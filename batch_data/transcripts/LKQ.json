[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Joe Boutros, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin. Joseph P. Boutross: Thanks, Devin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we released our first quarter 2014 financial results. In the room with me today are Rob Wagman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Quinn, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Rob and John have some prepared remarks, and then we will open the call up for questions. In addition to the telephone access for today's call, we are providing an audiocast via the LKQ website. A replay of the audiocast and conference call will be available shortly after the conclusion of the call. Before we begin with our discussion, I would like to remind everyone that the statements made in this call that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are not currently known to us. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which it was made, except as required by law. Also note that guidance for 2014 is based on current conditions, including acquisitions completed through March 31, 2014, and excludes the impact of restructuring and acquisition-related expenses; gains or losses related to acquisitions or divestitures, including changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; loss on debt extinguishment; and capital spending related to future business acquisitions. Please refer to our Form 10-K and other subsequent documents filed with the SEC and the press release we issued this morning for more information on potential risks. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the next few days. And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Wagman. Robert L. Wagman: Thank you, Joe. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today. In Q1, revenue reached a new quarterly high of $1.63 billion, an increase of 35.9% as compared to Q1 2013. Net income for the first quarter of 2014 was $104.7 million, an increase of 23.7% as compared to $84.6 million for the same period of 2013. Diluted earnings per share of $0.34 for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014, increased 21.4% from $0.28 for the first quarter of 2013. Please note that adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2014 would have been $0.35 compared to $0.29 for the first quarter of 2013 after adjusting for a net loss resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, loss on debt extinguishment and the change in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 10.3% for the quarter. I am particularly pleased with our North American organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.4% despite the extreme weather we faced throughout January, a month when miles driven was down almost 5% in some of our key North American markets. Now more detail on our North American operations. During the first quarter, we purchased over 72,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is an 8% increase over Q1 2013. As we progress into Q2, the volumes and pricing at auctions remain steady despite the recent 2.2% spike in the Manheim Index we witnessed during Q1. With inventory already on hand and a continuation of our current run rate for acquiring cars, we should have sufficient inventory for our recycled parts operations. In our self-service retail businesses, during the first quarter, we acquired approximately 120,000 lower-cost self-service and crush-only cars as compared to over 128,000 in Q1 of 2013 or roughly a 7% decrease. The reason for the decrease was that price and demand for vehicles in certain markets exceeded our acceptable cost given the prices of scrap and other metals. And now we'll comment about APU. In early April, CCC released their annual 2013 APU number, and we ended the year at 37%. Briefly, I would like to put some context around this number. The 37% reported by CCC measures APU as a percentage of parts dollars and not unit volume trends. Unit volume trends are important metric for our industry. With the aging carpark, measuring APU as a percentage of parts dollars does not tell the whole story about what is actually occurring in the marketplace. Why? Simply put, the higher the OE cost, the larger share of parts volume the OEs will appear to capture. To get a more accurate representation of the penetration of APU, we obtained data from CCC on a per-unit basis. From 2009 to 2013, the number of parts being replaced on a per-estimate basis has increased from 7.8 to 8.6. This trend bodes well for the replacement parts industry. Of that increase in replaced parts, CCC data shows that approximately 75% of the time, alternative parts are being written, as opposed to just 25% for OEM. As a result, on a per-unit basis, the alternative parts industry is continuing to take market share from the OEs. Because of the aging carpark, however, the increase in the per-unit share of APU is offset by the lower prices paid for parts that get installed on older vehicles. With the SAAR rate improving, we believe that the carpark will inevitably become younger, and assuming we maintain the higher per unit share of APU, we expect the percentage of parts dollars to begin to increase as well as we begin to sell more expensive, newer model year products. And lastly, in our North American operations, I wanted to update everyone on a recent initiative that could bode well for our aftermarket parts opportunity with State Farm. In close conjunction with the rollout of PartsTrader, State Farm has announced that it has authorized the use of aftermarket certified chrome front and rear bumpers. While these are still early days, we are encouraged by the fact that State Farm is looking at the aftermarket parts industry once again. As of now, they have not given any indication of a broader program. However, we obviously view this as a positive move after nearly 15 years on the sideline. Looking at these particular part types, year-over-year sales of aftermarket chrome bumpers were up 30% in January, 29% in February and 33% in March. While some of this increase may be weather-related, we believe that some of the increase is related to State Farm's new policy regarding aftermarket certified chrome bumpers. We continue to have open dialogue with State Farm, and we hope that they will continue to expand their use of our aftermarket product offerings. Now turning to our European operations. We continue to be extremely pleased with the performance of Euro Car Parts and its ability to increase market share. In Q1, ECP achieved organic revenue growth of 25.3%. For branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 18.4% during the first quarter. Also during the quarter, ECP opened 11 of the 20 new branches we have scheduled for 2014. I continue to be impressed with the quality and depth of ECP's management team and their ability to execute our strategic plan in the U.K. market. Now an update on ECP's collision program. During the quarter, we again witnessed strong double-digit year-over-year growth of approximately 60% with our collision parts sales at ECP. I am also pleased with the growth in our collision parts offerings in the first quarter, which today stands at 20,000 SKUs, which represents an increase of 8.5% year-over-year. In addition, during the first quarter, ECP added an additional 2 insurers into their pilot program, bringing our total carrier relationship to 15. Also during the quarter, ECP signed an agreement with a self-insured rental car company to supply collision parts to the shops that they subcontract with for the repair to their fleet. And now moving on to acquisitions and development initiatives. On January 3, 2014, the company completed its acquisition of Keystone Automotive Operations, Inc. Please note that we have broken out the segment separately in our financials as Keystone Specialty. As previously announced, Keystone Specialty is a leading distributor and marketer of specialty equipment and accessories in North America. Keystone continues to deliver on many of our operational expectations, and I am pleased with the initial synergies we are seeing with our warehouse and administrative integration, product cross-selling initiatives, logistics and our shared cultural focus on growth. We have integrated a total of 11 Keystone cross-stock facilities into our existing wholesale operations since we closed the deal in January. In Q1, I had the opportunity to visit one of the Keystone's nationally recognized vendor shows, and I saw firsthand the potential for cross-selling our existing SKUs, such as paint, reman engines and muscle car parts, to Keystone's customer base. And I expect this favorable trend to continue in the future quarters. In addition to the Keystone Specialty acquisition, during the first quarter of 2014, LKQ made 4 additional acquisitions, including a supplier cores and new products for the automotive aftermarket with locations in 9 states; a business in South Carolina with 1 wholesale salvage yard and 1 self-service retail operation; a paint distributor in the United Kingdom; and a paint distributor in Canada. And now a quick update on ACM Parts, our Australian joint venture with the largest insurer in the market, Suncorp Insurance. In late March, ACM acquired Frank's Auto Parts, a salvage yard operator with 2 yards servicing the New Wales (sic) [New South Wales] market. Upon closing, the JV immediately began dismantling some of SunCorp's total loss vehicles at both locations. Clearly, this acquisition springboards our recycling efforts in Australia and provides a talented management team that will enhance our efforts in developing our build-to-suit footprint in the market. Also at ACM, on April 11, NSF International announced that they are expanding their automotive parts certification expertise to Australia. NSF has developed new protocols for aftermarket automotive parts that specifically address the Australian market. This announcement further validates our belief that, on a global basis, insurance carriers, consumers and collision repair shops benefit from a competitive marketplace with a high-quality option for collision repair parts that are affordable and that come with a limited lifetime guarantee. And lastly for our continental European operations at Sator. On April 15, 2014, we announced the signing of letters of intent to acquire 5 Netherlands companies, all of which are customers of and currently serve as distributors for Sator. Our preliminary estimate of the aggregate annual revenue of these 5 companies, after netting out existing sales among the companies and Sator, is approximately $180 million. These transactions are subject to, among other conditions, negotiation by the parties of definitive agreements and authorization under the Dutch merger control procedure. We are currently targeting the completion of the transactions in the second or third quarter of 2014. At this time, I'd like to ask John Quinn to provide some more detail on the financial results of the quarter. John S. Quinn: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As Rob noted in our press release tables, we've broken out Keystone automotive operations as a segment for reporting purposes, which we are calling Specialty. While we believe the business has many of the characteristics of our existing North American business, including sharing customers, facilities and economic characteristics, for the time being, we're calling it a separate segment as we believe there is interest in the standalone Specialty results. So for now, we have 3 reportable segments : North America, Europe and Specialty. And I'd also point out that in Q1 2014, we saw LKQ reach a number of significant milestones. It was our first quarter with revenue reaching an annualized run rate over $6 billion, with our Q1 revenue annualizing at a hair over $6.5 billion. It's the first time we exceeded $200 million in EBITDA in a quarter and the first quarter where we exceeded $100 million of net income. Giving you the specifics on the quarter and beginning with revenue. Our Q1 2014 revenue of $1,626,000,000 was an increase of $430 million as compared to Q1 last year or an increase of 36%. For Q1, our total organic revenue growth was 6%, and we delivered an additional 29% from acquisitions, with foreign exchange adding a further 1 point. Rob mentioned that the Q1 2014 organic growth for parts and services was 10.3%. And within that, we saw our North American operations grow organically 6.4% while the European segment grew 25.3%. We completed 5 acquisitions in Q1 2014, with Specialty being the largest. Our Q1 2014 acquisitions contributed $197 million in revenue in Q1 2014, of which Keystone Specialty accounted for $177 million. The total revenue acquired in Q1 on an annual basis was $790 million. Total change to other revenue, which is where we record scrap commodity sales, was negative 10%. This was mainly due to negative organic growth of 19%, offset by 9% acquisition-related growth. We saw decreases in our self-service car volumes and in aluminum furnace and precious metal businesses. The average price we received for scrap steel was approximately 7% lower year-over-year at $224 per tonne [ph] this year versus $242 per tonne [ph] in Q1 2013. Other revenue was 9.6% of total revenue as compared to 14.5% for the same period last year and has continued the trend of becoming a lower percentage of and, therefore, less significant to our total revenue. In Q1 2014, revenue for our self-serve business was $105 million or 6.4% of LKQ's total revenue. Approximately 33% of this was parts sales included in North American parts and services revenue, and 6.7% -- excuse me, 67% was scrap and core sales included in other revenue. A year ago, in Q1 2013, our self-serve business was 9.5% of our total revenue, and that percentage has been falling each of the last 5 quarters as we've grown our aftermarket business. Our reported gross margin for Q1 2014 was $652 million or 40.1% of revenue, a decline of approximately 190 basis points from a gross margin percentage of 42% in Q1 2013. The primary reason for this decrease was a 230-basis-point decline attributable to acquisitions completed after March 31, 2013, including 110 basis points related to the Specialty acquisition, 70 basis points from the European Sator acquisition and the remainder due to other acquisitions, including the U.K. paint transaction. The decline due to Specialty of 110 basis points is in line with the guidance we provided last quarter. Excluding these items, we saw an improvement of about 70 basis points in the North American margins, of which a portion resulted from the mix with the reduction of lower-margin other revenue that I mentioned earlier. Other immaterial factors reduced gross margin by about 30 basis points relative to the prior year. Now moving to operating expenses. Some of the comparisons are being affected by our Specialty and Sator acquisitions, which both operate 3-step models. In this model, gross margins tend to be lower than the 2-step approach, but they will incur relatively lower facility distribution and SG&A costs. While Sator will anniversary in Q2, Specialty will affect the comparisons for the remainder of the year. Facility and warehouse costs were 7.8% of revenue in Q1 2014, a 60-basis-point improvement over 8.4% in Q1 last year. This improvement is primarily due to Specialty, which tends to lower -- run lower facility costs than the rest of our operations. Distributions costs for the -- were 8.4% this quarter, down from 8.7% in the same quarter last year. And we attribute most of this improvement to Sator, which has lower distribution cost. Selling and G&A expenses decreased from 11.5% of revenue in Q1 last year to 11.4% in Q1 this year. This improvement is primarily related to Sator and Specialty, which would have driven this number 40 basis points lower but was offset by higher costs in the U.K. as we incurred higher personnel and advertising costs, most of which I would characterize as being build-out ahead of the branch expansion that Rob mentioned. The combination of warehouse, facility, distribution and SG&A costs was 27.6% of revenue in Q1 2014 as compared to 28.5% in Q1 2013. I've explained that most of this improvement is due to the acquisitions we've completed, but it's worth noting that the drop in other revenue is probably masking leverage that we're achieving in the base business. It's hard to accurately quantify the exact impact, but as I've pointed out in the past, other revenue tends to incur very little incremental cost in these line items. So there's likely a 10- to 30-basis-point improvement in leverage being masked by lower scrap and core revenue. During Q1 2014, we recorded $3.3 million of restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, up from $1.5 million in Q1 last year. The 2014 costs primarily related to Specialty. Depreciation and amortization was 1.6% of revenue during Q1 this year as compared to 1.5% of revenue in Q1 2013. We saw a modest reduction in depreciation as a percent of revenue of 10 basis points as we levered the assets over a larger revenue base. But that improvement was more than offset by higher amortization related to intangibles from the Sator and Specialty acquisitions. Other expenses net increased to $15.1 million in the 3 months ended March 31, 2014, compared to $9.8 million for the same period last year, an increase of $5.3 million. Interest expense was $7.5 million higher, of which $6 million was due to higher debt levels and $1.5 million from the higher interest rates, primarily on our senior notes. During the quarter, we incurred $300,000 of expenses related to debt extinguishment costs. Adjustments to consider -- contingent consideration were an income of $1.2 million in Q1 this year as compared to an expense of $800,000 last year in the same period. Our effective borrowing rate for the quarter was 3.6%, and our effective tax rate for the quarter was 34% compared to 35.8% in Q1 last year. Taxes came in a little bit better than what we had expected at the time of our last call, as the effective rate in Specialty was slightly lower than we anticipated. On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share was $0.34 in Q1 2014 compared to $0.28 in Q1 2013, an improvement of 21%. Adjusting for the combination of acquisition-related expenses, contingent purchase price adjustments and the loss on debt extinguishment, EPS would have been about $0.01 higher both this year and last. So on an adjusted basis, Q1 2014 would have been $0.35 as compared to $0.29 last year. Switching to our year-to-date cash flow. Net cash provided by operation activities totaled $97 million during the 3 months of 2014 compared to $106 million in 2013. Net income and depreciation were favorable to cash flow by $20 million and $9 million, respectively. But these were offset by a change in the use of cash of $29 million related to inventories. In Q1 2013, we entered the quarter with the inventories at fairly high levels, so Q1 last year saw a benefit to cash flow. In 2014, we increased inventories in Europe in anticipation of the branch expansion and at Specialty ahead of the busy summer season, resulting in inventories being a use of cash this year. Capital spending was $34 million in Q1 2014, and we have spent $487 million in cash on acquisitions, the largest being Specialty, which accounted for $427 million of the total. During Q1, we refinanced our credit facility, increasing the total size of the facility to $2.3 billion and extending the maturity until May 2019. We made a number of amendments to the covenants to provide us with additional operational flexibility. We were also fortunate to be able to amend our pricing grid and reduce our borrowing cost on the facility between 25 and 50 basis points, depending upon our leverage. I would like to acknowledge and thank our banking partners for the support they demonstrate to LKQ, as evidenced by these changes. We ended Q1 2014 with $1.7 billion of debt, and cash and cash equivalents were $113 million. Availability under our credit facility was approximately $1.2 billion. And with the cash, total liquidity was about $1.4 billion. So we have capacity to pursue additional acquisitions as suitable opportunities arise. Now turning to guidance. We've left our guidance unchanged from February. Our guidance for 2014 for organic parts -- excuse me, organic revenue growth for parts and services is 8% to 10%. Our net income and earnings per share guidance ranges are $400 million to $430 million and $1.30 to $1.40, respectively. And our guidance for capital expenditures, $110 million to $140 million, and cash from operations of approximately $375 million. I'd like to highlight a few of the changes we've seen in the business since February and give you some indication why we decided to leave the guidance unchanged even after a fairly strong Q1. In January, we saw very light sales volume. As weather was so severe, many of our operations closed. And we were concerned that if people were not driving, the accidents may simply have never occurred. In February and March, we did see that volume pick up. Although there are no formal sources, our informal channel checks suggest that the shops have a reasonable backlog for Q2. In contrast, we saw a mild winter in Europe, and that business was a little softer than we had expected throughout the quarter. The organic growth of 10.3% we reported for Q1 parts and services was ahead of our full year guidance, but we still believe that our growth will abate in the back half of the year as we start reporting Sator and the U.K. paint businesses in that number. As I discussed a moment ago, we've seen a drop in scrap steel prices. And Rob mentioned we scaled back the car buying in the self-serve line of business because the cost of the cars in this line of business wasn't falling as fast as necessary to reflect the lower scrap prices. The impacts of this showed up in other revenue, which is primarily scrap and cores from the hulks. This lower volume and the continued stubborn lower prices on scrap steel were not contemplated in our earlier guidance. We certainly didn't expect a negative 19% organic growth in other revenue, and it turned out to be a headwind for us in Q1. We haven't seen any material improvement in that outlook in April. The Manheim Index, which we expected to start falling, has actually been increasing in the last 3 months and is higher now than in March 2011. So we've not seen any meaningful relief on car buying costs in either the self-serve or the recycling lines of business. Against the negatives of scrap prices and car cost, we do have a number of positives. We reported only a de minimis impact from our Australian joint venture. While things are progressing there, the losses we anticipated for 2014 may not be as much as the $0.02 we earlier thought likely. The refinancing of the credit facility will save us a minimum of 25 basis points on borrowings over what we would have otherwise paid. And as we worked through the Specialty acquisition impacts, the tax rates came in favorable to what we expected on the last call. We believe these will add a couple of pennies to what we expected in February. Offsetting these are the scrap and car pressures that I mentioned. Aside from those items, we do keep an eye on foreign exchange, particularly as Europe continues to grow, and on the ongoing scrap volatility and weather in the balance of the year. In terms of providing some high-level characterization on the quarter's results, I would say, overall, we believe we saw a strong performance in the North American collision business, buoyed by a protracted winter and an in-line performance at Specialty. This performance was partially offset by a soft commodity market, ongoing high used car prices and a mild winter in Europe, which dampened sales in some key product lines. Weather and commodity prices will fluctuate over time, but the key message from our perspective is that the underlying business is progressing very much according to our plans. With that, I'll turn the call back to Rob. Robert L. Wagman: Thanks, John. To summarize, we are quite pleased with our first quarter 2014 results and proud of how our team of over 26,000 employees performed in the midst of some unusual weather-related operating challenges during the quarter in both North America and Europe and nonoperational headlines that could have impacted our morale, performance and long-term strategy. But collectively, we never took our eye off the ball and got it done. And with that, Devin, we'd like to open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : I wanted to talk a little bit -- congratulations on the opportunity to start working with State Farm a little bit. I know you work with them on some of the mechanical and recycle-type aftermarket things but not so much, obviously, on the collision. And I know that this is a small data point and we shouldn't get overly excited about it. But I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how those discussions went to start doing these chrome bumpers, when they might have started or whether they just one day kind of picked up the phone and said, \"We're going to start doing it,\" or whether you guys were involved in that in terms of trying to think about what the pipeline might be for future products. Robert L. Wagman: We were not involved in that decision, Nate. Of course, we regularly pitch our products and services to State Farm. They came this -- upon this on themselves, and they did it in conjunction with the rollout of PartsTrader. And as PartsTrader has gone across the country, obviously, we've seen more and more sales. Our reps that are on PartsTrader reviewing those estimates know about those 2 part types and are pushing them hard. So while we can't comment -- I don't know for sure how much of that percentage increase was related to State Farm because not all times that we know there's a repair or tell us who they're repairing a car for. But clearly, the 29% and 33% increases, some of that was related to State Farm's new policy. With an 18%-plus market share, they're a mover, obviously. So we're monitoring this, and we still, as I said in my prepared remarks, in constant communication with State Farm. And hopefully, they continue to expand the product offerings. Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay, great. That's optimistic. And then second, congratulations also on getting a couple of more insurance companies into the ECP pilot programs. It kind of sounds like even though -- while some of those insurance companies are kind of still tiptoeing around, being really aggressive with those programs, given your increase in overall revenue, they're clearly starting to use those. Is there any take in terms of whether or not they have to officially sign on for those programs to still take hold or whether you really expect gradually they'll take hold even if they don't fully move past the pilot program? Robert L. Wagman: Yes. I would expect that they'll continue to move, Nate. The fact that they haven't signed anything, I wouldn't read anything into that. We certainly haven't. The fact that of the 15 that are in pilots, plus the rental car company we announced today as well, none of them have stopped writing it, so they continue to write it. And I think some of them are averse to actually signing a contract. But we do have 2 under contract, and the rental car company is under a contract as well. But I suspect it will continue to move along as we continue to grow our product offering. Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay, great. And then just 2 housekeeping things, John, if I could. One, what tax rate should we be thinking about going forward now with some of these adjustments? John S. Quinn: Yes, I think we had a 34% rate in Q1. Absent some discrete items, I would say probably in that range, 34%, maybe 34.5% for the rest of the year. Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay, great. And then also, too, you talked about maybe some lower organic total growth expectations towards the end of the year as Sator gets in there or maybe the U.K. paint business. Could you just give us maybe a rough estimate of what the organic growth of those individual businesses are as we think about the overall mix? John S. Quinn: Yes. And we're thinking it's probably going to be sort of more North American mid single digits on those 2 components. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : A lot on the call here. I'm going to have to reread the transcript. But did want to ask about your pending acquisitions in The Netherlands. It would seem to be a very big positive if you're able to close those deals. I'm curious how other jobbers in that market have reacted to the announcement, and I'll start with that. Robert L. Wagman: Sure, Craig. The -- we have a tie-in with every one of our customers over there with our computer system. We've been in contact with every one of those other jobbers. Some of them have offered to sell us their business. These 5 acquisitions give us 52 facilities. We think the right number is circa 75. So we're going fill in the balance either through acquisition or greenfield. So we've gotten some inquiries about selling the businesses, but we haven't had one defection as of yet. Some of that certainly is at risk. They could probably find somebody else, but the tie-in with the computer system, they use our operating system, actually, to order a lot of parts and to actually manage their business. So it's going to be pretty difficult for them to get away from us, and as of now, we've had no defections whatsoever. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And to follow up, you mentioned the operating system. It's my understanding that Sator has an order platform, if you will, that is widely used. Could you explain what that is and whether it's something that could scale more broadly beyond that particular geography? Robert L. Wagman: Yes, absolutely. Basically, what we have -- the system that the jobbers use actually ties right into our system live. It's called My Grossier [ph], my best attempt at Dutch, where basically, we -- they can see our inventory. We can see what they're doing as well in terms of ordering, so it's pretty intricate. We have looked at that as an ECP potential model to move to other parts of Europe. But at this point, we're still, obviously, just looking at that. And then now with the acquisitions now going into a 2-step model, we'll have to relook at that as well. But it is an interesting system where we get really full visibility of what our customers are doing. John S. Quinn: Yes, and it actually goes down to the garage level. So the garage uses our software. They use that to look up inventory, not only at our customers but they can actually see right through to our inventory. And then they can order those parts. So they order -- the garages are ordering from our customers using our software, and they're sort of an intermediary in there. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : If you look at ECP in the U.K., is there a different operating platform that you don't control that is used? John S. Quinn: Yes. The garages use typically their own software for the garage management system, if you will. Robert L. Wagman: We don't have the access to -- we don't have the ability to see what they're doing, though we do in Holland. So it's very intriguing, and we're looking at ways to replicate that in the U.K. at some point. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And then one more on that deal. What does the rest of Europe look like from a 2-step or 3-step model perspective? Robert L. Wagman: Pretty much every country has some level of 2-step and 3-step, but the vast majority of Western Europe is predominantly going to be 2-step. There are some 3-steppers still out there, but the bigger companies are going to be 2-step. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And then, John, one housekeeping question. On the 4 deals, the incremental deals that were announced in the transcript, what was the trailing annual revenue? And can you give that to us by geography, if possible, North America versus Europe? John S. Quinn: The total annualized revenue is $790 million, and pretty much all of it's in North America. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : That includes Keystone? John S. Quinn: Yes. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Do you know what it is x Keystone? John S. Quinn: Keystone was around $700 million, so it was about $90 million of other deals. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel. James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Obviously, everyone's going to have their State Farm questions, and we certainly do as well. But I wanted to focus, if I could, on just making sure I understood what you said on gross margin. Your core, if I understood it, North American gross margin was up 70 basis points year-on-year. Is that correct? And sort of can you get to a little bit of what's driving that, whether it's sort of the flow-through of deals as they leverage or something going on with the sweet spot of kind of the SAAR roll-off? John S. Quinn: We just -- we saw a little bit better margins in the businesses here. I did mention that other revenue was down. Some of that was the aluminum furnaces and precious metals businesses being down. Those tend to be relatively lower-margin businesses. So as that other revenue came down, it was probably a slight benefit to the margins, which is why we said don't count all of that 70 basis points. It's just sort of the math on product mix. We did see a little bit improvement in the margin in the late model [ph] of the salvage business and a little bit improvement on the aftermarket parts costs. It was pretty widespread, frankly, other than we did get those benefits just from having lower other revenue, which probably hurt us on the operating leverage on the facility and warehouse and other below-the-line costs. James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : And can you remind me -- last quarter, I think it was positive year-over-year as well but maybe a lower on rate-of-change basis. So we're seeing acceleration in the improvement, in other words? John S. Quinn: I think if you strip out the other revenue, it's probably fairly consistent, right? I haven't got my notes in front of me, but I think you're right. I think we've said around 50 bps is our number currently. James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then if you guys could just help us understand. I think you've said in the past sort of ballpark assumption is 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin kind of expansion on an annual basis, I mean, inclusive of the M&A, which obviously is a little dilutive at the outset. As some of the M&A flows through here from Sator and Keystone, sounds like it may even be ahead of schedule to some degree in terms of the integration strategy. Is that sort of range changing? Or should we expect something more in the higher end of that range as a result? John S. Quinn: I've always said this thing's going to be lumpy. And you've got to kind of adjust for the fact that you look like you're getting operating leverage when scrap costs are going up and it looks like you're losing it when they're going down. But I don't think we've changed our view with respect to that in terms of it's our belief that we can grow the business organically the way we do and then supplement that with some acquisitions. We ought to be able to see leverage coming through like we did this quarter in depreciation. And as I said, if you adjust for the other revenue, you do see that leverage in the North American operations, and we did see a little bit in the gross margin. But I don't know that's so much operating leverage as just cost structure in terms of price range for the cars. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Lawrence with Stephens. John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Rob, would you talk a little bit about -- you mentioned Keystone a little bit, some of the end markets, what you're seeing as far as the muscle cars, et cetera. Talk a little bit -- take one more step on those end markets. And maybe what are you seeing today in the activities surrounding sort of integration that you have left to do in '14 for that business? Robert L. Wagman: Sure. John, the integration has actually gone much quicker than we expected. As we mentioned -- as I mentioned, we closed 11 cross-stocks. We also moved about 14 locations into existing locations. To give you a quick example, Keystone was delivering into the Dallas market from Kansas City, and they were driving through Oklahoma City. And they would drive to Dallas, drop off all the parts, and then trucks would then leave Dallas to go service the Oklahoma City. That shuttle truck is now stopping in Oklahoma City, dropping off the products for Oklahoma City and local LKQ/Keystone drivers delivering those products. So we're seeing a tremendous amount of freight going from Dallas all the way back to Oklahoma City, where that truck is already going by. So that's some of the found synergies that we really didn't anticipate, quite frankly, is 14 of those locations. We're on plan for synergies on both the financial and the operational side. We -- as I mentioned on the last call, at some point, we want to bring some products to Europe to try and test this. We've actually -- I actually personally met with the CEO of our Keystone operation, with one vendor in Chicago, and we're going to launch, hopefully, something in late Q2 to start bringing some products into Europe as a trial. Meeting the vendors, we're seeing some cross-selling opportunities, as we discussed. One of the things that we found was, in the RV side of the business, there's a lot of these dealerships have paint and repair businesses, and we're already starting to market our paint products into those RV businesses. The LKQ reps already have access to the Keystone inventory, so they can now sell that product. It just started about a week ago, so it's really too early to say what the impact of that's going to be. And then, of course, Keystone has access to the muscle car products, our cooling products and as well as our reman engines, so that is now starting to cross-sell. So we're pretty bullish on, hopefully, what the cross-selling opportunities are. And most importantly to me, the cultures are in lock step. They're a growth-oriented company. We are too. And we're very pleased with that acquisition. And just finally, one last thing on Keystone. We approved a new distribution center in Texas. That's a big market for the Keystone. As I said, we're servicing Kansas City now, and we're going to have our own distribution center there. So really excited about what we got going in the works there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : First question is on the inventory at the salvage auctions. Are you seeing pretty good inventory supply there? And I mean, do you think that, over the next quarter or 2, that higher kind of supply -- in fact, you are seeing that, could offset higher Manheim prices and maybe be a benefit in pricing? Robert L. Wagman: Yes. We track weekly, John, the number of vehicles at the auctions. And we've only seen a modest spike so far. So I assume the Coparts and the ADESAs and the insurance auto auctions are sitting on a backlog because we haven't seen it hit the auctions yet. And it generally does take 2 months before it gets through the systems. But we certainly expect that if that volume increases as much as the number of total losses that likely took place in Q1, we do expect it to have a positive impact on Manheim, thereby lowering, hopefully, our cost. But haven't seen that yet. Our auction costs actually were, year-over-year, just down slightly. But I would also mention that scrap is down, so that could be just a scrap relation. But we do expect Manheim to eventually start to lighten up a little bit here, hopefully soon. John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then there's been more talk about multi-bidding platform in terms of the salvage auction industry and in the whole car auction industry. What are your guys thoughts on that? I mean, do you think that, that would have any impact on potential pricing competition and so forth? Robert L. Wagman: Well, the Internet bidding has been around really -- [indiscernible] Copart's initial, I think, came out in '04, if I'm not mistaken, maybe even earlier than that. So it's been around for quite a bit of time. So those multi-bid functions have been there for quite a while. We've been dealing with them. So I don't see any additional impact because they've been open for quite a few years. So really not expecting to see anything there negative. John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, great. And last question, John. I think last quarter you guys had mentioned that you expect kind of EPS to ramp sequentially throughout the year. First quarter was probably a little bit better than expected. I mean, is it still reasonable to think that we'll see some kind of ramp-up? Or is the normal seasonality something we should think about? John S. Quinn: I think the things that are sort of different is Keystone Automotive is -- their strongest quarter, we believe, is going to be Q2. What we did see is the European businesses, and it's our understanding that Keystone also are pretty light in Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : Just talk a little bit more about State Farm so I get my understanding here correctly. Are you the only entity that has been approved to sell these aftermarket bumpers? Robert L. Wagman: No. They authorized the use of certified aftermarket chrome front and rear bumpers, and anyone who carries a certified bumper has the ability to sell that product. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. So -- and is this really the first time in a long time that State Farm has -- is starting to use, what would they be called, collision repair parts? Robert L. Wagman: On the collision part, yes. They have written radius condensers, but that's considered mechanical. This was really the first collision part they've entered the marketplace with. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : So do you think it's to be expected that they'll come out with some more going forward, then? Robert L. Wagman: We're certainly hoping, but nothing more than that at this point, unfortunately. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets. Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : As you look at the end of the first quarter, coming into the second quarter, do you have a feeling for sort of what the collision channel backlog looks like? I mean, there are certainly increased crash rates, but there are some issues, maybe some of those repairs weren't made, given supply disruption. And as we look at Q2, do you have a feeling maybe year-over-year how we entered the quarter with sort of channel demand? Robert L. Wagman: Honestly, Bret, just anecdotally, we hear -- because a lot of the cars were drivable, so you might drive by a shop and not see many cars there. But just because the car is drivable, it is scheduled to come in. I can say that we don't give, honestly, guidance for the quarter. But I will say that, for the first 3 weeks of April, it appears that the shops are working through some backlog. But it's really, really tough to say how much backlog is actually out there. Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. And then on Keystone Specialty, do you have a feeling, I guess -- I'm sure you have a feeling for what the inventory levels are on that? And then just given the fact that, that's closer to traditional auto parts, which, in many cases, has got better working capital leverage, is there the potential to generate cash as you could extend payables or leverage some of that inventory you're carrying at Keystone Specialty? John S. Quinn: Yes. I'll just give you some indication. The -- we acquired about $152 million through that deal. They were one of the causes of the increase in the inventory in the quarter. So quarter end, they were at about $166 million. The type of programs you're talking about, you're right, this has more potential for that sort of a financing structure. We don't have any plans in place at the moment, but given we're -- that refinancing of our credit facility, it can be more interesting, I suspect, in terms of it's really a leverage play. So I won't say never, but we don't have anything in the hopper at the moment. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Stember with Sidoti & Company. Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Could you remind us how big the chrome bumpers are within the portfolio of products that you guys have? Robert L. Wagman: Yes. It's -- obviously, they're just basically on pick-up trucks. So it's a pretty limited line, mainly Ford, Chevy and Dodge. But the 4 manufacturers don't carry much. But as you know, the F-150 is the #1-selling vehicle in the United States. So it's not a huge product line. It is pretty limited in that respect. Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. And to that point, just trying to figure out how much business you could potentially get out of this versus your competitors. Are these parts, do they have any extra certifications that possibly some of your competitors would not have? Robert L. Wagman: No. It's basically being done through -- NSF is the certifying body for most of those products. I think CAPA does a few, but it's mainly NSF. Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. And can you talk about CCC ONE platform? You didn't give an update on it. Is there anything new there? Robert L. Wagman: Still progressing. The growth sequentially was 23% in revenue. Again, that's off a small base, but the volume was up 30%. So still gaining traction. Roughly still around 4,000 shops in the program, Scott. Salvage, though, this is -- right now, we're just solely limited to aftermarket. Salvage is slated to roll out in late summer, and that seems to be on target. And CCC tells us they're averaging about 80 shops a month that are being enabled. So they're getting deeper and deeper into this thing. And actually, CCC is actually running some contests to get more shops involved. So they're stepping up on their side. I'm still really very excited about the product, mainly because it's -- the shop is doing most of the work. But the biggest ancillary benefit is that their returns have dropped dramatically as the shops do the -- keen to do a better job keying in the product than our reps were, what we were being told to key in. So very excited about the program, and hope it continues to grow. Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Great. And last question on the collision parts program in Europe. Particularly with many of the underwriters in the U.K. writing business in Europe as well, have you seen any initial traction there? Robert L. Wagman: We have not. This will be Phase 2 of that now with the locations that we acquired at Sator, the 5 locations. We'll now be able to go direct to those shops. So probably later this year, we'll start bringing our insurance team over there to start marketing to the insurance companies. And hopefully, later this year or early next year, we'll start our collision parts program there on the continent. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just a couple of follow-ups. The Keystone Specialty segment, what's the growth of that business right now? I know you didn't have it, obviously, in the books last year, but what's the year-on-year growth right now that you're seeing? Robert L. Wagman: It's growing -- in Q1, year-over-year -- and again, it's not -- we're not obviously reporting it as organic growth yet, but it was mid to high single digits. Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : And is that how we should be looking at that for 2014, you figure? Robert L. Wagman: No. We said it's going to grow more North America, but they had a really good Q1. So we think it's going to be somewhere between the 5% to 7%. Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then the April commentary, where you said that it appears that the shops are working through the backlogs, should I look at that statement and the implication being that April was better than March or better than March and February overall? Robert L. Wagman: Well, April definitely slows down compared to March just because of the backlog from January to February. But we think we're going to track on plan for April. Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : And last question, and if you've already mentioned this and I missed it, I apologize. You have 156 ECP stores now, having opened 11 this past quarter. I think your goal originally was 165 by year end. And it would seem as though you're ahead of that pace. Are you still looking at 165? Or how should we look at the store count by year end? Robert L. Wagman: Yes, we're going to bring those 9 finish by -- hopefully, by the end of Q2, actually. A few of them may go into early Q3. And at that point, Sam, we'll reevaluate if we can do more. But we'll hit the 165 for no problem at all. Operator : Our final question is from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : I just wanted to follow up on a previous question. You don't see a lot of chrome bumpers on the roads anymore. Any idea -- if you look at the carpark is, I think, maybe 270 million vehicles, any idea how many have chrome bumpers? And maybe more importantly, what indication, if any, has State Farm given that they may expand this program to plastic bumpers, all types of bumpers and then, obviously, beyond that to other collision parts? Robert L. Wagman: No indication past the chrome bumpers, and I really don't know what the pick-up truck population in the U.S. is today. But it's certainly a lot smaller than the car population. But yes, you're just going to find these, Bill, to your point, basically just on pick-up trucks. That's all they'll be on. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And so far, they haven't given any indication that they may expand this to plastic bumpers or anything else? Robert L. Wagman: None whatsoever at this point. And with that, we'll be back in about 3 months to give you an update on our results for Q2. Thanks for joining the call, everybody. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the LKQ Corporation's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joe Boutross, Director, Investor Relations for LKQ Corporation. Thank you. Mr. Boutross, you may begin. Joseph P. Boutross: Thanks, Devin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we released our second quarter 2014 financial results. In the room with me today are Rob Wagman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Quinn, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Rob and John have some prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call for questions. In addition to the telephone access for today's call, we are providing an audiocast via the LKQ website. A replay of the audiocast and conference call will be available shortly after the conclusion of the call. Before we begin with our discussion, I would like to remind everyone that the statements made in this call that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are currently unknown to us. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which it was made, except as required by law. Please refer to our Form 10-K and other subsequent documents filed with the SEC and the press release we issued this morning, for more information on potential risks. Also note that guidance for 2014 is based on current conditions, including acquisitions completed through July 31, 2014, and excludes any impact of restructuring and acquisition-related expenses; gains or losses related to acquisitions or divestitures, including changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; loss on debt extinguishment; and capital spending related to future business acquisitions. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the next few days. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Wagman. Robert L. Wagman: Thank you, Joe. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today. In Q2, revenue reached a new quarterly high of $1.71 billion, an increase of 36.5% as compared to Q2 2013. Net income for the second quarter of 2014 was $104.9 million, an increase of 38.5% as compared to $75.7 million for the same period of 2013. Diluted earnings per share of $0.34 for the second quarter ended June 30, 2014, increased 36% from $0.25 for the second quarter of 2013. Please note that adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter 2014 would have been $0.35 compared to $0.26 for the second quarter of 2013 after adjusting for any net losses resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, losses of debt extinguishment and the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. During the quarter, we achieved organic revenue growth and acquisition revenue growth for parts and services of 8.1% and 31%, respectively. I am particularly pleased with this performance, given we were able to translate this revenue growth into an improved bottom line, with a 39% increase in net income and a 36% increase in diluted EPS, despite the tough year-over-year comparatives. Now more detail on our North American operations. During the second quarter, we purchased over 71,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is a 2.4% decrease from Q2 2013. While our purchases were slightly down year-over-year in Q2, the backlog from a strong Q1 purchasing environment left us with solid inventory levels of product to continue the growth of our recycled parts operations in Q2 and now into Q3. In our self-service retail businesses, during the second quarter, we acquired approximately 143,000 lower-cost, self-service and crush-only cars as compared to over 135,000 in Q2 of 2013 or roughly a 6% increase. Lastly, in our North American operations, I want to update everyone on State Farm and their previously announced use of aftermarket certified chrome front and rear bumpers. During the quarter, sales of this particular part type were up 22% year-over-year, which we believe is partially attributable to State Farm. At this point, we are not aware of State Farm considering a broader use of our aftermarket offerings, but we do remain encouraged, given that we estimate they are witnessing savings of approximately 20% on this part type alone. Clearly, a broader program which includes aftermarket other sheet metal and body panels, offers State Farm and its policyholders tremendous economic benefits. Now turning to our European operations. We continue to be extremely pleased with the performance of Euro Car Parts and its ability to increase market share. In Q2, ECP achieved organic revenue growth of 22.3%. For branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 14.4% during the quarter. This performance was particularly impressive given that ECP had 1 less selling day year-over-year. Also during the quarter, ECP opened 9 branches, bringing our total to 20 for the year, the number we initially scheduled for 2014. Given the recent disruption with one of our main competitors in the U.K. market, we are currently assessing whether or not we will accelerate the opening of additional branches this year. And now an update on ECP's collision program. During the quarter, we continued to win strong double-digit year-over-year growth of over 33% with our collision parts sales at ECP despite the headwind of an extremely mild winter in the U.K. and, again, 1 less selling day. In addition, during the second quarter, ECP added 2 additional insurers into ECP's pilot program, bringing our total carrier relationship to 17. These 2 new carriers each signed agreements identifying ECP as the first distributor of choice for non-OE collision parts with their respective body shop networks. I am quite pleased with the carrier penetration we have achieved since we launched ECP's collision program and pleased to note that these 17 carriers represent well over 80% of the auto insurance market in the U.K. And lastly, on Europe, on May 30, 2014, the company completed its acquisition of 5 Netherlands parts distributors, all of which were customers of Sator. Combined, these distributors added 52 branches to Sator's Netherlands network. Strategically, this deal accelerates our efforts in converting Sator's distribution network from a 3-step to a 2-step model, strengthens our growth and prospects and margin profile and positions the business well for eventual entry into the alternative collision parts market in the Benelux. Although it is still early, these 5 acquisitions are meeting our expectations. Now to our Specialty segment. Keystone Specialty continues to outperform many of our operational and financial expectations. John will cover the financial performance for our Specialty segment, but operationally, I'd like to give you a brief update on Keystone. Just finalizing the acquisition in January, Keystone has closed 12 cross dock facilities and added an additional 36 drop points into existing wholesale operations. This cross dock initiative has reduced our driving distances and improved our customer experiences, while allowing us to reinvest resources toward adding more frequent deliveries and building the delivery network capable of handling more revenue growth going forward. Furthermore, we are well on our way to launching our new distribution center in Texas, which will be operational later this year and provide additional access to a substantial truck and off-road market. In addition, Keystone continues to make great progress identifying cross-selling opportunities for our existing products. Keystone, through recent systems and sales exploration efforts, now offers over 1,000 collision SKUs, an ATK remanufactured engine line and over 20,000 SKUs from our Goodmark aftermarket muscle car and classic lines to their Specialty customers. Lastly on Keystone, in July, all HR functions have been fully integrated into LKQ processes, and efforts in other administrative areas are on target. Moving on to acquisitions and development initiatives. In addition to the acquisition of the 5 Netherlands parts distributors, during the second quarter of 2014, LKQ made 6 additional acquisitions, all of them in North America, including a paint distributor in Texas; a self-serve yard in Georgia; a paint distributor with 6 locations in Ontario; a paint distributor in New York; an aftermarket collision parts distributor with locations in Florida and Georgia; and finally, a tire recycler in Ohio. As we enter the back half of the year, we continue to witness a steady flow of M&A opportunities in the geographies and segments in which we operate. Given the strength of our balance sheet and operational capabilities, I believe we are well positioned to execute on more strategic acquisitions. At this time, I'd like to ask John Quinn to provide some more detail on the financial results of the quarter. John S. Quinn: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Rob mentioned that the top line revenue of $1.7 billion for the quarter was an increase of $457 million or 37% over the $1.25 billion we achieved in Q2 2013. This is the second consecutive quarter LKQ is annualizing revenue in excess of $6.5 billion, with quarterly EBITDA over $200 million and net income over $100 million. So overall, pretty solid back-to-back quarters. The revenue growth breaks down as follows : For Q2, our total organic revenue growth was 6.6%, and we delivered additional growth of 28.3% from acquisitions, with foreign exchange adding a further 1.7%. Organic growth for parts and services was 8.1%. Within that, we saw our North American operations grow organically 5.3%, while the European segment grew 15.6%. We were facing a difficult comparison to Q2 2013 in the North American segment when we reported 7.3%. Although we believe the shops had good backlogs going into Q2 this year, they had a similar situation last year with the late winter in 2013. The European segment showed lower growth as we've included Sator for the first time. ECP continues to show strong organic growth of 22%, but Sator had an organic revenue decline of 6.9%. The Sator negative growth appears to be related to general market conditions, particularly for some of our private label product, which was exported, and the impact of acquisitions on the base business. With the acquisition of some of our major customers and converting the distribution to a 2-step model, we anticipated some loss of revenue in the base business. Meanwhile, as Rob mentioned, the sales of the garages by our newly acquired distributors are progressing well. Acquisitions completed in the last 12 months to June 30 contributed $354 million to Q2 2014 revenue on a reported basis, including $25 million from acquisitions completed in Q2 2014. The annualized revenue from acquisitions completed in Q2 2014 is approximately $220 million or roughly $55 million per quarter. I know we've got some questions about our Specialty segment, which is where we are reporting the revenue for Keystone Specialty, the company we acquired in January this year. For Q2 2014, our revenue for that segment was $218 million. While we didn't own Keystone last year, we estimated that their revenue was $196 million for Q2, so that business grew 11% year-over-year, hence, Rob's comments of our being pleased with its progress. Total change in other revenue, which is where we record our scrap commodity sales, was positive 7%. While acquisitions contributed 11% positive growth, that was offset by negative 4% growth from our existing business. We saw a decline in both pricing and volumes, with pricing being down on scrap steel about 5% and our volumes of aluminum and other precious metals lower year-over-year. The average price we received for scrap steel was $217 per ton this year versus $228 per ton in Q2 2013. Other revenue was 9.8% of total revenue compared to 12.6% in the same period last year, reflecting the declining relative importance of this revenue to our overall results. In Q2 2014, revenue from our self-service business was $109 million or 6.4% of LKQ's total revenue. Approximately 32% of this revenue is parts sales included in North American parts and services revenue and 68% scrap and core sales included in other revenue. A year ago, in Q2 2013, our self-serve business was 8.8% of revenue. The lower percentage this year reflects the lower commodity prices and the faster growth of our other lines of business. Our reported gross margin for Q2 2014 was $671 million or 39.3% of revenue, a decline of approximately 140 basis points from our gross margin percentage of 40.7% in Q2 2013. The primary reason for this decrease was a 210 basis point decline attributable to acquisitions completed after March 2013, including 120 basis points related to the specialty acquisition and 90 basis points from other acquisitions. Excluding these items, we saw an improvement of about 70 basis points in the North American operating margins. Moving to our operating expenses. Some of the comparisons are being affected by the Specialty and Sator acquisitions, which both operate 3-step models to some extent. In this model, gross margins tend to be lower than in the 2-step approach, but they incur relatively lower facility, distribution and SG&A costs. Sator will not affect these comparisons as much going forward because it was in Q2 2013 for 2 of the 3 months. Specialty will affect comparisons for the remainder of the year. Facility and warehouse costs were 7.5% of revenue in Q2 2014, a 70 basis point improvement over 8.2% in Q2 last year. This improvement is primarily due to the Specialty acquisition, which tends to run at lower facility costs than the rest of our operations. Distribution costs increased slightly from 8.5% of revenue in Q2 2013 to 8.6% this quarter. This change is mainly attributable to higher costs in the U.K., which is associated with the new branch openings and offset by lower costs from the Specialty segment. Selling and G&A expenses decreased from 11.7% of revenue in Q2 last year to 10.9% in Q2 this year, an improvement of 80 basis points. Keystone Specialty accounts for 50 basis points of the improvement, but we also saw operating leverage in the balance of the business with a 30 basis point improvement. The combination of facility and warehouse, distribution and SG&A costs was 27% of revenue in Q2 2014 as compared to 28.4% in Q2 2013. I've explained much of this improvement is due to the acquisitions we've completed, but it's worth pointing out again that the drop of other revenue relative to the total revenue is masking the leverage we're achieving in the base business. It's hard to accurately quantify the exact impact, but as I've pointed out in the past, other revenue tends to incur very little incremental cost on these line items. During Q2 2014, we recorded $5.9 million of restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, up from $3.7 million in Q2 last year 2014 costs primarily related to the specialty and Netherlands acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization was 1.8% of revenue during Q2 this year as compared to 1.5% of revenue in Q2 2013. This increase is due to higher amortization related to intangibles, particularly from the Sator and Specialty acquisitions. Other expenses, net, decreased to $13.9 million in the 3 months ended June 2014 compared to $14.9 million in the same period last year, a decrease of $1 million. The main components of the change include interest expense which was $3.1 million higher, with $4.6 million attributable to higher debt levels and a $1.5 million reduction from lower interest rates. During Q2 2013, we included -- we incurred a $2.8 million loss related to the debt extinguishment costs. Adjustments to contingent consideration were income of $0.8 million in Q2 this year as compared to an expense of $200,000 last year in the same period. Our effective borrowing rate for the quarter was 3.4%. Our year-to-date effective tax rate was 34% compared to 35.4% in the first half of 2013, reflecting our growing International business, which has lower tax rates. On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share was $0.34 in Q2 2014 compared to $0.25 in Q2 2013, an improvement of 36%. Adjusting for the combination of restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, contingent purchase price adjustments and the loss on debt extinguishment, EPS would have been $0.01 higher both this year and last. So on an adjusted basis, Q2 2014 would have been $0.35 as compared to $0.26 last year. Switching to our year-to-date cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $152 million through 6 months in 2014 compared to $209 million in 2013. Net income and depreciation were favorable to cash flow by $49 million and $19 million, respectively, but those are offset by a change in the use of cash of $35 million related to inventories. In Q2 -- excuse me, in Q1 2013, we entered the quarter with inventories at fairly high levels, so Q1 last year saw the benefit in our cash flow. In 2014, we increased inventories in Europe in anticipation of the branch expansion and at specialty ahead of the busy summer season, resulting in inventories being a use of cash this year. Similarly, accounts receivable has been $21 million higher use of cash this year, reflecting the strong sales growth year-over-year and the seasonality of the specialty business. Accounts payable has been a use of cash this year compared to a source of cash last year, creating the $35 million year-over-year change in cash flow. Timing of cash taxes resulted to a higher outflow of funds in 2014 compared to 2013 of $25 million. Capital spending was $67 million in the first 6 months of 2014 and we've spent $635 million in cash on acquisitions, the largest being Specialty, which accounted for $427 million of the total. If you recall, in Q1, we refinanced our credit facility, increasing the total size of the facility to $2.3 billion and extending the maturity until May 2019. We ended Q2 2014 with $1,951,000,000 of debt, and cash and cash equivalents were $110 million. Availability under our credit facility is approximately $1.1 billion, and with cash, total liquidity was about $1.2 billion. So we have capacity to pursue additional acquisitions as suitable opportunities arise. And now turning to guidance. We increased the bottom end of our income guidance, with the new guidance calling for net income between $405 million and $430 million. That equates to a revised earnings per share guidance of $1.32 to $1.40. We left the remainder of our guidance unchanged from February. Our guidance for 2014 for organic revenue growth for parts and services is 8% to 10%, and our guidance for capital expenditures is $110 million to $140 million, with cash flow from operations of approximately $375 million. A few general comments on what we are seeing in the business and how it's reflected in our guidance. North American wholesale continues to remain fairly steady in terms of volume and costs. We've seen slight upticks in the miles driven and in the last few years, higher new vehicle production is slowly working its way into our sweet spot of our market. While new car production initially hurts us because many insurance companies will not use alternative parts until the car is a few years old, ultimately, we believe we will see favorable improvements in the age profile of the car part, which will be helpful. We haven't seen any appreciable change in used car prices and are paying more for vehicles this year than last. We remain ever hopeful that used car prices will fall and we'll begin to get a benefit, but that hasn't shown up in any appreciable manner. A little less than 10% of our revenue are self-serve business and scrap volumes are still important to our company. In Q2, we saw another sequential drop in prices of about 3% for scrap steel. That seems to have stabilized, and our car buying in that line of business has been adjusted to the lower scrap levels. Our European operations continue to see what I would describe as sluggish demand, particularly on the continent. We thought we might see an uptick from the delayed winter spending, but that really hasn't been the case. We saw our largest aftermarket competitor in the U.K. go into receivership this month, which is probably a reflection of the difficult market conditions there, along with our success of our branch expansion. We are optimistic that we'll be able to obtain some of that revenue that the company had previously been enjoying. The acquisition integrations are going well. Rob mentioned that Keystone Specialty is slightly ahead of our expectations. Our recent acquisitions in the Netherlands are performing in line with our goals. Although it's early days, we remain confident that we are on the right strategy. I would remind everyone that the U.K. paint acquisitions completed in August last year will begin to anniversary in Q3, but they will not -- they are not growing at the same rate as Europe as a whole. So that will adversely impact our reported European organic growth. On the flip side, we had the benefit of 21 new branches we opened in Europe in the first half of the year, and we expect those to contribute to the top line growth. Historically, Q4 has been one of LKQ's stronger quarters, but our product mix has changed. We expect the European operations in our Specialty segment to slow in Q4, which will dampen the improved results we normally expect in our collision business in North America. Both Christmas and New Year's will fall on a Thursday this year, which may also cause some disruption to normal revenue and cash flow patterns. Aside from those items, we do keep an eye on foreign exchange, particularly as Europe continues to grow and on the ongoing scrap volatility and weather in the balance of the year. I believe that Arthur is the only named storm that reached landfall so far this year, and from our perspective, we saw a very little impact. Before I turn the call back to Rob, I just want to take a moment put the results of our first half of this year into perspective. In full year 2011, we had revenue for the year of $3.3 billion and net income of $210 million. In the first half of 2014, our revenue was $3.3 billion and our net income was $210 million. We accomplished in 6 months of 2014 what it took us a full year to achieve in 2011. Over the years, Rob and I have answered numerous questions regarding our acquisition and growth strategies, and we frequently respond to questions regarding how these acquisitions impact our gross margin or operating margins. I believe what it is telling about the comparison I just made is that despite doubling our size, we maintained the net income margins. It sometimes takes a bit of time to integrate our acquisitions and they will be quarterly fluctuations, but over time, when it comes to the bottom line, and by that, I mean, to include the impact of differing tax rates, we are demonstrating remarkably -- remarkable consistency in the execution of our strategy. And that, I believe, is what makes LKQ a unique company. We're growing parts and services revenue organically at a reasonably high rate, for example, 8.1% this past quarter, and we've also consistently acquired and integrated good companies and growing them at similar rates. It's rare to find a company with the markets and the skill set to both execute organic growth and acquisitions with the kind of consistency that LKQ has shown. With that, I'll turn the call back to Rob before we open to questions. Robert L. Wagman: Thanks, John. To summarize, we are quite pleased with our results in the second quarter and the first half of the year and we are optimistic of what lies ahead for our company. Looking ahead, in North America, the recent upswing and trend in new vehicle sales bodes well for our collision business because newer vehicles tend to be fully insured with higher premiums and lower deductibles, and if financed, lien holders require the owner of the vehicle to carry mandatory insurance coverage. New cars are more valuable, so they are less likely to total, and from our perspective this means that newer cars are more likely to be repaired than an older vehicle. We also believe that as more new cars are sold, used car prices will eventually fall, which is good for us because it should reduce the cost of salvaged vehicles we procure for our North American recycling business. Simply put, increased new vehicle sales equate to more insured repairs and, therefore, more opportunities for LKQ. The increase in new vehicle sales is also a favorable trend for our new Specialty segment because the most common time for someone to modify their vehicle with specialty products is in the first 2 years of vehicle ownership. The performance of our Specialty segment in the second quarter, I believe, was in part a result of this trend. In Europe, we are in the early innings with capitalizing on the opportunities in that segment. Over the last 3 years, we've gained tremendous knowledge with the success of ECP and their ability to gain share in the U.K. market. Our objective is to replicate ECP's exceptional 2-step distribution and logistics model, in the industry-leading fill rates with Sator and the recent acquisition of the 5 distributors in the Netherlands. And of course, we intend on expanding this model into other European markets and remain committed to our European strategy and the long-term growth prospects for this segment. In closing, our team of over 28,000 employees, working across our geographic and operating segments, collaborate daily to leverage their combined operational expertise with a common goal of maximizing our growth and diversification strategy. This collaboration, coupled with our ability to successfully identify, acquire, integrate and grow these businesses, continues to create a long-term value for our stockholders. Operator, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel. James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I wanted to ask you on ECP. I heard you on the addition of 2 insurers, now you're at 17 over -- I think you said well over 80% of the insurance market there. I just wanted to understand how did the market, overall -- from an alternative parts penetration perspective, how long did it take to get to 7%? And what's your view on how that 7% can work higher? Is it something that can spike as auto insurance providers sort of change their tone on alternative parts? Or is this going to be more of a gradual sort of improvement over time? And then as it relates to that, I figured I'll just ask the follow-up now. Given your competitor -- business competitor weakness and your growth, geographically speaking, how much better positioned are you now to leverage that APU growth? Robert L. Wagman: Sure. The 7%, Jamie, it was basically when we arrived in the U.K. were roughly 5% to 7%. But we think we've had, obviously, a positive impact so we continue to grow the marketplace. But the answer to your question, it really depends on the insurer. The insurer has to buy in -- and of course, I think why we're so successful here in the United States with alternative parts because the insurance company is, in fact, pushing the alternative parts. The nice part about the U.K. is that all the policies of the major insurance companies that we've looked at, all have, in their policy language, the ability to use these alternative parts. So it's going to be a long slog to get this through and get the insurance companies comfortable. But every quarter, we see more and more acceptance, and the growth has just been really, really strong. The second half of your question, about the competitive environment in the U.K. As you know, as we mentioned on the call, one of our largest competitors did go into receivership, they went into mensuration last week. We are currently looking at the various sites that were shuttered in the process and looking to see if we can find geographic holes to fill in our market and expand our distribution network. There are many trained, very talented employees now in the marketplace, and we are looking at opportunities to hire as many of those people as possible. And I think we're very well positioned to inherit a lot of that revenue that they had over there. We are 1 of 2 national companies now left on the marketplace. So we're going after the national accounts. And, again, looking to fill in the geographical holes. As I mentioned in my presentation, we added 20 locations this year, it puts us at 165. Our goal was always about 200. We will look to maybe acquire some of those so we don't have to greenfield those, and that's what we're looking at right now. So we're actively looking at opportunities in the marketplace. But we think it's a great opportunity for us to expand our strength in the U.K. market. John S. Quinn: And Jamie, just to supplement what Rob said a little bit. In terms of the collision business, the company Rob's referring to is called Unipart Automotive. They did not distribute body panels. They did a little bit of collision work in terms of lighting and that sort of thing. But in terms of the mechanical market, great opportunity for us and I don't think it's really going to impact our -- the cadence of the acceptance of collision parts, particularly. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : First question, and I apologize if I missed this, I jumped on a couple of minutes late here. But Rob, I think you mentioned that wholesale vehicle purchases were down, I think, 2% in the quarter, and I believe on a year-over-year basis. Can you just give a little color on that? Was that supply related, pricing related? What were the kind of drivers behind that? Robert L. Wagman: The main reason, John, was that we had a really healthy backlog coming out of Q1. With the nasty winter weather we had, the auctions were quite plentiful of salvage. So we did stock up quite heavily in Q1. Year-over-year, we are ahead of where we were for the 6 months to 6 months. So we have enough product in the backlog to continue to hit our salvage numbers. John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : That's helpful. Next, you guys made a couple of nice paint distribution acquisitions in the quarter. Could you just remind us -- or can you just kind of size that market opportunity in North America and Europe and maybe give us an idea of how the returns on the paint business compared to kind of corporate average? Robert L. Wagman: Yes, the market opportunity is pretty big here in the United States. It's well over $2 billion marketplace. We're #2 in North America. Finish Master would be the largest. We're a close second now, we've been gaining on them and looking at opportunities to continue to fill in that network. So you'll see more acquisitions in the paint business here in North America. As far as the U.K., we are by far the #1 distributor of paint at this point with locations throughout the U.K. John, you want to comment on the impact? John S. Quinn: Yes, it tends to be a little lower gross margin business, John, but -- and we believe we get that back on an ROIC basis due, typically, you're just holding inventory prior to it being distributed on our own vehicles. I think the example we've always pointed to is back when we did the AkzoNobel acquisition and we bought 40 of their locations, and a little over 30 of them ended up in our existing locations. And so from an ROIC point of view, I think that they're quite attractive, but they are a little bit lower gross margin businesses. And you heard us refer to that, some of the gross margin deterioration year-over-year is just a result of the acquisitions in August last year associated with the U.K. paint deals. John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. If I could just sneak one last one here. The Chrysler agreement that you guys reached, if I remember correctly, was only pertaining to very few parts. I mean, is there an opportunity to broaden that relationship with Chrysler over time? Robert L. Wagman: There is, John. And by the way, the initial lawsuit that they posed against us was for one vehicle. They have several vehicles, actually, in the patent process, so it's bigger than just the one vehicle that was mentioned in the initial lawsuit. So it is settled, and I do believe it's a got a great opportunity because, of course, they always are continuing to patent parts so -- going forward. So that will continue to grow year-over-year. As you've seen in our Ford agreement, every year we seem to get a little more traction in that program, and I expect the same will happen with Chrysler. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : I wanted to go back to the European landscape a little bit and I was just wondering if you could update us on the mechanical side, what the aftermarket parts penetration is. And you mentioned that you're now 1 of 2 national suppliers there. If you could talk about just the competitive landscape in terms of how fragmented that is, just kind of trying to frame the opportunity with Unipart kind of having their struggles like in terms of the market share that you might be able to pick up. Robert L. Wagman: Sure. In terms of the mechanical penetration there, Nate, we believe in the United States is roughly 80%. We are -- back-of-the-envelope calculations that -- we've got various sources over there -- somewhere between 50% and 60% penetration of the aftermarket. The OEs had a much stronger foothold there. That has been eroding though, with the passage of the Block Exemption Rule, about 4 years ago, which basically prohibited the OEs from voiding warranty if you put market products on. So we expect the aftermarket marketplace to continue to gain market share from the OEs. In terms of what's the opportunity, we know Unipart roughly had about $225 million worth of business. They had 160 branches. All of those branches were closed. We think there's a great opportunity, especially from a national accounts perspective, to be able to go after that business that they had. I believe roughly 40% of their business was national accounts. And that is really up for grabs and, like I said, which one of the other -- there's only LKQ or Euro Car Parts and another competitor that can possibly get that business. So we're actively going after that. This just happened a week ago, so we're actively pursuing those opportunities as we speak. Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay, great. And then in terms of going back to, like North America, obviously, the organic numbers were well within your range and also up against the tough comps. What are we kind of looking for going forward in terms of the sustainability of that 5% to 7% organic growth in terms of just the dynamics for the rest of the year? I know you mentioned some of the seasonality that you're going to get out of the specialty business, but if you look at just the kind of collision opportunity, how should we feel about that? Robert L. Wagman: I feel very good about our North American organic growth rate of 5% to 7%. John mentioned in his presentation about the SAAR rate and the continued advantages we have there. That will start to flow through here in the next year, at the latest. We'll start seeing some of those benefits relative to newer car parts. So I'm very confident in that 5% to 7% range. And with KAO, KAO was actually up 11% year-over-year. Even though it's not our [indiscernible] numbers, that bodes well for us that the new cars are starting to get to the marketplace, and as those cars get in accidents, that will definitely be a positive for us. So, feel very confident in the 5% to 7%, certainly long term as those new cars get into the system, but even short term, I think we're pretty good there. Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. And then just one last quick big -- kind of big picture thing, but a lot of people are starting to talk about these accident avoidance systems and whether or not they might actually have any impact, just wanted to see what kind of your big picture thoughts on that might be and whether you guys have done any research there in terms of whether they do make a difference. Robert L. Wagman: We have done that research. In fact, John and I had a meeting this week with CCC. We get a quarterly update on what they're seeing in the market. And they gave us an updated chart here. And they are standing by the fact that in 20 years, we should see a reduction of 5% in accident claims, 20 years from now. 5 years, it's predicted to be about 2.5%. So very little impact they're predicting over the coming years. The example we always use, Nate, was the anti-lock brakes that became a requirement somewhere around 1996. Took until about 2011 before 80% of the cars actually had them. So there's a long cycle time to work out the older cars. So we think, comfortably, this 15 to 20 years of very little impact on the accident-avoidance systems. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : On Keystone Automotive, the specialty parts business, John, you indicated that was significantly above trend at 11%. Can you explain what's driving that? Is there a market dynamic or something more specific to Keystone? John S. Quinn: I think there is a little bit of a market dynamic. That company does benefit from new car production. When we look at their SAAR rate, it is up slightly year-over-year, I don't know it's up enough to drive that whole 11%. I'd like to think that some of it is the fact that we are -- we believe we're improving the service with the additional point distribution -- point, so to speak. We're also investing in that business, we're opening a new warehouse in Texas in the fall. So I don't know if it's anything unique. Rob, do you have a view? Robert L. Wagman: I absolutely believe, Craig, what John said is right. Those 36 additional distribution points have been really critical. We're using existing LKQ facilities, so there's no additional costs and we're getting the parts to our customers even quicker. And we're starting the process, starting to share deliveries now as well. So we see that as a win-win. Customers will get the product faster. We'll continue to get additional costs out of those businesses going forward. So that's long term. We've got to get those routes all combined, but I am convinced that those extra drop points are really a key, a benefit for us to get customers more sticky with us in terms of them wanting to buy from us. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : So as the balance of the year unfolds and you have the benefit of those additional distribution points, do you think we'll see 3 more quarters of sort of above-trend growth in that business? Robert L. Wagman: I'll comment through June -- up to July, I mean, they're having a very good July as well. I think we're going to see continued growth there, strong growth. We originally -- when we announced the deal, we thought we'd grow North American 5% to 7%, I think you'll see strong growth. We'll be at the high end of that range, if not higher, I feel pretty confident going forward. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : That's great. And then on Sator, I think you mentioned some contraction in their core business. Could you just spend a little more time explaining the dynamics affecting that? And then also maybe inject how you think the 5 jobber acquisitions are going to play in that overall equation? Robert L. Wagman: Sure. There are a couple of things, Craig, on the Sator organic. Mainly, I think the most important ones is we did buy our 5 best customers, and that revenue went from organic to intercompany. Even though the deal didn't close until May, it was announced in April for the competition commission to get involved. So it was basically the whole quarter. And I'm -- what's hard to really quantify, we're pretty certain some of the remaining customers likely moved a portion of their spend elsewhere. If another competitor had the product, they didn't want to spend it with us. There was no mass leaving of customers, but we believe that their spend likely was diversified outside of LKQ. A little bit of an impact with the export business. We had a pretty decent excellent export business into Russia and the Ukraine. That, obviously, had a little bit of an impact with the political disruption in those markets. It was a mild winter in Europe, which didn't help our Q2. So I think all those factors combined a little bit to drive down the organic growth. The 5 locations that we did buy are performing to plan. It's been a couple of months since we've had them under our belt, but they are performing to our performer expectations. And customers are seeing better fill rates with us. Obviously, we're selling more of our products into those customers we bought. So we're very happy with that progress of the 5 locations we bought. We are looking, obviously, as we mentioned on the last call, Craig, that those are 52 locations. We think the optimum number is 75. So we'll look to buy a few more acquisitions in that marketplace to fill up the market and cover the entire Netherlands. So -- and finally, on that, we did pro forma a decrease in growth with those 5 acquisitions because we knew some of our customers would likely look for alternative sources. So all in all, it's expected, and we think with the 5, now we can start to drive the organic growth as we get more comfortable. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Lawrence with Stephens. John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division : You guys mentioned and talked about the -- that basically, John, you said that some of the margin improvement in the U.S. business is being masked by some of the other noise. Can you talk a little bit about what's causing that? Obviously, you get that kind of organic growth from North America, and we can understand why we get part of it. But obviously, that number is trending better probably than you expected. John S. Quinn: Yes, I think the point I was trying to make was that, obviously, the bigger driver that changed the margins has been the acquisitions, and those are masking the overall improvement. And we had about a 70 basis point improvement in North America. The other point I was trying to make was that because other revenue is becoming -- is shrinking relative to the rest of the size of the business, that's masking the leverage that we're getting out of the SG&A and the distribution network a little bit. Because if you look at those numbers, they're coming down as a total percent of revenue as well in many cases. But had we kept that other revenue higher simply because of commodity prices being higher, you would have seen those come down much more. The fact that we're compensating for that drop in other revenue is masking a little bit of the improvement in the operating leverage that we're getting in the base business. That was the point I was trying to make, John. John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Yes, right. And just one more point there. The 70 basis points in North America is just primarily leveraged from that organic growth? John S. Quinn: It's a little bit of a gross margin improvement on -- particularly, this quarter, we saw our self-serve and our aftermarket businesses taking a little bit of an uptick and then it's just that down below the gross margin line is just leveraged throughout the entire network. John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division : And last question. If you look forward and just trying to think about the puts and takes on margin pressure, how is it -- Rob, you mentioned on the Specialty business, that should be more of just flow-through of the business rather than a change in gross margin mix that will change anything on the gross margin line. Is that right? Robert L. Wagman: Yes, that business -- the Specialty business is a lower gross margin, John, so as we gain market share and grow the business, it will be a slight deterioration on our overall gross margin as they continue to outperform. John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division : But it should not -- overall, the mix there shouldn't change either way, really, up or down as far as where we could see gross margin there? Robert L. Wagman: I think it's minimal on the grants, de minimis on the grants, on the overall company performance. But it is slightly margin dilutive, that business. John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division : And then, secondly, as we go to Europe, obviously, the -- as you wind through and continue to add and move from 3-step to 2-step, that helps Sator. And then I assume the next round of revenue growth, and with the ECP branches, could come in at a little lower of cost based of -- if you pick something up from Unipart. John S. Quinn: Yes, I think that's right, John. A couple of things on the 3, 2 -- excuse me, the Netherlands acquisitions. The -- initially, we have to defer the intercompany revenue profit on -- associated with those sales. And so -- and once we get those fully integrated and get an inventory turn in there, you'll start to see a little bit of improvement in the Sator margins. ECP has opened 20 branches this year, they've incurred some of those costs in the first half of the year. As we've said before, those branches take a little while to get profitable. So I would anticipate the margins in the U.K. coming up over time as those branches expand and as they take advantage of, hopefully, our revenue part [ph] associated with that and the bankruptcy of Unipart. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Just on Sator, with the Netherlands acquisitions, is there a risk of further customer loss going forward? Or do you think you've already realized it all? Robert L. Wagman: I think it's been realized, Bill. I think the good customer defections would have been gone by now. I'd say, I think it's probably losing -- they're losing a little bit of their spend, but we haven't lost a significant customer through this process. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And in North America, on salvaged vehicles, can you just comment on the pricing trends at the auctions and also what sort of volumes or availability of vehicles you're seeing at the auctions? Robert L. Wagman: Yes, the auctions have been very steady, Bill. We haven't seen a huge spike out of -- from all that winter weather. So we track the number of vehicles that we see at the auctions and very, very steady. As far as our cost, it is slightly up year-over-year. However, that is almost by plan because we're actually trying to buy a better car to fulfill our needs. So slight increase in the car cost, but pretty much the plan. As I said, nice backlog at our facilities, and the auctions have been very, very steady. One thing I do want to talk about a little bit about is on the scrap impact as it relates to that. We were down year-over-year, about $10 a ton and, sequentially, we were down $9 a ton. And we see a slight uptick in July. So we've seen a little bit -- at least the bottom seems to have hit there. But year-to-date, we lost about $0.01 of EPS due to the scrap being down over the course of the year. So hopefully, that stabilizes and we don't lose any more on the scrap line. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Right. And if we adjust for the mix, I know you're going after maybe a little bit better quality vehicle. Just kind of on a more apples-to-apples basis, are you seeing pricing kind of steady? Or do you think it's increasing on an apples-to-apples basis also? Robert L. Wagman: Actually, it's pretty steady, but the Manheim year-to-date -- actually, year-over-year, is up about 3.6%, so that's remaining high. Everyone we've heard talk about that seems to think that has to be the end of it. It's going to start coming down because of the SAAR rate, but auction prices happen to be pretty steady. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : A couple of quick questions. First off, you mentioned that the Keystone business was dilutive to gross margin. At least in this quarter, it seemed like it was nicely accretive to EBITDA margin at 13%, which is higher, I think, at least than we were pegging it. How sustainable is that 13% EBITDA margin in and of itself? John S. Quinn: There is a seasonality to that business, I think Q2 is probably their strongest quarter. Obviously, we haven't owned the business for -- a little over 6 months. So -- but we anticipate that Q4 is probably going to be softer on that. Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then a couple of more quick questions, if I could. The acquired businesses that you acquired in the quarter outside of distributors in the Netherlands, what's a ballpark sales base on an annualized basis for those? John S. Quinn: Well, the total, including the Sator piece, is $220 million. And in the quarter -- that equates about $55 million per quarter. In the quarter, we reported $25 million, so you can anticipate about $30 million on average, again, taking out seasonality. But we should have a $30 million revenue still to come on a quarterly basis. Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. Yes, I think so. And then the last question I would have. Rob, as it relates to the U.K. pilot, the insurance company pilot for collision parts, how should we think about a time frame in terms of it switching from a pilot to a full commitment on their behalf? I mean, are there certain mile posts that have been voiced to you? Or how should we define the success of the program and its gestation period? Robert L. Wagman: Sure. Sam, I kind of wish we never used the word pilot because it obviously signifies that it's a test. The fact that no insurance company -- we launched this back in March of 2012, has stopped writing the product. I believe it's just a word that we probably regret using. We are in full-status program with these guys. Again, just taking away the word pilot. The growth that -- double-digit strong, 33% this quarter off a mild winter, I think we can continue to see those programs last. I would say we're over the hump right now with most of the carriers on the uneasiness about using these parts. Everyone has been committed to the program, and no one is showing any signs of taking back with their stance on the aftermarket parts. Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Is there a tipping point coming from the aftermarket parts manufacturers then, in terms of them committing a product for you to inventory then? Robert L. Wagman: The nice part about this, Sam, is they're the exact same manufacturers for us here in North America, so we have them fully committed to putting more certified parts into the program, both here and the north -- and in the U.K. In fact, we had an increase of certified parts of 33% here in North America. So no issues at all with our manufacturers whatsoever. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : My questions have been answered, but I was going to ask about buying these Sator distributors and what it was going to eventually do to your margins. But I think, John, you kind of answered it. You said it's up a smidge over time? John S. Quinn: Yes, I think so. Basically, we were making a profit selling to the distributors, distributors were making a profit, so you've got -- once you eliminate that intercompany revenue, ultimately, we anticipate a slight uptick in the gross margins. We had to defer the profit on the intercompany sales until we get a turn in inventory. So we didn't get much benefit from that in Q2, probably won't get much benefit in Q3, start to see a little bit better improvement in Q4. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then, Rob, with your business, I remember in Q1, you said it was definitely impacted by weather. There was a lot of backlog in the collision repair facilities. I mean, how much did that really benefit you in Q2? And has that -- I would assume at this point, that, that's equilibrialized. Robert L. Wagman: It's certainly helped, Gary, there was definitely a backlog going into Q2. We're in constant contact with our customers. They still feel that there's work in the field, whether that's late in the winter or now it's the hailstorms or just normal conditions. But volume's been pretty good through July. We're very pleased with the amount of locked work at the shops. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then, lastly, John, you were talking about the changes in seasonality for -- based on Europe. So that would mean Q3, based on that seasonality, will be stronger than it historically has been, and Q4 would be less strong than it historically has been. Is that how I should read that? John S. Quinn: If you look back many years ago, our strongest quarters tend to be Q1, followed by Q4. The point I was trying to make, I think, was with the European businesses, Q4 tends to be a little bit lighter than, say, Q2. And the Keystone automotive business, there's a lot of recreational associated -- especially with people who want to enhance their vehicles. But a lot of that tends to take place in the summer months. So we're anticipating a little step-down in the Keystone automotive in Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Stember with Sidoti & Company. Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Rob, you indicated that the Keystone Specialty operations is now offering 1,000 SKUs of collision parts nature. Could you maybe just talk about how that's been received, how those are moving and, specifically, what kind of parts those are? Robert L. Wagman: Yes, it's really early days, Scott. We just got all the systems communicating with each other, so the reps on both sides can see the product. It's mainly cooling products at this point, radiators, condensers, that stuff that goes into those specialty shops as well. But very pleased to have that inventory there. They actually -- I think the big potential win here will be the muscle car. Those specialty shops do tend to work on those type of vehicles, and those 20,000 SKUs of the Goodmark muscle car parts, that opens up a new opportunity to move that. It's not a huge market, the specialty -- muscle car market, but we have a nice line to be able to go after those customers now. So early days, but the communication is going back and forth and the products are flowing. And again, with 36 of their locations now -- LKQ locations as their drop point, much easier to get to them to as well. Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. And just moving over to Europe. Now that you've had relationships with several big carriers in the U.K. for -- going on over a year now, can you talk about any success with driving the collision parts program in the continent? Robert L. Wagman: We've done nothing yet. At this point, Scott, our plan was to get the 3 to 2 the companies -- Sator companies under -- through the consolidation process. We are working on that. But I believe, by Q4, we'll start putting some insurance marketing people over there. And hopefully, by Q1 of next year, we should be able to launch a program over there with parts. Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. And just last question on -- can you just give an update on CCC ONE and how that's going, where you stand with that? Robert L. Wagman: Sure. Sequentially, we had a 15% growth in orders and a 14% growth in dollars and they've over 4,200 shops enrolled at this point. So slow but steady, but still growing. And salvage will be in pilot, so that they'll be able to order salvage in Q4 with a rollout in Q1 of 2015. So moving ahead very nicely. We want to be courteous of your time, so we'll wrap up here. Thank you, everyone, for your time this morning, and we look forward to speaking to you in October when we report our third quarter 2014 results. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your time lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

In Q3, revenue reached a new quarterly high of $1.72 billion, an increase of 32.6% as compared to Q3 2013. Net income for the third quarter of 2014 was $91.5 million, an increase of 24.6% as compared to $73.4 million for the same period in 2013. Diluted earnings per share of $0.30 for the third quarter ended September 30, 2014, increased 25% from $0.24 for the third quarter of 2013. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2014 would've been $0.31 compared to $0.25 for the third quarter of 2013 after adjusting for any net losses resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related expenses and changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. During the quarter, we achieved organic revenue growth and acquisition revenue growth for parts and services of 8.9% and 24.6%, respectively. I am particularly pleased with the North American organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.7%. Now more detail on our North American operations. During the third quarter, we purchased over 72,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is a 2.4% increase from Q3 2013. With the Manheim Index trending down over the last 5 months, I want to take a moment to touch on one aspect of our car buying that could impact us in the coming quarters. One way to grow recycled parts business is to simply buy more cars. If we buy 5% more vehicles and they are the right vehicles for which there is demand, then our revenue in that segment should increase proportionately. It is also possible to grow revenue buying a better-quality car, one that will part out for additional revenue. So while the number of vehicles we bought this quarter was up only modestly, we remain confident in our ability to grow the top line because of the better-quality car we are purchasing. While used car prices are falling, we have increased the average value of inventory acquired. We believe that this decision will drive incremental revenue and gross margin dollars in the coming quarters. Because of the life of the selling cycle, this will likely take 2 quarters to fully manifest itself in our results. During the quarter, our aftermarket parts business continued to deliver solid organic growth. Between 2009 and 2013, the average number of parts being replaced on a repair claim has increased 10% with 75% of the increase being captured by aftermarket parts. Insurers' expanded use of aftermarket parts is being driven by the value proposition of aftermarket parts and the increased supply availability as evidenced by a 32% year-over-year increase in the number of available certified parts. In our self-service retail business, during the third quarter, we acquired approximately 134,000 lower-cost self-service and crush-only cars as compared to 128,000 in Q3 of 2013 or roughly a 4.5% increase. Now turning to our European operations. We continue to be extremely pleased with the performance of Euro Car Parts and its ability to increase market share. In Q3, ECP achieved organic revenue growth of 17.9%. This figure includes, for the first time, the paint businesses acquired in August last year. Excluding our paint locations, ECP's organic revenue growth during the quarter was 10.4% for branches open more than 12 months. I am particularly pleased with the ongoing double-digit organic growth despite facing unseasonably warm September, a soft overall economic environment in the U.K. during the quarter and coming up a year that benefited from aggressive branch openings in 2012. On August 7, 2014, ECP assumed the leases of 27 former Unipart Automotive branches. Unipart was a large competitor, which went into receivership during the quarter. We don't intend to retain all of these locations. Our plan is to keep some of the smaller satellite locations to existing branches. Some will become the main branch in that market, replacing our existing site. And some will be operated temporarily while we find a more suitable location in certain markets. When that rationalization is completed, we anticipate that we will net out 18 new ECP branches. Initially, we will incur some upfront costs with these transactions that will cause a drag on earnings. However, we believe this deal positions us well to continue our market share gains in the U.K. and advance our sales to the Unipart Car Care Centres and national accounts. In addition, we've been able to hire many experienced people from across former Unipart. Further highlighting this point, since Unipart went into receivership, our existing ECP branches have seen averages sales per day to Unipart Car Care Centres and national accounts increase 57% and 23%, respectively. During the quarter, ECP opened up a total of 15 branches, 3 new ECP branches and 12 converted Unipart Automotive branches, bringing our current network to 179 branch locations. Our target is to have 190 branches by year-end, including the balance of the Unipart locations. Now an update on ECP's collision program. During the quarter, we continued to witness strong double-digit year-over-year growth of nearly 30% with our collision parts sales. And for the first time, we are witnessing our impact to the U.K. APU rate. Based on reports from multiple industry participants, U.K. APU today stands at 9%, which is a 200 basis point improvement since we launched ECP's collision program in March of 2012. And of that 200 basis points improvement, we believe the vast majority is a direct result of our efforts in educating carriers and body shops of our value proposition to not only drive down cost but to assure them of the quality of the aftermarket collision products and ECP's ability to get them to the shop on time. In conjunction with the growth of ECP's collision parts program, I am also pleased with the growth we are achieving with ECP's paint sales from the distributors we acquired in August 2013. The growth we are witnessing with our paint sales further highlights the leverage and synergies our one-stop shop collision model can achieve in new geographic segments. Now let's turn to our Sator business. On August 27, 2014, the company completed its acquisition of an automotive aftermarket products parts distributor with 11 branches in the Netherlands. This acquisition supports our ongoing plan to convert Sator distribution network from a 3-step to a 2-step model. We anticipate that once we rationalize these 11 branch locations with Sator's existing network, we will net 8 new branches, bringing Sator's branch count to 60. As mentioned on previous calls, our target is 75 to 80 branches for building up the Netherlands market. Though we saw a decline in EBITDA margin in Europe this quarter, driven in part by integration of Netherlands distributors into Sator, we believe the strategic initiatives have positioned us well for executing our growth strategy. Despite the loss of some export sales, Sator posted 2.1% organic growth in the quarter. Now an update on our specialty segment. Keystone Specialty continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year growth of 13.4% in the quarter and year-to-date growth of 11% against its preacquisition results. To further expand Keystone Specialty's presence in the RV market with its existing NTP Distribution business, on October 3, the company announced that it acquired Stag-Parkway. Stag-Parkway is a leading aftermarket distributor of recreational vehicle parts and accessories in North America that has been serving a diverse base of over 6,000 customers from 600 suppliers for the past 50 years. Stag-Parkway offers a broad selection of parts and accessories with next-day shipments that covers 95% of North America. Stag currently operates 12 warehouses in the United States. We believe there are ample opportunities for synergies and for leveraging our existing North American distribution network with the combination of Stag and Keystone Specialty's existing RV business. In addition to the acquisitions in Europe and specialty segments, during the third quarter 2014, the company made 2 additional North American acquisitions, including a salvage yard in Nova Scotia, Canada and a heavy-duty truck salvage yard in Illinois. As you can see, we've been very busy with acquisitions and proud to report that we have completed 20 acquisitions for the first 9 months of 2014, including 12 in North America alone, with the additional 8 in Europe. Acquisition candidates continue to exist across all of our operating segments, and we are well positioned to execute operationally and financially as opportunities present themselves. At this time, I'd like to ask John Quinn to provide some more detail on the financial results for the quarter. John S. Quinn: Thanks, Rob. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Revenue for Q3 2014 was $1.7 billion, an increase of $423 million or 33% over the $1.3 billion we achieved in Q3 2013. Earnings growth was a healthy 25% increase. I'll point out some things about earnings to help explain the difference relative to revenue growth. As a frame of reference, the way we looked at the quarter was as follows. Last year, in Q3, we reported $0.24 of diluted earnings per share when there was $0.01 unfavorable impact from restructuring, acquisition and contingent payment adjustments. There was also $0.01 favorable adjustment relating to discrete tax items. This year, our reported diluted earnings per share was $0.30. We had $0.01 of unfavorable impact from restructuring, acquisition and contingent payment adjustments. Not in our guidance but in our actual results was a further $0.005 of unfavorable impact associated with the new branch startups in the U.K. as a result of a competitor, Unipart, going into insolvency administration. In our guidance but not necessarily in some analyst models was the unfavorable impact of not being able to recognize profit on sales to recently acquired companies in the Netherlands. That was a further $0.01 impact of our earnings. I realize there's a lot going on here, so I'll repeat some of this analysis in the rest of my remarks. The revenue growth breaks down as follows : For Q3, our total organic revenue growth was 8.5% and we delivered additional growth of 22.7% from acquisitions with foreign exchange adding a further 1.3%. Organic growth of parts and services was 8.9%. Within that, we saw our North American operations grow organically 6.7% while the European segment grew 13.4%. North American growth was the highest we've reported in the last 5 quarters. We believe that this growth reflects the basic fundamentals of the company's markets and our value proposition. Last quarter, in our prepared remarks and in our recent investor presentations, we stated that we believe that we should start to see the benefit of higher miles driven, the benefit of higher new car sales starting to come into our sweet spot for alternative parts demand. The fundamental value proposition of alternative parts for the consumer and the insurance companies continues to drive demand as measured in parts consumption. It's our belief that these dynamics will continue to afford our industry and LKQ, in particular, opportunities for continued organic growth in North America. As we anticipated in the last quarterly call, the European segment showed lower growth as we have included the U.K. paint operations acquired in August last year in organic growth for the first time, along with Sator for a full quarter for the first time. Even including the paint businesses, ECP continues to show strong organic growth of 18%. We saw Sator return to positive organic revenue growth with a 2.1% improvement, helped by our expansion in France. With the acquisition of some of our major customers and converting the distribution to a 2-step model, we anticipated some loss of revenue in the base business. But through the first 6 months, those losses have been well controlled and the base business is growing even in a difficult economic environment. Acquisitions completed in the last 12 months through September 30 contributed $295 million to Q3 2014 revenue on a reported basis, including $4 million from acquisitions completed in Q3 2014. The annualized revenue from acquisitions completed in Q3 2014 was approximately $37 million or $9 million per quarter. Rob mentioned we acquired Stag-Parkway earlier in October. Obviously, none of that revenue is in the quarterly numbers. But for modeling purposes, we are estimating that Stag will have an annual revenue of approximately $180 million. Total change in other revenue, which is where we recorded scrap commodity sales, was positive 15%. Acquisitions contributed 9% positive growth and we had 6% organic growth, primarily volume increases, as fuel pricing was about 3% lower year-over-year. The average price we received for scraps deal was $215 per ton this year versus $221 per ton in Q3 2013. Other revenue was 10.3% of total revenue as compared to 11.9% for the same period last year, reflecting the declining relative importance of this revenue to our overall results. In Q3 2014, revenue for our self-serve business was $115 million or 6.7% of LKQ's total revenue. Approximately 31% of this revenue was parts sales included in North American parts and services revenue and 69% scrap and core sales included in other revenue. Our reported gross margin for Q3 2014 was $664 million or 38.6% of revenue, a decline of approximately 130 basis points from our gross margin percentage of 39.3% in Q3 2013. There was 130 basis point decline attributable to the specialty acquisition. Mix and some smaller acquisitions are offsetting a 60 basis point improvement in the base North American business. We are encouraged to see these continued improvements in the North American margins. As I explained in last quarter's call, we're not able to recognize the intercompany profit on sales by Sator to the newly acquired distributors until we complete 1 turn of inventory and those products are sold to the final customers. That process is behind us now. But in Q3 2014, it impacted our gross margins by approximately $4.6 million. Had we not had that impact, our gross margin percentage would have been 30 basis points higher and our EPS about $0.01 higher. Moving to operating expenses. Some of the comparisons are being affected by our specialty acquisition. In the specialty line of business, gross margins tend to be lower, but they incur relatively lower facility and SG&A costs. Specialty will affect the comparisons for the remainder of the year. Facility and warehouse costs were 7.7% of revenue in Q3 2014, a 60 basis point improvement over the 8.3% in Q3 last year. This improvement is primarily due to specialty, which tends to run lower facility costs than the rest of our operations. Distribution cost increased slightly from 8.4% of revenue in Q3 2013 to 8.6% this quarter. This change was mainly attributable to higher cost in the U.K., which was associated with the new branch openings and some startup costs, which we are incurring on the former Unipart locations. Selling and G&A expenses decreased from 11.8% of revenue in Q3 last year to 11.2% in Q3 this year, an improvement of 60 basis points. Keystone Specialty accounts for 30 basis points of the improvement, but 20 basis points of that was offset by the Netherlands acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, we saw North American leverage generate a 50 basis point improvement in this market. So in summary, the combination of facility and warehouse, distribution and SG&A cost was 27.5% of revenue in Q3 2014 as compared to 28.6% in Q3 2013. About half of that improvement is a net impact of acquisitions, offset by incremental cost of ECP and the other half was leverage from the North American operations. During Q3 2014, we recorded $3.6 million of restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, up from $2.2 million in Q3 last year. The 2014 cost is primarily related to the operations in the Netherlands. Depreciation and amortization was 1.8% of revenue during Q3 this year as compared to 1.6% of revenue in Q3 2013. This increase was due to higher amortization related to intangibles, primarily at the specialty acquisition. Other expenses net increased to $16.4 million in the 3 months ended September 2014, compared to $14.4 million in the same period last year, an increase of $2 million. The main components of the change included net interest expense, which is $1.2 million higher, with $2.4 million attributable to higher debt levels, partially offset by a $1.2 million reduction in lower interest rates. Adjustments to continued consideration were negligible this quarter as compared to an expense of $700,000 in Q3 last year. Other income is also negligible this year, whereas in Q3 2013, it was a positive $1.6 million. This change is also entirely due to currency changes, which generated income of $500,000 last year over a loss of $900,000 this year. Our effective borrowing rate for the quarter was 3.5%. Our year-to-date effective income tax rate was 34% as compared to 34.6% the prior year. In Q3 2014, our effective rate was 34% versus 32.6% Q3 last year. As we previously disclosed, in Q3 last year, we had some favorable discrete items which lowered the rate, impacting earnings per share favorably by approximately $0.01 at that time. On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share was $0.30 in Q3 2014 compared to $0.24 in Q3 2013, an improvement of 25%. Adjusting for the restructuring, acquisition-related expenses and contingent consideration adjustments, EPS would have been about $0.01 higher both this year and the last. So on an adjusted basis, Q3 would have been $0.31 as compared to $0.25 last year. I've also pointed the $0.01 EPS impact to gross margin caused by the Netherlands acquisitions and the $0.01 impact for discrete items in last year's taxpayers. We believe the U.K. branch openings will have further unanticipated $0.005 loss this year. We always have some types of these costs in the company. But in this case, they were not contemplated in our July guidance. Switching to our year-to-date cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $323 million through 9 months in 2014 compared to $341 million in 2013. Net income and depreciation were favorable to cash flow by $67 million and $29 million, respectively. Growth in accounts receivable was an incremental 35 -- $34 million use of cash as we continue to grow revenue organically. Similarly, inventory was an incremental use of cash of $37 million as we invest in inventory for the expanded business. The timing of cash taxes resulted in a higher outflow of funds in 2014 compared to 2013 of $20 million and other operating assets was a net use of $21 million, primarily as a result of interest payments on our senior notes and bonus payments in 2014. Capital spending was $100 million in the first 9 months of 2014, and we spent $651 million in cash on acquisitions, the largest being specialty, which accounted for $427 million of the total. During the quarter, we amended our asset securitization program, increasing the facility size from $80 million to $97 million and extending the maturity to October 2017. We ended Q3 2014 with $1.9 billion of debt and cash and cash equivalents were $245 million. Availability in our credit facility was approximately $1.1 billion and with the cash, total liquidity was approximately $1.4 billion. So we have the capacity to pursue additional acquisitions if suitable opportunities arise. Now turning to guidance. The new guidance is calling for net income between $405 million and $417 million. That equates to revised earnings per share guidance of $1.32 to $1.36. We left the remainder of our guidance unchanged from February. Our guidance in 2014 for organic revenue growth from parts and services is 8% to 10% and our guidance for capital expenditures is $110 million to $140 million with cash from operations of approximately $375 million. I'll point out where we see some differences from the last quarter and how we think those impacted Q3 or may impact Q4. Relative to the guidance we provided in Q2, the major changes we've seen relate to the U.K. branch expansion, foreign exchange rates and scrap. The new U.K. branch openings since our last call were not anticipated in our prior guidance. We acquired these locations on very favorable terms. And while it should be a long-run positive for us, they are requiring some initial further investment. We are working very quickly to get these opened and expect that the portfolio will be largely rationalized by the end of the year. We believe that the losses from this program likely will cost us about $0.005 in earnings per share in Q3 and will be almost $0.01 loss in Q4. As I'm sure listeners are aware, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against many currencies, including the Canadian dollar, the euro and the pound. We believe this negatively impacted us in Q3 partly because the earnings convert to lower U.S. dollars but also with short-term losses we recorded in other income, which I mentioned a moment ago. We believe that given where rates are today, we could see $0.015 to $0.01 impact to earnings per share relative to the Q2 guidance. Scrap was down slightly in Q3 but not really enough to call out as an issue. However, we have seen fairly steep drops in October, and we're hearing there's potential further drops in November. We are adjusting our car buying to reflect this, but that takes time and can cause some volume decreases, as we tend to leave the market on the downside. It is possible that we could see the combined volume price from scrap being as much as $0.01 impact to EPS in Q4. As we have discussed before, we see these fluctuations as short-term gains and losses, which take a quarter or 2 to correct but fundamentally don't change the business. And one final reminder, the U.K. paint businesses were included in our organic growth only half the quarter and they'll be in the figure for the full quarter in Q4. So we may get a slight tick-down in the European organic growth as a result of that. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Rob before we open it up to questions. Robert L. Wagman: Thanks, John. To summarize, we are pleased with our results in the third quarter and for the first 9 months of the year and we are optimistic of what lies ahead for our company. Looking ahead, in North America the recent upswing in miles driven, lower gas prices and increased new car sales should provide nice tailwind to our collision business. In addition, a younger car part that is fully insured and more frequent driving should equate to a higher accident frequency, resulting in more repairs. For insurance companies, the competition for premium dollars is fierce with the personal lines insurance industry today spending more than 3x what they spent on marketing and advertising in 2002. We view this as a positive for LKQ because the value proposition of alternative collision parts continues to be a real solution for insurance carriers to drive down their costs. Another potential positive is that we continue to believe that as more new cars are sold; used car prices will continue to fall. The Manheim Index is down over 1% year-over-year through September, which is good for the cost of the salvage vehicles we procure for our North American recycling business. And as you can see by the acquisitions completed thus far in 2014, North America continues to be a priority in key segments for LKQ, and we have runway to grow our network within all lines of our businesses. In the U.K., in just 2 years, we have built aftermarket-only collision parts business from scratch, which is now approaching $70 million of revenue. Our efforts in the U.K. have played the key role in driving APU growth by 28%. We continue to believe there are ample opportunities to grow this business line in the U.K. and soon the launch on the continent. Again this growth has been accomplished with aftermarket collision parts only, leaving many more untapped opportunities for LKQ in Europe, including salvage, reman and heavy truck, which we continue to explore regularly. In Europe, there are approximately 280 million vehicles on the road, roughly 14% larger than the United States, yet there is no pan-European distributor scale serving the professional mechanical and collision repair. In just over 2 years, LKQ is a leading player in Europe servicing these customers. This dynamic highlights the fragmented nature of this operating segment and a market ripe for consolidation. Lastly, our acquisition strategy has always been to acquire the best assets we can with the best management teams and use those strengths to lever the business to higher growth rates. Clearly, Keystone Specialty fits that criteria and we believe there is opportunity to grow this segment in the niches it serves. In closing, our team of over 29,000 employees work tirelessly to create and evolve what we will believe is a unique company. Our extensive networks, the breadth of our inventory and our industry-leading fulfillment position us well to deliver consistent growth organically and from acquisitions across all of our operating segments. This combination should translate into continued long-term value for our stockholders. And with that, Devon, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel. James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : A couple of key points that you highlighted, organic growth, U.K. APUs, up 200 basis points, and then Sator profit. I want to ask one quick clarification and a follow-up. Rob, on one of the comments you made with respect to the focus on late-model vehicle purchases, it seems to tie with what you're talking about in terms of the sweet spot in terms of the growth of kind of 3-, 4-, 5-year-old units in operation. But at the same time, it doesn't seem like you're looking for any degradation in the pricing environment. So perhaps is that an element of sort of conservatism in your outlook that could incrementally drive a better result looking into the fourth quarter and beyond? Robert L. Wagman: Yes. Jamie, obviously, with car parts shifting to a newer car part, this was a strategy of ours that we have led very quickly. We want to start buying a newer car. That's going to do a couple of things for us. As I mentioned on previous calls, with our shifts switching from an average request of a 7-mod-year car to a 9-mod-year-old car, we were selling an older car part at a lower price. We do believe that we can, in essence, acquire the same number of cars and increase our top line to meet our expectations because we'll be selling at a higher price. With Manheim coming down as well, we do expect a lower cost of this type of vehicles across the board. So we can buy a better car that will part for more at a reasonable price because of Manheim coming down. So it was a conscious shift on our part and we think we can take advantage of that going into 2015 and beyond. James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : It just sounds like it's building, I guess, is my point as well. Robert L. Wagman: Absolutely, yes. You're going to see that sweet spot start to get a lot stronger here as those 16 and 17 million car parts move its way towards 2 and 3 years old, which is already happening. So we believe that we're going to start seeing some tailwind from that for sure. James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Great. Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, just on the gross margin side, John, thanks for the details as well, trying to understand a little bit on the Sator comment you made. But overall, 130 basis point degradation year-over-year with a 60 basis point lift in core, which has been, I think, consistent with the last 2 or 3 quarters of 60, 70 basis point lift in core. So as we look into the fourth quarter and beyond, we're going to cycle through some of the bigger-picture acquisition headwinds. How should we think about the compares if you look into 2015? It seems like it will be a positive environment for further gross margin expansion. But what are the headwinds that we're missing that we should be considering for next year as well? John S. Quinn: Yes. Thanks, Jamie. So there's about 130 basis point drop in Q3 year-over-year. I think we called out about 130 basis of that was specifically tied to the Keystone Specialty acquisition. We think there's about 60 basis points that's just tied to some of the smaller deals, including some of those -- the acquisitions that we did in the Netherlands, where we weren't able to recognize the intercompany profit that you would normally see coming through in the inventory until we actually sell that product through an inventory turn. That's behind us now. It was about a $4.6 million impact at relatively low tax rate in the Netherlands of 25%. So that was probably about another 30 basis points. Obviously, that's not a year-over-year impact, but it is in the numbers, and we just want to try to explain that because I'm not sure everybody appreciated that, even when we tried to call it out on the last quarterly call. And then you did see at the North American base business, we have about 60 basis point improvement. So those 2 kind of netted off against each other. In terms of what's going -- where we see coming down the pipeline, obviously we won't have a repeat of that intercompany issue in Q4, that's behind us. We do think though that scrap is going to fall. We know scrap is falling, and we don't know how far. But I did call out that it could be about $0.01 impact. So in North America, $5 million is roughly $0.01. So that will probably hurt us in Q4 a little bit. But that, I guess, I said, will be offset by the impact of Sator picking up. And then you just have the normal seasonality in terms of the base business. Generally speaking, the collision business is a little bit stronger. And so we do normally see a seasonal impact. It is a positive on that side. Sometimes the margins can be a little bit weaker on the mechanical side in Europe because you have December, where it's lower in Keystone and Stag acquisition are obviously going to be. That's a seasonal low for them as well. Going into next year, obviously we're not giving guidance yet for that. But a lot of these things that I just talked about are sort of more -- I won't call them one-time events, but they're unusual events that we don't expect to repeat. Obviously, the scrap, we address our procurement. So that will bleed through in the quarter, so -- and then we'll get through the Sator thing, continue the integration with respect to some of the integrations over there. It's probably a little bit of a drag with respect to the opening of the new branches in the ECP. So we may see a little bit improvement there, as Rob mentioned, with respect to the car cost as well. So that's maybe a little bit more than you asked for, but... Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets. Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : A question as it relates to the Keystone Specialty business. I mean, could you sort of just refresh us on what its growth was on a comparable basis, and then how you're seeing that underlying industry growth? I mean, that number, it seems like it's expanding better than the rate of performance parts. And maybe some feeling for market share gains or what might be driving the expansion there. Robert L. Wagman: Bret, year-over-year on the core was 13.4% and year-to-date was 10.3%. So I think what's driving that is the SAAR rate. There's no doubt about it. People are most likely going to accessorize their vehicle at the time of purchase. And many of our better customers or dealerships have really rolled this right into the bank note. So we are very bullish on that quite frankly with the SAAR rate being strong. We think their growth rate is going to continue for as long as the SAAR rate remains strong. Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. And then on Stag, could you give us any more color as far as what their productivity maybe EBITDA rates were on that $180 million in revenues? Robert L. Wagman: Well, let me talk full synergy, where we think we're going to be on that, Bret. Let's talk about the deal as a whole. We paid approximately $110 million for the business with revenue of circa $180 million, as John mentioned. Post synergies -- and we think there's a lot, they have a couple of years to get that. There's a lot of warehouse consolidation that needs to be done. But post synergy, we expect we'll be in the multiple range of our normal multiple range that we pay for business, in the 4 to 6. And I believe it will be closer to the lower end of the range than the higher end of the range when we're all said and done. Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. Any news out of State Farm? Could you give us an update on where they are with the chrome bumper business, if there's any signs of expanding that? Robert L. Wagman: Absolutely. This quarter, again really good growth on chrome bumpers. We were up 22.4%. And again really hard to tie how much of that is to State Farm, but we know the market wasn't growing at 22.4% for sure. So we think they have a lot to do with that. Nothing new coming on out of Bloomington, unfortunately. But we remind them every quarter of the results and they show their appreciation for that. There is one uptick to the insurance side of the business. GEICO insurance just became the second-largest insurance company in the United States. It overtook Allstate. They just had phenomenal growth. They're very active users of our products. So even if some of the bigger companies, the State Farms, continue to not use our products, gains by aggressive companies like GEICO continue to bode well for us and really provide a great future. Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. And then one last question, on the 60 basis points gross margin expansion in North America core, could you give us a color on what the pricing environment looks like as far as competition? Is product sourcing generating the margin? Or is it a less competitive pricing environment that's helping? John S. Quinn: It was spread across all the lines of business, I think. We saw a little bit improvement in the self-service business. We saw the aftermarket business, we are benefiting a little bit from, we believe, better procurement on that side of the business. It's difficult to say exactly how the Manheim Index is impacting us in terms of the salvage business because as it's coming down, as Rob mentioned, we are buying a slightly better car. So we're investing in more expensive cars than we were a year ago. But we believe that's going to ultimately translate into higher organic growth because they'll have higher -- those cars will part out for more dollars. Robert L. Wagman: And let me just add one thing, Bret, that Q3 historically has not been one of our better gross margin quarters. So to have that expansion in this quarter, we're very pleased with that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Maybe start with the guidance, especially on Q4. Your full year organic growth guidance is unchanged, but you're up 9.1% for the first 9 months. So if I do the math, you've got a pretty wide range for Q4. Any insight into why you've decided to keep it so wide? And maybe what are trends looking like so far this quarter? John S. Quinn: We just didn't really see any reason to change it, quite frankly. I think it's more than a meaningful change to try to tweak it down or up meaningfully in the quarter to be perfectly frank. In terms of the quarter-to-date, do you have any comments? Robert L. Wagman: Yes. The quarter so far, October, obviously we're 3 weeks in -- almost 4 weeks in, going to plan. We always seem to get a little bit of uptick when we switch to daylight savings time, which happens next week, so pretty much to plan. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then with respect to Europe and your progress with insurance companies there, I'm curious if there's some kind of internal metric you use to determine the pace of adoption? Obviously, you've talked about the whole industry being up pretty significantly. But I'm wondering if you can track your progress with specific insurance companies and if some are outperforming others in terms of their adoption curve. Robert L. Wagman: We can certainly, Craig, where they have their own collision repair shops. And we are seeing more and more adoption through that. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the 200 basis point improvement, we believe, we have a major part in that increase. So we do watch the insurance companies, again with their own body shop, so we could track that. Outside, when they're using independents and the direct repair facilities, it's much more difficult because we often don't know who the carrier is at that time. Our focus now is to really hone in on those 17 carriers that we have those relationships with that have an 80% market share and just keep driving the business. No negative news out of any of those carriers whatsoever, not a pullback. So we're optimistic that we can continue to drive this. And at some point, we're going to bring this to the continent. And really what we're waiting for there is really skip the integration of the 3 -- the companies that we bought, the end line distributors at Sator. Once that's complete and we think we'll do that in 2015, we'll be able to watch the collision parts program on the continent. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And finally, I imagine as your insurance company partners are successful with the adoption of these aftermarket parts, they'll start considering recycled parts. At what point do you think it will make sense for you to introduce those types of parts as well? Robert L. Wagman: Yes. It's going to be sooner than later. We have people looking at opportunities over there. We made initially a promise to them that if they adopted the aftermarket parts, we would look to expand our business. They clearly have done that. So I think you'll see us enter the salvage parts business in 2015 somewhere in Europe. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Lawrence with Stephens. John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Rob, would you take a step further and just go on the European side and maybe walk through sort of that -- the differences maybe in the flows? Obviously, it's a favorable development to get those stores from Unipart. But just give us a little difference in the flows of the upfront cost versus -- on this deal versus if you were just greenfield. John S. Quinn: John, it's John Quinn speaking. I'll just start and Rob can supplement it maybe. The Unipart branches, at the time they went into administration, they had been 165 location and were doing, we think, around GBP 165 million. So their productivity at those individual branches is obviously much smaller than what an equivalent ECP branch would do. They were shut down for a number of weeks. And so obviously some of the customers have gone away. We acquired the leases through the administration process, went back and tried to hire as many of the staff that we thought we could that were associated with those branches. But we basically got no inventory. We had to take the signage down. We had to rerack them, and then get our inventory in there and get them into our system. So it's not too dissimilar to a greenfield. I guess, the point we were trying to make was that those things were not in our original guidance. We didn't anticipate the normal startup losses, which is why we didn't really just called them out as a unique item in the press release. We always have some of those costs. Last year, we had some branch openings going on. And so we always have some of those costs. This is just a change from relative to what we had expected in Q2 at the time we did the guidance. So the plan is to take those 27 locations, some of them we're just using as a starter location to get the market going and we're going to actually close the branches and open a bigger branch of our own once we find a suitable site. In a couple of cases, they did have some bigger locations, and we are going to move our location into theirs. And in some cases, we decided that the facility was inappropriate. That's why Rob said out of the 27, we think we're going to net around 18 locations. So you end up -- and we wanted to retain those staff with the additional costs, get training those people into our systems, getting the inventory in, getting the system set up. And it's a big piece of -- there's a lot going on there in a very short period of the time, which is why the costs were a little bit high. But I'd just point out, we did buy these at a very favorable price. We basically assumed the leases and got paid for some small, minor assets. Robert L. Wagman: And I think, John, just to add on to what John said, I think in a perfect world, the greenfield would be perhaps desirable because you can pick your locations and you can build it from scratch. But because the opportunity with them going to receivership, we wanted to move quickly. So it will take a little bit longer, but we're obviously excited about the opportunity. And as you noted from the results, I imagine on the UCC stores, Unipart Car Care Centres and the national accounts, we are starting to get some of that business for sure. John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Great. And secondly on the specialty business, so the acquired business you got, if you look at that from a gross margin standpoint will as you tie that in with Keystone, will you get -- will that leverage come from buying synergies or basically just from this warehouse transition? Or are the operating models today about the same? John S. Quinn: In terms of the gross margin, we hope to achieve some procurement synergies over time with that. You don't -- ultimately, the -- it's running at the moment on lower EBITDA margin than a normal business. But we believe we can get it up through the rationalization of the inventory and the distribution system or the warehousing and the distribution system. Robert L. Wagman: We would definitely get some pickup on the purchasing, but [indiscernible] the synergies that we get from bringing the distributions together. John S. Quinn: Right. But that's not going to go through the gross margin line, by and large. A lot of that [indiscernible] the facility and warehousing and distribution lines. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : First question for you -- and I don't want to beat you guys up on the gross margin line. I mean, I recognize that the real leverage in the business model isn't there. But we do get a lot of questions on it. And so I'm just thinking from a trend basis, do you think gross margin could return to above the 40% range again? I mean, how should we think about this kind of longer term? John S. Quinn: The business has evolved quite a bit from the days when we were enjoying almost 45% margins. So there's a lot of structural things going on in terms of some of the acquisitions we've done. And we've made conscious decisions to adopt paint, for example. The Keystone Automotive acquisition is another example. There is a lower gross margin associated with those businesses. We believe we get those back in terms of better inventory turns or better distribution efficiencies. And by the time we get down to the return on capital, those are still very attractive opportunities for us. The second component is that during a rising commodity environment, you tend to get a little bit of a tailwind and a little bit of a headwind when it's coming down. And if you look at the scrap prices over the course of the last year, so they've actually been drifting down slightly. It could have probably been a little bit headwind to us, not enough to call out on in a particular quarter, other than as I mentioned, Q4 it seems like it's stepping down more dramatically than normal. So I think in terms of those 2 things, you're always going to have the volatility associated with the scrap. But there's some structural things that have changed that are not going to really change dramatically. In terms of the salvage business, that's the third component that I'd always point to. Since the time that business, we've had some compression associated with that with the Manheim Index coming up and more what we're paying for vehicles going up, that remains to be seen. We believe that it's going to come down as we see the cost of cars come down. But when that comes back down, that business is not as large a component of our total company as it was back in the days -- back in, say, 2009 days. So that even if it came back to where the margin it enjoyed before this event, you're not going to see the impact to the total company gross margins. So I think over time, there is some opportunity, as we get bigger to lever some of the procurement opportunities in Europe, for example. I believe there's some more opportunities as we rationalize, for example, Stag-Parkway with the Keystone Automotive operations. There are some opportunities to improve that. But fundamentally, what we pay for vehicles, we're a price taker in terms of the option prices on the salvage business. And we think we're probably already one of the biggest customers of many of our suppliers on the salvage -- on the aftermarket collision side. So there may be some opportunities to improve scale in that. Most of the leverage from the business that comes through the distribution network and through the facility warehouses and the SG&A obviously as we see technology also starting to improve a little bit on that end. John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And that's very helpful. And then one final question, just more of a strategic question. If we think about the North American market and the opportunities for further consolidation for you guys, where is the main focus right now? Are you focusing on heavy truck? Or is it in a different area? Robert L. Wagman: I think it's across all the business, John. Still, there's 6,000 recyclers in the United States. We own roughly 190 locations. So there's great opportunity on the salvage side; heavy truck, absolutely good opportunity; self-serve, we will continue to look at those opportunities as well. But the aftermarket, I would say, pretty well developed. We've got dots on the map pretty much in all of North America. However, we'll continue to look at fully niche businesses, like paint, cooling and that type of stuff. So I believe there's a lot of opportunities left in North America. I always point to Southern California as a great example. We have one dot on a map in our salvage in Santa Fe Springs just outside of L.A. servicing what I believe is probably one of the bigger per capita areas between San Diego and L.A. So a really good opportunity to keep growing all lines of the business. And of course, Europe is still very, very wide open in my mind. We like to say that, roughly after 2 years, we're probably the biggest supplier of mechanical components in Europe in just 2 years. So that is a great opportunity as well. Operator : Our final question will be from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : I was wondering if you could update us on the transition in Europe to the 2-step distribution model. Rob, I think you mentioned that the acquisition in the Netherlands might help that along. And would we be talking just about the Netherlands or into France and other countries as well? Robert L. Wagman: Yes. At this point, Bill, we are talking just the Netherlands. We will look at France. We did add a location in France earlier this year. So we're up to 3 locations in France. But in terms of the Netherlands build-out, with the latest acquisition we did that we just announced in August, we're up to 60 locations. And we think the right number is somewhere between 75 and 80. So we're certainly well on our way to getting that done. Now the work is getting them on synergies and rationalizing the businesses, which we have a team over there doing, working on that regularly. And as we mentioned on the last call, too, Bill, we did pro forma reduction in revenue. We were pleased with the organic growth, a big positive this quarter. Last quarter, it was negative. So we are making our strides there. And I suspect by a couple of quarters, we will have reached our target of 75 to 80. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : And how does that impact the transition from 3-step to 2-step? Robert L. Wagman: Well, that will allow us to virtually cover the entire Netherlands with our 2-step model. So we will basically be done with the Netherlands. Now of course, going after the business will be the next step. I guess, there are no other questions. So thank you, everyone, for your time this morning, and we look forward to speaking with you in February, when we report our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. Thanks, and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Also note that guidance for 2014 is based on current conditions, including acquisitions completed through February 26, 2015, and excludes any impact of restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, gains or losses related to acquisitions or divestitures, including changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, loss on debt extinguishment and any capital spending related to future business acquisitions. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-K in the next few days. And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Wagman. Rob Wagman : Thanks, Joe. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today. All things considered, a reasonable quarter to end the good year. With respect to activities under our control, the Company performed well. Unfortunately, there are items we don\u2019t control and they has negative impact on our financial results. Global revenue reached $1.68 billion in the quarter, an increase of 27.9% as compared to Q4 2013. Net income for the fourth quarter was $80.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.26, which was flat year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.27 for the quarter compared to $0.26 in the prior year, an increase of 3.8%. During the quarter, we experienced significant impacts from deteriorating scrap markets, FX and tax rates. Adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2014 was negative affected by $0.04 as a result of these items. Without them, diluted adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter of 2014 would have increased 15% versus the fourth quarter of 2013. During the quarter, we achieved companywide organic revenue growth and acquisition revenue growth for products and services of 8.7% and 23.9% respectively. I continue to be pleased with the North American organic revenue growth for products and services, which during the quarter grew 6.2% despite facing a seasonably mild December. While we can\u2019t say for certain, having the Christmas holiday in the middle of the week also seen slightly negative to results. European organic growth for the quarter was a robust 13.8%. For full year 2014, revenue reached 6.7 billion in 2014, an increase of 33% as compared to 2013. Net income for the full year was 381.5 million compared with 311.6 million for the prior year, an increase of 22.4%. Importantly, organic revenue growth for products and service for 2014 was 9%, a clear indication of the strength of our company. And total organic revenue growth for the year reflecting the softness of scrap was 7.1%. Our adjusted EPS for all 2014 was $1.27 representing an increase of 19.8% from a $1.06 reported in 2013. Full year 2014 and 2013 diluted earnings per share included charges equal to $0.02 and $0.04 respectively. Resulting from restructuring and acquisition related expenses, loss on debt extinguishment and the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. Including these charges on a diluted basis, our GAAP EPS was $1.25 in 2014 versus $1.02 in 2013. Before I provide an update on our operations, I want to highlight a few factors that affected our Q4 2014 results. While on the last call we warned that scrap prices will be a headwind in Q4, the actual deterioration of prices was worse than expected. During the quarter, scrap prices were down 15% sequentially, an 18% year-over-year taken as a whole for the climb in scrap prices at about $0.02 negative effect on Q4 2014 relative to last year. Secondly, there were negative impacts from the devaluations of the British pound, euro and the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar which fell 2.2%, 8.2% and 7.6% in Q4 2014. Furthermore, this devaluation combined with the decline in scrap sequentially negatively impacted top-line revenue by $37 million. And increase in the effected tax rate car buying shifted earnings to higher tax rate jurisdictions and higher losses from our joint venture at a negative impact on the Q4 results, when combined with the FX impact just noted these items represented an additional $0.02 negative effect of relative to Q4 of 2013. So while adjusted diluted EPS increased by just 4% over the prior year, Q4 EPS would have increased 15% if scrap prices FX rates and the tax rate had remained confident with Q4 of 2013. John will provide further details on these guidance during his comments. And now moving to our operations. During the fourth quarter, we purchased over 74,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is a 5.4% increase over Q4 2013. Our full year 2014 vehicle procurement was approximately 290,000 which is a 3.2% increase over 2013. As we entered 2015, the volume of the auctions is robust and the outlook for supply remains steady. In addition, one benefit of the strengthening dollar is that we are more favorably positioned against our export competitors who are now disadvantaged by the stronger U.S. dollar. We continue to buy what we believe is a better quality vehicle of the auction for the goal driving top-line with higher revenue per vehicle. These trends coupled with inventory already on hand should provide sufficient inventory to grow our recycle parts operation in 2015. In our self-service retail business, during the fourth quarter, we acquired over a 116,000 lower-cost self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 3.4% decrease over Q4 2013. This decrease was intention given a downward trend in scrap prices in a continued pressure on margins, for full year 2014, vehicle procurements approximately 514,000, which was flat over 2013. And lastly on North America throughout 2014, we continue to make significant progress with the intelligent part solution initiative with CCC information services. The revenue in number of purchased orders process through the CCC platform during the quarter grew 90% and 84% respectively year-over-year. Clearly the trend towards sharp adopting this [feature] in the CCC platform continues to gain traction. With this initiative, currently NOI is annualizing over $20 million in revenue less than two years from initial launch. And now turning to our European operations, we continue to be pleased with the performance of euro car parts ability to increase market-share. In Q4, ECP achieved organic revenue growth of 18.2% and for branches open more in 12 months, ECP\u2019s organic growth during the quarter was 10.8%. For full year 2014, ECP achieved organic revenue growth of 20.6% and 12.7% for branches open more in 12 months. We did however experienced some unbudgeted expenses in Q4 for the continued integration cost of Unipart Automotive acquisition and also on the purchase of APX. During the quarter, ECP opened a total of 10 branches, three new ECP branches and seven converted Unipart branches, bringing our network to 189 branch locations. For the full year, ECP opened 44 branches which included 19 for Unipart locations. With some impressive track record, the ECP\u2019s management\u2019s team effectively open, grow and gain market-share, I am pleased to announce that we have improved an additional 13 new ECP branches for 2015. And finally on ECP, during the quarter we continue to win the strong double-digit year-over-year growth of nearly 24% of our closing part sales and full year 2014 growth of over 35%.  Turning to our Sator business; during the quarter, Sator started to win us some gross margin benefit from the shift in network from a three step to a two step mall. With targeted acquisitions in the pipeline and its innovative partner strategy Sator\u2019s national footprint will be completed in 2015. This step-shift also positions Sator to enter the collision market in Benelux 2015 as well. We are confident that the carrier relationships we\u2019re developing in UK will assist the launch of Sator\u2019s collision efforts given seven of the top 10 carriers in UK right insurance in their markets. Sator posted 2.6% organic growth in Q4. Now onto the specialty segment, our specialty segment continued strong performance by posting year-over-year growth of 35.4% in the quarter including the benefit of Stag Parkway the distributor we acquired in October. Full year organic growth for our specialty segment was 12% against pre-acquisition results. In 2014, Keystone\u2019s management team made tremendous progress on synergy and cost savings initiatives by closing and relocating 12 of their cross docks and adding 26 new cross dock into existing LKQ locations. Keystone also opened a new 231,000 square foot distribution center in Dallas. The Keystone team continue to deliver on synergy initiatives with the previously announced Stag-Parkway holding company and acquisition. During the quarter, four of the 13 Stag-Parkway locations we finalized the transaction on October 3rd were closed and relocated into existing Keystone locations. Now moving on to corporate development. In addition to Stag-Parkway, the company made two additional acquisitions during the quarter including a specialty aftermarket distributor with locations in Ohio and Pennsylvania and a salvage business with locations in Sweden and Norway. Our acquisition of the European salvage business demonstrates our commitment to replicating the success of our collision model in Europe and to actively grow the use of alternative collision parts beyond North America. Our traction to this market was heightened by the company\u2019s strong insurance relationships allowing us to test of our North American APU business model. Our Swedish insurance partners are enthusiastic about our entry into this market and we are in active discussions with them regarding enhanced programs and services. I am proud of our development efforts and what our team was able to accomplish in 2014 with the completion of 23 acquisitions. As we head to 2015 I am confident of their ability to identify additional acquisition candidates across our operating segments. At this time, I\u2019d like to ask John Quinn to provide some more detail on the financial results for the quarter and full year. John Quinn : Thank you, Rob. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Revenue for Q4 2014 was $1.7 billion, an increase of $367 million or 28% over the $1.3 billion we achieved in Q4 2013. Net income in Q4 2014 of $80.5 million was 3.3% higher than Q4 2013. Obviously we expected better pull through of the top line growth to the bottom line as opposed to the net income margin compression we saw. As Rob said, some of the drivers of the lower margin are outside of our control but we are taking actions in an attempt to mitigate them. Before I get into the details on the high level as I characterize the quarter\u2019s results is having the strong top line and organic growth set by a difficult scrap and foreign exchange environment. Also the relative performance of Europe caused our tax rate to increase. As I will discuss in a moment the scrap and foreign exchange issues continue through Q1, but we believe we\u2019ll eventually stabilize and at least in the case of scrap possibly improve over time. We also believe the European operations will improve over time helping not only our pretax income but also our tax rate. The revenue growth breakdown as follows, for Q4 our total organic revenue growth was 7.1% and we delivered an additional growth of 22.2% from acquisitions, the foreign exchange being negative 1.4%. Organic growth in products and services was 8.7% and within that we saw our North American operations grow organically 6.2% while the European segment to 13.8%. North American organic growth of 6.2% was 30 basis higher than that reported in Q4 2013. There are no definitive statistics available but our sense is that while the weather in Q4 2014 was not as favorable to us as in Q4 2013 we may be starting to see the benefit of higher miles driven and higher new car sales starting to come into our sweet spot for alternative parts demand. October and November 2014 miles driven averaged 2% year-over-year increase one of the stronger rates we\u2019ve seen recently. New car sales in the U.S. reached 16.5 million light vehicles their highest level since 2006 it will take a few years before those cars fall in the age group for peak demand for alternative parts so we believe its clear evidence that the dynamics of the cars in use are moving in favor of LKQ. During the quarter, our European segment reported 13.8% organic growth with ECP continuing to show strong organic growth by achieving 18.2% in quarter. Sator reported organic revenue growth of 2.6% which was 50 basis points higher than our Q3 2014 results. We continue to execute on our plant and converting another one\u2019s distribution to a two step model. Given the potential for channel conflict as we execute the strategy, we\u2019re pleased that Sator continues to show positive organic growth. Acquisitions completed during 2014 contributed $292 million of Q4 revenue on a reported basis including $38 million from acquisitions completed in Q4 2014. The annualized revenues from acquisitions completed in Q4 2014 was approximately $225 million, or roughly $56 million per quarter, I remind listeners that the annualized revenue acquired includes Stag-Parkway acquisition completed in the October. And during our Q3 2014 call we indicated that Stag Parkway had an annual revenue of approximately 180 million which is included in the 225 million figure I just mentioned. Total change in other revenue which where we recorded our scrap commodity sales is marginally positive at 2.9%. Acquisitions contributed 8.4% positive growth and we had negative 5.3% organic growth. Volume increases were more than offset by falling commodity prices as scrap pricing was about 18% lower year-over-year.  Average price we received for scraps deal of a $197 per ton this year as compared to $241 per ton in 2013. Other revenue was 9% of our total revenue as compared to 11.1% for the same period last year continuing the trend of declining relative important of this revenue to our overall results although that I will discuss in the moment the commodity price swings can still impact our short-term earnings.  In Q4 2014, revenue for our self-serve business was $97 million or 5.7% of LKQ\u2019s total revenue. As scrap prices have fallen and our other lines of businesses are growing this business is become less material to the overall company. Approximately 35% of this revenue was part sales included in North American parts and services revenue and 65% scrap and core sales included in other revenue.  Our reported gross margin for Q4 2014 was $665 million or 39.5% of revenue. Decline of 200 basis points from our gross margin percentage of 41.4% from Q4 2013. There is a 130 basis points decline attributable to the specialty segment and other small acquisitions. North American margins contributed about 30 basis points of the decline mainly due to the scrap price falls. European margin attributed approximately 20 basis points of decline as we saw heavier discount in ECP. Mix contributed about 20 basis points of the decline. We have taken actions and ECP to reverse the decline we saw in Q4 and believe will be begin to see positive results in Q1 2015. Moving to our operating expenses, some of these comparisons are being affected by our specialty segment. In the specialty line of business gross margins tend to be lower but they incur relatively lower facility and SG&A cost. January 2015 was the anniversary of the Keystone Automotive acquisition that stay we continue to have some influence on these margins year-over-year through October 2015.  Facility and warehouse costs were 8.2% of revenue in Q4 2014, a 40 basis points improvement over 8.6% in Q4 last year. This improvement was primarily due to the specialty segment. Distribution cost increased slightly from 8.5% of revenue in Q4 2013 to 8.6% this quarter. This change is mainly attributable to higher cost in Europe which was associated with the ECP new branch openings and some start-up cost we incurred with the former Unipart branch locations and relatively higher distribution cost that bringing a two step model in the Midland.  Selling and G&A expenses decreased from 12.2% of revenue in Q4 last year to 11.8% in Q4 this year, an improvement of 40 basis points. The specialty segment accounts for 40 basis points of the improvement that 30 basis points of that was offset by the Netherlands acquisitions and increased cost at ECP. Excluding the acquisitions we saw North American leverage generated a 30 basis points improvement in this line.  During Q4 2014 we recorded $2 million of restructuring and acquisition related expenses down from $2.8 million in Q4 last year. The 2014 costs are primarily related to the integration of our specialty in Netherlands acquisition.  Depreciation and amortization was 2% of revenue during Q4 this year as compared to 1.8% of revenue in Q4 2013. Although a small percentage of revenue that these costs have been rising faster than our revenue. The increase year-over-year of $10.5 million equates to roughly $0.02 EPS impact in Q4 2014. But half of this increase was due to a larger asset base and fixed assets. The balance relates to the non-cash amortization of intangibles such as customer relationships associated with acquisitions.  I point this out simply because these costs are function of our acquisition activity and if we stop our acquisition activity this cost would actually fall overtime. We don\u2019t intend to stop our acquisition strategy but as we do large deals the accounting conventions were acquired are recognizing these cost and that could impact our operating margin for these non-cash charges. Other expenses net increased to $16.5 million in the three months ended December 2014, compared to $15.2 million for the same period last year an increase of $1.3 million. The main reason for the change was the net interest expense which is $1.3 million higher with $2.5 million attributable to higher debt levels partially offset by $1.2 million reduction from lower interest rates. Our effective borrowing rate for the quarter was 3.3%.  Our year-to- date effective tax rate is 34.7% as compared to 34.5% in the prior year. In Q4 2014, our effective tax rate was 37.3% versus 34.3% in Q4 last year. Our tax rate is a blend of the rates of the countries in which we operate it will proportionately earn less in lower tax offshore locations our tax rate increases. The income from our foreign businesses was negative to both our expectations and our tax rate due to foreign exchange in relative operating performance. On a reported basis diluted earnings per share was $0.26 in Q4 2014, flat to the $0.26 Q4 2013. Adjusting for the restructuring acquisition related expenses and consideration adjustments EPS would have been about a $0.01 higher this year. On an adjusted basis Q4 2014 would have been $0.27 as compared to $0.26 last year, an improvement of 4%. Rob spoke to scrap impacting us approximately $0.02 negatively and foreign exchange joint venture in tax causing further $0.02 loss. Before I move to the balance sheet, I just reference the segment revenue in EBITDA disclosures in our press release. In the fourth quarter 2014, North American revenue grew year-over-year from $937 million to $1 billion and we saw EBITDA increase from $123 million to $129 million. The scrap impacts were entirely related to the segment and about those impacts we would have seen EBITDA improvements more proportionate to the revenue growth. The European segment saw year-over-year revenue growth from $379 million to $465 million, an increase of $86 million; EBITDA was $38 million was flat year-over-year. This segment was impacted by foreign currency deteriorations we expect the better EBITDA growth more in line with the revenue growth. We attribute the flat EBITDA to the lower margin ECP in higher cost associated with the acquisitions and Unipart locations we acquired. The cost structure at Sator is also higher than we expected to be once the conversion to a two set model is complete and the acquisitions are fully integrated. The specialty segments are revenue of $210 million and EBITDA of $15 million in Q4 2014 we did not have a comparable segment in 2015. As previously discussed the specialty segment is seasonal and Q4 tends to be a lower performing quarter. The seasonality is evident when comparing Q4 to the full year EBITDA of $79 million. Stag Parkway contributed very little EBITDA in Q4, so the $79 million compares favorably to be approximately $450 million we paid for the Keystone Automotive acquisition with the first year multiple to 5.7 times. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $371 million for the year 2014 as compared to $428 million in 2013. Net income and depreciation were favorable to cash flow by $70 million and $39 million respectively, growth in the accounts receivable was an incremental $17 million use of cash as we continue to grow with revenue organically. Similarly, inventory was an incremental use of cash of $53 million as we invest in inventory for the expanded business. We had been concerned about the recently threatened port strikes on the West Coast and we build some additional inventories as risk mitigation measure. The timing to cash tax is result in a higher outsource front in 2014 to 2013 of $32 million. Changes in accounts payable and other operating assets was a net source of cash of $13 million in 2014, as compared to the source of cash of $76 million in 2013. The timing of accounts payable this disbursements and higher interest and bonus payments been the primary driver the relatively lower contribution of these items. Capital spending is a 141 million in 2014 and in 2014 we spend $776 million in cash and acquisitions the largest being specialty which accounted for $427 million of the total. We closed 2014 with $1.9 billion in debt and cash and cash equivalents were $115 million, availability in our credit facility was approximately $1.1 billion and with the cash total liquidity was approximately $1.2 billion, so we have the capacity to pursue additional acquisitions if suitable opportunities are arose. And now turning to guidance. The 2015 annual guidance cost for net income between $420 million and $460 million that equates to earnings per share of $1.36 to $1.46. Our guidance for 2015 for organic revenue growth from parking services is 6.5% to 9% and our guidance for capital expenditures is $150 million to $180 million cash flow from operations for approximately $450 million. We don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, but I want to give you some insight into what we\u2019re seeing so far this year. Starting with foreign exchange, the U.S. dollar has strengthened appreciably against the pound, euro and Canadian dollar compared to last year\u2019s averages. As earlier this week compared to last year\u2019s averages, these currencies will respectively 6.2%, 14.7% and 12.2% Lower compared to the average over last year we believe that currencies represent approximately $0.04 to $0.05 headwind at current rates. Obviously we don\u2019t know where these trends would lead. Scrap steel has also weakened since Q4 I mentioned that our Q4 average scrap sales were $197 per ton. Our report for this business last week shows that we\u2019re achieving only $130 per ton. At this time we don\u2019t know where the floor is on these prices or when the recovery will start as we\u2019ve discussed many times in price aggressively manage the cost of our vehicles lower but we incur lower than expected income as we sell the cars acquired last quarter when prices were higher. Q1 will be impacted by this phenomena and expect that to carry into Q2. We estimate that this will be a negative impact of approximately $0.05 to $0.06 over the year. In 2008 we saw large drop in commodity prices. This situation this time is different and the decline in the prices to-date has not been severe and as we\u2019ve been discussing in past calls the total portion of revenue impacted is a much smaller percent of our total revenue. So while we\u2019re not immune to these changes, we believe that we can adjust our buying to account for them and once we see stability or perhaps seen a reversal of prices, we\u2019ll see the kind of recovery that we saw in 2009 and 2010. I mentioned the performance of the European segment in Q4 relative to the prior year in our expectations we believe that we\u2019ll see improvements in that segment in relatively short order. We\u2019ve charged our European team to take active steps to focus on gross margin improvement for simultaneously improving their cost structure. We continue to anticipate improvements in Sator as we build out our footprint in Netherlands. If the European operations improves at a faster rate than the U.S. operations, we\u2019ll also see our tax rate improves. Finally, turning to what we see in the broader economic market. We continue to believe that our margins in North America are going to benefit from the larger number of later model cars entering our space. The European markets despite the currency issues appear to be pulling out their proactive slow growth model. Lower fuel cost and higher employment figures should lead to more miles driven. So we need to through the challenges at lower scrap pricing and the stronger dollar crate ultimately we see the markets moving in our favor for next few years. With that I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Rob before we open to questions. Rob Wagman : Thanks John. To summarize we faced significant headwinds in the fourth quarter many of which were outside of our control. Yet despite these challenges we delivered solid results in 2014. Looking ahead in North America the recent upswing in miles driven, lower gas prices and increased new car sale should provide a nice tailwind to our collision business. In addition the recent inclement weather in North America could provide some momentum as we enter the second quarter. For our aftermarket parts business, we continue to see improvement in our full SKU offering as well as our certified parts offering both growing 6% and 18.6% respectively. In UK, new car registrations reached a level not seen since 2005 which we believe boards well for ECP\u2019s mechanical parts business and their growing alternative collision parts business. Also with UK insurance premiums down 13% since 2012 we continue to believe that the value proposition of alternative collision parts is attractive to carriers trying to mirage cost. Also we continue to be pleased with the performance of our specialty segment and the timing of our entry into the large and highly fragmented market. In 2013 the specialty equipment market produced the highest growth rate since the recent recession posting a 7% gain and pushing the overall market to over 33 billion. These dynamics coupled with the projected increase in SAR over the next four years positions us well for 2015 and beyond within this segment. In closing I am proud of hard work and dedication our 29,000 plus employees delivered for the company, our stockholders and most importantly our customers in 2014. I am equally proud of our team\u2019s commitment to effectively manage the dynamics of our business that they can control while not losing focus on growing the business, developing our people and continuously looking for opportunities to generate leverage and synergies from our existing and recently acquired operations. Finally, as you probably saw in our second press release John Quinn has been appointed to head our European operations. I want to thank John for his five years of service as our CFO. Our commitment to Europe requires strong leadership. John has extensive knowledge of European business market having held key positions there in previous company. He is ideal person to take our European operations for the next level. Also, I want to welcome Nick Zarcone as our new CFO. Nick has extensive CFO experience and a great knowledge of our company. He was the key person at our lead underwriter Baird during our IPO in 2003 follow on offerings in 2005 and 2007 and has advised on several of our strategic initiatives over the years. We are fortunate to have him join our team. And Devon with that we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann, William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Nate Brochmann : Hey, wanted to talk a little bit. I get all the noise certainly created by scrap and FX and the tax rate, and thank you for explaining that very well. There still seems to be an ounce of a gap in terms of guidance. I get the fact that there's some lingering issues in the fourth quarter in terms of cost with Europe and some margin things here and there. But in terms of guidance, you talked about the expectations that those things would get better, but there still seems to be a little bit of a gap between where expectations were, even adjusting for scrap and FX and kind of where guidance is. Some of that seems to be a little bit of a gap in terms of operational, some of that, again, still might be some gross margin. Some of that may be higher cost with Europe, and just getting the platform established in 2015. Wondering if you could go through a little bit more in detail where the perception on the gap might be? John Quinn : Just I guess the way that we look at where came out with guidance if you look at the fundamentals of the company and there was Q4 underperformed a bit in terms of European operations obviously that drove the tax rate little bit higher and there is a pickup year-to-date increase in the tax rate we have the pickup in Q4. We also have some increases in the amortization on some of the intangibles. So if take that component then roll it forward say we have a $1.27 on adjusted basis in 2014. If you drove that in any kind of reasonable rate probably be in the $1.45 to $1.50 range, we then see about a $0.10 headwind within this scrap and the FX impact. And that\u2019s kind of where we ended up on the guidance.  Keep in mind we don\u2019t have a lot of big acquisitions in these numbers, back if you look in 2011 maybe you see peak coming into 2012 we had the benefit of Keystone Automotive last year. The fundamentals of the business, I think are quite strong. We do have this scrap which is we view is been a temporary headwind, I don\u2019t know when FX is going to turn or if it ever does, but there are some things we are obviously doing and trying to improve those things as well. Not all the currencies moved in the same direction at the same time and if that does a little bit of an opportunity for arbitress and some of the procurement as we look in that so if you can mitigate or mitigating some of these impacts. The FX is not just and we have to accept that there are some things we can do to move cost around from different currencies. Nate Brochmann : Okay, that's fair. I know that obviously you guys been very successful with your strategy in terms of buying acquisitions and the putting them into the business. Clearly, the top-line revenue remains fairly impressive, and certainly within expectations. Again, I'm sure that the answer will be no, we're not going to change what we're doing. Again, I wouldn't expect necessarily you to as you've been successful with that. But at some point you wonder, with the stock price bring down here, whether you might look for shareholder returns that could be a little bit better, whether that's buying back stock, or whether that's kind of laying off anything very large. I know timing's always unpredictable. I know that if you go back to the couple years post-Keystone one, you showed some impressive margin improvement, whether there would be an opportunity to be able to do that and kind of enhance the quality of the earnings and overall shareholder value, or whether that's just really not in the cards and there's just so much opportunity that, that's really still the foremost thing to ultimately create shareholder value. Rob Wagman : I am going to just touch a little bit on the acquisition front and then let Rob to address your second question which was shareholder and buybacks or something. In terms of the acquisition strategy I called out specifically the Keystone Automotive acquisition we did last year which we paid about roughly $450 million for that acquisition. We got some good synergies out of it and it looks like last year first year multiples are around 5.7 times. I still believe that what interest rates where they are, our credit facility allows us to borrow that\u2019s good opportunity create shareholder value of multiple. One-third business get go into relatively low capital intensity business, and lot of additional CapEx required becomes very attractive distribution business from our perspective. To the extend we can identify additional opportunities like that actually that is the best use of the capital. in terms of just on comment in terms of some other foreign exchange issues that we have, it does impact the income when we buy assets in foreign countries be it Canada or Europe then we try to match that with a foreign currency hedge in so much as we try to borrow as much of the currency in the foreign currency we can. So underlying the foreign currency cash flows coming in with the foreign currency debt. So although we end up with volatility in the income statement and we know we understand that\u2019s important. The underlying economics we do create hedge on the asset itself. Do you want to comment on the others? John Quinn : I will comment on the stock buyback, it\u2019s something that we consider every quarter, we meet with our Board and we discuss that and honestly to your point as of today, we just believe there are other opportunities that issues of our capital it's not to say that it wouldn\u2019t change at some point but it's the topic that we discuss regularly with our Board and as we stated our plan right now was to continue the path we\u2019re on. Acquisition as you said are sticky, they come and go and could have big yield come on play tomorrow absolutely it could and if we didn\u2019t have a good balance sheet which we\u2019re and the great position to do. So, our liquidity is great at this time, I think we\u2019re going to continue with the strategy of trying to build up a network. We think there is first move advantages in many markets and those opportunities are something that we just kept as up at this point. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Craig Kennison : Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start with Europe and the European margins. Clearly, they have been under significant pressure in the last year and there are some outside factors. I'm asking, are you getting the synergy you expect to get out of that business? And then maybe, Rob, you could cover the two to three year margin outlook for that business. John, maybe you can talk about your priorities as you move into a leadership role there. Rob Wagman : Let me just talk about the ECP gross margin first Craig, for Q4 after the Unipart bankruptcy basically, there was a grab for a lot of the business and it got quite competitive in the marketplace. So that is behind us now, we certainly think things are starting now to settle down in terms of that. We have put in pricing programs not only for single customers, but also for our national accounts. We are now truly the only national player for all of UK, there are other competitors that can team up together, but we\u2019re the only true single company that can do that. So, we do a special margin expansion there as well. We constantly are working on our front cost initiative with vendors and we\u2019re going to start seeing some progress there as well. Just a little bit of a drag on ECP\u2019s margins, gross margins was -- that win Unipart going down we did pick up some more national accounts which are obviously slightly dilutive to your overall margins. But I think we\u2019re going to start to see some nice turns in the margins of ECP certainly through January, February very pleased with that. As far as Sator goes in the margin year, we are still building hope the three step and two step model, we have 64 locations now I report in the last quarter that we wanted to have about 80, we\u2019ll have that done by 2015 and at that point we\u2019ll get the significant synergies. In terms of your second questions, are we seeing the synergies, we probably are going to see. We\u2019re about 80% done with the purchasing synergies between Sator and ECP is just 20% more to go and I think that will continue to comment we continue to grow mass and size on being able to leverage that with our vendors. John as far as\u2026. John Quinn : First, we believe we have a great set of management teams both in the Netherlands and in the UK, so this is not my new role s not change things there is really a focus of making through the integration between those goes a little bit better in terms of things like cataloging and some of the non-procurement related synergies and some of those other back office we can do a little bit better. And then I\u2019ll be focusing on the integration trying to reduce the cost structure over there and improve the value proposition to the customer in terms of some of the ecommerce things that we could do, we have a decent ECP ecommerce strategy we like to bring that to the year. And then looking for additional acquisition both in terms of things that we can adjacencies where we can tuck and things, so as a example we did the paint deals in UK, we don\u2019t distribute paint to the Netherlands that\u2019s collision we don\u2019t do in the Netherlands. So once we get our footprint build out in the Netherlands will be looking to further our adjacencies. And then additional markets, we\u2019ve talk many times here large car park, large in the U.S. and then you define it and we think that, that is a good opportunity. Rob talked about the first-mover advantages. We do also have a couple of large projects going on there ECP is building a new warehouse necessarily large project. So we just going to be focusing on making sure we\u2019ve got execution on that front. Craig Kennison : That's really helpful. So when we look at European EBITDA margins, I think you finished the year with a quarter of 8.2% EBITDA margin. For the full year, it was probably closer to 9%, down from maybe approximately 11% last year. What is the right outlook? Can that business get back to double-digit EBITDA margins within the next two, three years? John Quinn : I believe it can, we\u2019re carrying a lot of cost there associated with the start-ups with the Unipart branches that we took over that they are not generating as much revenue in Q4 and we\u2019re still carrying the fair amount of duplicate cost in terms of some of the infrastructure is around the Sator acquisitions. As we expanded the collision business, you know we opened additional warehousing space in the UK which is causing additional distribution cost, I mentioned a moment ago the project rationalize that\u2019s probably a 2017, 2018 project whether that actually it's a large we have to start it now. So eventually those things will bring down our average cost from the distribution front and some of I think talked about in terms of rationalize in the cataloging and some of those other expenses, we believe there is opportunity there. Yes, we definitely targeting to get back to double-digit. Rob Wagman : I\u2019ll answer that Craig, in 2012, after we did the aggressive branch opening at ECP we did 42 in 2012 we took the first half of 2013 on but we saw margin expansions. We\u2019re 189 now we\u2019ve always said the right number of somewhere between 200 and 225. I believe in two to three years you will see that margin expansions will be done with that build out and you will starting to see those margin expansion like we did in 2013. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please proceed with your question. James Albertine : Great, thanks for taking the question. Let me just thank John for his years of service. Wish him the best of luck in his new role and welcome, Nick, to the team here at the outset. Lots of moving pieces, Rob, as you said, some of which are out of your control. Just a quick history lesson. Has there ever been a period of sustained scrap pressures while wholesale pricing, at least the Manheim index, moves higher? It seems like those, generally if they move down together and move up together. Do you recall a period where you've ever gone through what we're seeing today? Rob Wagman : We did go through it in a way Jamie I believe Manheim actually came down in \u201908 but we\u2019re seeing Manheim go up but scrap actually imploded in 2008 so just in a way now though is our weight was very sudden the scrap went from about $325 a ton as I recall down to very, very low numbers. This has been more gradual and actually \u201908 from our perspective was better because it went down so quickly it drilled down the cost of our salvage so much. It is interesting when I look at what we\u2019re paying in auction. In Q4, we paid $1990 on average sequentially it was down $48 in Q3 so we\u2019re starting to see the scrap impact at the auctions. Because Manheim went up, you would think that our prices were gone so we believe that the decrease in the car cost of $48 was related to the scrap. So the problem is, we see a gradual drop but we did see this in \u201908, \u201909 and \u201910 were good years for us as scrap recovered. One or two things was going to happen here either scrap will recover and that will be obviously a good thing or scrap will continue to be low and then we can adjust our buying appropriately which is one of the things that John mentioned one of the things we\u2019re actively doing we\u2019re driving down our cost on the acquisition side. So you will start to see that margin improve as that scrap stabilizes. James Albertine : Got it. Very helpful. As relates to your guidance for organic growth, first of all, looking back it FY14, 9% looks quite strong. Just kind of stuck out with me that the range of 6.5 % to 9% seems fairly wide. What are the key swing factors that you are seeing there or anticipating? Particularly in light of what John mentioned around the sweet spot. Starting see the early stages of the benefits from SARs -- the SAR recovery, if you will. Rob Wagman : The wide range is a couple of factors obviously winter we think we\u2019re having a good winter obviously and we started about the quarter so far I am sure someone to ask that anyway on January we were on plan for our numbers, February has been a interesting month because there was such weather inclement weather we had obviously major shutdowns in Boston and I understand Atlanta was shutdown yesterday by the governor. So February is going to be interesting months because of the inclement weather we certain do believe it\u2019s going to be a snapback whether it\u2019d be in March or April in the Q2 most likely due to it\u2019s going to be likely have a snapback on all those cars getting into the repair shops. We are up against a huge comp in Q1 though. As you will recall last winter was really strong winter in terms of being very snowy very icy for the entire Untied States actually Atlanta had two ice clumps last year so we\u2019re up against the top comp but we certainly believe this weather has been good to us. And in terms of our European organic growth ECP continue to built out so there are more opportunities there. As we get Sator through that three sub to two sub again which we\u2019ve completed this year I think we\u2019ll start to see some running there on the organic growth rate. So I think it\u2019s some good things there are some headwinds of course in terms of just the core in back of the collision losses and where they are going to be in the spring and fall but we\u2019re pretty bullish actually on our organic growth. James Albertine : Again, very helpful. If I could sneak one more in, as it relates to your leverage ratio, just getting a kind of a sense of where you ended up at the end of FY14 and really with an eye toward your comments around the interest rate environment being favorable. There's some deals you can't pass up. Have you adjusted your max ratio, the most leverage that you could take on and still feel comfortable running the business day to day? Thanks. John Quinn : I think we really adjusted it in the -- if you look at just on the reported EBITDA basis I think we\u2019re around 2.4 times if you adjust for the main covenant where we get credit for acquisitions we did late in the year and so forward and we\u2019re closer to 2 times leverage. So leverage right now is very modest I would say and reasonable. And we haven\u2019t changed if you just model during a very large acquisitions a $1 billion acquisition intent we had a reasonable multiple however did go up around 3 times. We\u2019re still very comfortable with that. Historically we\u2019ve had taken the leverage higher and one time back 2007 we ended up to about 4.8 times after the Keystone Automotive. I don\u2019t see us that high but just because of the math it would be very difficult to do that. So it\u2019s good opportunity in terms of we have take no leverage up before if we start doing acquisitions, the Company generates a lot of cash flow. Somebody just handed me a note. I think I misspoke. Our cash flow guidance, I think said $450 million approximately. It should be $425 million approximately, according to Press Release. So the company would deliver fairly quickly if we would ever stop doing acquisitions and as I said earlier if we can sign good accretive deals we are continue to try to do that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Lawrence with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Ben Bienvenu : It's actually Ben Bienvenu on for John. I wanted to talk about the ECP branch growth anticipated for next year, the 13 units. Do any of those include Unipart sites? And then as you look at your longer-term opportunity for ECP branches, as market dynamics change and as you learn more data about the customer set in that market, is there are opportunity for that to move up? Or do you think we're fairly zeroed in on what the opportunity is? Rob Wagman : The new branches do consume Unipart conversions, it\u2019s a tricky question because some of those branches move. We are taking one branch ECP brand and UA branch and bringing them together. So overall though it\u2019s a combination of both new branches and combined branches as well. Ben Bienvenu : In the question on the longer-term opportunity, do you feel like you've zeroed in on that or is there an opportunity for that to move? Rob Wagman : I think in terms of the once we get the branch builder we are going to continue to expand the commission business in UK. We got the pretty much coverage in terms of country in terms of paint but the penetration of commission part is still relatively low when you compare the UK to the U.S. We believe there is a penetration of alternative parts is probably still maybe little bit under 10% versus 36% 37% in North America. So there is a quite a bit of opportunity for expansion on the commission business as well. And then just looking at other penetration as I mentioned the e-commerce business is been growing fairly well which is getting that a retail customer more than traditional mechanical repaired market. John Quinn : Just one other thing I would add to that for the UK down the road. I did mention on the call that we entered Swedish salvage market this is still an opportunity we are looking at. So that\u2019s an opportunity as all remanufactured. We have a remanufactured base here in the United States and we are looking to bring that into the UK as well as the continent as well. So that\u2019s could be an opportunity for us. You will see us move on that within the next year or so. Ben Bienvenu : That's very helpful color, thanks. The second question, just related to State Farm, I assumed if there was any meaningful change in the activity there we would have heard something. I'd just like to get an update on what you are seeing there on terms of their buying of alternative parts. Rob Wagman : They continue to by our chrome bumpers the one that they did allow about year-ago. Our chrome bumper sales were up 22.3% for us. So they will continue to buy those products and we are cautiously optimistic that and we know they are happy with the results they told us that, we are cautiously optimistic that they actually turn up more and more parks. So nothing new update other than the fact that they continue to our chrome bumpers at a very healthy rate. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Stember with Sidoti & Company. Please proceed with your question. Scott Stember : Could you talk about how fuel costs, assuming they stay as low as they are right now, how that will impact margin as regards to your distribution set? John Quinn : John speaking, we did see a little bit of benefit in Q2 -- excuse me in Q4. We have our annual spend is about $90 million on fuel and that will be offset to some of these other negatives that we have been talking about and really in 2015. Scott Stember : Okay. Rob, you mentioned the West Coast ports earlier. Could you maybe talk about what you have been doing and what you plan to do? Are you diverting parts shipments to other ports throughout the country? Rob Wagman : We did do that Scott, the good news is that they have resolved and they are I believe the union has approved it. That was the one thing that was left outstanding but they have come to a settlement there is a backlog at the ports we are in very good shape actually. Our purchasing department done a phenomenal job of diverting cans from West Coast to the East Coast to north ports to other ports as well. So we are in good shape, we think it\u2019s going to be a month or two before that backlog comes out. As John mentioned in his prepared remarks we did move some of that buying in the Q4, we did see this coming. So actually we are in great shape our fuel rate. No major concerns there at all. Scott Stember : And last, just touching base on the commentary you made about the collision parts, potentially selling them in Sweden. Could you talk about penetration within the core European markets, such as where Sator is right now? Rob Wagman : The rents are just about identical, although interesting about last quarter we reported that UK alternate part rates are now up 9%, when we got into business at 7. We believe the economy is more on a 7 right now and we think there is an opportunity as I mentioned in my remarks that right there in programs with us in UK are ready on continent as well. So there should be a great opportunity all the way for us as far as to get that three step to two step model done, so we can get everybody on the same page, get our synergies and bring those products in. So, hopefully we\u2019ll start seeing some parts moving in the side of the business by the end of this year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Bret Jordan : Just a little bit more color on the ECP margin issues, and I guess trying to understand was there brief price war that has since ended? I guess you are talking about seeing some recovery there. I'm just trying to understand what did impact the traditional auto parts market? Rob Wagman : Yes, there absolutely was what I\u2019ll call ramp grab to that business, I think quite competitive it was also another entry into the marketplace that we have since acquired quite frankly APX Autopart. So it did quite aggressive for little bit, those days are behind us now and that we had in January and February margins of come out nicely in the UK business. Bret Jordan : What\u2019s your market share, do you think, in traditional parts through ECP? Rob Wagman : Is very difficult to say it include the dealers, other -- dealers are still very important part of distribution network. We do include the dealers generally speaking Bret because they are selling parts as well of course into their maintenance sort of market. When you throw them in their it's in the 20% range, 20% to 25% range. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then a question on alternative parts penetration in North America. I think John might have thrown a number out there, but what's your feeling for 2014 ending? Was it the use of 36 or 37? John Quinn : It's going to be in that number for sure. One of the downsides of course the strong rate is the fact almost gets -- almost all they get OEM parts when they are [random moving parts] when they are new parallel. So, when those parts walk their way through to two, three, four years old out, we do expect that to take back up again, but it will mean the 36, 37 range again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Bill Armstrong : My question also is on the potential pricing pressure. You discussed the UK. Any other pressure in the parts and service in North America or perhaps on the Continent, either from competitive pricing or from any softening in demand? Rob Wagman : I\u2019ll talk about the buying environment, as I mentioned though the stronger dollar is, I think on acute some of the exporters on the marketplace here, so I think we\u2019ll be able to buy little bit better on salvage. We\u2019ve seen though price pressure on the aftermarket side of the business both on the buy and sell. So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see any pressure on either sides of presence is here. Bill Armstrong : Did I hear you say before that Sator will have higher costs as you migrate to a two-step model from a three-step? If I got that right, why -- what sort of costs would increase? Why would that happen? John Quinn : So, and there if you think on the traditional three step model we buy the product we ship it out one to date our customers and typically in large loads with on semi-trucks, when you go to a two step distribution model we\u2019re still starting those same locations, but then we have the additional distribution accounts to take it to that final model as you will to smaller van to deliver with half hour, one hour service. So you got all those additional distribution cost. What you should be able to pick up is the margin, the gross margin from that distributor gets added to our gross margin so to speak you can met them obviously, but you do pick up the two margins instead of the one. So ultimately we believe the overall EBITDA margin when you take out all the cost individual customers should be better than operating independently. But in terms of the SG&A and in terms of the distribution cost it doesn\u2019t go up slightly when you go into a two step distribution model versus a three step -- if you use the three step ever, does that make sense? Bill Armstrong : Yes, that completely makes sense. And just one last quick question. What sort of income tax rate are you baking into your guidance for the new year? John Quinn : Some are between 34.5 and 35 given their size that can drive the $0.02 other way, it really going to depend on the mix, we don\u2019t anticipating the changes I the taxes, the rates in the individual countries and as I mentioned in Q4 the income shifted for the full year more to the U.S. and way from some of the lower tax jurisdiction including the UK and the Netherlands and so is really you going to come down where the mix comes out. Rob Wagman : To your earlier question about the margins in the U.S. and I just want to comment on some of just macro trends we\u2019re seeing here, why, I think the margins won\u2019t be get too much pressures because some of the tailwinds we\u2019re seeing in the businesses likely to be strong. We got some of these but gas price is coming down and miles driving is increasing, unemployment is coming down, so see more people go to work and be it on the roads. Sator remain strong, which is really great for our KAO business. So it's interesting with the new car we got this information from CCC with the new strong rate total losses are actually flat now because there are much higher dollar cars coming to the repair process. So, we think the repair market is going to get a nice shot in the arm here. It\u2019s pretty interesting they also pulled us repair costs are trending up 3.4% again also likely because of the newer car part which again bodes well for us because insurance companies are looking to drive the cost out. The other stack that CCC gave us which was really shocking to me is the 0.4 more parts per estimate being used in 2014 versus 2013 based on 19 million repairable so that\u2019s roughly 7 million new parts coming on to estimates that weren\u2019t there a year ago so that\u2019s also impressive. The other thing that they told us which really caught me off guard quite frankly in 2009 39% of estimates had at least one aftermarket part on it in 2014 15% of estimates had at least one aftermarket part on it. So aftermarket continues to gain market share so I really think all those considered we\u2019re in really good shape for the growth for the business and the core business remains strong and scrap deals and it will heal itself there is no doubt in my mind and FX will eventually the foreign exchange rates will settle down at some point I think we\u2019re going to be in good shape. Rob Wagman : I think that\u2019s it. So I want to thank everyone for the time this morning. And look forward to speak to you in April for our first quarter results. Thanks everybody. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joe Boutross, Director of Investor Relations for LKQ Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Boutross, you may begin. Joseph P. Boutross: Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we released our first quarter 2015 financial results. In the room with me today are Rob Wagman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Nick Zarcone, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Quinn, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of our European operations. In addition to the telephone access for today's call, we are providing an audiocast via the LKQ website. A replay of the audiocast and conference call will be available shortly after the conclusion of this call. I would like to remind everyone that the statements made in this call that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which it was made except as required by law. Please refer to our Form 10-K and other subsequent documents filed with the SEC and the press release we issued this morning for more information on potential risk. Also, note that guidance for 2015 is based on current conditions, including acquisitions completed through March 31, 2015, and excludes any impact of restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, gains or losses related to acquisitions or divestitures, including changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, loss on debt extinguishment and capital spending related to future business acquisitions. Hopefully everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. As normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the next few days. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Wagman. Robert L. Wagman: Thank you, Joe. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today. In Q1, revenue reached a new quarterly high of $1.77 billion, an increase of 9.1% as compared to $1.63 billion in the first quarter of 2014. Net income for the first quarter of 2015 was $107.1 million, an increase of 2.3%, as compared to $104.7 million for the same period of 2014. Diluted earnings per share of $0.35 for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015, increased 2.9% from $0.34 for the first quarter of 2014. Please note that adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2015 would have been $0.36 compared to $0.35 for the first quarter of 2014 after adjusting for net losses resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, loss on debt extinguishment in 2014 and the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 7.5% for the quarter, following an extremely tough comp from last year. I am particularly pleased with the sequential improvement in the EBITDA margin of our wholesale European segment, which increased 130 basis points in the quarter. Nick will provide more color around margins momentarily. Now moving on to operations. During the first quarter, we purchased nearly 70,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is a 3.1% decrease compared to Q1 2014. I want to put some context around the drop in our dismantling procurement. During our third quarter 2014 earnings call, I indicated that we adjusted our procurement strategy for our salvage inventory by focusing on buying a better quality car that would part-out for additional revenue. The intent of this strategy was to drive incremental revenue and gross margin dollars. Though we are still working through the selling cycle, I am encouraged with the initial results, despite lower procurement volumes. Since implementing this strategy, our salvage organic revenue growth has outperformed our overall North American organic growth. Thus far, in Q2, sequentially, our procurement and pricing are trending favorably with ample volume at the auction. With inventory already on hand and a continuation of our current run rate for acquiring cars, we should have sufficient inventory for our recycled parts operations. In our self-service retail business, during the first quarter, we acquired approximately 100,000 lower-cost, self-service and crush-only cars as compared to 120,000 in Q1 of 2014 or roughly a 16% decrease. Similar to last quarter, this decrease was intentional given the continued downward trend in scrap prices and a continued pressure on margins. Also, regarding scrap, it is important to note that scrap will continue to become a smaller portion of our global revenue mix, which we believe will reduce our exposure to unexpected surprises in our earnings stream. For further context on this point, at the end of Q1 2011, a period before we diversified our business into Europe and Specialty, the other revenue line was over 16% of our revenue versus 7.3% at the end of Q1 2015. Lastly, in North America, in April 2015, we renewed our designed patent license agreement with Ford. The license agreement grants LKQ the exclusive right to distribute aftermarket replicas of Ford automotive parts covered by U.S. design patents. The renewal is on a substantially the same terms as the previous agreement, except that the term now extends until March of 2020. LKQ and Ford have forged a mutually beneficial relationship that helps ensure that customers continue to have a choice between original equipment and non-OE automotive parts. Now moving to our European operations. In Q1, our Wholesale European segment had acquisition growth of 12.7% and organic revenue growth of 14%, which was offset by a decrease of 10.7% related to the foreign exchange rates. ECP continued its double-digit performance by posting organic revenue growth of 16.8% in the quarter and for branches opened more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 10.2%. In addition, during Q1, our collision parts revenue with ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 34%, despite a mild U.K. winter. We believe that this growth demonstrates that our 17 insurance partners in the U.K. recognize the value proposition of our alternative parts offering. During the quarter, ECP opened a total of 3 branches, bringing our network total to 192 branch locations. Turning to our Sator business. During the quarter, Sator witnessed some gross margin benefit year-over-year, primarily from the shift in its network from a 3-step to a 2-step model. I am particularly pleased with Sator's 5.3% organic growth in the quarter. We believe that we've successfully weathered any further fallout from our customer base as a result of this new distribution model. Also, during the quarter, Sator acquired 2 additional distributors of aftermarket automotive products in the Netherlands, 1 of which closed on April 1. These 2 acquisitions added an additional 8 locations in the market, bringing Sator's branch network to 72. As I noted on our last call, additional acquisitions in the pipeline and the innovative partner strategy should see us complete our national footprint in the Netherlands by the year end with a target count of circa 80 branches. Now on to the Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year revenue growth of 36% in the quarter, including the benefit of Stag Parkway and organic revenue growth of 6.3%. In Q1, our Specialty team made continued progress on synergy and cost-saving initiatives with Stag Parkway by closing and integrating 4 additional warehouses. We expect the balance of the identified Stag locations to be closed and fully integrated by year-end. Turning to our acquisition activity and pipeline. In addition to the Netherlands distributors, during the first quarter of 2015, the company also acquired a salvage business located in Nebraska. I am pleased with the diligent efforts of our development team and our team's ongoing integration efforts. We continue to see a robust pipeline of opportunities to acquire businesses that fit our growth strategy in each operating segment. At this time, I'd like to ask John and Nick to provide more detail and perspective on the financial results of the quarter. John S. Quinn: Thanks, Rob. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. I'll give a little color on the overall company results. In a moment, Nick will address the segment details, the balance sheet and the guidance. Q1 2015 saw LKQ reach a number of significant milestones. It was our first quarter with revenue reaching an annualized run rate over $7 billion with a Q1 revenue annualizing of $7.1 billion. And this is also the first time we exceeded $210 million of EBITDA in a quarter. These accomplishments were completed even in the face of a severe drop of scrap steel prices. Getting to the specifics in the quarter, beginning with revenue, our Q1 2015 revenue were $1,774,000,000, was an increase of $148 million compared to Q1 last year, or an increase of 9.1%. For Q1, our total organic revenue growth was 5.1% and we delivered an additional growth of 7.5% from acquisitions with foreign exchange negatively impacting total revenue by 3.4%. Rob mentioned that the Q1 2015 organic growth of Parts and Services was 7.5%. We completed 2 small acquisitions in Q1 2015, which were and are expected to be immaterial to revenue. Total change in other revenue, which is where we recorded our scrap commodity sales was negative 17.4%. That was mainly due to the negative organic growth of 17.7% with a small acquisition growth in foreign exchange almost offsetting each other. As Rob mentioned, we saw purchases of cars down in the quarter year-over-year. In the recycling line of business, we've been targeting a better quality car, whereas in the self-service line of business, we adjusted our buying to account for the difficult scrap environment, a process we started in Q4 2014. Some of that volume decrease will impact Q2 when we scrap those cars. The decrease in volume offset some of the fall in scrap steel prices we experienced year-over-year and helped reduce the impact of lower scrap compared to what we had anticipated on the February call. The average price we received for scrap steel was approximately 37% lower year-over-year at $141 per ton this year versus $224 per ton in Q1 2014. Other revenue was 7.3% of total revenue as compared to 9.6% for the same period last year and has continued the trend of becoming a lower percentage of and less significant to, our total revenue. In Q1 2015, revenue for our Self-serve business was $85 million or 4.8% of LKQ's total revenue. Approximately 42% of this revenue was parts sales included in North American parts and services revenue and 58% scrap and core sales included in other revenue. A year ago, in Q1 2014, our Self-serve business was 6.4% of our revenue and that percentage has been falling as scrap prices fell and as we've grown our other lines of business. Our reported gross margin for Q1 2015 was $699 million or 39.4% of revenue, a decline of approximately 70 basis points from our gross margin percentage of 40.1% in Q1 2014. Fifty basis points of the decline was due to mix with lower-margin European and Specialty businesses growing faster than North America. North American margins were 10 basis points lower, which is primarily due to scrap pricing. We estimated that the drop in scrap prices impacted EPS by $0.02, which equates to approximately $10 million of gross margin impact. Without this headwind, North American would have seen improvement in gross margins. Specialty gross margins were lower, primarily due to the acquisitions we completed in Q4 of 2014. Moving on to operating expenses. Facility and warehouse cost improved from 7.8% of revenue in Q1 2014 to 7.5% in Q1 this year. This improvement is primarily due to mix caused by the growth in our Specialty and European segments, which tend to run lower facility costs than the North American segment. Distribution costs were 8% of revenue this quarter, down from 8.4% in the same quarter of last year. The primary reason for this improvement was due to lower fuel expenses. Selling and G&A expenses increased from 11.4% of revenue in Q1 last year to 11.5% in Q1 this year. This reflects cost in the Netherlands associated with the move to a 2-step distribution model, which was responsible for a 20-basis-point increase and that was offset by a 10-basis-point improvement in the Specialty segment as we achieved synergies following the acquisitions. The combination of facility and warehouse distribution and SG&A costs was 27% of revenue in Q1 2015 as compared to 27.6% in Q1 2014. It's worth noting that the drop in other revenues was probably masking additional leverage we achieved in the base business. It's hard to accurately quantify the exact impact, but as I've pointed out in the past, other revenue tends to incur very little incremental cost on these line items. So it's likely an improvement in leverage being masked by the lower scrap in core revenue. We estimate this improvement in the 30 to 50 basis-point range. During Q1 2015, we recorded $6.5 million of restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, up from $3.3 million in Q1 last year. The 2015 cost primarily related to the restructuring cost in the Specialty segment. Depreciation and amortization was 1.7% of revenue during Q1 this year as compared to 1.6% of revenue in Q1 2014, reflecting higher capital spending and the impact of acquisitions on amortization. Other expenses, net, increased to $16.8 million in the 3 months ended March 31, 2015, compared to $15.1 million in the same period last year, an increase of $1.7 million. Year-over-year, net interest expense and loss on debt extinguishment was $1.5 million favorable, offset by contingent consideration liabilities, which were $1.4 million of unfavorable and greater foreign exchange losses of $1.8 million. Our effective borrowing rate for the quarter was 3.4%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.5% compared to 34.0% in Q1 last year. The increase rate reflects mix with a higher portion of pretax income in the higher tax rate United States and a $700,000 unfavorable discrete charge in Q1 2015. On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share was $0.35 in Q1 2015 compared to $0.34 in Q1 2014, an improvement of 2.9%. Adjusting for the combination of acquisition-related expenses, contingent purchase price adjustments and the loss on the debt extinguish, EPS would have been $0.01 higher both this year and last. So on an adjusted basis, Q1 2015 would've been $0.36 as compared to $0.35 last year. I'd also point out that the strengthening U.S. dollar causes our reported foreign exchange earnings to be lower. We estimate the net impact of the stronger dollar added $0.02 negative impact on Q1 2015 earnings per share. With that, I'd like to pass over to Nick Zarcone to provide some details regarding these segments and some color on our outlook. Dominick P. Zarcone: Thanks, John, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'm delighted to be part of the LKQ leadership team and I look forward to sharing our financial results with you for many quarters to come. While John has provided an overview of our consolidated results, I'd like to take a few minutes to address our 3 segments : North America, Europe, and Specialty products, particularly as it relates to some of the margin dynamics. North American parts and services revenue during the first quarter grew 5.1% compared to last year, most of which represented organic growth. You may recall that Q1 of 2014 was a particularly harsh winter, which resulted in our then-strongest ever quarter. So we knew it was going to be a tough comparison and we are very pleased with these results. In Europe, revenue was up 16% on a year-over-year basis with organic growth of 14% and acquisition growth of 12.7% being modified by the 10.7% negative impact in the movement in FX rates. To put that latter point into perspective, converting the Q1 2015 local currency results, including the acquired revenue at the lower exchange rates, reduced European revenue by approximately $60 million compared to where revenue would have been had the FX rates remained constant at 2014 levels. And as mentioned, revenue for the Specialty segment grew 36%, combining 6% organic growth and 31% acquisition growth, the latter being the result of the Stag Parkway acquisition that was completed in Q4 of 2014. So organic growth from parts and services was 7.5% on a global basis, which is consistent with the guidance provided during our last call. And as mentioned by John, the significant drop in scrap prices led to a 17% decline in other revenue, bringing total organic growth down to 5.1%. When thinking about profitability, it is important to remember that each of our 3 operating segments have different margin characteristics, with our North American segment historically having the highest gross margin and EBITDA margins. As a result, when looking over time periods, a significant portion of the change in margins on a consolidated basis can be attributable to the change in revenue mix. In the first quarter of 2015, North America fell to 59% of global revenue compared to 63.3% during the comparable period of 2014. This largely reflects the impact of the acquisitions in our European and Specialty businesses during 2014, which have further diversified the revenue stream. As highlighted in the press release, consolidated EBITDA margins fell from 12.5% in the first quarter of 2014 to 12% in the first quarter of 2015. Most all of that change was the result of 2 items : one, higher restructuring cost related to the integration of Stag Parkway into our Specialty business as we closed overlapping facilities, incurred-related moving expenses and terminated redundant staff; second, we experienced an increase in the losses from unconsolidated subsidiaries. Importantly, segment EBITDA, which excludes the impact of restructuring charges and the results of unconsolidated subs, increased 7.9% in the first quarter compared to last year to $221 million from $205 million. Segment EBITDA margins were 12.5% in the most recent quarter compared to 12.6% last year. Again, most all of the change was due to a shift in our revenue mix. Gross margins in North America were slightly lower in Q1 of 2015, as improved pricing on the aftermarket side was more than offset by a decline in the salvage margins, particularly due to the significant decline in scrap prices and the change in purchasing strategy that Rob mentioned toward newer, higher-priced salvage vehicles, which generate higher parts sales and dollars but slightly lower gross margins. EBITDA margins of the North American segment were 14.3% during the most recent quarter, which is up 10 basis points from the first quarter of 2014. As one would expect, given the seasonality of the business, on a sequential basis, first quarter margins were up significantly from the 12.8% we reported in Q4 of last year. Remember, Q1 tends to be our strongest quarter of the year in this segment. Notwithstanding the negative drag related to the lower scrap prices, these are the best Q1 margins posted by our North American segment in several years as we experienced leverage in the distribution system due in part to the decline in fuel prices. The gross margin of our Specialty segment fell about 80 basis points due to the acquisition of the Stag Parkway RV-related business in Q4 of 2014. Stag Parkway traditionally has had lower gross margins than our KAO operation. That said, EBITDA margins for the Specialty segment increased by 40 basis points to 10.5% in Q1 of 2015 compared to 10.1% in Q1 of the prior year and ahead of the seasonal low of 7.3% recorded in Q4 of last year. This was largely due to the realization of logistic synergies associated with the rationalizing the distribution network of the acquired business. So it was an excellent performance for this segment and solid evidence that the integration of the recent acquisition is on track. With respect to Europe, gross margins in the first quarter remained constant with the comparable period of 2014. We experienced a slight decline in gross margins in the U.K. related to a shift in revenue toward national accounts, but that was wholly offset by an increase in margin on the continent, reflecting the internalization of incremental gross margin from the acquired distributors as part of our 3 to 2 distribution strategy. As you may recall, the EBITDA margins of our European segment fell by approximately 150 basis points in the second half of 2014 due to 4 primary items : first, there was an aggressive planned ramp in new ECP branches; second, there was an unexpected opportunity to add more than 20 branches from Unipart when it was shut down. Collectively, this resulted in the addition of 44 new branches in the U.K. during 2014, a majority of which hit in the second half of the year. As you know, it takes several quarters for new branches to breakeven and a few years to reach maturity. Clearly, the acceleration and branch openings had a depressing impact on margins; third, as discussed during the last call, there was some price discounting in the marketplace as all the participants sought to replace Unipart as the preferred vendor at select clients when Unipart was shut down. We believe most of that is behind us. And finally, as part of our 3-to-2 distribution strategy in the Benelux region, we had purchased 5 of our former distributor customers in the second half of 2014 and under U.S. GAAP, we were not able to record a profit on the inventory we had previously sold to these distributors, which depressed margins at Sator. While we will continue to buy other distributor customers as we work to complete the migration to a 2-step distribution model, the impact will likely be less than what was experienced in 2014. Those 4 items all had a negative impact on EBITDA margins in the second half of 2014, but we knew with time, the impact would begin to fade. Importantly, if given the same set of circumstances, we would absolutely make the same decisions to grow the business as they were in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. While EBITDA margins of our European segment in Q1 of 2015 were 9.5%, down 30 basis points from the 9.8% reported in Q1 of last year, the entire decline was due to foreign currency transaction losses, including the impact of foreign currency contracts used to hedge the purchase of inventory. Importantly, EBITDA margins in Q1 of 2015 improved by 130 basis points from the 8.2% recorded in Q4 of last year. While some of the improvements is seasonal, we believe the residual impact of our decisions to aggressively grow the European business last year are beginning to abate. Moving on to the key cash flow items for the company as a whole. Funds from operations during Q1 of 2015 totaled $180 million compared to $97 million in Q1 of last year. While we realized a $10 million increase in consolidated EBITDA, the real benefit came from an improvement in working capital since year end as we experienced a reduction in inventories and an increase in payables. You may recall that we accelerated our purchases of aftermarket inventory in Q4 of 2014 in anticipation of some potential issues with the U.S. ports on the West Coast. So this decline was a temporary move and we fully anticipate inventories will grow as we proceed throughout the year. During the quarter, we used $34 million of our cash for long-term investments. This included approximately $26 million of capital expenditures and $8 million of other investments, including acquisitions. The resulting net cash flow of $146 million was used to repay down approximately $80 million of our debt and to build our cash on hand. At the end of Q1, we had approximately $1.7 billion of debt outstanding and $175 million of cash balances. The available capacity under our revolving credit agreement at the end of the quarter was just north of $1.2 billion which, when you add the cash balances, resulted in approximately $1.4 billion of available liquidity. Total debt to the latest 12-month EBITDA was about 2.2x. And if you factor in the full year impact of EBITDA for the acquired businesses, the ratio fell to approximately 2.0x. So we believe we have more than ample ability to finance the continued growth of our business. Finally, we are not changing the guidance provided in late February. We still expect organic revenue growth from Parts and Services will be in the range of 6.5% to 9%. Our net income and earnings per share guidance ranges are $420 million to $450 million, or $1.36 to $1.46 a share, respectively. And our guidance for capital expenditures is $150 million to $180 million with cash flow from operations of approximately $425 million. I would like to highlight a few of the changes we have seen in the business since February and give you some indication as to why we have decided to leave the guidance unchanged, even after a solid first quarter. The organic growth of 7.5% we reported for Parts and Services was in line with our prior guidance. While there will be periodic fluctuations due to weather or other events, we expect the fundamental drivers of that growth to continue. We believe that in North America the number of vehicles in our sweet spot will continue to grow and the trends of higher miles driven will help. In Europe, we will continue to get the benefit of the new branch openings of the past few years and the growth of our collision and e-commerce businesses. On our February earnings call, we discussed that we expected the negative impact from falling scrap prices to be $0.05 to $0.06 a share, primarily spread over the first 2 quarters with an emphasis in Q1. The impact of scrap prices in Q1 was only $0.02 a share. So basically, a $0.01 or $0.02 less than we had anticipated. Assuming current scrap prices hold, we now anticipate the full year impact to scrap will be $0.03 to $0.04 a share compared to the $0.05 to $0.06 we anticipated back in February. In other words, at current levels, we expect scrap to continue to hit earnings per share for $0.01 or $0.02 in the second quarter. The other item we discussed last quarter was the impact of foreign exchange. The currencies continued to be volatile and, as noted, the impact on Q1 earnings per share was $0.02 a share. While the pound is currently trading in a range similar to when we issued our original guidance in February, the average exchange rate for the euro during April is down a bit further. So depending on where the currencies move during the remainder of the year, the initial estimate of FX having a $0.04 to $0.05 negative impact on the earnings per share might be light by a $0.01. So in total, we believe that the combined negative impact of scrap and FX, which was estimated in February at approximately $0.08 to $0.10 a share for the year is still a reasonable estimate. In terms of putting some high-level characterization on the quarter's results, I would say that we believe we saw a strong performance in all of the lines of business. North America continues to benefit from the trends we discussed earlier. As we anticipated on the last call, we saw the European segments starting to snap back from its soft performance in the second half of 2014. And while some of that is simply seasonal, we also benefited from better sales, margins and cost controls. And the integration plans in the Specialty business are on track. The key message is that the underlying business -- the underlying business is progressing very much according to our plans and our balance sheet is in great shape to provide us the flexibility needed to continue to execute our strategy. Before I turn the conversation back over to Rob, I just wanted to mention that over the past few weeks, I've received a few questions from the investment community as to why I decided to join LKQ. While major career changes are never simple, it really boiled down to 2 key items. First, I believe the growth potential of LKQ is significant. How often do you have an opportunity to join a company that is a clear leader in its core categories and markets around the globe and still has organic growth rates that are 3x to 4x that of GDP? And there are still very significant potential to grow through acquisition. That affords an opportunity for me to help build the company into a substantially larger enterprise in the foreseeable future. Second, I have known the company, and more importantly, the leadership team for a very, very long time. I understand the culture, core values and the absolute integrity of the organization, and that reduces the natural risk inherent in a move. Overall, it simply created an opportunity I couldn't pass up. And I will now turn the discussion back to Rob for a wrap-up before Q&A. Robert L. Wagman: Thanks, Nick. To summarize, we are quite pleased with our first quarter 2015 results. And as always, we could not do it without the dedication of our 29,000-plus employees. LKQ was founded in 1998 with a goal of forming the largest nationwide provider of recycled OEM automotive products. We achieved that objective yet have more runway to expand in that particular line of business across our existing North American network and into new geographies. With the acquisition of Keystone Automotive Industries in 2007 and ECP in 2011, we diversified our company into different markets, products and geographies with the intent of expanding the use of all alternative parts globally, both in the professional mechanical and collision repair. Though on the surface some segments and geographies look different, our strategies remain the same : identifying niche markets ripe for consolidation that offer combined synergies and network leverage; seek to acquire the #1 or #2 player with outstanding management in each segment; focus on sound return metrics and strive for the highest fill rates in our operating segments. With this strategy, we continue to believe that LKQ is a unique company, not just because of the strength of our business model and operating segments, but also because of the consistent growth we are able to deliver both organically and from acquisitions. Over the last 5 years, we have averaged over 8% organic growth for parts and services and nearly 19% from acquisitions. This performance was achieved in a low-growth environment for both our economy and for a lot of the companies in our industry. This strategy, coupled with the dynamics of increased miles driven, lower fuel prices and a strong sell rate, creates ongoing opportunities to grow our company across all of our operating segments and add long-term value for our stockholders. Devon, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : First question just has to do with the start of the second quarter. If you could give us any perspective on the pace of revenue in the second quarter and any cost we should be aware of just so that we set the second quarter expectation correctly. Robert L. Wagman: Craig, this is Rob. We've been talking to some of our bigger customers in North America. We didn't have a backlog coming out of Q1 that we had last year, but business has been steady, so we're pretty much where we thought we should be for April thus far. In Europe, same story there, pretty much where we expected to be. Revenue was looking to plan over in Europe as well. John S. Quinn: And Craig, I think Nick noted that we're expecting some continuing impact from scrap because the cars we're selling today are ones we bought maybe earlier in Q1. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Right, that helps. That helps, John. And then maybe my second question for you, John, since we may not get the opportunity to talk you as frequently on these calls. Just maybe give us a sense for your priorities in Europe. I know it's still early, so you're still forming your plan, but what are your priorities there? And how should we look to track that progress? John S. Quinn: Sure. So I spent the better part of last month over there and I guess the way I view it is we have 2 really good businesses for the Netherlands and the U.K. But within each country, I think there are still a lot of work to do to finish some of the integration or the acquisitions we have, particularly in respect to the Netherlands. First thing is don't do any harm but make sure that we can continue to integrate those acquisitions within the countries. And there are some additional deals we need to do to continue to fill out the footprint there. In the Netherlands, we are at about 72 locations. We think we can probably end up somewhere in the 80 to 85 by the time we're done and we hope that platform builds over the end of the year. And then, when you move a little bit higher and you say, what else can we do? There's more integration to be done between the 2 countries. We did some preliminary integration on procurement in the last couple of years. I think we can do a lot more on that front. And that probably starts with getting the common catalog. There was a project underway to get a common catalog among the countries. And then using that knowledge to leverage the procurement across the group. And there are also some opportunities to probably integrate the procurement a little bit stronger between North America and Europe, particularly on some of the collision businesses where there's a heavy overlap in suppliers. And then, the third platform in the car integration is probably on the revenue opportunities, with particular [indiscernible] like e-commerce, where both countries have a nascent e-commerce business and we can lever the distribution network that we have to try to go through that. And then if you take those 1 step higher, there's obviously some other opportunities to do additional product lines, like, for example, we're now distributing paint or collision business in the Netherlands. So we look for additional opportunities to do those kinds of things, probably once we get the integration done. And then other geographies so that's [indiscernible] countries they currently exist, and then look for opportunities in other countries. So I think we'll be pretty busy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Lawrence with Stephens. John Russell Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Rob, would you go through a simple example? I mean, for years and years we've talked about this core competency of the acquisition procurement process. So with that algorithm now, can you just sort of walk us through what that would look like when a car comes into that -- to the handheld or whatever, what exactly changes as far as just the sort of the remedial process of looking at those cars to get that higher quality? Robert L. Wagman: Yes, really, nothing's changed, John, at all. The handheld device calculates demand, calculates the probability of sale. It's interesting, our average cost has come down from Q4 to Q1, up 4%. So we are buying a better car for less money. So we're very pleased with that trend. But in essence, whether you're buying a $300 car or a $2,000 car, the handheld does the exact same data lookup just basing on demand and probability of sale. And so nothing really has changed in that respect. In fact, it just allows our reps to get a higher dollar for that part as it's just a higher price part. We are buying, on average, about 1/2 a year younger to 1 year younger vehicle this time now as opposed to last year. So really nothing has changed at all. John S. Quinn: John, it's John Quinn speaking. I guess one thing you can think about is, if you got somewhere that is, for example, space constrained, the throughput whether you're dismantling a $2,000 car or a $3,000 car, it takes up the same amount of geography and roughly the same amount of labor and warehousing space. So the thinking is that if you can get a better car, you can improve your return on capital as well on those things. We don't have to buy additional land to grow the business. We've always said one way to grow this business is to buy additional cars. You provide 5% more cars, your revenues should go up about 5%. If you also buy a 5% better car, your revenue should go up 5% on basically the same footprint. And so part of this is just the strategy to try to move up market and particularly in a couple yards that are potentially space-constrained where we wouldn't -- want to avoid buying extra land. John Russell Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Well, we're 40 minutes into the call, so I got to ask about State Farm, I guess. Robert L. Wagman: Sure, glad to answer that. Update on the bumpers, Q1 was a 19.5% increase year-over-year. So still getting -- and that's up a strong comp, John. Other than that, no new news out of Bloomington, unfortunately. But we continue to really raise the number on the products they are writing in the aftermarket, in the bumpers. So we keep reminding them and we'll continue to do so. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Two questions, if I could. The first one has to do with your sequential operating expenses Q1 over Q4. I noticed that there was very nice leverage sequentially. I also noticed that there wasn't a whole lot of acquisitions this quarter, which gives us a little bit of a unique look into potentially what your organic leverage might look like with the legacy business. Can you help us, I'm not sure, Nick, if this for you or for John, but can you help us in terms of sequentially, how much of that leverage came from the absence of some one-off costs that may have occurred in 4Q? For example, some of the European branches, how much of that was seasonal? And how much of that might have been organic leverage, if you could? Specifically around S&W [ph] expenses, distribution expenses and SG&A expenses. John S. Quinn: I think it's probably best to talk about the different segments because there's certainly a unique story in each one, right? So you're right, in North America we didn't -- we haven't done a lot of acquisitions in the quarter. There wasn't a lot of acquisition activity going, coming out of Q4, frankly, either in North America. So a lot of that was, I would say, sort of a seasonal leverage and you can just see that through the segment data. On the Specialty segment, that is a seasonal business both on -- with respect to that business and with respect to the European business. I'd just remind people that Q4 tends to be a bit softer in those 2 businesses. Historically, if you look at the company, Q1 was our strongest and Q4 was our second strongest when we were basically a collision-focused business. But as we've been diversifying into more into some of these hard parts [ph] Specialty products, Q1 tends to be the strongest quarter. And on those 2 segments, Q4 is a lot lighter. So you didn't see -- on the Specialty segment, we got the benefit of some of the integration of Stag Parkway. Stag Parkway didn't contribute very much at all in Q4 last year, probably because of the seasonal thing and partly because we haven't really executed on some of the synergies, which I think Nick spoke to the fact that they did a good job getting a lot of those synergies captured already. So some of that is, you're right, integration improvement coming through. And then on the European business, I don't have any specifics for you, Sam, but we did talk about the fact that we were carrying some additional cost associated with the branch openings. There's also a little bit of a profit deferral associated with those acquisitions that we do in the Netherlands. So we did see operating leverage with respect to the businesses there, for sure. And again, some of that's the seasonality and some of it is just better -- getting the revenue, I would say, from those acquisitions and being able to recognize more of the profit with respect to the Sator acquisition. Dominick P. Zarcone: And Sam, this is Nick. As Rob indicated, and this particularly goes to distribution cost, we did gain a little bit of benefit on fuel, as fuel prices came down pretty substantially from Q4 and that helped a bit. We helped thousands of trucks that travel millions of miles across the roads and highways around the globe and we consume a fair amount of fuel. So that helped a little bit. Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Two more quick questions, if I could, and I think you mentioned this in the prepared remarks and I missed it I apologize. What was the impacts specifically of the Sator move to 2-step on overall gross margins? And I have 1 final quick follow-up as well. John S. Quinn: On a year-over-year basis? Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Sure. Robert L. Wagman: Let's take a look at that while you go on and ask your second question. Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Sure, sure. The last question, I noticed a minority interest was up pretty nicely on a percentage basis, which suggests that your Australian JV is doing quite well. Anything there that is learnings or something translatable that you're seeing down there, Rob, that you might be able to transfer over to your European operations as you try and grow that alternative business? Robert L. Wagman: Well, one thing that is nice, Sam, is that we're obviously working directly with the insurance company, so that owns a large body shop chain down there. So we're taking the parts that we're procuring directly from them and putting them right into their repair stream. So yes, we think there could be actually some move over. As you know, we entered the Swedish market last quarter and we're doing something very similar in the Swedish market there actually by procuring directly from the insurance company. So we do think there is something to be done there. The reason why we don't think it's really applicable here in the U.S. because the country is so large. I mean, Australia is a unique market in that 90% of the population live in 4 cities and we have [indiscernible] in 3 of those 4 cities. Perth, on the western side of the country, we haven't focus on yet. But yes, we do think there is something we could take from the U.S. or from the Australian market into the European market, which we're kind of doing in Sweden right now. John S. Quinn: And Sam, with respect to the impact of the acquisitions, we did see a little bit of improvement in the margin in the Netherlands, but because the Netherlands is relatively small compared to the total company, it wasn't really enough to drive the overall company margins. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : I appreciate all that color. A couple of things. One, just focusing on kind of the North American organic growth rate. Obviously, we were up against a tough comp. You probably had some weather disruption in certain areas in February with cities shutting down, which ends up being a net negative for you guys. And my gut tells me that there's obviously with buying a few -- fewer cars, obviously that's probably impacted the portion of the self-service that goes into the parts and service number for North America. How should we think about that kind of going forward? Historically, you've always given a range of about 5% to 7% organic growth for North America. We have some favorable trends going on with miles driven and more parts for repair, and like you say, a little bit better quality part. How should we think about the growth rate there for kind of the next couple of quarters or the remainder of the year? Robert L. Wagman: Nate, we get a report from CCC, the leading estimating company here in the United States. We just had a sit down with them this week. It's interesting, they showed stats by states. And New England, as you rightly mentioned, was shut down for those 3 blizzards they had. So it was very slow in New England. It was pretty interesting from Pennsylvania West to the Minnesota-Iowa market, claims were actually down. So they -- we had very little snow in Chicago as you know. So we don't have a backlog coming out of Q1. However, as you mentioned, we're up against a tough comp. We do feel good because of those trends you're talking about, the newer car part, definitely is working in our favor. One thing you didn't mention was the amount of certified parts. Certified parts increased 18% year-over-year, which is good for obviously for the aftermarket. Our backlog is very healthy. Very strong backlog at all of our facilities. Miles driven are increasing. Gas prices, although they've come up a little bit, are still substantially down year-over-year. And the man time [ph] is finally stable. So yes, we feel good about the next couple of quarters once that all fleshes out. And certainly, when these new cars, these 16 million and 17 million SAAR rates start getting 2 and 3 years out, we feel pretty good that there's going to be a really healthy amount of cars coming to the sweet spot. So pretty bullish on the North American growth and I feel confident that the 5 to 7 is still going to hold. Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay, great. And John, kind of a question along the other one in terms of all the opportunities over in Europe. And it sounds like, just based on some of the cost pressures that we had temporarily in the fourth quarter and some of things that happened, as those go away, I think it sounds like that, that margin improvement over there is fairly sustainable and probably even has upside as you implement some of those 4 things that you spoke about. Do you have any rough time line on how long you think it will take to get to each of those 4 opportunities or any initial viewpoint on how fast that kind of moves in terms of making that integration kind of seeing at 100% versus where we might be at, give or take, I don't know, 70% today? John S. Quinn: Yes. We don't have a good sense here. We just kicked off the project on sort of getting the common catalog. And I think the procurement though, we're very quick to bringing that team together, and so that will be relatively quick. I do think over time, what we'd like to get is the sustainable double-digit EBITDA margins over there. I'd be a bit like an economist to give you number but not a date, but I don't think it's years and but it's probably some time in 2016, 2017 before we get there on a sustainable basis. Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. And then just one quick final question regarding the gross margin improvement in North America, which kind of helped by not buying as many cars because of the scrap impact. Should that be -- I mean, I know that there's a net-net negative impact in the second quarter, but should we continue to see kind of those margins trend up temporarily as we kind of do some of these better pricing initiatives, et cetera? Or it will be impacted buying the better quality parts, eventually kind of offset that and maybe it's kind of a neutral going forward kind of look? Dominick P. Zarcone: Nate, this is Nick. The gross margins in the first quarter on a comparative basis to last year were actually down, just that and that really reflected the impact of the scrap and the pressure it weighed on with the -- the positive impact of increased prices on the aftermarket not being able to fully cover the impact of scrap. We do not see any major shifts in our margin structure in North America. Obviously, that assumes that scrap prices stay about where they are and it assumes that we still get the pull-through purchasing the higher-quality car that Rob and John talked about a little bit earlier in the call, because that gives us the ability to get more parts dollars off those vehicles. But we are not anticipating any major shifts in the margin structure. Robert L. Wagman: I was just going to add to what Nick said about scrap. Scrap last week was roughly about $135 a ton, so it at least stabilized from where it was in February. But just to put in perspective, it's 37% down year-over-year and 25% sequentially. So scrap will be a little bit of a headwind, still. Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : But just then kind of put that into conclusion at least going sequentially, we should expect, given some of the puts and the takes, to kind of balance out and give or take, pretty flat gross margins for the rest of the year, again, assuming scrap stays where it's at? John S. Quinn: Yes, there's a little bit of seasonality on the gross margin in the Specialty business. Robert L. Wagman: In Q4. Dominick P. Zarcone: Right. John S. Quinn: Right. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : Rob, you mentioned that you're paying about 4% less for car. Is that really a function of the fact that scrap has come down? Is that what is making the car purchases a little bit better for you? Robert L. Wagman: I think that's certainly a portion of it, Gary. I also think that there's such a large export that the auctions export, and I think that the dollar has worked in our favor. So I think that may also be impacting it. So I think it's a combination of the strong dollar and scrap coming down. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then in terms of -- I just want to clear something up with myself, in terms of Sator, when you're going from a 3- to a 2-step distribution model, is the intent to have all of Sator's business go to that 3- to 2-step model? John S. Quinn: No. It'll continue to have 3-step distribution models. Keep in mind, we're only talking about the Netherlands when we're talking about converting this right now. The Belgian operation is still [indistinguishable] and so is France. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay, so it's only the Netherlands, okay. John S. Quinn: Well, even within the Netherlands we'll continue to have partners where -- that are distributing as well. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : And I know you had mentioned something about collision parts on the continent, and I know you've purchased something, I think, in Sweden or something like that? John S. Quinn: Correct. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : But in terms of the bigger part of the continent, France, Germany, all that, when do you think you'll start getting some of that collision parts business out there? John S. Quinn: Again, if you -- let me backup. First of all, France has unusual rules that it's against the law to put an aftermarket product on a French-made car. Until that law gets changed, probably not be huge business there, although people do distribute through companies like ourselves OE parts. The OEs use non-dealers to distribute parts there. So there is an opportunity on that front. We generally need the last mile, right? We need to be able to get the parts to the customer. At the moment, we don't have the network to do that anywhere in a particular country, as you described, Germany, France, even the Netherlands, we still not have the product -- the facility built out and the infrastructure built out. So I think the initial focus really is just to get the Netherlands integrations. And if we can find an acquisition or a couple of smaller companies that distribute aftermarket product and there's some salvage companies, if we could find one of those that was attractive and want to sell at a reasonable price, then we would probably buy that and use that as a footprint. Most of our distribution right now is to the mechanical repair shop on the continent. We have a very little interaction with collision body shops. Whereas in the U.K., we've developed very strong relationships with all of the body shops, particularly through our paint acquisitions there. So I guess what I'm telling you, Gary, is it's probably not going to be this year, but it's not going to be multiple years either. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. Thanks for clearing that up. And then just lastly, on the tax rate, John. I think the last call, you had said that the tax rate would be high in the first couple of quarters, then transition down to about 34% as you start getting a better balance of profits coming from lower tax rate jurisdictions is that about where you thinking right now that by the third and fourth quarter, we would be at a 34% tax rate? John S. Quinn: No. Generally we try to do is estimate the full year tax rate and then adjust for any discrete items. So there's about a $700,000 discrete item that was -- if you look at the year-over-year increase on the tax rate, about 1/2 of that was a discrete item, that will go away in Q2. And we would anticipate using that same rate, for the rest of the year. So the rate going forward, to use a little bit over 35% is probably about right. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers [ph] with Great Lakes Review [ph]. Unknown Analyst : Nice to see the continued double-digit organic growth and the 12 months and older ECP branches, and I was wondering how sustainable you think that is? John S. Quinn: It takes almost 4 years for branch -- 3 to 4 years for branch to reach full maturity. So if you look at the cadence of the branches that we've opened the last couple of years -- branches that were opened, for example, in 2013 are still maturing and they're still growing. So some of that growth what you're seeing is maturing on the branches, and then also, the much older branches continue to take market share. So yes, I don't want to get into specifics and giving sort of multi-year guidance here, but we do believe we have a number of years of additional growth just as those branches, as Nick mentioned the 40-odd branches we opened last year, are going to continue to mature over the next couple of years. Unknown Analyst : Okay. And then looking at the acquisitions that you made, the 2 distributors and the Nebraska business, how much in total revenue do you expect that to contribute on an annual basis? John S. Quinn: It's less than $5 million, it's very small. Unknown Analyst : Alright. And finally the online purchasing through CCC, about what amount in revenue does that make up currently? Robert L. Wagman: We've been tracking it as a percentage of increase because it's still off of a small base. But revenue, Jason, was up 75% year-over-year, and purchase orders were up 70% year-over-year. It's roughly annualizing at about $22 million a year right now. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately we have exceeded our allotted time for questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. Robert L. Wagman: Thank you, everyone, for your time this morning. We look forward to speaking to you in July, we report our second quarter 2015 results. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Rodgers - Great Lakes Review Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc. Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the LKQ Corporation Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joe Boutross, Investor Relations for LKQ Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Boutross. You may begin. Joseph P. Boutross - Director, Investor Relations : Thanks, Devon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us today are Rob Wagman and Nick Zarcone. Please refer to the LKQ website for earnings release issued this morning, as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information please refer to the risk factors discussed in our form 10-K for 2014 and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. And with I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Rob Wagman. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Joe. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today. At LKQ we are a mission driven company, and I would like to start this call by highlighting our recently updated mission statement. We want to be the leading global value-added distributor of vehicle parts and accessories by offering our customers the most comprehensive available and cost-effective selection of parts solutions while building strong partnerships with our employees and the communities in which we operating. We are well on our way toward fulfilling our mission statement. Our goal is to be the leading distributor, versus simply a parts provider. We are global, with nearly 28% of our revenue outside of North America. Our products are for all types of vehicles and not solely replacement products for autos and light trucks. And most importantly, we are focused on building strong partnerships with our customers, our people, our suppliers, and the communities in which we operating. With that said, I believe our performance during the quarter speaks to this mission in I am quite pleased with the results. In Q2, revenue reached a new quarterly height of $1.84 billion, an increase of 7.5% as compared to $1.71 billion in the second quarter of 2014. Net income for the second quarter of 2015 was $119.7 million, an increase of 14.1% as compared to $104.9 million for the same period of 2014. Diluted earnings per share of $0.39 for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015, increased 14.7% from $0.34 for the second quarter of 2014. Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 7.5% for the quarter, and on a constant currency basis, total growth for parts and services was 14.9%. I am particularly pleased with our EPS performance, given the effect from FX and soft commodity prices, which combined negatively impacted the year-over-year change in EPS by $0.03. On a six-month year-to-date basis, revenue was $3.61 billion, an increase of 8.3% from $3.33 billion for the comparable period of 2014. Parts and services organic revenue growth for the first six months of 2015 was 7.5%. Net income for the first six months of 2015 was $226.8 million, as compared to $209.5 million for the first half of 2014. Diluted earnings per share was $0.74 for the first six months of 2015, as compared to $0.69 for the comparable period of 2014. Now on to our operations. During the quarter, our North American operations benefited from various macro trends. Let me highlight few. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation the 12-month moving average for miles driven through May 2015 reached its highest level since 1990, the year they began tracking the data. For 2015, cumulative miles driven witnessed a year-over-year increase of 3.4% through May. In addition, the year-to-date average price of unleaded regular gas was $2.42 a gallon through May of 2015, compared to an average of $3.51 during the same period in 2014. This represents 31% drop in the average gas price. Also, the unemployment rate in the U.S. has improved. The average unemployment rate in Q2 of 2015 was 5.4%, compared to 6.2% for Q2 of 2014, a 13% decrease year-over-year. And lastly, new car sales continue to improve. The SAAR rate for Q2 2015 was 17.2 million units, compared to 16.6 million units for Q2 of 2014, a 4% increase year-over-year. Now some specifics on our North American business. In Q2, our North American segment had organic growth of 6.3%. On a constant currency basis, organic revenue growth was 7.2%, with the difference primarily due to the weakness in the Canadian dollar. As noted on slide eight, during the second quarter we purchased nearly 75,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is a 5.6% increase compared to Q2 of 2014. During Q2, the pricing at auction was flat year-over-year, but we are also buying a new vehicle compared to 2014. This younger vehicle dynamic should equate to higher top-line revenue and improve margin dollars in this line of business. Also, our North American aftermarket parts business continues to perform well, as witnessed by its positive 30-basis-point contribution year-over-year to our wholesale North American gross margins. Another important metric that we track is the number of available certified parts. On a year-over-year basis, that number of SKUs increased 18%, which is critical to our insurance partners. Lastly, in our self-service retail businesses, we acquired over 131,000 lower cost self-service and crush-only cars, as compared to 143,000 in Q2 of 2014, or roughly a 8.4% decreased. This decreased was intentional, given the downward trend in scrap prices we faced in Q1, which continued as we entered Q2. We were encouraged as Q2 progressed because we began to witness period of pricing improvement and stability in the scrap market. Though this improvement was a positive from Q1 lows, we were slightly down sequentially, and 36% year-over-year. As we enter Q3, this temporary improvement has softened due to the sluggish demand out of China and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Nick will provide some further context around scrap shortly. Now moving to our European operations. In Q2, our wholesale European segment had organic revenue growth of 10.1% and acquisition growth of 11.1%, which was offset by a decrease of 11.7% related to foreign exchange rates. ECP's continued solid performance drove organic revenue growth of 11.6% in the quarter, and for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 7.1%. In addition, during Q2 our collision parts revenue in ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 33%. Our UK-based insurance industry relation teams have been working diligently with our 17 insurance partners in the UK to drive increased alternative collision parts usage within their respective body shop networks. During the quarter ECP opened two additional branches, bringing our UK network to 194 branches. We anticipate operating five branches in Q3 and three additional in Q4, keeping us on track to open the 13 branches we approved for 2015. Now turning to our Sator business. During the quarter, Sator witnessed additional gross margin benefit year-over-year, primarily from the shift in its network from three step to a two step distribution model and opening of our Lyon location in France in 2014. I am particularly pleased with Sator's 6.2% organic growth in the quarter. Also during the quarter, Sator acquired six additional distributors of aftermarket automotive products in the Netherlands. These acquisitions add 10 additional branches into the market, bringing Sator's branch network to 82, getting our branch count close to being fully built up. Now to our Specialty mar \u2013 segment. Our Specialty segment continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year revenue growth of 30% in the quarter, including the benefit of Stag-Parkway, and organic revenue growth of 6.6%. With this type of growth in operational effectiveness of our Specialty segment, we recently approved a lease for a 250,000-square-foot distribution center in Washington state. This facility will allow us to improve service levels across the Pacific Northwest and Western Canada. We hope to have this facility open by the end of 2015. And lastly on Specialty, earlier this month SEMA released their annual market data report, and last year the industry increased sales for the fifth year in a row, with 2014 increasing total sales volume 8% from 2013. With our current footprint in this segment and the number of new vehicles sales projected to increase in the coming years, we believe we are well positioned for continuing the growth of this segment. Turing to corporate development. On July 8, 2015, the company announced the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of PartsChannel, Inc., an aftermarket collision parts to distributor with 14 warehouses servicing over 30 markets across the United States. PartsChannel presents attractive synergies with our existing North American aftermarket collision parts business. Following the PartsChannel announcement, on July 9, 2015, we announced the signing of the definitive agreement to acquire The Coast Distribution System, Incorporated. Coast is a leading distributor of replacement parts and supplies and accessories for recreational vehicles, primarily to retail parts and supply stores, service and repair establishments, and new and used RV dealers in North America. This tender offer began \u2013 period began July 22, 2015, and will expire at the end of the day on August 18, 2015, unless the offer is extended. Because the tender offer is not complete, we are precluded from answering any Coast-specific questions during the Q&A portion of the call. Also, on July 14, 2015, the company acquired eight self-service yards from Ecology Auto Parts, an auto recycler based in California. This acquisition of the Ecology self-service yards furthers our commitment to the \u2013 expanding our recycled parts business and overall capacity to service the significant car park and population of California. Lastly, during the quarter we also acquired a wholesale salvage business located in Alabama, and an aftermarket parts distributor in Iowa. Before I turn the call over to Nick, I would like to update everyone on a couple key projects initiated in second quarter that we anticipate will have a positive long-term impact on the company. These initiatives are highlighted on slides 10 and 11. Our European operations are growing quickly. When we acquired Euro Car Parts it had 89 branches. We've expanded that number up to 194 locations, and added 26 paint distribution locations as well. At the time of the acquisition, the initial 89 branches were supported by a single national distribution center, or NDC, in Tamworth, England. In order to support the growth, we leased two additional sites in nearby locations. Today, we are supporting that branch network out of these three locations, which is inefficient from a logistics point of view, and even with three locations we are projecting to be out of space in a few years' time. In order to remedy these issues, earlier this year we broke ground on a new leased national distribution warehouse we are calling Tamworth 2, or T2 for short, adjacent to our primary NDC. T2 will be approximately 750,000 square feet, and will include significant automated warehouse functions. We don't expect T2 to be fully operational until 2018. While we anticipate we will ultimately close two of the existing facilities, during 2016 and 2017 we will incur costs on all four. This is a large and exciting project with a strong return-on-capital profile that will provide us with a competitive advantage in the UK to further protect the business and provide a platform for continued growth, but it will require investment, both in terms of capital and transition expenses. We will give more details in the coming quarters, but for modeling purposes we are preliminarily suggesting that the project will negatively impact in EPS by $0.02 to $0.03 in 2016 and $0.07 to $0.09 in 2017, after which we expect a positive contribution. This adverse impact on EPS is primarily due to operating duplicate facilities locations during relocation and start-up. There will be some costs incurred in 2015, but these have been included in our guidance. If these costs are material in any one quarter, we will expect to disclose them separately. And second, we recently hired the services of Alix Partners, a global consulting and advisory firm, to assist us in identifying areas in which we might uncover potential operational efficiencies and improvements to maintain our market-leading positions. Simultaneously, we are working closely with Alix to find opportunities to continuously enhance the experience for both our customers and team members. While we do expect this process to yield positive financial benefits, it will take some time before we can fully implement any recommendations coming out of that review. As this project with Alix unfolds, we will keep you apprised of its impact. And at this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on the financial results of the quarter. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks Rob, and good morning to everyone on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary on the quarter, and over the next few minutes I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of our three segments, before quickly touching on the balance sheet and addressing our revised guidance. For those of you who accessed our earnings presentation on the website, you will notice that we've included detail on both the second quarter ended June 30, as well as, for your convenience, the first six months of 2015. My comments will generally follow the flow of the presentation, but to be concise on this call, I will primarily focus on the quarterly results. The Cliff Notes portion of our financial performance in the second quarter of 2015 would be that we experienced solid revenue growth despite the continued headwinds from the strong dollar and lower commodity prices, and our businesses drove margin increases relative to the second quarter of last year. Consolidated revenue in the second quarter of 2015 was $1.84 billion, representing a 7.5% increase over last year. That reflects a 10.6% increase in revenue for parts and services, partially offset by a 20.5% decrease in other revenue, primarily related to the decline in scrap prices, which I will address in a few minutes. The components of the parts and services revenue increase include approximately 7.5% organic, plus 7.4% from acquisitions, before backing out 4.3% for FX. As noted on slide 14 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins improved 10 basis points to 39.4% during the quarter. The uptick reflected a 40 basis point improvement from operations, offset by a 30 basis point decline due to revenue mix, as the revenue growth of our European and Specialty businesses, which have lower gross margins structures, outpaced that of our North American operations. We picked up about 10 basis points of efficiencies in our operating expenses. Facility costs as a percent of revenues declined, primarily due to the shift in revenue mix towards our European and Specialty segments, which structurally have a lower facility expense. These units tend to utilize regional distribution centers, the cost of which is captured in cost of goods sold as opposed to in the facility expense line. Our distribution costs as a percent of revenue also declined relative to last year, primarily due to the lower fuel prices. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses as a percent of revenue, mainly due to an expansion of our sales force and administrative personnel in Europe to support the growth of the business. Segment EBITDA totaled $233 million for the quarter, reflecting a 10% increase from 2014, and as a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 12.7%, a 30 basis point increase over the 12.4% recorded in the second quarter of last year. The increase in EBITDA, when combined with the lower levels of depreciation, interest expense, and restructuring costs, on both a absolute and relative basis, allows pre-tax income to increase by 16% during the second quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year. And pre-tax margins expanded by 80 basis points to 10.1%. Our tax rate during the second quarter was 34.9% up from 34% last year. The tax rate reflects an effective rate of 35.1%, reduce a bit by few discrete items related to state taxes. As Rob mentioned, fully diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.39 compared to $0.34, up about 15%, and adjusted EPS before the restructuring charges and other items was $0.39 versus $0.35 a share, reflecting an 11% improvement. On a year-to-date basis, total revenue is up 8.3% to $3.6 billion for the first month \u2013 first six months of 2014 [sic] 2015 (20:10). Revenue from parts and services increased 11.3%, comprised of organic growth of 7.5% and the impact of acquisitions which added another 7.8%, before factoring in the negative impacts of currency movements. Gross margin for the first six months was 39.4%, reflecting a 30-basis-point decline from the prior year as the favorable experience in the second quarter could not fully offset the downtick in Q1. For the first six months, segment EBITDA margins were up 10 basis points, reflecting the continued efficiencies achieved in terms of warehousing and distribution. Fully diluted earnings per share for first six months were $0.74 compared to $0.69, reflecting a 7.2% increase, and on an adjusted basis, again before restructuring, EPS for the first six months was $0.76 compared to $0.70, or 8.6% increase. And as Rob mentioned, we estimate that for the first six months of 2015, the significant drop in scrap prices had a $0.03 negative impact on EPS, while the weak foreign currencies relative to the dollar added another $0.03 negative impact on earnings per share. As highlighted on slide 16, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this mix shift can distort the trend in consolidated margins. Accordingly, we have provided some extra segment-by-segment margin information in the presentation to provide more context as to what's going on the businesses. And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Revenue in North America during the second quarter of 2015 increased to $1.045 billion, or about 2% over 2014. This is the combination of a 6.3% organic growth in parts and services, offset by a 20% decline in other revenue, again the latter of which is due to the lower scrap prices. About half of the organic growth in parts and services was due to value, and half was due to price. You will recall that the organic growth rate of our North American parts and services business during the first quarter of 2015 was just under 5% due to the tough comparable results posted in Q1 of 2014. During the earnings call back in April, we mentioned that this growth rate would bounce back to normal levels, which it did. This was a solid quarter for our North American business. Gross margins in North America during the second quarter increased 40 basis points relative to last year, from 42% to 42.4%. This increase was primarily due to a solid 50-basis-point increase in our wholesale operations, offset by a decline at our self-service operations. On a sequential basis, the gross margin was lower than Q1, which as shown by the graph in the upper right hand corner of slide 17 is consistent with our normal seasonal trend. With respect to operating expenses, we lost 50 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of 2014. On the upside, our wholesale operations tightly controlled the head count which helped reduce facility and warehousing expense as a percent of revenue. In addition, we experienced continued improvements in fuel cost relative to last year, as diesel averages $2.85 a gallon in 2015 compared to $3.94 a gallon last year. This was the primary driver behind a significant improvement in distribution expenses in North America on a percent of revenue basis. However, these positive trends were largely offset by our self-serve unit, which experienced flat operating expenses but lower revenue to both the significant decline in scrap prices and the reduction in the number of cars purchase and processed. Slide 19 takes a closer look at scrap prices over the last 18 months. You will note that the average price we realized in the second quarter of 2015 was approximately $140 a ton, or down 36% compared to the average of $217 a ton realized in Q2 of last year. In total, the lower pricing reduced our revenue for the quarter significantly, and on a year-over-year basis had approximately a $0.012 negative impact on our EPS during the quarter. So in total, EBITDA for the North American business during the second quarter of 2015 was $139 million, reflecting a 1.2% increase over the last year. EBITDA for the wholesale operations increased 11% over the prior year, while the self-serve operation saw a decline. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the North American segment was 13.3%, down 10 basis points over the comparable period of last year. Again, the wholesale operations experienced a solid 80-basis-point improvement in EBITDA margins, but that was more than offset by a decline at our self-service operations, again with the later largely reflecting the impact of the lower scrap prices. Moving on to our European segment, total revenue in the quarter accelerated to $510 million from $465 million. Organic growth in Europe during the quarter was 10.1%, reflecting a combination of 11.6% organic growth at ECP and 6.2% growth at Sator. And the impact of acquisitions in Europe represented an additional 11.1% increase in revenue. These gains were offset by an 11.7% decline due to the translation impact of a strong dollar, creating a negative impact on revenue and resulting in total reported growth for our European parts and services business of 9.5%. Gross margins in Europe increased to 37.9% during the quarter, a 70 basis point improvement over the comparable period of last year, and a sequential improvement of 90 basis points over Q1 of 2015. While a bit of the Q2 pick up is seasonal, we benefited from improved procurement in the UK and the internalization of the gross margin from our 2014 acquisitions in the Netherlands. These are the highest quarterly gross margins we have achieved in Europe since early 2013. With respect to operating expenses in Europe, there were some gives and takes which netted out to a wash. On the upside, we benefited from the internalization of certain delivery activities that were previously outsourced at ECP, as well as lower fuel costs. On the downside, as mentioned we had higher SG&A expenses at both ECP and Sator. European EBITDA totaled $54 million, a 17.5% increase, even after taking into account the impact of the strong dollar. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA in the second quarter of 2015 was 10.6% versus 9.9% last year. Again, these EBITDA margins for the European segment are the best we've posted in over 18 months. We do anticipate the normal seasonal patterns will continue in 2015 and these margins will decline in the back half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. As noted on slide 22, relative to the second quarter of 2014 the pound decline 9% and the euro decline 19%. We estimate that the strong dollar reduced revenue significantly in EPS by about $0.018 during the quarter. As noted on this page, removing the impact of the currency swings would have resulted in second quarter European revenue growth of 21%, and given the margin improvement, EBITDA growth of 32%, which we believe is quite strong. Turning to the Specialty segment, revenue for the second quarter totaled $284 million, a 30% increase over the comparable quarter of 2014. Obviously the impact of the Stag acquisition in Q4 of last year accounted for the largest component of growth, but the organic growth of 6.6% was also quite strong. Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the second quarter remained generally constant with last year at 30.8% compared to 30.9%. The slight 10-basis-point decline is due to mix shift caused by the addition of the Stag business, which has lower gross margin than the core KAO operation. That said, operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down 120 basis points as we continued to see the leverage from integrating the Stag acquisition into the Keystone infrastructure, as well as the benefit of the lower fuel prices. EBITDA for this segment was $40 million, reflecting a 42% increase over last year, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased to 14.1% in 2015 compared to 13% last year. We are quite pleased with the 110 basis points expansion in EBITDA margins compared to the prior year. This is a highly seasonal business and the second quarter is by far the strongest, as demonstrated by the graph in the upper right corner of slide 23. So it is important to recognize that as we move through the back half of the year, you should expect the margins to moderate meaningfully as the selling activity moves lower. Let's move on to capital allocation, which given the working capital swings, lumpiness of capital spending and the timing of acquisitions, I think is best viewed on a year-to-date basis as presented on slide 25. You will note that our after-tax cash flow from earnings for the first six months was approximately $299 million, and we experienced a $16 million increase in working capital, resulting in approximately $283 million of cash provided by operations. The working capital uptick is the result of an increase in accounts receivable associated with our revenue growth, partially offset by a reduction in inventory as we continue to work our way down from the intentionally high balances held at year end to protect us from what we anticipated could be some potential port issues early in the year. Thus far in 2015, we have deployed $109 million of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $67 million to fund capital expenditures and $42 million to fund acquisitions and other investments. So for the first six months we generated $174 million of free cash and we used about $150 million of that repay our debt balances. We sourced an incremental $5 million from other financing sources. The remaining $29 million was added to our liquidity, and we closed the quarter with the approximately $143 million of cash, of which $85 million is held in Europe. At June 30, we had $1.7 billion of total debt outstanding, which on a GAAP basis was approximately 2.1 times our latest 12 month EBITDA, and if you factor in the full impact of the EBITDA for the acquisitions completed over the past 12 months, and back out our cash balances, the net debt to EBITDA ratio would be approximately 1.9 times. The weighted average interest rates on our borrowings during the quarter remained constant at 3.4%, and the available capacity on our credit facility was approximately $1.2 billion, which we believe provides adequate liquidity to fund the continued growth of our business. We are focused on return metrics for our company, and for the latest 12 months both our return on equity and return on invested capital are generally consistent with the levels achieved over the past five years. You should note that we've deployed a significant amount of capital over the past few years, and investment tend to have a lower return in those early years, which clearly has an impact on the metrics. We are, however, focused on driving these higher. As noted in our press release, we have adjusted our guidance on some of the key financial metrics for the year. As it relates to organic growth for parts and services, we have tightened the full-year range from what was 6.5% to 9%, to now 7% to 8.5%. In terms of earnings per share, we are narrowing the guidance a bit to $1.38 on the low end to $1.45 on the high end, and essentially leaving the midpoint alone. This all assumes that the pound sterling, euro, and Canadian dollar remain at current levels of $1.55, $1.10 and $0.76 respectively, and importantly, that scrap remains at approximately $140 a ton. We recognize that the earnings reported today exceeded the consensus estimates for the quarter, but we would encourage folks to neither add that difference to the current annual consensus, nor extrapolate that forward to the back half of the year. In particular, it is important to be sensitive to the seasonal trends of our businesses and the historical impact that has had on the revenue and operating margins. The consensus EPS estimate for the fourth quarter is currently $0.35, which appears overly optimistic in light of the normal seasonal patterns of our business. Finally, we've adjusted guidance for the income from operations up to $450 million to reflect the slightly lower investment in working capital, and we believe the guidance for capital spending is still valid at $150 million to $180 million. And at this point, I will turn the call back over the Rob. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Nick. Before we open it up for Q&A I wanted to end with a historical summary of our founding strategy and business model highlighted on slide 29, which today is still the nucleus of our company, and one that is cornerstone of our operating segments despite their unique mix of products and geographies. At founding, we saw the opportunity to create a national network of wholesale recyclers to service the North American body shop and auto repair industries. With this strategy, we look to acquire the best recycling locations with the best management teams and operators, and create a network that provided synergies through consolidating this fragmented industry. These yards, when combined in a given trading zone, would create the highest fulfillment rates in the industry, which today still holds true. This strategy continued when we entered the aftermarket collision business with the acquisition of Keystone to grow our North American alternative collision business, the European market with ECP and Sator, and the specialty space with KAO and tuck-ins like Stag-Parkway. While our European and Specialty businesses offer different products, and the vernacular can create confusion, make no mistake : The founding strategy and business model is consistent. Each of our businesses operate in fragmented markets that are ripe for consolidation. By buying the number one or number two players in the market, with the right management teams, we can begin to build a network that offers tremendous synergies and scale by offering industry-leading fill rates. Simply stated, in the vehicle parts business the distributor that has the part readily available, and can get it to the customer on time, wins the sale. We believe that we can offer that capability across all of our segments, and with more runway to grow. With this core strategy and operation model, I am confident that our team of over 30,000 employees will continue to add long-term value for our customers and stockholders. Devon, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. Our first question comes from Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Also thanks for slide presentation and guidance commentary. All of that has been very helpful today. Nick, first question on guidance, I just want to be clear, does it include either PartsChannel or Coast? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, they do. We're not anticipating that either of those are going to have material impact, Craig, on the back half for the year. It's going to take some time to get them fully integrated and the like. And obviously with Coast, we have to wait to see the results of the tender offer. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. And then with respect to the Tamworth DC, on slide 10 it looks like it'll cost $0.09 to $0.12 over the balance of two years. Could you frame the actual cost of the project and how much of that would be capitalized versus expensed? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well \u2013 Craig, this is Nick. Ultimately we're going to lease the facility, but all of the kind of the inner workings, if you will, are going to be capitalized and then depreciated over time. It's a fairly large investment on our behalf, it's on the order of \u00a375 million, so it's quite significant. We have to start paying rent when we take possession of the facility, which will be in early 2016. But it's going to take us some time to fit it out and get it up and running, the better part of a couple years, and so that's why Rob mentioned that we're going to have kind of duplicate rental expense for \u2013 because we're going to have four facilities for period of time, before getting down to two. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And then on a related note, I know you've taken greater care to understand future expectations in terms of what's embedded in consensus expectations. I guess I'm wondering, looking ahead to 2016 and 2017, although you haven't provided guidance, is it possible that none of us have really anticipated these costs, given that this is the first time you've really talked about them? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That would be my expectation, Craig, because we did want to get this out to the investment community as soon as we had a pretty good sense as to what was going to mean. We understand that a number of folks do longer-term projections, and there was no way for them to have an understanding as to what may be coming their way related to these projects. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): That's helpful. Thanks, and we'll get back in the queue. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Craig. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good morning, gentlemen. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Nate. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: So, couple things. One, it was nice to see the uptick in the gross margins across the board, and I know that fuel obviously helped on the distribution expense. But minus the normal seasonality and any impact from future acquisitions that might come in a little bit negatively, and I know that we have a little bit of mix shift, but apple to apples, are you guys fairly comfortable that we can kind of continue on a more stable run rate on the gross margin line? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Nate this is Nick. I think you have to take a look at that on a business unit by business unit basis, and that's why we provided the additional disclosure with respect to gross margins. You will see there is some quarterly fluctuations in the overall margin structures of the business. We provided the, basically the gross margins over the last six quarters, so we can kind of take that into account as well. The back half of the year in North America, the margins tend to be generally consistent with the second quarter but obviously down from the first quarter; European margins as well. There's a little bit of fluctuation, and then \u2013 so we would encourage you to take a look at the historical seasonal patterns, because that's the best guidance as to where we may head in the future. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then regarding the Alix project, obviously I think that that probably makes sense with where you are in your kind of build-out of the North American business. Is that kind of signal that there might be an opportunity overall to maybe enhance the operating margins a little bit, in terms of just some network efficiency? Is that one of the overall goals of that project, or is there something else embedded in that? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, that's exactly it, Nate. We've been a very decentralized company, and what we challenged ourselves to do was to figure out how that maintain that entrepreneurial spirit, yet get some operational efficiencies. So with that in mind, we focused on four key components that we are looking at. One is our sales organization; second is logistics, the fleet, because we have thousands of trucks on the road every day; purchasing, getting some more purchasing synergies; and then looking at our dismantling capabilities and how to get some best practices across our region. So yeah, we do expect some operating efficiencies to come, likely in 2016, mid-2016 we'll start seeing those results come through. But you're spot on, we wanted to make sure we had that entrepreneurial spirit still in the company; that's what the base of this company has been so successful on. So we're going to get the best of both worlds though this project. Assuming it goes the way we expect it to, we will look at Europe at some point, of doing the same process over there. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then final question, in terms of the ECP facility \u2013 and I get the fact that maybe we didn't anticipate the costs, upfront costs for that. But I assume that that's an indication, though, in terms of the bigger picture, where the opportunity is, not only in terms of new parts injection but in terms of just being a little bit more efficient with your distribution capability. In combining those facilities, I assume that the collision network's going to be a little bit more integrated with the mechanical side. So I mean, ultimately, that should get you a lot of synergies out of that, and probably a sign of positive things to come in terms of the potential volume growth that we could get out of that. Is that a fair assessment? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think that's right on. We're operating out of three buildings now; we are going to go to two eventually. The three buildings, by the way, are roughly 20 miles apart from each other as well. These are literally separated by a retention pond, these two buildings in Tamworth. So we will get some operating efficiencies for sure. And the automation that's coming with it as well will provide some nice pick up there as well, so... And finally, the other major aspects of doing it is to prepare for future growth. As I said in my remarks, Nate, that we have three buildings and we're already pushing the limits of those, so getting two in the same footprint will be greatly enhancing our capabilities to our customers. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then one last quick check-the-backs question and then I'll turn it over, but any update on State Farm? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Same. We still want to be meeting with them constantly, no decisions have been made, but as far as chrome and bumpers go I can give you an update on that. Quarter, up 16.9%, so they clearly are driving that product type for us. And fingers crossed that they came back here soon. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Nate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Jamie J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, and good morning. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Jamie. Jamie J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Congratulations by the way on a nice quarter. And let me just add on, the slides, thanks to Joe and Nick and team for all your hard work there. They are tremendously helpful. If I may, looking at your guidance, it looks like your \u2013 you've tightened your net income guidance but haven't really move the midpoint there, and yet your net cash from Ops guidance is up by $25 million. So I wanted to get into a little bit more detail as to what's driving that? And then maybe to sort of fast forward to a free cash flow question, how many more years do you expect to have this elevated level of CapEx to support things like the DC in the UK, the DC in Washington state and so forth? And are there any other big opportunities to invest in your future growth, sort of globally? Thanks. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'll start with the guidance. Again, we tightened up the range a little bit, essentially left the midpoint alone. The uptick on the free cash flow is basically a sense that our working capital needs are going to be less than we originally anticipated. And so we pulled in the net income range, $5 million off the top and up from the bottom. But it's really the working capital that's driving the $25 million uptick in free cash flow. All of our \u2013 most of our capital spending is to support the growth of our business, Our rough estimate is about 75% of what we spend is growth-orientated, as opposed to repair and replacement and the like. As long as there are really good opportunities to continue to grow our business, we will deploy capital behind our businesses. Obviously something like Tamworth, that maybe a once-in-a-moon kind of event for our companies, something that size and scale. But there are other situations across North America where we are going to be expanding warehouses, going into new distribution facilities to support the continued growth of our business. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I just want to add one thing to that, Jamie. As a percent of revenue, our capital has been pretty much in line. So to Nick's point, as long as there's opportunities to continue to grow the business, it will stay in line with that percentage of revenue. Jamie J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Understood. And just if I may, a quick follow-up, just a housekeeping item. Rob, you've talked about alternative parts usage historically in the U.S. and UK. Are there any update you can provide based on the data you're seeing in those markets? It's still around 9%, I assume, in the UK, and 37%-ish in the U.S., but I wanted to get your insights there? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That is correct. A little bit less in the U.S., circa 36% to 37%, it's been right in the middle there, teetering between the two. But we expected that in the U.S. with the recent surge in the new car park. We're seeing the same thing actually over the UK a little bit, with a strong SAAR rate right now, but we do expect as these new cars get into the sweet spot outside of three years, we are going to start seeing an uptick in the AP usage here in the U.S.. Jamie J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. Thanks again, and good luck in the third quarter. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Actually, just one last thing, as we highlight in the slide deck, in our investor deck, is the part count. I just wanted to give a quick update on that. There are actually up to 9.1 parts per estimate now, versus 7.9 just five years ago. So we are seeing more parts get on the estimate, and that's why we're kind of bullish, what we think is going to happen as these cars get into our sweet spot at three years we are going to see that growth in the AP usage. Jamie J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jamie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please proceed with your company \u2013 your question. Ben S. Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Ben. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Ben S. Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Just quickly on the UK collision side, you've talked in the past about the pilot program with insurance carriers. Any update there, what kind of progress you're making and what that pipeline looks like? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we're still at 17 carriers right now, Ben, in the program, which amounted to about 80% of the UK insurance base. So it's probably going to be at that number for a while. No one has pulled out of the program, and as I mentioned in my remarks, a 33% increase. So still getting traction and still heading in the right direction. As we've mentioned on previous calls, once we get our 322 built out, our three step to two step in the Netherlands, we will be introducing collision parts there with \u2013 many of the same carriers that write in the UK also write on the continent. So we are probably couple quarters away from launching some kind of program on the continent. Ben S. Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, very good. Secondly, looking at the Unipart branches, how have those progressed since you've made those acquisitions? Are they comping in line with the chain? What does profitability at those look like? What your thoughts on the progress there? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I'll talk about the \u2013 what we've been able to integrate. We've pretty much opened every one of those stores that we did, that we targeted. Remember, some \u2013 we closed two stores to make one, we either closed the ECP store or we closed the Unipart store brought in. That has been done. And we are starting to see the benefits of that. The employees are fully trained now our systems and taking phone calls, as we do in our normal course of business. As far as the profitability, it does kind of get melded in there into the overall mix, and \u2013 but we're very pleased with what we've done there, and as I said, we have 194 branches now, so we are certainly at the tail end of our build-out of 200 to 225, and we anticipate that being done in the next couple of years. Ben S. Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great. Lastly from me, we saw some pretty severe flooding in Texas. I'd be interested to hear if those cars are showing up at auction yet, what they look like? I would think with your predisposition toward buying higher quality vehicles, those would be a good fit for you, but just any commentary or color there would be helpful? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I'll go back to my days at the auction business. Those are great cars, as \u2013 in terms of their quality. Freshwater floods are really great because there's no body damage. We have not seen them start to flow through the auction yet. There is generally a lag of about 45 to 60 days before the pools can get access to the titles, but we do expect some really good salvage to be coming through. Ben S. Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks guys. Best of luck. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ben. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with C.L. King & Associates. Please proceeds with your questions. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, guys. I'll also add my appreciation for these slides. I think there are very helpful. Are there any construction costs for the Tamworth DC built into the second half of 2015 in your guidance? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : There are some just ancillary costs related to the project, Bill, but nothing of significance. Again, right now it's under construction as you can see by the slide that we put into the deck. It's a pretty massive facility, but ultimately the landlord is incurring those expenses. Obviously there's some broader project-related activities as we continued to plan out for the outfitting of the facility and the like, but nothing material. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Okay. In terms of the auction environment, can you talk about your average price that you paid per car for the quarter versus a year ago, and what you're seeing in the auctions overall in terms of supply and pricing trends? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, sure, Bill. This is Rob. Our salvage cost was basically flat. It was about $4 better a vehicle, but again we are buying a younger vehicle, so we know we're buying a better vehicle. On the self-service side of the business \u2013 really not so much in the auction, but we do buy some \u2013 we were down $81 to an average of \u2013 well, just under $400, which is all scrap-related. In terms of the volume at the auctions, very consistent. We track the number of cars at the auctions we visit; they're pretty much flat to slightly up. So plenty of availability. We're still only buying roughly 6% to 7% of the auction, so plenty of availability to keep driving the top line. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then in terms of vehicle miles driven, we know in the U.S. that we've had a pretty strong increase this year. Do you have any data for that in the UK or the Netherlands, by any chance? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We do not have that available. We know the SAAR rate is up, but we do not have miles driven on a European basis. But we'll have Joe get back to you on that. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Please proceed with your question. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Yes. Just a question on ECP's organic growth rate for the branches open more than 12 months. It came down a little bit in the quarter versus historical trends, and I was wondering if there were any one-time factors there? Or is that the rate we should expect going forward, just given the maturity of the branches? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, couple factors going on there, Jason. Certainly when we bought the business in 2011 with 89 locations, the 90th, the 91st to the 100th branch were obviously the lowest-hanging fruit. So we're getting at the tail end of that, so that's having a little bit of impact there. There is a surge of new cars as I just mentioned, so that's going to be a little bit of a headwind for the time being, until those cars get out of warranty. One thing that I do want to add, and we show that 12 month and over, that it does include our paint locations now. So that does drag it down a little bit. And then just one last point on that. In talking to our suppliers, they say that the market is generally a little soft right now. They equate it to the new car sales going up a little bit, and just general market conditions. They do expect it to rebound, so I think you'll still see mid- to high-single-digit growth out of the stores open more than 12 months. You take the paint out of there, it's actually little bit higher. But we are expecting, with the new stores as well as the stores in general, still double-digit growth here for the balance of the year. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : That's helpful. And then, how should be thinking about foreign currency and scrap for the second half for the year? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. If you take a look at the slide where we've kind of set out the historical scrap prices, right, in Q1 the comparison was $224 versus $141; in Q2, $217 in last year, $140 this year; Q3 of last year was $215; so scrap remained pretty steady last year. And if you assume that it's going to stay in the $140 range, we would expect \u2013 we lost a couple pennies in the first quarter, a penny in the second quarter, there is chance that there is a half a penny to a penny yet in Q3. By Q4, where the comparison gets a little bit better \u2013 Q4 of last year was $187, so if scrap stays at $140, it'd be probably more of a rounding error, if you will. So maybe another half a penny to a penny. On the FX, you can go through the same analysis. Really for the first three quarters of last year, the currencies stayed pretty consistent. On the euro, $1.37, $1.37, $1.33 for the first three quarters of last year. The pound sterling, $1.66, $1.68, $1.67. And so, it was \u2013 we talked about $0.02 in FX last quarter, it was actually $0.016 and rounded up. This quarter was another couple pennies, but again it's a rounding up, so $0.03 for the first six months. We're probably going to be in that same range for Q3, so think about maybe a penny and a half, plus or minus. In Q4, both the sterling and the euro started to drop a little bit, so probably a little bit less in Q4. We thought originally FX would hit us for $0.04 to $0.05. Last call, you may remember we talked about that the $0.08 to $0.10 from scrap and FX was probably going to get flipped, probably $0.06 or so from FX, and that's not a bad estimate. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please proceed with your questions. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Hi, guys. I think I have \u2013 the last question here just asked the same question I was going to ask. We're still looking at those same ranges for FX and scrap to impact your EPS guidance for this year, correct? I think it was like $0.03 to $0.04 for scrap and $0.05 to $0.06 for FX? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's correct. Again, scrap ended the quarter right around $137, $138. There's a lot of noise coming out of China about economic growth and the like, and there are some folks out there forecasting that, that scrap will get little bit softer here. We're assuming, at this point at time, a kind of a steady state on scrap. We'll have to see what the Fed does with interest rates and the impact that has to do on the dollar, but again, we're assuming that rates are going to stay relatively constant at $1.55 for the pound and about $1.10 for the euro. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Is scrap all really predicated on what goes on in China? Because I know Turkey is a big buyer of scrap, too. Are you hearing anything out of there? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Those are the two countries, Gary, you are right. I have not heard much out of Turkey, it's really China is the big one. The domestic mills seem to be doing okay. But Turkey and China will definitely drive the exporting, for sure. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brett Jordan (59:42) with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Unknown Speaker : Hey, good morning guys. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Brett (59:47). Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Unknown Speaker : In the Benelux, what percentage of your revenues are two step versus three now? Maybe you can give us some color what the spread on the margin is in those channels? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We'll have to get back to you on that, Brett (60:03). Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And part of it is, it's hard because once we make the acquisitions, it all gets integrated, if you will, into the \u2013 into our financial system. So it's not like we have a bunch of standalone P&Ls that we then roll up at the end of the month and the end of the quarter. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Thanks. And then I guess on PartsChannel, can you give us any color on what their productivity looked like versus your own aftermarket parts business? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm sorry, their productivity? Unknown Speaker : Yeah. Were they generally generating similar profits to you, or were they less productive because they had smaller scale? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think we'll be able to pull their margin up to ours, Brett (60:45), and they did get us into a few new markets, interestingly enough. So yeah, their margins were generally a little bit lower than ours, and they will come up to our numbers. Unknown Speaker : All right, great, thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, everyone, for your time this morning. And we look forward to speaking to you in October when we report our Q3 results. Have a great day, everybody. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joe Boutross, Investor Relations for LKQ Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Boutross. You may begin. Joseph P. Boutross - Director, Investor Relations : Thank you, Devon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us today are Rob Wagman and Nick Zarcone. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for the call. Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2014 and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.

A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release as well as the slide presentation. And, with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Rob Wagman. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Joe. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased with the results we reported this morning. And before I provide an update on our operations, let me briefly highlight a few key financial metrics from the quarter. Turning to slide three, Q3 revenue reached $1.83 billion, an increase of 6.4% as compared to $1.72 billion in the third quarter of 2014. Net income for the third quarter of 2015 was $101.3 million, an increase of 10.7% as compared to $91.5 million for the same period of 2014. Diluted earnings per share of $0.33 for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015, increased 10% from $0.30 for the third quarter of 2014. Please note that adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2015 would have been $0.34 compared to $0.31 for the third quarter of 2014 after adjusting each of the periods for net losses resulting from restructuring and acquisition related expenses and the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 6.8% for the quarter. And on a constant currency basis, total growth for parts and services was 14.9%. I am particularly pleased with our EPS performance, given the effect from FX and soft scrap steel prices, which, combined, negatively impacted the year-over-year change in EPS by $0.02. On a nine-month year-to-date basis, revenue was $5.44 billion, an increase of 7.7% from $5.1 billion for the comparable period of 2014. Parts and services organic revenue growth for the first nine months of 2015 was 7.3%. Net income for the first nine months of 2015 was $328.2 million as compared to $301.1 million for the first nine months of 2014. Diluted earnings per share was $1.07 for the first nine months of 2015 as compared to $0.98 for the comparable period of 2014. On an adjusted basis, year-to-date 2015 EPS was $1.10 versus $1.01 for the last year. Now a brief update on our operations, which are highlighted on slide six and seven. During the quarter, our North American operations continued to benefit from various macro trends. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, miles driven was up 4.2% in July, the latest reported figures available. This number represents the 17th consecutive month of increases in miles driven. With low gas prices and ongoing improvements in unemployment rate, we expect a continuation of this trend. Though initially a headwind, as newer vehicles requiring repair tend to receive new OE parts, the increase in the SAAR rate presents attractive growth prospects for alternative products as these vehicles age. The SAAR rate for Q3 2015 was 17.8 million units compared to 16.8 million units for Q3 2014, a 6.1% increase year-over-year. Simply put, increased new vehicle sales increased the size of the car park, which equates to more insured cars on the road, the likelihood of increased accidents and more repairs. These trends help drive North American organic growth for parts and services of 5.9% in Q3. During Q3, we purchased 71,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operation, which is a 1.4% decrease compared to Q3 2014. This reduction was a result of a healthy backlog of vehicles from the first half of 2015. During Q3, our pricing at auction was again flat year-over-year, but we were also buying a younger vehicle by over a half a year when compared to 2014. This younger vehicle procurement strategy continues to perform well as witnessed by the positive 30 basis point contribution year-over-year to our North American gross margins. Also, our North American aftermarket parts business witnessed a robust increase in the number of available certified parts in Q3. On a year-over-year basis, the number of certified SKUs increased 34%. This trend bodes well as the vehicles from the recent surge in the SAAR rate begin to move into our sweet spot of vehicles in the three-year to nine-year range, again, an ideal age range for alternative part usage. During Q3, our self-service retail business acquired 128,000 lower cost, self-service and crush-only cars as compared to 134,000 in Q3 of 2014 or a 4.5% decrease. Self-service faced some headwinds during the quarter, primarily centered on lower scrap pricing, which Nick will address shortly. And, lastly on North America, I want to provide a brief update on AlixPartners, the global business consulting and advisory firm we partnered with in Q2 to begin assisting us with identifying potential operational efficiencies within four key areas : parts procurement, route optimization, dismantling centers of excellence and sales force effectiveness. We have identified several significant opportunities in each of these key areas. However, I want to highlight an example with the sales force effectiveness test that we launched in Q3 at our Florida locations. The intent with this test was to create a defined sales and operations structure in Florida to enable a greater focus on improving the customer experience, while simultaneously developing high levels of productivity. For example, in order to gain efficiencies within our sales effort, we began leveraging a centralized phone system that is networked throughout the entire state. This system creates a seamless flow of calls between facilities, which reduces the time our customers wait for the next available representative and the risk of a lost sale. In addition, to drive increased sales productivity, we've established key performance indicators or KPIs. KPIs are primarily focused around maximizing total clock time and outbound call levels and coaching time, which is the time inside sales managers spend developing the effectiveness of our sales representatives. Though early in this initiative, we're quickly witnessing a reduction in personnel overlap, which has resulted in positive cost savings thus far. Now moving to our European operations. In Q3, our Wholesale European segment had organic revenue growth of 7.2% and acquisition growth of 5.7%, which was offset by a decrease of 9.9% related to foreign exchange rates. ECP's continued positive performance drove organic revenue growth up 10.1% in the quarter. And for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 6.2%. During the quarter, ECP opened four additional branches, bringing our UK network to 198 with four additional branches scheduled to open in Q4. During Q3, collision parts sales at ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 34%. ECP continues to execute on growing the collision business. And through the end of Q3, ECP operates 14 collision parts distribution centers dedicated to supporting the collision sales of their branch network. The targeted number of collision parts distribution centers necessary to cover the UK is 20. And we expect this to be completed by the second half of 2016. And, lastly, on ECP, I'd like to provide a brief update on our new 750,000 square foot national distribution warehouse, currently under development in the UK. This large project is currently on-time and on-budget. At this point, the shell of the warehouse is fully complete. And we're now planning the next phase, which is primarily focused on internal equipment infrastructure and the launching of the automation and logistical build out. For the quarter, we did not incur any material costs related to this project. Turning to Sator business. During the quarter, Sator witnessed additional gross margin benefit year-over-year, which contributed to a positive 260 basis point year-over-year improvement to our European gross margins. Also, during the quarter, Sator acquired four additional distributors of aftermarket automotive products in the Netherlands. These acquisitions largely completed our efforts of converting a portion of Sator's network to a two-step model and achieve our goal of operating over 80 branches of the market. Once fully integrated, this branch network should strengthen Sator's long-term prospects and margin profile and position the business well for our expected entry into the alternative collision parts market in the Benelux region, which we anticipate launching in 2016. Now onto the Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year revenue growth of 41% in the quarter, including the benefits of the Stag Parkway and Coast acquisitions and strong organic revenue growth of 10%. During the quarter, all integration activities from the October 2014 Stag acquisition were completed. In total, our Specialty team integrated 12 Stag warehouses into six existing KAO distribution centers, an impressive accomplishment in just one year. In addition, during Q3, our Specialty team opened a new 360,000 square foot warehouse in Michigan. This warehouse will provide improved inventory availability and service levels for our customers in the Great Lakes and Midwest regions. We're scheduled to begin receiving inventory at this warehouse mid-Q4 and begin distributing products early Q1 2016. And, lastly, on operations, in addition to the Netherlands distributors, during the quarter, our corporate development efforts included the closing of the previously announced acquisitions of Parts Channel, The Coast Distribution System and eight self-service yards in California from Ecology Auto Parts. At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on the financial results of the quarter. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone on the call. Over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of our three segments before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our revised guidance. For those of you who accessed our earnings presentation on the website, you will notice that we have included detail on both the third quarter ended September 30 and the first nine months of 2015. My comments will generally follow the flow of the presentation. But to be concise, I will focus on the quarterly results. The short version of our financial performance in the third quarter of 2015 would be that save for our self-service operation, we had a great quarter. We experienced solid revenue growth despite continued headwinds from lower scrap prices and the strong dollar. And except for our self-service operations, each of our businesses drove solid margin increases relative to the third quarter of 2014. As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $1.83 billion, representing a 6.4% increase over last year. That reflects a 10.7% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by a 30.8% decrease in other revenue, primarily related to the decline in prices for scrap steel and other metals, which I will address in a few minutes. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 6.8% from organic, 8.1% from acquisitions, before backing out 4.2% for the translation impact of FX. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results. As noted on slide 11 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins improved 30 basis points to 38.9% in the quarter. The uptick reflected approximately 70 basis points of improvement from operations, offset by 40 basis points of decline due to the revenue mix as the revenue growth of our Specialty business, which has the lowest gross margin structure, outpaced that of our other operations. We lost about 10 basis points of efficiencies in our operating expenses, largely due to our self-service operations. This operation experienced a meaningful decline in revenue related to the lower scrap steel prices and an uptick in expenses, the combination of which resulted in materially higher cost as a percent of revenue in each expense category. Outside of the impact of metal prices, our consolidated distribution costs as a percent of revenue benefited from lower fuel prices and our SG&A expenses benefited from the acquisition integration synergies in our Specialty operation. Segment EBITDA totaled $207 million for the quarter, reflecting an 8.2% increase from 2014. And, as a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 11.3%, a 20 basis point increase over the 11.1% recorded last year. The increase in EBITDA, when combined with the lower relative levels of depreciation, amortization and interest expense, allows pre-tax income to increase by 10.8% during the third quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year and the pre-tax margins expanded by 40 basis points from 8.1% to 8.5%. Our tax rate during the third quarter was down to 33.9% as compared to 34.0% in 2014. The tax rate reflects an effective rate of 34.75% for the quarter as well as a favorable adjustment to get us to that level on a year-to-date basis as we have been estimating an effective tax rate of 35.1%. As Rob mentioned, fully diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.33 a share compared to $0.30 last year, a 10% increase. And adjusted EPS was $0.34 a share compared to $0.31, again, approximately 10% improvement. As highlighted on slide 13, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since all of our segments have different margin structures, this mix shift does impact the trend in consolidated margins. And, with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the third quarter of 2015 increased to $1,037 million or about 1% over last year. This is a combination of a 7.9% growth rate in parts and services, offset by a 31.1% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was due primarily to lower prices received for scrap steel and other metals. Organic growth in the North American parts and services was 5.9%, reflecting a 6.5% increase in the core recycling and aftermarket activities being offset by minimal revenue growth from part sales in our self-service business. All in all, this was a very solid quarter for our North American operations. Gross margins in North America during the third quarter increased 30 basis points relative to the comparable period of the prior year from 41.9% to 42.2%. This increase was primarily due to our improved procurement in our salvage operations and a mix shift away from self-service, which has lower gross margins than our Wholesale operations. With respect to operating expense in North American, we lost about 80 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of 2014. On the upside, we continue to experience improvements in fuel costs relative to last year as diesel averaged $2.63 a gallon as compared to $3.84. As a percent of revenue, fuel costs declined by 40 basis points while we experienced some modest increases in facilities and SG&A expenses, resulting in an overall 10 basis point reduction in operating expenses as a percent of revenue for our Wholesale business. Unfortunately, the improvement in Wholesale was more than offset by our self-serve unit, which experienced a slight increase in operating expenses but meaningfully lower revenue due both to the significant decline in scrap prices and a modest reduction in the number of cars processed. As a result, operating expenses as a percent of revenue of our self-service operation increased very significantly on a year-over-year basis. And while self-service only represents a little bit less than 9% of total North American revenue, this large increase had a 90 basis point negative impact on the total operating expenses as a percent of revenue for North America. So we were up 10 basis points due to Wholesale, down 90 basis points due self-serve for a negative impact of 80 basis points. Slide 16 takes a closer look at the scrap steel prices over the past 21 months. You will note that the average price we realized in the third quarter of 2015 was approximately $123 a ton. We're down 43% compared to last year. In total, the lower pricing for scrap steel reduced our revenue for the quarter by approximately $29 million on a year-over-year basis. It is important to note that while we ended the quarter at approximately $109 per ton for scrap steel, the prices we have been receiving recently have fallen further. So we expect additional pressure in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline in scrap steel prices had approximately a $0.02 negative impact on our earnings per share during the third quarter. While we have been dealing with falling scrap steel prices for a while, during Q3, we also experienced a material decline in the prices received from other metals that are a residual of our recycling activities, including aluminum, copper, platinum, palladium and rhodium, which were down materially compared to the third quarter of last year. So while revenue from scrap steel was down $29 million during the quarter, revenue derived from selling aluminum, precious metals and catalytic converters was down an incremental $17 million compared to Q3 of last year. In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the third quarter of 2015 was $129 million, reflecting a 2.5% decline compared to last year. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the North American segment was 12.4% in Q3 of 2015, a 50 basis point decline over the comparable period the prior year. In both, dollar and percentage terms, the Wholesale operations improved relative to the comparable period of the prior year. But the overall segment results were down as a result of the decline at our self-service operations, again, with the latter largely reflecting the impact of lower scrap and other metal prices. Moving on to our European segment, total revenue in the third quarter accelerated to $511 million. Organic growth in Europe during the third quarter was 7.2%, reflecting a combination of 10.1% organic growth at ECP and nominal organic growth at Sator. The impact of acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 5.7% increase in revenue. But these gains were offset by a 9.9% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, creating a negative impact on revenue and resulting in total reported growth for European parts and services of 3%. On a constant currency basis, European revenue growth during the quarter was 13%. Gross margins in Europe increased to 38.3%, a 260 basis point improvement over the comparable period of 2014. Both Euro Car Parts and Sator experienced higher gross margins from operations, about 160 basis points collectively, as we continued to benefit from improved procurement in the UK and the internalization of the gross margin from our acquisitions in the Netherlands. The remaining balance of the improvement relates to the impact of Sator's acquisitions in 2014 and the related accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP, which depressed margins by about 100 basis points in the third quarter of last year. These are the highest quarterly gross margins we have achieved in Europe since early 2012. With respect to operating expenses in Europe, we lost about 70 basis points to largely due to higher SG&A expense at our UK operation, reflecting higher personnel costs to support the growth of the business, including our e-commerce development. European EBITDA totaled $53 million, a 26.4% increase, even after taking into account the impact of the strong dollar, which had a negative effect of $4 million. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA in the third quarter was 10.3% versus 8.4% last year, a 190 basis point improvement. These are some of the best EBITDA margins this segment has posted in quite some time. We anticipate the normal seasonal pattern will continue in 2015. And we would expect these margins will moderate in the fourth quarter. As noted on slide 19, relative to the third quarter of 2014, the pound sterling declined 7% and the euro declined 16% against the dollar. We estimate that for the third quarter the strong dollar reduced our European revenue by approximately $49 million compared to Q3 of last year. As noted on this page, removing the impact of the currency swings would have resulted in third quarter European revenue growth of 13% and given the margin improvement, EBITDA growth on a constant currency basis of 35%, which we believe is quite strong. When taking all currencies into account, the strong dollar reduced third quarter EPS by about $0.005 compared to last year. Turning to our Specialty segment, revenue for the third quarter totaled $283 million, a 41% increase over the comparable quarter of 2014. Obviously, the impact of the acquisitions of Stag Parkway in the fourth quarter of 2014 and Coast Distribution in August of 2015 accounted for the largest component of growth, but the organic growth rate of our Specialty business was 10%, very strong. Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the third quarter declined about 120 basis points compared to last year, largely due to procurement and pricing considerations in our Canadian operations, offset in part by a favorable mix shift towards more profitable lines. On the bright side, operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down about 150 basis points as we continue to see the leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network as well as the benefit of lower fuel prices. EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $26 million, reflecting a 45% increase over 2014. And, as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased 30 basis points to 9.2% in 2015. As noted in the last call, this is a highly seasonal business, and the fourth quarter is by far the weakest as demonstrated by the graph in the upper right-hand corner of slide 20. We expect the Coast acquisition will accentuate the margin drop in Q4. So you should expect the margins to again moderate meaningfully as the selling activity moves lower towards the end of the year. Now, let's move on to capital allocation, which, given the working capital swings, the lumpiness of capital spending, and the timing of acquisitions, is best viewed on a year-to-date basis, as set forth on slide 22. You will note that our after-tax cash flow from earnings for the first nine months was approximately $432 million and we experienced a $59 million decrease in net operating assets and liabilities, which were the primary drivers behind the $491 million of cash provided by operations during the first nine months of the year. Thus far in 2015, we have deployed $254 million of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $100 million to fund capital expenditures and $154 million to fund acquisitions and other investments. So for the first nine months, we generated $237 million of free cash and we used approximately $215 million of that to repay our debt balances. The remaining $22 million was added to our liquidity. And we closed the quarter with approximately $137 million of cash, of which about $87 million is held in Europe. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.6 billion of total debt outstanding, which, on a GAAP basis, was approximately 2.0 times our latest 12 months EBITDA. The available capacity on our credit facility was approximately $1.3 billion, which we believe provides adequate liquidity to fund the continued growth of our business. Finally, as noted in our press release, we have adjusted our guidance on some of the key financial metrics for the year as we lace to organic growth for parts and services. We are at 7.3% through the first nine months. We have tightened the full year range from what was 7% to 8.5% to 7.0% to 7.5%, which essentially implies 6% to 8% organic growth during the fourth quarter. In terms of earnings per share, we're narrowing the guidance a bit to $1.39 a share on the low end to $1.44 on the high end. This all assumes that the pound sterling, euro and Canadian dollar remain at current levels and, importantly, that scrap remains at current levels as well. The corresponding net income guidance is $428 million to $442 million. We have adjusted guidance for cash flow from operations up from $450 million during our last call to $525 million to $550 million, reflecting the continued solid cash earnings of the company and a moderate investment in working capital during the fourth quarter. And, finally, we have moved the guidance for capital spending down a bit to $135 million to $150 million, basically, reflecting the fact that we are at $100 million for the first nine months. And, with that, I will turn the call back over to Rob. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Nick. Looking at the remainder of the last quarter of 2015 and preparing for 2016, our outlook continues to be optimistic. We're laser-focused on our mission statement of being the leading global value-added distributor of vehicle parts and accessories by offering our customers the most comprehensive available and cost-effective selection of parts solutions, while building strong partnerships with our employees and the communities in which we operate. In North America, I am encouraged by the trends in miles driven, the continued growth in the average number of parts per claim, the increase in the per unit share of APU, the increased costs of repairs pushing carriers to seek alternative parts to lower their costs and the consistent pipeline of acquisition opportunities we're witnessing across all of our business lines. In Europe, the macro trends are also attractive. In the UK, new car registrations are annualizing at the highest level since 2005 with vehicle miles through June at the highest rolling annual total ever. Europe, as a whole, in 2014 witnessed its first registration increase since 2007, a positive long-term trend for the types of aftermarket mechanical and service parts we offer in this segment. In Specialty, the size of the SEMA market is material and fragmented, a cornerstone to our business model and founding strategy. We continue to identify deals within Specialty that, through acquisition, create tremendous synergies and scale within our existing network. And, in closing, I want to thank our over 31,000 team members who daily endeavor to drive organic sales, promote the use of alternative parts and implement operational efficiencies to enhance the productivity of our organization and enhance the experience of our customers, which, ultimately, will reward our stockholders now and over the long-term. And, with that, Devon, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone, and congrats on a good, solid quarter. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Nate. Good morning. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: So a couple things. I wanted to talk about a little bit in terms \u2013 over in Europe in terms of like ECP. You just mentioned, obviously, some good macro trends in terms of miles driven going on over there and, obviously, we have more parts injections. But, as you slow, obviously, that increase in branch count, we mature that, which we're getting close to, could you talk about the big drivers over the next several years like kind of in terms at least the footprint you have today beyond any additional acquisitions in terms of what are the opportunities, breaking it down in terms of just market share gains versus new product injections, et cetera? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Certainly, Nate, we're at the tail end. This year \u2013 so the end of Q4, we'll be over 200 locations. And we've always said the right number is 225. So we're certainly at the tail end. Obviously, the new park introductions are going to be huge for us. We plan on bringing reman parts into the marketplace, recycled parts as well. So there's a lot of opportunity to bring the products we have here in the U.S. over to the UK. So we do think the overall market conditions are good. On top of some of the tailwinds you mentioned, the strong surge in SAAR rate that we're seeing here in the U.S. is also occurring in the UK and on the continent. And we know when those cars come out of warranty they're going to be a real driver of the business. The average age of the car part in the UK is 7.8 years old, but it's expanding. And on the continent, it's 8.6 years old and expanding. So we think as these cars get older, it's going to provide a nice tailwind. The other thing that I do want to talk about really, what we've really been focusing on this last quarter is the focus on the gross margin there at ECP, as you saw in the numbers. So while initially a headwind in terms of really driving down our selling cost, our selling prices to the customers, we are going to see we believe a consistent effort to grow our top-line as well on top of that as well as the gross margin. So I think with all the macro drivers and some of the stuff we're doing internally, we're in good shape there. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Sounds good. Thanks for that. And then second question. Obviously, you pointed out some good initial results from your kind of endeavors on the consulting arrangement. And we talked about maybe seeing some benefits in 2016. And, obviously, this individual project in the small area had good results. Can you talk about maybe what you're seeing so far in terms of the opportunity to monetize any of those initial efforts across the entire network where it could produce something that actually is meaningful in terms of results for next year? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: >: Yeah. Let me talk about the four different areas that we're focusing on, Nate. First, routing software. We are launching our first routing software initiative next week in Florida. So that's our first shot at that. The purchasing area that we've been focusing on, we've got a lot of RFQs out in the marketplace today. So those will start coming in pretty soon. The sales changes I talked about in Florida are going well. And we do plan on expanding those. The last one on our list was the dismantling centers. We are bringing some Six Sigma black belts on to the payroll to work on getting those implemented. It just really is too early to talk about what the net gain is going to be, although initially we've been very pleased with what we think we're going to be able to attain here. But it really just is too early to monetize what the net effect is going to be. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. That makes sense. And I appreciate the time. And I'll turn it over. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Nate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Jim. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I wanted to ask as well on the European segment, just to the considerations for the fourth quarter as it relates to margins. You obviously had a great result in the third quarter but help us understand. You're balancing, I think, some easier compares year-over-year. If I recall, there's some pull forward costs related to a competitor bankruptcy last year and some other expansion. You've got a new UK facility, though, that's starting to come online as well this year. So how do we sort of balance that and how do we think about kind of the year-over-year trends looking forward into the fourth quarter? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You're right, Jamie. There was a bit of a pressure on margins over Europe in Q4 of last year. We think most of that is behind us. Again, we showed solid improvement during Q3. We do anticipate that the margins in Q4 should be a little bit better than last year. But it is a seasonal business, much more than here in the U.S. So it's important to keep that in mind. So we do anticipate that the margins will creep down in Q4 relative to where they are right now. Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So if I'm hearing, we should just moderate the rate of change that we saw in the third quarter when we're thinking about our fourth quarter models? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's fair. Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. And then just a quick question as well, maybe an update really on your plan to essentially buy fewer higher quality or higher priced cars. How is that progressing? Is it still kind of too small relative to the 200,000 or so you're buying to really be impactful? Or is that a bigger chunk of the pie than we're giving it credit? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're starting to see the benefits of that, Jamie, for sure, buying the better car. Obviously, as the car park gets a little younger, we're buying about a half a model year better for the same price. And I think what's really impacting our cost at auctions, quite frankly, is the strong dollar is keeping a lot of the exporters out. And, of course, scrap is bringing it down as well. But that's a strategic initiative we're moving forward. And we're very pleased with the results. We're actually getting more dollars per car than we did with the older car. Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Well, I would imagine an ancillary benefit though is probably pretty small, is sort of the reduced exposure to scrap in the sense that you're buying fewer cars, right? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Absolutely, yeah. That would certainly be a positive. But it's basically we're flat. We're down 1.4% year-over-year. And I think we'll be in that same range of about the same number of cars here going forward. We did have a healthy backlog coming out of Q1 and Q2, which did allow us to buy a little bit less in Q3. Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Well, thank you so much and congrats on a great third quarter. And good luck in the fourth. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jamie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions as well. Nick, the free cash flow upside this year has been the talk of investors, I guess, early this morning. What are the key factors behind that and how sustainable is it given it's driven by some working capital benefits? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Craig. There's no doubt that we have benefited on the working capital side. Again, the $491 million of free cash or operating cash flow, if you will, for the first nine months reflects strong earnings, basically $432 million, but then a net decrease in working capital. I don't believe that we're going to be able to run the business for the next several years continuing to reduce the amount of working capital. Again, some of that has to do with the fact that Q4 of last year at year-end \u2013 again, we really bulked up the inventory in anticipation that there could be some issues at the ports during the first quarter and second quarter. And so our inventory balances are actually coming down from the end of last year. Again, we had some increase in payables as well, which helped matters. So we took the guidance for the year up just reflecting the fact that we're well ahead of where we anticipated we would be. But, again, I think, for modeling purposes, folks should assume that, on an ongoing basis, we're going to need to increase working capital pretty much in line with our revenue growth. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): As a follow-up, just given the upside, even though it may not be entirely sustainable, but still strong, is there an opportunity to go to your rating agencies and look for a re-rating of any kind? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Probably not. I mean, we keep in constant dialogue with both Moody's and Standard & Poor's. We think we've got a great relationship there. At the end of the day, it's going to take a little bit more than just an uptick in free cash flow, if you will, I think, to get us to investment grade land. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And then just, lastly, on your facility in the UK, the new distribution center you're working on. I'm curious if you can quantify what you think might be some of the benefits from a fulfillment rate perspective or a delivery frequency perspective. I'm trying to compare it really to a competitor in the U.S., O'Reilly, which has used really some scale advantages as a distribution center operator to take meaningful share. And I'm wondering if that's a decent analogy. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it is correct. We will be able to service our branches much better. And with the excess capacity, we'll have deeper inventories as well. So I think we can buy better as well. Hopefully, we'll be able to buy bulk, much larger and be able to service our branches and our hubs much quicker with that facility. It's going to be fully automated \u2013 a good portion of it's going to be automated that will allow us to be real efficient in terms of space and everything else. So a real positive and I think it's going to really allow us to get a lot more efficient on both the sales and service side of the business. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Craig. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : Hi, Good morning. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Tony. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : The first question I have \u2013 and it looks like all of your businesses outside of sort of the metals exposed are doing well. But when you look at the comment, I think, you talked about 2016 introduction of alternative parts in the Sator business. Can you maybe give a little bit more understanding of the process that's involved there, sort of, the ramp time and what you see as the opportunity as you introduce those newer alternative parts? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Tony. Obviously, we have 17 carriers in the UK that we're going to use them as our launching pad as we get to the continent. Many of those right also in the continent, so from the UK, so we have those relationships already built. In terms of the product, it's the same vendors we're using in the UK, so that won't be difficult. It's really just getting \u2013 our first process was to flip from three step to two step. And now that we're virtually done with that, now we can control that last mile of distribution. So it's really going to be working with the insurance companies on the continent to show them our results that we've had in the UK. In terms of the market opportunity, the OEs have about a 93% market share on the continent, so lots of opportunity. We've been very successful in the UK, as we mentioned in my script, 34% growth year-over-year. And the numbers are getting larger and larger obviously as we continue to grow that side of the business. So we think there's a sizable opportunity, once we get the products launched in the Holland (45:06) market. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. Is it similar to, with respect to the U.S., in terms of you get to a certain point and then maybe there's a little bit more pushback, but it's easier to introduce parts when the concentration is so heavy on the OE side right now? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think that's fair. And it's actually interesting. I think as we get deeper and deeper, it actually gets easier. There won't be a pushback. The initial pushback comes at the beginning, getting people to switch and trust the ability for us to service the customer. Once that's accomplished, I think, it gets so much easier, actually. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. And then if I could ask one more question. The self-serve side of the businesses, we're talking a lot about scrap and the negative overhang on metals. I'm assuming the demand side at your self-service business is still very strong and robust relative to the market. And, one, is that true? And then, second, as you look at scrap, these prices are down at levels we saw back in 2008 and 2009 after being up at $250, $300 a crushed ton. Do you get the same lag time in terms of recovery as you do feeling the pressure? So you got 60 days, 90 days of recovery on between the time you buy the car and when you crush it. On the flip side, coming out of it or if scrap prices reverse, do you then get the benefit on that lag time as well? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I'll take the question about the demand and I'll let Nick talk about the scrap. The demand, our admissions have never been higher actually at our facilities. The average model year car in the United States is 11.4 model years old. So the demand is very strong. That's not an issue whatsoever. What we're seeing a little bit is scrap prices have dropped. Some of the people that we procure the product from, the tow yards, the municipalities, et cetera, some of these people are hoarding the inventory until scrap comes up. So it's a little more difficult to purchase our products, but the demand is as high as it's ever been. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yep. And on the scrap, self-service has roughly a 90-day, maybe 120-day time between where the cars \u2013 we purchase the cars. They are then fed into our facilities and then ultimately head to the crusher. So, on the full service side, obviously, that's a much longer duration. But three months to four months we basically turn the inventory on the self-serve side. So, in theory, as prices begin to head in a northward direction as opposed to a southward direction, we should get benefit there as well. It all has to do with the price that we paid for the car and the underlying value that we're getting from the scrap. And we've actually been able to buy pretty effectively. We're bringing our purchase price for the cars down as scrap prices has fallen. But, again, there is always that lag there. And that lag will be there on the way up as well. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And just to put some color on that, Tony. Our average price at a self-serve location is down $103 per car year-over-year. So, we've taken a lot of cost out of the purchase. And the full service is down $18 year-over-year. But, again, I think that's a little misleading because we are buying a better car. So I think we're actually doing much better than the $18 shows. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. That's great. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Tony. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Ben. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Just touching on the specialty industry. Following the Coast acquisition, are there any other sizable competitors there or anyone of any meaningful competitive threat? And then, when you think about the product offerings that you offer today, are there any offerings that you would like to bring onboard or that you could potentially bring onboard through bolt-on acquisitions? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Ben. There are sizable competitors in the marketplace still. Remember, we operate in the entire SEMA market which is well over $34 billion. We're only operating in the $5.6 billion part of that segment. So lots of competitors out there still and a lots of opportunities to keep growing the business. And that pipeline in our industry \u2013 that acquisition pipeline is very active actually, that side of the business. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then just touching on the ECP same-store sales, branch growth. Obviously, strong new car sales, I suspect, are creating a little bit of a near-term headwind, obviously a long-term tailwind. Is that mid to high single-digit growth expectation you laid out for the full year on the last call still a reasonable expectation? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it is. I think with just some of the macro trends, they're benefiting from miles driven increasing. The new car park, as we just mentioned, as I said earlier, once that car ages three years, gets out of the warranty side of the business, we expect our business to be very strong there, so, on that side. The collision is still doing very well. I think our paint business is dragging down the organic. It was never going to grow at the size of the parts business. So that's kind of bringing in the number a little bit. But I do feel pretty confident that strong single-digits, low double-digits are going to be achievable with the macro trends we're facing. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ben. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with C.L. King & Associates. Please proceed with your question. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, gentlemen. So kind of related to that last one. In Europe, your organic growth was 7.2%, which is below the trend we've seen elsewhere. ECP is still is pretty strong, about 10%. Anything to call out in the Netherlands in terms of the organic growth rate? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Two things on the Netherlands, Bill, that are probably worth noting. We had a really strong Q2. It was a very mild spring on the continent. And we believe a lot of that repair work may have been pushed from Q3 into Q2. And the other thing that we're doing is obviously with the heavy acquisitions we're doing from three-step to two-step, there's a lot of revenue moving as we acquire new businesses we're cannibalizing from other locations. So it may be shifting from an older location that was comping to a newer location that we didn't get the benefit of the organic growth. So we do think that's going to start to level out again and will be back to where we think we should be, which is mid single-digits of organic growth. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Got it. And then a question maybe for Nick. You had a $3 million other income item on your P&L. What was that? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Most of it related to FX items. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: So kind of non-cash then or the hedges or what? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Mostly non-cash items, Bill. Again, nothing material. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Okay. So not \u2013 and also, I guess, sort of non-recurring then? I mean is that something we should be looking for in the quarters ahead? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. I mean, the FX goes along with where the currencies are swinging and the like. So we would never kind of plan on that being a recurring item. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Understood. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Bret. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Just housekeeping. Could you give us what you have for the alternative parts penetration year-over-year in North America and then the UK number? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In the U.S., we get quarterly updates, but it's really moving. But it's in that 36% to 37% range. And in the UK, we're closer to 9% plus. The last figure we got from Solaire (53:21) at the time. Up from 7%, we got in the business, Bret, in 2012. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then, in Specialty, as you're looking around the M&A environment, I guess, you wouldn't be buying a manufacturer. Would you buy a to-consumer brand like a Summit or a JEGS or a QuadraTec or is that too much sort of a catalog retail presence? You need more of a distribution model. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We do play in that performance side of the business, Bret. That is one of the segments we are in. We certainly would look at anything that we could obviously lever. They do have \u2013 both of those companies have a strong e-commerce presence, which is attractive to us. But at this point, we're just looking at all of the opportunities. And since they are in that segment, we certainly would be interested in that business. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then, one last question. On ECP, the 6.2% comp, do you have a feeling for what the underlying market growth was there? I mean, that would seem to be a share gain comp, but do you know what the number that you're selling against was? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The 6.2% comp? Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Yeah. I think you said the 12 month and older ECP stores were up 6.2%. What was the market up do you think? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We've been told the market is growing circa GDP, so 2%ish. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Bret. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Please proceed with your question. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Hello, guys. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Jason. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Just looking at FX and scrap, assuming that rates and prices remain at current levels, what do you expect the EPS impact will be in the fourth quarter? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Again, if FX rates stay where they are today, again, probably a little bit less than $0.005, on the scrap side, figure $0.02 relative to last year. I mean we continue to chunk down. And the scrap prices really didn't start to come in meaningfully until early Q1 of this year. So we won't get the real benefit. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : And then, how about the tax rate for the fourth quarter? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You should assume for the year that we'll be at the 34.75%. That's our best estimate at this point in time. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Okay. And then, finally, if you wouldn't mind providing an update on the State Farm aftermarket chrome bumpers, as well as your JV in Australia. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Jason, on State Farm, the bumpers, the ones that they are writing in the aftermarket were up 16.6% year-over-year, so really impressive growth. We now have 467 certified parts available just in the bumper line, so very pleased with that. We talk to State Farm all the time, nothing more than that. On Australia, we keep moving forward with the partnership there. And it's a slow, steady race, but growing our top-line very nicely and expect to do a little bit more here in the coming quarters in terms of potential acquisitions and more product entry. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Thank you very much. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jason. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Van Horn with FRB (sic) [FBR] (56:47) Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Van Horn - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Just a quick question on Sator and I apologize if you went over this. But could you just update it now that you've kind of completed these four acquisitions, update us on the competitive landscape over there and where you guys are kind of positioned? And have you quantified kind of the addressable market for that business after these acquisitions? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It's a competitive marketplace. We're now in a position to really control that last mile of distribution. So we do still have some wholesale customers as well. So we're kind of playing in both of the markets. The car park is growing there. And it presents a great opportunity. We think that our small entry into France \u2013 we have three locations in France \u2013 provides another opportunity to keep growing the business. So we think it's a great opportunity to really grow the business in all segments of the markets we operate, the Benelux, as well as the France markets as well. Christopher Van Horn - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: And these last four really puts you at a competitive advantage over some of the other guys over there, right? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We certainly believe that now that we're pretty much where we need to be in terms of the three-step to two-step, we're in a great position because our inventory is strong. We can leverage not only our existing inventory in the Netherlands, but we have backup in the UK as well. So we think we're in a great position. Christopher Van Horn - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. Good stuff. And then secondly on Coast, have you guys talked about \u2013 is the dynamics in that market similar to auto in terms of the sweet spot of the age of the vehicle? And what kind of trends are you seeing in the addressable market there? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Remember the Coast business and our accessory business really isn't tied to collisions. It's more tied to the upgrading of the vehicle or accessorizing of the vehicle. So it's really tied to the SAAR rate. As new car sales and new RV sales continue, people are more likely to accessorize their vehicle at time of purchase. So we think we're in a great position on all side of the accessory business because of that strong SAAR rate. People are going to do this, most likely upgrade their vehicle at the time of purchase. The other thing that's attractive about that is the dealerships often finance those type of upgrades. So they roll right into the notes. So we're pretty optimistic. As long as the SAAR rates stay strong, we've got a nice tailwind there. Christopher Van Horn - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. Thanks for taking the call again. Thanks. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Christopher. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Devon. Thank you, everyone, for your time this morning. And we look forward to speaking with you in February when we report our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Rob Wagman. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Joe. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are again delighted with our quarterly and full year results, and before I provide an update on our operations, let me briefly highlight a few key financial metrics from the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015. Turning to slide three, Q4 revenue reached $1.75 billion, an increase of 3.8% as compared to $1.68 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact to our Other Revenue category, revenue grew 8% for the quarter. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $95.1 million, an increase of 18.1% as compared to $80.5 million for the same period of 2014. Diluted earnings per share of $0.31 for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015, increased 19.2% from $0.26 for the fourth quarter of 2014, while adjusted EPS increased from $0.27 to $0.32. Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 6.2% for the quarter, and on a constant currency basis, total growth for parts and services was 10.9%. I am particularly pleased with our EPS performance, given that the effect from FX and weakness in commodity prices, which combined negatively impacted the year-over-year change in EPS by $0.03. For full-year 2015, revenue reached $7.19 billion, an increase of 6.7% as compared to 2014. For the first time ever, revenue surpassed $7 billion, a major milestone for the company. Net income for the full year was $423.2 million, compared with $381.5 million for the prior, an increase of 10.9%. Organic revenue growth for parts and services for 2015 was 7%, a solid performance given the tough comp of 9% in 2014. On a constant currency basis, total revenue growth for 2015 was 10.1%, while total revenue growth for parts and services was 14.1%. Our adjusted EPS for all of 2015 was $1.42, representing an increase of 11.8% from the $1.27 reported in 2014, again, net of the adverse impact of FX and commodity pricing. Now a brief update on our operations, which are highlighted on slides six and seven. During the quarter, our North American operations continued to benefit from various macro trends. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, miles driven was up 3.5% in 2015 as compared to 2014. Miles driven in 2015 was the highest number reported since 1990. With low prices and ongoing improvements in the unemployment rate, we do expect a continuation of this trend. Though initially a headwind, as newer vehicles requiring repair tend to receive new OE parts, the increase in the SAAR rate presents attractive growth prospects for our alternative products as these vehicles age. The SAAR rate for 2015 was 17.4 million units, compared to 16.4 million units for 2014, a 6.1% increase year-over-year. Auto industry analysts expect this trend to continue in 2016, which again should be good for our North American collision businesses as well as our specialty segment. These trends helped drive North American organic growth for parts and services of 5.6% in Q4, despite the mild weather patterns we faced throughout December. During Q4 and for full-year 2015, we purchased over 73,000 and 288,000 vehicles, respectively, for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is essentially flat year-over-year for both periods. During Q4, our pricing at auction was flat compared to Q4 2014, but we were also buying a younger vehicle by over one year. This younger vehicle procurement strategy continues to perform well and played a role in the improvements we witnessed in Q4 year-over-year in North American gross margins. For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings, as well as the total member of certified parts available, each growing 13.2% and 32.2% respectively in 2015. In our self-service retail business, during Q4 we acquired over 112,000 lower-cost self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 4% decrease over Q4 2014. For full-year 2015, vehicle procurement was approximately 471,000, a decrease of 8.4% from 2014. As mentioned on past calls, this reduction in the self-service procurement was intentional, given the dynamics we faced with the scrap markets throughout the year. Nick will provide more detail on scrap during his comments, and in particular its impact on revenue. Turning to the 2015 results of our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC Information Services, the revenue and number of purchase orders processed through the CCC platform during 2015 each grew 66% respectively year-over-year. Clearly, the trend towards shops adopting this feature within the CCC platform continues to gain traction, with this initiative currently annualizing over $28 million in revenue for LKQ. And lastly on North America, I want to provide an update on our productivity initiatives to identify potential operational efficiencies. As mentioned on previous calls, we have identified several significant opportunities in four key areas, with one of them being procurement. During the quarter, AlixPartners led an internal focus group tasked with assessing our current maintenance, repair and operations, or MRO, and indirect spend categories, and the details behind what we can change or can consolidate. Following this extensive analysis, we modified and redefined several positions within our procurement team in attempt to optimize our ability to capture the potential savings uncovered. Though early in the process, we are extremely encouraged by the savings we could achieve in areas of both direct spend on after-market parts and the MRO, and the indirect spend categories such as logistics, corrugated boxes and shipping supplies, vehicle rentals, IT hardware, and various services. While it will take a few quarters for the savings on parts purchases to be realized and rolled through our inventory turns, we anticipate we will begin to realize some of the savings on the other items in late Q1 of this year. Now moving on to our European operations. In Q4, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth of 6.3% and acquisition growth of 5%, which was offset by a decrease of 6.7% related to foreign exchange rates. During Q4, ECP drove organic revenue growth of 8.9%, and for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 6.8%, solid performance given that the UK witnessed one of the warmest and most mild winters since 1985. During the quarter, ECP opened one additional branch, bringing our UK network to 199, an increase of 110 branches since we acquired ECP. With the continued market opportunities in the UK, I am pleased to announce that we approved an additional 13 branches in 2016. During Q4, collision parts sales at ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 21.2%. I am pleased with the continued double-digit performance in this line of business, especially given the mild Q4 weather in the UK and a tough 2014 comp. And lastly on ECP, I'd like to provide a brief update on our new 750,000-square-foot national distribution warehouse, currently under development in the UK. Upon completion of the building shell in early February 2016, we began our lease payments and also started absorbing duplicate expenses that will continue through 2017 as we begin to move towards finalizing the full consolidation of our existing NDCs into this state-of-the-art facility. Nick will cover the impact of those costs shortly. During Q1, we began installing interior racking in preparation for using the facility for bulk storage in Q2, with the automation and more sophisticated storage spaces scheduled to be completed in 2017. For the quarter and for full year 2015, we did not incur any material costs related to this project. And now turning to our Sator business. With the network build-up in the Netherlands largely completed via a combination of acquisitions and innovative partnering solutions, Sator has now turned its focus towards integrating the systems in place at the wholesale level. By year-end 2016, we plan to have consolidated from six systems to two, with integrated end-to-end inventory and customer visibility, a key enabler for driving logistical and working capital improvements in the business. And now to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year total revenue growth of 16.2% in the quarter, including the benefits of the Coast acquisition and strong organic revenue growth of 8.1%. During the quarter, all integration activities from the Coast acquisition continued as planned. In total, our Specialty team integrated 5 of the 17 Coast warehouses into our existing KAO distribution centers, with two additional warehouses integrated in January. In addition, during Q4, our Specialty team stocked the 360,000-square-foot warehouse in Michigan, mentioned on the previous call, and in January we officially began shipping product from this facility. I am also pleased to announce that in 2015, the Specialty team achieved two significant milestones. For the first time, Specialty eclipsed $1 billion in annual revenue and made over 1 million delivery stops. Congratulations to our Specialty team for reaching such an impressive milestone. Now on to corporate development. In December 2015, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Rhiag-Inter Auto Parts, a leading pan-European business-to-business distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles, for an enterprise value of \u20ac1.04 billion. This acquisition gives us access to the rapidly growing Eastern European market, and of course Italy, where Rhiag's base business is well positioned for continued growth beyond their current 15% market share. The targeted closing for Rhiag is progressing as expected, with all the filings required by the EU and Ukraine regulatory authorities submitted, accepted and deemed complete. Those regulatory agencies are now in the final review process, and we anticipate this deal to close in the first half of 2016. In addition to the Rhiag announcement, during the fourth quarter of 2015 we acquired a wholesale salvage business in Sweden and an interest in a pan-European distributor and remanufacturer of engines and powertrain products. Lastly, earlier this month the company sold its interest in ACM Parts, our JV in Australia, to our JV partner Suncorp. LKQ played a pivotal role in the creation of ACM Parts, and we will continue to have a strong working relationship with the business. Key formal strategic alliances between ACM Parts and LKQ, particularly those related to aftermarket parts sourcing and technology, will remain in place. This transaction allows us to maintain a presence in Australia while redeploying our capital, both human and financial, towards the multiple opportunities we have in Europe. Clearly, 2015 was another very active year, with our development efforts resulting in the completion of 18 acquisitions, which combined, expanded our geographic footprint and extended our leadership position in each of our operating segments. At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our 2016 guidance. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'm delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter, and over the next few minutes I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of the three segments, before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our guidance for 2016. For those of you who accessed our earnings presentation on the website, you will notice that we have included detail on both the fourth quarter ended December 31 as well as the full year of 2015. My comments will generally follow the flow of the presentation, but as usual, I will primarily focus on the quarterly results. The short version of our financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2015 would be a repeat of the third quarter. Save for our self-service operation, we had a great quarter in which we experienced solid revenue and earnings growth despite the continued headwinds from lower scrap prices and the strong dollar. As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.75 billion, representing a 3.8% increase over last year. That reflects an 8% increase in revenue from parts and services, offset in part by a 38% decline in other revenue, primarily related to the continued decline in prices for scrap steel and other metals, which I will address in a few minutes. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 6.2% growth from organic activities, plus 4.7% from acquisitions, equated to constant-currency growth of 10.9%, before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 2.9% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results. As noted on slide 11 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins improved 40 basis points to 39.9% during the quarter. The uptick reflected approximately a 50-basis-point improvement from operations, offset by a 10-basis-point decline due to revenue mix, as the revenue growth in our Specialty business, which has the lowest gross margin structure, outpaced that of our other operations. We lost about 20 basis points of efficiencies in our operating expenses, again largely due to our self-service operations. Those operations continued to experience a meaningful decline in revenue related to the lower scrap steel prices and an uptick in expenses, the combination of which resulted in materially higher cost as a percent of revenue in each expense category. Outside of the impact of metal prices, our consolidated distribution cost as a percent of revenue benefited from lower fuel prices, and our SG&A expense benefited from the acquisition integration synergies in our Specialty operation. Segment EBITDA totaled $193 million for the quarter, reflecting a 5.7% increase from 2014. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 11.0%, a 20-basis-point improvement over the 10.8% recorded last year. The increase in EBITDA, when combined with lower relative levels of depreciation and amortization and interest expense, allowed pre-tax income to increase by 7.5% during the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year, and pre-tax margins expanded by 30 basis points to 8.0% from 7.7%. Our net tax rate during the fourth quarter was 30.4%, down from 37.3% in 2014. The tax rate reflects an effective rate of 34.55% for the quarter, as well as a favorable adjustment to get us to that level on a year-to-date basis, as we have been accruing at an effective rate of 34.75% through the first three quarters. The 2015 annual rate reflects a favorable shift due to a relative increase in earnings sourced from the UK, which has a low tax rate. We also benefited from a few discrete items during the quarter, including a couple of deferred tax adjustments due to favorable state or foreign tax rate changes, a couple of refunds, and some FIN 48 reserve releases due to settlements or statute expirations. As Rob mentioned, fully diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.31 compared to $0.26 last year, a 19% increase, and adjusted earnings per share before restructuring charges was $0.32 a share versus $0.27, again reflecting a 19% improvement. A solid fourth quarter brought our adjusted EPS for the year to $1.42 which is exactly the midpoint of our guidance provided in February of 2015, notwithstanding the fact that the plunge in scrap prices had a $0.07 negative impact and the strong dollar had a $0.04 negative impact on our year-over-year EPS growth during 2015. As mentioned in December, starting in 2016 we are changing the definition of adjusted EPS to exclude the after-tax impact of intangible amortization. As highlighted in Appendix 4 on page 32 of the slide deck, 2015 adjusted EPS under the new definition is $1.49 a share. As highlighted on slide 13, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to the varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins, and that will become more accentuated once we close the pending Rhiag acquisition and we begin to consolidate the Rhiag results. And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the fourth quarter in 2015 increased to $1.018 billion, or almost 1% over 2014. This is the combination of a 7.9% growth rate in parts and services, offset by a 39% decline in other revenue, again the latter which was due to the lower prices received for scrap steel and other metals. Importantly, organic growth in North American parts and services was 5.6%. All in all, this was a very solid quarter. Margins in North America during the fourth quarter increased 90 basis points relative to the comparable period of the prior year, to 43.2% from 42.3%. This increase was primarily due to our improved pricing to customers in our aftermarket operations, improved procurement in our salvage operations, and a mix shift away from self-service, which has lower gross margins than our wholesale operations. With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we lost approximately 90 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of 2014. On the upside, we continued to experience improvements in fuel costs relative to last year, as diesel fuel averaged $2.43 a gallon compared to $3.58 a gallon. As a percent of revenue, fuel costs declined by 40 basis points, while we experienced some modest increases in facility and SG expenses in our wholesale business. Unfortunately, our self-serve unit experienced an increase in operating expenses, but meaningfully lower revenue due both to the significant decline in scrap prices and a modest reduction in the number of cars processed. As a result, operating expenses as a percent of revenue for our self-service operation increased very significantly on a year-over-year basis. Slide 16 takes a closer look at scrap steel prices over the past 24 months. You will note that the average price we realized in Q4 of 2015 was approximately $82 a ton, down 56% compared to the average of $187 a ton realized in Q4 of last year. In total, the lower pricing for scrap steel reduced our revenue for the quarter by approximately $26 million on a year-over-year basis. The decline in scrap steel prices had approximately a $0.03 negative impact on our EPS during the quarter. Scrap steel prices have leveled out the last few months, and hopefully we will not see continued deterioration. While we have been dealing with falling scrap prices for a while, during Q4 we also experienced a continued material decline in the prices received for other metals that are a residual of our recycling activities, including aluminum, copper, platinum, palladium and rhodium, which were down between 20% and 45% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. So while revenue from scrap steel was down $30 million during the quarter, revenue derived from selling these other precious metals and catalytic converters, excuse me, was down an incremental $16 million compared to Q4 of last year. So in total, the falling metals prices depressed our North American business by approximately 160 basis points during Q4 of 2015 relative to the margins in the prior year. In total, for the North American business during the fourth quarter of 2015, the total EBITDA was $131 million, reflecting a 1.3% increase compared to last year. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA for North America was 12.8%, flat with the comparable period of the prior year. In both dollar and percentage terms, the wholesale operations improved relative to the comparable period, with EBITDA margins being up 70 basis points, but the overall segment results were flat as a result of the decline at our self-service operations. Moving onto our European segment. Total revenue in the fourth quarter accelerated to $487 million from $465 million. Organic growth in Europe during the quarter was 6.3%, reflecting the combination of 8.9% growth at ECP and just under 1% at Sator. The impact of acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 5% increase in revenue, so on a constant currency basis, European revenue was up 11.3%. These gains were offset by a 6.7% decline due to the translation impact with the strong dollar, creating a negative impact on revenue and resulting in total growth for Europe of 4.6%. Gross margins in Europe increased to 38.9%, which was a 160-basis-point improvement over the comparable period of 2014. Both ECP and Sator experienced higher gross margins from operations, as we continued to benefit from improved procurement in the UK and the internalization of the gross margins from acquisitions in the Netherlands. These are the highest quarterly gross margins we have achieved in Europe since early 2012. With respect to operating expenses in Europe, we loss about 40 basis points, due largely to higher SG&A expense at our UK operation, reflecting higher personnel cost to support the growth of the business, including our e-commerce development. European EBITDA totaled $47.4 million, which was a 23.6% increase, even after taking into account the impact of the strong dollar, which had a negative effect of about $3 million. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 9.7% versus 8.2% last year, reflecting a 150-basis-point improvement. As noted on slide 19, relative to the fourth quarter of 2014, the pound declined 4% and the euro declined 13% against the dollar. We estimate that for the fourth quarter, the strong dollar reduced European revenue by approximately $31 million compared to Q4 of last year, and removing the impact of the currency swings would have resulted in Q4 revenue growth of 11.3%. Given the significant margin improvement, constant currency EBITDA growth was 32%, which we believe is quite strong. When taking all currencies into account, the strong dollar reduced Q4 year-over-year EPS growth by a fraction of $0.01 compared to last year. Turning to our Specialty segment, revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $245 million, a 16% increase over the comparable quarter of last year. Obviously the impact of the acquisition of Coast Distribution in August of 2015 accounted for the largest component of growth at 9.5%, but the organic growth rate of 8.1% was also quite strong. Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the fourth quarter declined by 280 basis points compared to last year, largely due to the impact of the Coast acquisition. On the bright side, operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down by about 150 basis points as we continue to see the leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing distribution network as well as the benefit of the lower fuel prices. EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $15 million, essentially flat with 2014, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment decreased by 120 basis points to 6.1%. This is a highly seasonal business and the fourth quarter is by far the weakest, as demonstrated by the graph in the lower right-hand corner of slide 20. As highlighted during the third quarter call, we fully anticipated the Coast acquisition with its focus on the RV marketplace would accentuate the normal drop in fourth quarter margins, and it did. Now, let's move on to capital allocation, which given working capital swings, the lumpiness of capital spending, and the timing of acquisitions is best viewed on a full-year basis, as presented on slide 22. You will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations for 2015 was approximately $530 million as we experienced a strong increase in earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. In 2015, we deployed $330 million of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $170 million to fund capital expenditures and $160 million to fund acquisitions and other investments. So for 2015, we generated $200 million of free cash flow, and we used all of that and some excess cash to repay $224 million of our debt. We closed the quarter with approximately $87 million of cash, of which about $59 million was held outside of the United States. At December 31, we had $1.6 billion of total debt outstanding, which reflected a leverage ratio of approximately 1.7 times as defined by our credit agreement. As announced earlier this month, we completed an amendment to our credit facility, increasing the total capacity by $900 million to a total of $3.2 billion, and extending the maturity to January of 2021. Today, our total availability under the new facility is approximately $2.2 billion, which is more than sufficient to fund the acquisition of Rhiag and support the continued growth of our businesses. Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided some guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016. Please note that our guidance excludes any impact from the proposed Rhiag acquisition, which we hope to close in the second quarter. As it relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we ended up at 7% for 2015 and have set the full-year range for 2016 at 6% to 8%, essentially consistent with our recent experience. Our range for adjusted EPS, which now excludes the impact of intangible amortization, is $1.59 to $1.69 a share, with a midpoint of $1.64. Assumed in that estimate is approximately $19 million of after-tax amortization, or about $0.06 per share. Said another way, based on the former reporting definition, the midpoint of adjusted EPS would be $1.58, which is consistent with the current analyst estimates for 2016. Going forward, I would ask that all the analysts adapt to the new adjusted EPS format so we have consistency in the EPS estimates. To assist with some of the year-over-year comparisons, appendices four and five of the callback include a reconciliation to the new adjusted format on an annual basis from 2015 to \u2013 from 2011 to 2015, and on a quarterly basis for the four quarters of 2015. The EPS guidance all assumes that the pound sterling, euro and Canadian dollar remain at budgeted levels of $1.45, $1.10 and $0.70, respectively, and importantly that scrap remains at current levels as well. On a year-over-year basis, I would note that the lower exchange rates have a $0.03 per share negative impact on earnings, and consistent with what we presented in the second quarter callback in July, the new Tamworth distribution facility will have another $0.03 negative impact during 2016. So that's a combined headwind of $0.06 a share compared to 2015, and at the midpoint of the guidance we are still expecting a 10% year-over-year improvement. The corresponding adjusted net income guidance is from $490 million to $520 million. Our assumed tax rate for 2016 is 34.7%, reflecting the slightly lower relative earnings contribution coming from the low-tax-rate United Kingdom, and the impact of the new distribution facility in Tamworth will slow the earnings growth from that country. Our guidance from cash flow from operations is approximately $520 million to $550 million with a midpoint of $535 million, a small increase over 2015 reflecting continued growth in cash earnings, offset by a more meaningful investment in working capital during 2016 compared to 2015. And finally, we set the guidance for capital spending at $170 million to $180 million, up just a bit over 2015. At this point, I will turn the call back over to Rob to wrap up. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Nick. To summarize, we faced some challenging headwinds this year with scrap and currency, two dynamics that are outside of our control, yet despite these challenges we delivered solid results for 2015. Now looking ahead. Since the 2008 recession in North America, we have witnessed an increased level of road congestion, which undoubtedly has played a role in the number of the paid claims increasing every year since 2009. Also, the number of vehicles in the U.S. continues to rise, with 264 million registered vehicles on the road at the end of 2015, a year when we witnessed the highest growth rate since 1999. These trends, coupled with the recent upswing in miles driven and lower gas prices, should continue to provide a nice tailwind to our collision business. In the UK, the miles traveled on all roads and classes and the number of vehicles licensed reached their highest levels on record in 2015, trends that should continue to benefit our branch network across the UK. At Sator, we have largely completed our three-step-to-two-step transformation and are now prepared to move the business forward as a single business operating unit. In addition, with the pending acquisition of Rhiag, our European strategy continues to evolve, and once closed, Rhiag will solidify our market-leading position across all of Europe. Yet, we have more runway to grow this fragmented market. Also, we continue to be pleased with the performance of our Specialty segment and the timing of our entry into this large and highly fragmented market. The project \u2013 the projected trend \u2013 upward trend in the SAAR rate should continue to benefit this segment. In closing, I am proud of the hard work and dedication that our 31,000-plus employees delivered for the company, our stockholders, and most importantly our customers in 2015. I am equally proud of our team's commitment on delivering continued and consistent performance, as reflected in our 2016 guidance. To further that point, over the last 16 years the LKQ team has delivered, on average, 7.5% organic growth, an accomplishment that few can claim, yet one that we have delivered predictably and consistently each and every year. Devon, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : Hey, thank you, good morning. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Tony. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : The first question I had stems from the EBITDA and the margin. In the U.S. it's holding steady, some of the margins that you talked about today were actually better than would have expected. And I'm just wondering how that margin improvement will translate in Europe, and is this a situation where you will be able to close the gap, knowing that they're two totally different businesses? But yet there are some efficiencies that have yet to been extracted? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Tony, this is Nick. Good morning. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : Good morning. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Obviously, the North American margins are a little bit of a tale of two cities, right? With the increase in EBITDA margins and the wholesale business I mentioned on the call, about 70 basis points, against a drop in the self-service margins. The margins in Europe hit double digits for the year. There are a lot of folks who 12 months ago were wondering how many years it was going to take us to get to double-digit margins in Europe, and we're at 10.1% for the year, so we are very proud of that. You know, we do think that ultimately the margins in Europe will have the ability to trend north, though I would caution folks that actually in 2016, because of the Tamworth facility, I quantify that as $0.03 a share. The reality from a margin perspective, if you take the \u2013 the roughly $13 million of P&L hit due to Tamworth, and you lay that against our 2015 results coming out of Europe, we would lose about 65 basis points to 70 basis points of margin just because of that facility. So, taking that aside, we think we can get some improvement in margins in Europe in the coming years, as we continue to rationalize. We think that once the Rhiag transaction is rolled in, that will give us incremental opportunities to get some savings on procurement, some savings on cataloging, some savings on the e-commerce platform, private labeling, all the things that John is hard at work on over in Europe. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : That's helpful. And then, I wanted to talk a little bit about the strategy to continue to get, I guess, later model buying at the auctions. Bigger picture, and if you look at the touch points for repair on today's vehicles, are there \u2013 are these later model vehicles actually providing you with more opportunities to sell an LKQ part? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Absolutely, Tony. And the other important part to note is, these are higher-priced parts. We like to give an example of the F150, the 2015, the taillight has blind spot detection, it's an $800 taillight, and the 2014 taillight was $85, it was just a piece of plastic. So these later model cars will give us some upside on pricing as well as just availability as they work through the SAAR rate. We think that with a strong SAAR rate for the last couple of the years, once they start hitting that sweet spot, that's going to provide a nice tailwind, and we're about six months to a year away from those really starting to hit in mass. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. And then just my last question with Rhiag. You talked about, I guess the second quarter, is there any thought on terms of the accretion that it may have now, based on the timeline of the close? I think originally you had said somewhere in the neighborhood of a $0.11, if I am not mistaken? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. That's still our best thinking Tony, $0.11 a share on our new adjusted EPS basis, so you would layer that on top of the midpoint of the $1.64 that we just referenced. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Tony, we are absolutely on pace to close at when we thought we would, early Q2. So we're very well along that way, the path, with the authorities over Europe. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. Great. Thanks for your time. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Tony. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions as well. Just to follow up on what Tony had to say there, is the $0.11 the, excuse me, the annual impact, or would that be the impact as if you owned it for six months? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That is a partial year, Craig, it's not the annual impact. You notice that in 2017, the EPS accretion that we gave folks back in December is $0.21 a share. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. That's \u2013 that is helpful to clarify that. And then, with respect to your European operational priorities, I think you addressed it a little bit, Nick, in your prior response, but could you add a little more color as far as how we should evaluate your progress in Europe in terms of the goals you've set operationally? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Craig, this is Rob. As Nick mentioned, John is hard at work and obviously we're very pleased with the double-digit EBITDA that we put up this year. The priorities would be \u2013 with Rhiag coming on board is to get that integrated into the system, and on purchasing, the e-commerce as Nick mentioned. So we've got some work to do there. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Sator is basically done from the three-step-to-two-step conversion. So we are anticipating getting back to normal there, and I also mentioned we're going from six systems to two systems. So the work at Sator is to finish that, get the systems on one play, get the Rhiag integrated, and of course the UK still opening branches, et cetera, and we're working that game plan. The other thing I'd like to add, as I mentioned in my notes, we did take a JV interest in a remanufacturer in Europe. We're going to end \u2013 start bringing those products into our different operations. So that's another opportunity as well. So those are the major priorities over in Europe this year. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks, Rob. And then finally, you have this Tamworth distribution center, which is exciting as it rolls out. Should this be considered a model for what you plan to do in Europe once you've got most of your footprint laid out? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think it's fair to say we will combine major warehouses where we can. The Tamworth 2 facility is 750,000 square feet and semi-automated, that would be the plan going forward as we build out the network in Europe, is to put a massive DC with semi-automation as well. So assuming this one goes well, and right so far, it's on plan to budget and to the timeliness. We are very excited about getting that online because I think it's going to make us much more efficient. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): So, that's dilutive early in the process, but obviously accretive down the road. But when we think about that accretion down the road, should we also have in the back of our mind that you may add additional DCs that could be, again short term dilutive, long term very accretive? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think that's fair. As we continue to work on Europe and the opportunity presents itself, we would likely put another DC into somewhere in Europe. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Thank you so much. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Craig. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company, L.L.C: Good morning, everyone. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Nate. Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company, L.L.C: So, Rob, thanks for some additional color on the AlixPartners kind of consulting project, in terms of where you're going with that. I was kind of curious a little bit in terms of just, if you look back a year ago when you started with that, in terms of like the progression and uncovering additional opportunities, relative to your additional \u2013 or your original expectations? And then, the second part of that is, how much of that improvement are you guys kind of including in your guidance, and whether there could be more upside as you uncover more opportunities? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I'll let Nick answer the guidance, but let me talk first about the \u2013 what we've found so far. We're very pleased with the work completed. I mentioned on the call \u2013 on my prepared remarks about the purchasing, but we're also seeing equal progress in our sales initiative, as well as our routing software. So the fourth leg of that, of course, was the efficiencies at our dismantling. Just to give an update on that, we have hired a Six Sigma Black Belt that's working on that project as well. So, these will take time to work through the system, but we are in the process of consolidating our sales centers into call centers, regional call centers. And then on the routing software, rolling out every one of our trucks, we'll know exactly where that truck is, we'll be able to be much more customer-focused on their timeless of delivery, and then also taking out cost on that, because we'll be able to be more efficient in the routing. As far as the guidance, Nick? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. And Nate, obviously the benefit that we gain from procurement pricing in the aftermarket parts marketplace, it takes time to get those POs in place. We have most of the adjusted pricing locked down with our vendors, but now we have to start placing orders, the product needs to get shipped over the ocean, delivered to our warehouses, and then we have to turn it through the inventory. So you're not going to see a whole lot of impact there in 2016. On some of the other items, we do believe we will be begin to get some flow-through late Q1, early Q2. As far as our guidance, is there a meaningful impact there? No. The biggest proportion will come from the aftermarket procurement. Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company, L.L.C: And then just bigger picture, along with that, to Rob is like philosophically, obviously, it's always been about putting the pedal down on terms of growth, and obviously that's still priority number one in a lot of potential acquisitions, particularly over in Europe and still more to go in North America. But obviously, particularly with that project, as well as the procurement initiatives in Europe, there's a little bit now of a focus in terms of getting efficiency improvements and generating the more consistent margins and hopefully more consistent cash flow. How do you philosophically think about that now, in terms of running the organization? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think it's making us much more efficient, Nate. We had, through the years, operated really decentralized, and I think getting consistencies on our sales process and how we measure our sales reps across the country and across the world, quite frankly, is going to make us much more efficient. And I think, though we'll get maybe some head count efficiencies, but also just being able to track our people on metrics that we think are key to driving the business. So it's an important initiative within our company. And as far as the routing software goes, that's equally important, being able to give our customers better service, and that will definitely be a result of this routing software. It's an amazing software that allows us to track the truck down to the mile and where it is and its ability to get to a customer. So we're going to be much more interactive with our customer base, which we think is a big advantage. Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company, L.L.C: Okay. And then just one last quick question regarding ECP. Obviously, getting a little bit more mature over there in terms of the branch build-out and whatnot. What do you see as the biggest growth opportunity now over the next three years for ECP? Is it still blocking and tackling in terms of market share gains, or is it about the new product injections or a combination of everything? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's a combination of everything. There are absolutely market share gains that we're continuing to get there, and we will to continue to get that we think. Adding the paint, adding the re-man engines now into the marketplace, and we'll have calipers and transmissions as well. We think that's really the big opportunity there. Of course, the Tamworth 2 is going to be absolutely critical to really outpacing our competitors and being able to get the product to them much more quicker. So we think we're going to get a big competitive advantage when we get T2 online. Tamworth 2. Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company, L.L.C: Great. Thanks for the time. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Nate. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Kelley with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : Good morning, gentlemen. This is David in for Bret Jordan. How are you? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good, David. How are you? David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : I'm doing well, thanks. Just a couple quick ones. Could you maybe provide some color on the ongoing MSO consolidation trend in the market, and maybe the impact you're seeing on alternative parts utilization at the moment? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. The MSO consolidation is continuing, it's \u2013 there are several very active buyers of body shops. We believe that's a positive for us. These MSOs are very tied to the insurance industry in driving alternative parts, so we are very pleased with that, and that \u2013 I don't see that slowing down any time soon, David. They are very aggressive in consolidating. I did just see a recent report that there're still 40,000 body shops in the United States, so there are still a tremendous amount of independents, but the consolidation will continue. As far as AP usage goes, we haven't seen the 2015 number yet from CCC, but we expect it to be relatively flat again at 36% mainly as a result of the SAAR rate. These news cars are demanding new parts. As I said earlier, we do think that's a benefit, as these tend to be higher-priced parts. But what we have seen, interestingly enough, is the number of parts per estimate continues to grow. In 2015 it went up to 9.2 parts per estimate, which is a huge trend in our favor. Obviously as cars get in accidents, we like to see parts get replaced versus repaired so that we can sell a product. So we see that trend continuing for two reasons. One, the complexity of the cars \u2013 the aluminum car is coming; I know we see magnesium is being entered into the parts stream as well. These will get replaced more often than repaired, that's a positive. And then the complexity \u2013 the body shop industry tends to be focusing more on replacing than repairing, so all positive trends, and we think, when these SAAR rates start to get into the sweet spot, we'll see that alternative part usage go from 36% to even higher as the parts make their way into the system. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : All right. Great; very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up here. You mention your price paid at auction I believe was flat year-over-year, but the average age of the vehicle purchased was a year or so younger. Do you have maybe a comparable same-age change in price? We were just hoping to get a feeling for ASPs, given some of the recent FX and scrap movements we're seeing in the market here. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I can tell you on the self-service, the lower end car, our purchase price is down $51 sequentially, so that's where you are going to see the scrap impact. Manheim (54:07) has been stubbornly high still, at 124.7 was the last number we saw. I did listen to the Car Call and I heard them say they were expecting used car prices to soften 3% to 5% this year, so we do expect some relief there, but the new car that we are buying is critical to our strategy, because as the SAAR rate gets through, we are going to see more demand on that new car. So, the fact that the prices are flat and we are buying a newer car, we do know that's obviously a positive for us. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : All right. Perfect. I appreciate the color, and thanks for taking my question. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: So if I could just talk about weather quickly, you mentioned warmer winter weather. Obviously that was a headline in the automotive space in the fourth quarter. Presumably that potentially diminishes the demand for collision products in the period, but if I recall in 2014 \u2013 excuse me; in 2015, there was a backlog in a number of the repair shops as a result of the pretty severe winter weather outlook for the fourth quarter. Could you talk about maybe the puts and takes there, across 4Q and 1Q, and sort of how we should think about that landscape in the current environment? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Let me talk about how the quarter is looking thus far. January was on plan, and thus far through February, we are also on plan as well, and we're up against some really tough comps in New England. As you remember, last year they had a blizzard it seemed like every other week for January and February, so there was some backlog. Just to put some color on the winter in Q4, ECP in December, their battery sales for one month were off 30%; that was $2.5 million difference just in battery sales. So the mild winter wasn't just here, it was also in Europe, so little bit of impact obviously in Q4. But so far through Q1, we are on plan and we're pretty happy. Now, there were some horrendous storms that came through the Southeast yesterday. Obviously those take time to get through the system, we'll see what that does. But so far, we are pretty pleased considering the comps we were up against in 2014. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Great. And then maybe dovetailing on your ECP commentary, the two-year stack on a same-store sales basis accelerated nicely despite that warm winter weather. You talked about market share gains. Could you disaggregate for us, of the 6.8%, what was secular growth, what was market share gains, and sort of what your expectation in there going forward? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. That's really hard for us to get our arms around because so many of our branches over there, Ben, are relatively close together, and we're consolidating some branches and the like. We think that the majority is related to market share gains, as we continue to expand out throughout the country. But there's, every time we open up a little branch, there's a little bit of cannibalization of the branches around it. So it's really hard to disaggregate that the way you want it. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Sure. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it's fair to say, though, Ben, that the industry is growing circa GDP, so it feels like most of it's market share gains. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay; great. And then just one last one for me, sticking with Europe, the collision business, obviously is a big opportunity longer term. Any updates there, and sort of some of the things that you are working through to build that business? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, sure. The \u2013 now that we've got the Sator business done, up basically from a three-step to a two-step, our plan is to launch that in probably Q3 or Q4 of 2016. One update on the UK : we did add one more insurance company into the program. So we are now up to 9 of the top 10 insurer company. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it was still well over 20% growth, so still strong double-digit. We are very pleased with that, and we are excited about bringing that to the continent. I think Rhiag also provides an opportunity there as well, in the Eastern European countries, so we are excited about that opportunity and I expect to see something here in the tail half of 2016. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Very good. Good luck, guys. Thanks. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ben. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of James Albertine with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Good morning and thanks for taking my question, gentlemen. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Jamie. Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I can speak wholeheartedly to that storm yesterday in Washington. If you do some water removal in basements, let me know. Real quickly, on the guidance, you mentioned FX and you also mentioned some headwind from Tamworth. I didn't hear any mention of scrap in the guidance. Maybe I missed it. But what should we be considering, assuming there is continued pressure as there has been sequentially now for several quarters? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So if scrap prices, particularly scrap steel prices, stay where they are, there should be maybe $0.01 or so, maybe $0.02 at the most in Q1, but by then most of the \u2013 this $80 scrap price will have rolled off, and we'd be in the clear. So we are not anticipating a big headwind from scrap, but again, that all assumes that prices stay where they are and they don't fall. Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. And I wanted to ask as well on the Rhiag side, and going back in the, sort of \u2013 I appreciate the appendices, and apologies for having sort of a confused initial look earlier this morning on the guidance side. But with respect to one element of Rhiag you had talked about in December, refinancing opportunity there. Is that considered in your $0.11 for the balance of this year, or is that something that would be incremental theoretically to the $0.11 guide? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, that's included. We assumed that we would take out the 7.25% fixed-rate notes very quickly after \u2013 at closing, and that is our full intent. Part of the reason we increased the line of credit was to give us the flexibility to do that. Now, we will come back and \u2013 at some time during 2016, depending on how the euro markets are, is replace out with our own bond, which will be at a \u2013 obviously it will be a fixed-rate instrument at a higher rate than under our line of credit, but we fully anticipated in the $0.11 accretion in 2016 that we would be taking out all the existing Rhiag debt. Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. And if I may just ask one more, I know it's getting late in the call and I appreciate you taking the question. On the working capital side, just there seems to be quite a bit of sort of change that you are unearthing, both you're working on things with AlixPartners on procurement, and obviously you're bringing Rhiag on here potentially, and then some of the three-to-two-step transitions. But how should we think about sort of the big swings in working capital? What should we watch for as it relates to upside-downside to your \u2013 to the cash flow from ops guidance? Thanks. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So, if you look at the funds flow statement, Jamie, 2015, a little bit unusual. As we told you going back a year, we had built inventories in Q4 of 2014 in anticipation of a potential port strike on the West Coast. And so as you \u2013 we came into the year kind of flush with inventory, and so we didn't need to add as much during the year to support the growth of the business. There was $83 million expansion in inventory during the year. Accounts receivable actually went down in 2015. That is very unusual, given a company that's growing its revenues. A lot of that had to do with some new things we were doing, particularly in the Netherlands, at Sator, some new focus on their receivables processing, if you will. We do not anticipate we will get another downtick in accounts receivable. We actually think receivables are going to grow in 2015 as our revenues grow. And so, that's the biggest swing. I know each year there seems to be something unusual. When you look at the \u2013 if you go back and you look historically at the kind of cash flow from operations, we were at $206 million in 2012, $428 million in 2013, down to $371 million in 2014, up to $521 million in 2015; most all of that has to do with swings related to working capital, and what I would suggest, if you kind of trend-lined it and normalized that to take out the peaks and the valleys, that's what you should be thinking about on a kind of long-term basis, recognizing that in any given year things could move up or down a little bit. Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's incredibly helpful, I appreciate that. And on the inventory \u2013 I mean, just a follow up to that, the inventory, you're buying some newer vehicles at a little higher price point, but you're buying fewer vehicles. Is that sort of going to net out, as we think about sort of inventory swings? And granted, you are working on improved terms and some other items that you noted with the AlixPartners work. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So the item that you referenced, which is the procurement of cars and newer cars and the like, that only impacts our North American salvage business. Actually, most of the inventory is on the aftermarket business here in the U.S., the Specialty business in the U.S., and the whole entirety of the European business, right? Because that's all aftermarket products. So while there will be a little bit of an impact from the salvage operations, that's a minority of our overall inventory balances. Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. I appreciate the clarification, and best of luck. Thanks, guys. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: . Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with C.L. King & Associates. Please proceed with your question. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, gentlemen. I want to just ask about Europe. Can you remind us what the average age of the car park is there? How that's trending, and how that might impact demand for your aftermarket parts? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It's about 8.7, Bill, is the average age, but it is growing, like the U.S. So we do expect that to be a nice tailwind for our European car parts business. As old cars get older, sort of what they're seeing here in United States, you'll see more need for those mechanical parts. So, definite positive trend. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And one other sort of futuristic question, I guess, and that's driverless cars, collision-avoidance technologies. There are some out there to think that's going to be \u2013 eliminate accidents. How do you guys see that, playing out in terms of how that might impact your business over the next \u2013 both over the near term, and then maybe over the next five years to 10 years? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's still very early days on that, and from what we've \u2013 the research we've looked at, Bill, most of this is currently an option right now, it's not a standard part. And it's mainly on higher end vehicles, although they are starting to work their way down. There was actually a study done by Thatcham over in UK that suggests that they believe claims volume will not drop precipitously, but severity will, and they actually expect total losses to drop, but the number of claims will. So instead of that violent roll-over collision, there will still be a collision but it just won't be as severe. So they're actually predicting pretty stability. So I think it's fair to say that it's still early days, but I will say this, it is actually part of our strategy to diversify the business. We do think it's coming, but we \u2013 and everything we've read says it's a decade-out problem, at the earliest. So we're going to continue to diversify the business, look to get away a little bit from the collision, as we've been doing over the last couple of years, but we do think there's at least a solid 10 years left of collisions that are going to stay pretty normalized. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Got it. That makes sense. Thanks very much. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Bill. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I'd like to now turn the floor back over to Mr. Wagman for closing comments. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Devon, and thank you everyone for your time today. But before we sign off, I just want to announce that we're very excited about, we'll be hosting our first ever Investor Day in New York City on March 15. You'll have the opportunity to hear from each of our segment leaders as they discuss their businesses, and we look forward to providing a deeper dive into our company. We hope you can join us, either in person or via our webcast. Thank you, everybody. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Turning to slide three, Q1 revenue reached a record $1.92 billion, an increase of 8.3% as compared to $1.77 billion in the first quarter of 2015. Net income for the first quarter of 2016 was a $107.7 million, an increase of 0.6% as compared to $107.1 million for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, net income was $128.7 million, an increase of 10.2% as compared to the $116.8 million for the same period of 2015. Diluted earnings per share of $0.35 for the first quarter ended March 31 2016 was unchanged from the $0.35 for the first quarter of 2015. It is important to note, however, that the Q1 2016 diluted earnings per share included charges equal to $0.07 per share resulting from restructuring and acquisition related expenses, losses on debt extinguishment, amortization of acquired intangibles, change in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, and an adjustment for gains associated with the hedging the Rhiag purchase price. So on an adjusted basis, EPS grew 10.5% year-over-year in Q1. Nick will provide more specifics on the adjustment shortly. Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 6.3% in the quarter, a solid number, given what mild weather headwinds we faced in North America and Europe and a tough comp in 2015. Turning to North America. According to the National Center for Environmental Information, March snow cover in the U.S. was 48% lower than the average coverage witnessed from 1981 to 2015. And the second smallest in the 50-year period on record was February and March of 2012 ranking third and fourth respectively. And February of this year was not far behind, recording 13th smallest level over that same 50-year period. With that as a backdrop, North America delivered organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.9% in the quarter, which compared to the 3.6% achieved in Q1 2012 is solid, given we experienced similar weather anomalies in each of those quarters. During Q1, we purchased over 72,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American wholesale operations, a 2.8% increase over Q1 2015. During Q1, our pricing at auction increased over Q1 2015 by 9%. But we were also buying a younger vehicle by over one year or 13% younger. This younger vehicle procurement strategy positions us to take advantage of the inevitable reduction in the average age of the vehicle being repaired, a direct result of the increase in the SAAR rates. Illustrating this point, during the quarter, the average model year age of a vehicle being repaired was younger by over a year compared to the same period in 2015. For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings, as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 18.5% and 58.4% respectively year-over-year in the quarter In our self-service retail business, during Q1, we acquired over 125,000 lower-cost self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 25% increase over Q1 2015. Compared to the prior year, we increased our self-service procurement in the quarter to take advantage of the favorable pricing for higher quality vehicles in this line of business, given the year-over-year decline in scrap pricing. As of way, we have seen a stabilization of scrap pricing. Turning to our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC Information Systems. In March of 2015, we introduced LKQ's recycled parts offering through this platform with initial base of 100 shops in Portland, Grand Rapids, and Oklahoma City. From a base of zero and within less than a year, the initial results are encouraged. Through the end of Q1, LKQ's recycled parts are now accessible to over 2,500 shops in virtually every major city throughout the United States. During Q1, the revenue and number of aftermarket parts purchased processed through the CCC platform, through 82% and 84% respectively year-over-year. And lastly, on North America, I want to provide an update on our productivity initiatives to identify potential operational efficiencies. As mentioned on previous calls, we've identified several significant opportunities in four key areas, with one being sales force effectiveness and the second one being (7:06) optimization. During the quarter, our sales responsibilities were separated from our operations across the United States, resulting in a more focused structure. This structure has three regional sales vice presidents, a leadership team of district sales manager and inside sales managers as well. We now have a geographically focused sales force that is positioned to compete at a local level allowing our broader team to handle increased call volumes. During the quarter, we implemented additional sales KPIs focused on increasing total talk time, outbound calls and peer coaching. The initial results of these KPIs are positive with total talk time and outbound calls increasing 27% and 15% respectively in the quarter. Under our peer coaching, we have engaged each inside sales manager to increase his or her time on the floor with their sales force. But we also have each sales manager spend 18 hours per week on the floor engaging in side-by-side coaching, which will increase sales skills with higher volume of sales per rep and simultaneously improve the overall experience to our customer. Though this coaching structure may create a slight head room with sales, the long-term benefit of driving the performance of our top sales people should lead to reduction in the overall size of our sales force. In addition, during the quarter, we made great strides with the implementation of Roadnet, the Tier 1 provider we've selected for the technology component of our route optimization efforts. Roadnet's fleet in mobile management software provides strategic territory and street level route plans, multi-stock vehicle routing and scheduling, wireless dispatch, vehicle telematics, fuel management and real-time vehicle GPS tracking. Our current utilization rate with Roadnet represents 65% of our North American fleet which today is accounting for over 2,500 vehicles driving over 140,000 miles and make over 22,000 stops on a daily basis. Our goal is to be at a 100% utilization by the end of 2016. Now moving on to our European operations. In Q1, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.9% and acquisition growth of 9.9%, which was offset by a decrease of 4.5% related to foreign exchange rates. During Q1, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 7.4%, and for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 5.8%, a solid performance given that ECP had one less selling day year-over-year. During the quarter, ECP did not open any additional branches, providing our team the bandwidth to focus on capturing incremental margin expansion year-over-year in Q1. During Q1, collision parts sales at ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 15.5%. I am pleased with the continued double-digit performance in this line of business, especially given the mild Q1 weather in the UK, a tough comp in 2015 and again with one less selling day. Now turning to our Sator business. During Q1, Sator drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.2%, its highest quarterly rate since we acquired the business in May of 2013. We believe that our investments in 2014 and 2015 to convert our distribution model from three step to two step is predominantly responsible for not only this acceleration of organic growth, but also the year-over-year improvements in gross and EBITDA margins. And now on to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued strong performance by posting year-over-year total revenue growth of 19.5% in the quarter, including the benefits of the Coast acquisition and strong organic revenue growth of 10.8%. I'm also pleased with the margin expansion at Specialty realized in the quarter, which Nick will cover shortly. During the quarter, Specialty continued their integration activities from the Coast acquisition by consolidating two additional warehouses into our network. Also the Coast administrative synergies continue to be ahead of our schedule. In addition, our previously mentioned Specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington State were both fully operational at the end of Q1. Now on to corporate development. On March 21, 2016, the company closed its previously announced acquisition of Rhiag, a leading pan-European business-to-business distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Rhiag operates through 252 distribution centers and 10 warehouses and serve more than 100,000 professional clients in 10 European countries. And on April 21, 2016, the company closed on its previously announced acquisition of PGW, a leading global distributor and manufacturer of automotive glass products. With the acquisition of PGW and our entrance into the sizable $3.5 billion automotive glass market, we continue to grow our industry leading position and product offerings to further serve the needs of our professional repair customers. PGW's offerings are complementary to LKQ's existing business and product offerings. And together, our respective teams now have the technology, products and expertise to introduce automotive glass to LKQ's global growth strategy. I am also pleased to announce that PGW has secured two new material OE contracts since we announced the acquisition in late February. I am excited to welcome the folks at both Rhiag and PGW to the LKQ team. In addition to the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions, during the first quarter of 2016, the company acquired an additional wholesale salvage business based in Sweden. At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter. And over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results for our company and review the performance of each of our three segments, before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our revised guidance for 2016, now that the Rhiag and PGW transactions have closed. The short version of our financial performance in the first quarter of 2016 is that we had a very good quarter and taken as a whole was right in line with our expectations. We experienced solid revenue and earnings growth. And the headwinds from lower scrap prices and the strong dollar have started to abate. To be clear, Rhiag closed in late March and was included in our first quarter for only a few days. PGW just closed last week and had no impact on our Q1 results. As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the first quarter of 2016 was $1.9 billion representing an 8.3% increase over last year. That reflects a 10.5% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by a 20% decrease in other revenue, primarily related to the decline in prices for scrap steel and other metals on a year-over-year basis. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 6.3% from organic, plus 6% from acquisitions, for constant currency growth of 12.3%, before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 1.8% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each of the businesses as I walk through the segment results. As noted on slide 10 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins improved 20 basis points to 39.6% during the quarter. The uptick reflected approximately a 40-basis point improvement from operations, largely in Europe offset by a 20-basis point decline due to revenue mix, as the revenue growth in our Specialty business, which has the lowest gross margin structure, continued to outpace that of our other operations. We lost about 50 basis points of efficiencies in our operating expenses, largely due to our North American operations. This was due primarily to the continued impact of lower revenue from scrap and core, which was down $39 million on a year-over-year basis, and particularly impacted our self-service operation. Outside of the impact of metal prices, our consolidated distribution cost as a percent of revenue benefited from lower fuel prices, and our SG&A expenses benefited from the acquisition integration synergies in our Specialty operation. Segment EBITDA totaled $237 million for the quarter, reflecting a 7% increase from 2015. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 12.3%, a 20-basis-point decrease over the 12.5% recorded last year. The increase in segment EBITDA was offset by an increase in restructuring costs. And operating income for the first quarter of 2016 was flat in dollar terms, and down a bit as a percent of revenue when compared to the same period of the prior year. The restructuring items primarily relate to expenses connected to the Rhiag acquisition. You will note a couple of relatively large non-operating items in our income statement during the first quarter of 2016, including a loss on debt extinguishment and significant other income. As you may recall, we amended our credit facility at the end of January. In addition, we repaid all of Rhiag's debt shortly after closing. Collectively, that accounted for approximately $26.7 million of one-time expenses related to unamortized issuance costs on the former credit agreement and the prepayment penalty associated with the high cost Rhiag debt. Going in the other direction, we hedged the anticipated payment for the Rhiag acquisition, and given the movement in the euro between when we set the hedge and the closing date, we had sizable gain, about $18 million on the hedge. On a combined basis, the net effect of these one-time items was a negative impact on pre-tax margins, which contracted by about 90 basis points to 8.6%. Our net tax rate during the first quarter was 34.75%, down from 35.5% in 2015 and even with the annual guidance we provided this past February. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.35, which was flat with last year. However, adjusted EPS before restructuring charges, a loss on debt extinguishment, the hedging gain and intangible asset amortization was $0.42 a share compared to $0.38 reflecting the 10.5% improvement. As mentioned, the impact of scrap and currency fluctuations have abated quite a bit and collectively impacted EPS by less than a penny during the first quarter. While we have included the details on scrap and currencies in the presentation material, given the minor impact, I am happy to say I won't be spending much time on those topics during this discussion. As highlighted on slide 11, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to the varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins. This will become more accentuated now that we have closed both Rhiag and PGW and you will begin to see a shift in the second quarter results. And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the first quarter of 2016 increased to $1.088 billion or a 4% increase over 2015. This is the combination of a 7.3% growth rate in parts and services, offset by a 20% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was primarily due to the lower prices received for scrap steel and other metals. The 7.3% growth in North American parts and services was a combination of 4.9% organic growth and 3.1% acquisition growth, offset by a 70 basis point FX-related decline, due to the weakness of the Canadian dollar. There is no doubt that the mild weather had an impact on our revenue, as collision claims were down in many states. But it's hard to quantify the impact, and in the end, we simply need to work through Mother Nature. All-in-all, this was a solid quarter in revenue for our North American business. Gross margins in North America during the first quarter were 42.7%, up just a few basis points. With respect to operating expenses, we lost about 80 basis points of margin, compared to the comparable quarter of last year. Our self-service unit experienced an increase in operating expenses, but meaningfully lower revenue due to the significant decline in commodity prices. And as a result, operating expenses as a percent of revenue for our self-service operation increased very significantly on a year-over-year basis. For the North American segment as a whole, the impact of the lower revenue from the sale of scrap and other commodities increased operating costs as a percent of revenue by approximately 110 basis points. On the upside, we continue to experience improvements in fuel costs, relative to last year, picking up about 20 basis points of margin, as diesel averaged $2.08 a gallon, compared to $2.92 a gallon last year, a 29% decline. Importantly, we began to experience some preliminary benefit from our productivity initiatives during Q1 with our non-inventory related purchasing activities benefiting from about $400,000 of savings. We would expect this to pick up as we move throughout the year. The inventory related savings will begin as we purchase inventories at new negotiated prices, the products are received and placed in our warehouses and we turn the inventory. In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the first quarter was $147 million, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the segment was 13.6% in Q1 of 2016, down from 14.3% reported in the comparable period of prior year. The impact of lower revenue from commodities should dissipate in the second half assuming we get to more comparable scrap pricing. Moving on to our European segment. Total revenue in the first quarter accelerated to $547 million from $487 million, a 12.2% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the first quarter was 6.9%, reflecting the combination of 7.4% growth at ECP and 6.2% at Sator. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 9.9% increase in revenues, which includes only two weeks of activity for Rhiag. So, on a constant currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 16.8% for the quarter. These gains were offset by a 4.5% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling. Gross margins in Europe increased to 38.1%, a 110 basis point improvement over the comparable period of last year. Both ECP and Sator experienced higher gross margins from operations as we continued to benefit from approved procurements in the UK in the internalization of the gross margins from the acquisitions in the Netherlands. These are the highest first quarter gross margins we have achieved in Europe in several years. As mentioned, when we announced the Rhiag acquisition back in December given the three-step distribution model in Italy and Switzerland. Rhiag has lower gross margins than either ECP or Sator, and beginning in the second quarter, you will see the impact of that on our consolidated European gross margins. With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 10 basis points increase on a consolidated European basis. We started paying rents and related property costs on the new distribution facility in Tamworth, England, which we call T2 back in February. The incremental costs related to this project (24:48) in Q1 were about \u00a31.2 million or about $1.8 million, which reflects a 30 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue for Europe. Offsetting some of this increase in expense were some FX gains related to hedges utilized to manage our foreign currency exposure on inventory purchases in the UK. European EBITDA totaled $57.5 million, a 23.6% increase over last year. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA in the first quarter of 2016 was 10.5% versus 9.5% last year, a full 100 basis point improvement even after taking into account the impact of the T2 project. Relative to the first quarter of 2015, the pound had declined 6% and the euro declined 3% against the dollar. Given the significant margin improvement, constant currency EBITDA growth in Europe was 28.6%, which we believe is robust. Turning to our Specialty segment, revenue for the first quarter totaled $288 million, a 19.5% increase over the comparable quarter of 2015. The organic growth rate of 10.8% was very strong, while the impact of the acquisition of Coast in August of 2015 added 9.4% to revenue growth. Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the first quarter increased by about 20 basis points compared to last year, due to some favorable product mix and favorable inventory capitalization adjustments related to the acquisition integration activities. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down about 30 basis points. We continue to see the leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network, as well as the benefit of lower fuel prices and lower advertising expenses. These savings were in part offset by higher cost related to the two new distribution facilities added in late 2015 and slightly higher freight expense. EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $32 million, up 25% from the first quarter of last year and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased 50 basis points to 11% in 2016 compared to 10.5% last year. Remember, this is a highly seasonal business and the first quarter is typically pretty strong as demonstrated by the graph in the lower right corner of slide 16. Consistent with the normal seasonal patterns, you should assume these margins will moderate as we move through the back half of the year. Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on slide 17, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations during the first quarter was approximately $119 million as we experienced strong earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. During the quarter, we deployed $625 million of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $50 million to fund capital expenditures and $575 million to fund the acquisitions and other investments. The latter amount includes the monies paid for Rhiag, net of the hedging gain on the purchase price and net of the proceeds from the previously announced sale of our interest in the Australian joint venture. The Rhiag acquisition was financed by drawing down on our line of credit, thus the big inflow from financing. We closed the quarter with about $229 million of cash, of which $177 million was held outside of the United States. The big increase in foreign cash relates to the amounts on Rhiag's balance sheet at the time of acquisition. At March 31, we had about $2.8 billion of total debt outstanding, which reflected the monies borrowed to complete the Rhiag acquisition in late March. That quarter-end balance does not include any borrowings related to PGW as that transaction closed in Q2. On a pro forma basis, taking into account the PGW closing, our net debt was approximately $3.3 billion or about three times pro forma EBITDA. Also, we completed a very successful \u20ac500 million issuance of senior notes in early April, and we used those proceeds to in part pay down the revolving credit facility used to finance the Rhiag transaction. The key terms of that offering were bullet maturity of eight years and a fixed interest rate of 3.875%. Today, our total availability under the new credit facility is approximately $1 billion, which we believe is more than sufficient to support the growth of our business. Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016 to include the impact from the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions. Again, Rhiag closed in late March and PGW in late April, so we effectively will record a tad more than nine months and eight months of the respective results in 2016. As relates to the organic growth rates for parts and services, we continue to be comfortable with the range of 6% to 8%, essentially consistent with our recent experience. Our range for adjusted EPS, which again now excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization is $1.76 at the low end to $1.86 per share at the high end with the midpoint of $1.81 a share. Again, this includes the anticipated impact from our ownership of Rhiag and PGW for nine months and eight months respectively in 2016. The EPS guidance also assumes that the pound sterling and the euro remain at budgeted levels of $1.45 and $1.10 respectively, and importantly that scrap remains at current levels as well. Based on our shares outstanding, that range implies an adjusted net income of approximately $545 million to $575 million, with a midpoint to $560 million. Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains at 34.75%. As part of the PGW transaction under U.S. GAAP, we need to mark the closing date inventory up to market value, which means about an $8 million to $12 million increase in the inventory valuation. This amount will get amortized as a non-cash expense as we turn the inventory. It won't affect the adjusted net income or adjusted EPS, but it will be a one-time impact on diluted net income and diluted EPS in Q2 and perhaps a bit in Q3. I believe all the analysts have adapted to the new adjusted EPS format, which we greatly appreciate, and that will ensure we have consistency in the EPS estimates. The appendices to this presentation include the relevant reconciliations for prior year periods. Our guidance for cash flow from operations is approximately $575 million to $625 million, with the midpoint of $600 million, and finally, we set the adjusted guidance for capital spending at $200 million to $225 million. And at this point, I will turn the call back over to Rob to wrap things up. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Nick. To summarize, I am proud of the momentum we have created with our Q1 performance, our recently completed strategic acquisitions and our recent financings. Combined these achievements position LKQ well to deliver another year of organic and acquisition-related revenue growth in 2016 that has us now annualizing in excess of $10 billion of revenue. Obviously, we can't predict weather patterns, so we remain focused on the things we can control, which include continuing to offer an attractive value proposition to our insurance carrier partners, maintaining and increasing our industry leading fulfillment rates and providing superior and responsive customer service to the professional vehicle repair and supply businesses we serve, all supported by a highly effective and unmatched alternative parts distribution network in North America. And most importantly, I believe we have a stellar team of 35,000 plus fellow employees dedicated to carrying on our mission globally, and I want to thank each and every one of them for their collective efforts. Devon, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Hey. On that ECP growth for stores open over 12 months of 5.8%, that's pretty strong. Is there anything going on? Is the market that strong or are you gaining market share in that region? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Bret. We're still taking market share for sure. And what I'm most excited about is we still haven't introduced our other product lines, being used, re-man to a (34:55) great extent. So, there's still opportunity there as well, but we believe we're taking market share. A little bit of a headwind there actually with the strong SAAR rate. We have to wait for those cars obviously to get into the independent aftermarket. So, we're very pleased with that number, it is very strong and we expect it to continue. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then on the PGW side, you mentioned you picked up a couple of contracts since you initially announced the deal. Can you share with us what those are? And is there a capacity constraint as far as your production capability or is it just the ability to outsource that class? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We can't share who they were, but they are locked in for future models. And as far as capacity, we do have the capacity to continue to take on new accounts. So that's not going to be a problem. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. And then a housekeeping, do you have a feeling for what alternative parts were as a percentage of North American repair? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The last \u2013 we did that annually update, and it was at \u2013 at the end of 2015, Bret, it was still 36%. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. And thank you. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Bret. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Ben. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks for taking my questions. So in your self-service business, you accelerated the number of vehicles you purchased pretty materially, up 25%. Obviously, scrap still \u2013 trends have improved, but I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on that business line. Do you think we're reaching a turning point there? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think the downturn in scrap, Ben, allowed us to buy a better car for less money and that's what's really driving the revenue there. We're putting better cars through the system and they are plentiful. So long term, scrap has ticked up slightly finally, so it seems to have bottomed out nicely. So we plan on continuing to buy aggressively in that line of business. Business has been very good there. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And then, we've heard some news recently about pretty severe hailstorms in the southern U.S., Texas primarily. Can you talk a little bit about what you think this means for your business going forward? Obviously, you've got the glass business now, it's good for your collision business as well, but just curious to hear your thoughts there. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, absolutely. When we look at Q1, it was really a tale of two countries. We meet with CCC regularly, and they gave us some stats on the Northeast and the Mid-West being down and the number of \u2013 accident frequency and that was not the case in the Southwest and the West. And we actually had a strong double digit organic growth in both of those markets. So we do expect \u2013 I did see an ad by Caliber Collision that they are booked through September for collision repair. So, we do expect some nice tailwinds coming out of that market. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Great. And then just one housekeeping... Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: (37:41) PGW will also be able to realize that benefit as well. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Great. And then, just one last housekeeping. You said your guidance reflects a continuation of current scrap steel prices. Should we think of that $93 per ton that you realized in the first quarter as the price that's embedded in your guidance? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Ben, this is Nick. Good morning. The $93 was the average for the quarter. Actually, as we came to the end of the quarter, was up a little bit, so we're kind of sitting right at around triple digits, which is great to be out of double digits, if you will. And so, that's really what's embedded in the guidance. Again, it's up a little bit which is good, but it's not up meaningful enough to really drive any sort of EPS accretion or... Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. So, it's end of the quarter price? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Best of luck. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ben. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Nate, good mooning. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: And so, if we kind of \u2013 and I know, Nick, you pointed this out in terms of you can't really tease it out in terms of the weather impact in the first quarter. But if we exclude that and kind of come in April a little bit in terms of more mile patterns year-over-year, can you talk about \u2013 like I mean, I would assume that the tailwinds are still existing in terms of increased miles driven, more parts per repair, and you talked about the more certified parts. I mean I would assume that, kind of moving out of that first quarter on the weather comp issue that you're still feeling good about the trends in the business and the tailwinds there. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Absolutely, no change in the longer term tailwinds, Nate. We feel very good about what's happening to the car park. The age of the car park. The number of miles driven. The distractions on the road. I mean, all that is absolutely no change from our perspective. As Rob noted, there are parts of the countries that had a soft winter, particularly the Northeast, Mid-West and importantly Canada, which Rob didn't mention. The shops did not have a big backlog in April. But by the time you hit May and June, all that's flushed through the system and it shouldn't be an issue. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then... Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Just to add one more thing to that \u2013 what Nick said. The auctions and I think as a result of some of the flooding that's happened on the Houston and the hailstorm, we expect the auctions to be very healthy here for a while. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then kind of on the facility expense line, as we've talked about, you have the new distribution facilities with Specialty, you have the UK one that's starting to come into costs. Should we anticipate that that line item continues to go up a little bit particularly as we move through the UK? And if so, is the UK still on track to kind of take out what was originally thought to be $0.02 to $0.03 this year? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Nate, this is Nick. Yes, actually $0.03 is our estimate. We've quantified that I think in past calls of about $13 million of total expense. As noted in my comments a bit earlier, it was about $1.8 million for the first quarter. So we still have the better part of $11 million of costs related to the T2 facility to absorb in the back three quarters of the year. And so that will be a slightly larger kind of weight that we need to bear as relates to facility cost. Again the two new facilities from the Specialty segment that we introduced in Q4 of last year, those are, as Rob indicated, fully up and running. The impact of that expense should begin to moderate a little bit. And we have kind of rearranged some of our people as to where they are hitting on the P&L. Rob talked about the change in the sales structure. That meant there was also a change in our operating structure as well. And so, there's a little bit of cost that was moving out of actually selling expense and up into facilities and warehousing expense. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : A little bit northward movement. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: And as Rhiag and PGW come on, would we expect that line item to again take a little bit of a relative jump before kind of paring down as you kind of consolidate facilities and routes and et cetera. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, again, there will be no kind of distribution synergies coming out of Rhiag, because they operate in geographies where we don't operate today. So we're not going to be consolidating warehouses or distribution routes and the like. They're going to operate as they have operated. It's going to take us a little bit of time on PGW. The only natural synergies will be in their aftermarket business where they have 120 locations around the country, we have 300 locations. We do believe that over time, there will be the ability to combine some of those operations and the like but you shouldn't see anything on that front near-term. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just one last housekeeping, Nick. Do you have, now that the deals have closed, a rough amortization number for us to think about in terms of \u2013 if you went back to a non-adjusted amortization earnings? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. The best that we have right now, Nate, is what we provided back when we announced the transactions in December and in late February. Again, we're just working through the opening balance sheet on Rhiag, that will probably. We still have some valuation work that we have outside experts helping us with as to how much the excess purchase price over book value is going to go to goodwill versus amortized assets, and that relates to both transactions. So, we'll come back and provide a better estimate, once we have some of that work done. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for the time, guys. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Nate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. James J. Albertine, Jr. - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. James J. Albertine, Jr. - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Wanted to ask on the cost of goods sold side in North America with Manheim coming down here quite precipitously last few months, it would seem to be a benefit to your margins. But at the same time, you noted you're buying a higher quality and fewer higher quality vehicles. So, just wanted to get a better understanding of how we should think about modeling gross margin, imagining it's a benefit for 2Q and the balance of the year, but if you could help us sort of understand the magnitude there. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Jamie. This is Nick. We're not anticipating a major pickup in \u2013 or a benefit on the cost of goods sold line. Again, the Manheim index is down a little bit, which ultimately helped us at the auctions a little bit. That said we are buying a newer car. You would have noticed that the average cost of the vehicle that we're buying was actually up, I think was about 9% in Q1 relative to last year. Now, our goal is to get more parts dollars off the car. And actually what we've been very consistent over the last several years in mentioning, as we've started to move towards buying a newer vehicle, while the gross margin dollars that we can get off that car go up, actually the gross margin percentage actually comes down a little bit. So there's probably going to be a little bit of a yin and a yang. We're not anticipating a major movement either way as it relates to our salvage cost of goods sold. James J. Albertine, Jr. - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So if I'm hearing you correctly and if I can just paraphrase, it sounds like you're assuming X for your cost of purchase of a vehicle and that's roughly flattish if you will year-over-year, but the amount you can get in terms of per parts \u2013 and Rob, you used the example of the F150 tail light, I believe, and with a blind spot detection, is about 10x with the predecessor tail light cost. So it sounds like COGS is flattish but you're going to be making more per vehicle. Do I hear that correctly? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. James J. Albertine, Jr. - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. And then just a quick question and apologies if you've gone through this on the CGW call or any detail in the slide that we missed it. But to our understanding, it's a little different to take the glass and put it into trucks and some trucks need to be specialized to handle different types of glass. And I'm thinking more on the sort of distribution synergies over the longer term side here. So is there any incremental investments you need to make into either trucks or whether its existing trucks or new trucks? Or just how should we think about that, or conversely, is there really not much to worry about as it relates to the handling of the glass? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, as far as the warehousing goes, Jamie, no changes there whatsoever, the racking is identical. But you are correct. The trucks are different. They have a different handling capability. What our plan would be to do is, we start integrating those businesses, and as trucks retire, we're retiring almost 600 trucks a year, we're replacing because of our large fleet. Those will be retrofitted appropriately to carry both glass and salvage. So, we don't see it being a major hindrance given the timeframe we have to integrate the businesses first. James J. Albertine, Jr. - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And at this point, it's maybe too early to start thinking about sort of balance sheet and P&L impacts and sort of percentage that we should attribute to that, is that fair? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. That's fair. James J. Albertine, Jr. - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Awesome, thanks guys, and best of luck in the second quarter. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jamie. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, following upon on Bret's earlier question, have you run any scenarios at ECP, to evaluate the impact of T2 on your fulfillment rates or ultimately your growth rate there? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We do know Craig that, we're going to have a lot more capacity of the store products. We run at about a 98% fill rate today. What we think we'll be able to do though is rather than having, in some cases, where we have limited, much limited supply in the field, will be able to put more in the field because of these regional hubs we're developing as well. So, we will have a lot better ability to backfill quickly. So, we do think our speed to market will be quicker, as a result. And of course, just with the automation, we do expect a lot more efficiencies as well, both in terms of pulling quicker and getting to our customers even quicker as well. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Do you see any impact on inventory turns as a result of T2? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The near term, the inventory will go up a bit, Craig, only because we're going to be filling that warehouse while we will still have inventory in the two warehouses that we'll ultimately shut down. That's more of a timing issue. Ultimately it'll work through the system. The inventory may go up a bit but it's not going to be a wholesale change. The key of what the large national distribution facilities allow us to do is that's where some of the longer dated inventory is held, and being able to have that and get it to our branches when needed quickly and through some of the automated picking processes and alike, that's the real benefit of that. So near-term inventory will go up a little bit as we're working through the transition going from four facilities down to two facilities because you need to have inventory ready for the customer but longer term, there shouldn't be a major impact. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. And then finally on your projects with Accel Partners on efficiency, are you in a position at all to quantify or at least help us frame, what you think the financial implications could be once you're up and running on these major projects? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Again, we'll report that really as we go. When we were in New York last month for the Investor Day, Justin Jude had mentioned tens of millions of dollars. Ultimately on a run rate basis, we're not going to get there, Craig, here in 2016. Again on the non-inventory related purchasing, again, we were at $400,000 in the first quarter, that will probably double in the coming quarters. So there will be, I don't know, $2.5 million to $3 million potential savings rolling through in 2016 related to things like logistics and our telecom and our corrugate and supplies buying and office supplies and all that kind of activity. The real key will come in from actually the aftermarket product that we procure from Taiwan. Again, we're just beginning to buy some of that at new pricing. Some of it's going to be based on demand that we have for those parts, as to how much we need to buy and the ability to make sure we retain the savings in-house, as opposed to passing any of that along to our customers. So, we'll be able to document that on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And just one follow-up to what Nick said, Craig. Even though we've only been with PGW a week, we've already put their transportation guys with our transportation guys and we're working on ocean freight to leverage that. So, We're quickly already addressing that with the new acquisitions. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Craig. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : Thank you. Good morning. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Tony. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : First question I had with respect to some of these initiatives on Roadnet and as well as on the sales force. I wonder if you could add a little bit more color in terms of which one do you think over the long term will give you a bit more of a benefit or greater efficiencies. And with respect to particularly the sales force initiative, some of the KPIs that are being implemented, are they going to drive overall higher fill rates or traction or customer service scores, or what should we think about in terms of the near-term benefit? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. If I rank them both, I would say, Roadnet's got the bigger impact for a couple of reasons. One, we can just be so much more confident with our customers as to when their products are going to be there. The route optimization is just incredible and how they route the drivers. For example, one thing it tries to do is take more right turns than left turns. So you can turn right on red as oppose to crossing traffic when you have to turn left. Those little efficiencies add up dramatically and the effect of ultimately probably putting fewer trucks on the road with better service is really going to have an impact on our customer base. As far as the sales KPIs, Tony, we're looking at total clock time, sitting with our reps, I think \u2013 and coaching, just pure coaching that we're doing and monitoring the outbound calls more effectively. I think the net effect of that is better customer service, you're absolutely right. We'll have better contact with our customers, more time on the phone with our customers and really become that vendor of choice as a result because we'll be so much more responsive to their requests and needs. So, that's moving full steam ahead. Back to the route optimization I mentioned in my prepared remarks, with 65% rolled out. We expect to have that 100% rolled out by the end of this year. So, I think the combination of the two, where we'll provide better customer service on the phone and then better customer service on the delivery end, really will raise the bar significantly on our customer service levels, so both are equally important. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : And does return rate \u2013 is that ever influenced by either one of these, meaning either the \u2013 it was miscommunicated in terms of which part was actually needed and/or the part didn't get there in the right amount of time and thus was a return because it ended up coming from somewhere else? Does this \u2013 I don't know if that's a big number or not, but is there an influence there as well? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think the biggest factor on return rate is cars totaling after the estimate's repaired \u2013 an estimate's written and the parts are ordered, or the customer never shows up. They say they're coming in on Tuesday, and they don't bring the car in. I think that's a bigger factor. However, obviously getting the part \u2013 making sure the customer is ordering the right part and our rep is making sure they are writing up the right part is critical. We do expect some improvement in return rates, in terms of getting the right part on the truck. But again, there's so many other factors that affect return rates that I don't think it's going to be a huge diminishment in the return rates. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. And if you look at your other businesses, the newer ones with the glass and with Rhiag. Are there any other seasonality effects that we should consider as we go through the balance of this year and into next year or do they pretty much mirror sort of the normal seasonality you have in your existing business? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. The Rhiag business is pretty consistent with our other European businesses. It tends to slow down a little bit around the holidays if you will. The glass business, the fourth quarter tends to turn down a little bit as well. Some of the OE is going to shut down around the holidays and the like. And so it's not a perfect spread of 25% a quarter across the year, if you will. So there are some gives and takes. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. On the aftermarket side of the glass, Tony, obviously winter weather is good for them, with salts, and \u2013 causing stone chips and rock chips. So a little bit of seasonality in the winter as well. Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets : Great. Thank you for your time. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Tony. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with C.L. King & Associates. Please proceed with your question. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Most of mine have been answered. But on the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions, you've indicated what you thought the accretion might be in 2017 for a full annualized run rate. Any change to your \u2013 what are you seeing there? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. Nothing, Bill. I mean the increase in our guidance is basically $0.17 a share. That's the exact same $0.17 that collectively we announced when we chatted about those transactions in December and February respectively, again picking up $0.11 from the Rhiag acquisition and $0.06 from the PGW transaction. When you think about how that gets spread for the quarters, obviously, the second quarter is going to have the smallest impact because while we have three months of Rhiag, we only have two months of PGW. So you probably want to think about that as maybe being a nickel of the $0.17. Then Q3 and Q4 would suggest about $0.06 a piece against \u2013 it may be $0.065 in Q3 and $0.055 in Q4 just because of the seasonality, some of the seasonality that we just talked about. But again, the $0.17 increase in our guidance is exactly consistent with what we've previously announced for the two transactions. And on \u2013 what we saw in Q1 even though they weren't on our ledger, if you will, they're tracking the plan which is good. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks for that color. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Bill. Devon, I think we have time for one more call. Operator : Okay. Our next and final question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Please proceed with your question. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Thanks for squeezing me in. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hello, Jason. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : My questions are answered. Did want to ask though, if you could provide an estimate for interest expense for the year? Thanks. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I don't have that at my fingertips. For the first quarter, our interest cost was running at about 3.8% on a total blended basis with all the fees and everything else. And we've got about $3.4 billion of debt, roughly probably $100 million, when you do that math. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Thank you very much. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No problem. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, everyone, for your time today. And we look forward to speaking with you in July, when we report our 2016 Q2 results. Have a great day. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Analysts : Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the LKQ Corporation Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joe Boutross, Investor Relations for LKQ Corporation. Thank you. Mr. Boutross, you may begin. Joseph P. Boutross - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Devon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Rob Wagman and Nick Zarcone. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factor discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Rob Wagman, our CEO. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Joe. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today. This morning, I will begin our review with a few high level financial metrics, followed by an update on our operating segments and some macro trends we witnessed in Q2. Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our financial performance. Turning to slide three. Q2 revenue reached a record $2.45 billion, an increase of 33.3% as compared to $1.84 billion in the second quarter of 2015. Net income for the second quarter of 2016 was $140.7 million, an increase of 17.6% as compared to $119.7 million for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, net income was $169.2 million, an increase of 34% as compared to the $126.3 million for the same period of 2015. Diluted earnings per share of $0.46 for Q2 increased 17.9% from $0.39 for the second quarter of 2015, while adjusted diluted EPS increased from $0.41 to $0.55, an increase of 34.1%. Nick will provide more specifics on these adjustments shortly. During the quarter, organic revenue growth for parts and services was a respectable 5.4%, despite facing tough year-over-year comps and a continuation of the challenging weather dynamics we faced in Q1 globally. Let's now turn to our North America operations. There is no doubt that the impact of the mild winter in Q1 continued into Q2 as collision claims were down in many states. According to CCC, total year-to-date collision claims were up only 2.3%. In addition, the U.S. market witnessed average temperatures well above historical levels, making year-to-date 2016 the third warmest on record with only 2012 and 2006 being warmer. Also, year-to-date precipitation was mixed across North America with key markets like Pennsylvania witnessing levels 17% below historical averages, while Colorado was 14% above. With that said, it's important to note that this impact was not consistent across North America. The geographic regions of Canada, the Northeast and the Midwest had declines in Q1 repairable claims and organic growth and the metrics in these regions were soft again in Q2. Conversely, our Central and Southeast regions which had nearly double-digit organic growth in Q1 continued that trend of solid organic growth in Q2. Despite the tough comp and the short-term challenges of weather and subsequent lower claims volume, North America delivered Q2 and year-to-date organic revenue growth for parts and services of 3.1% and 4% respectively. During Q2, we purchased over 72,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American wholesale operations, a 2.9% decrease over Q2 2015. Procurement costs at auction increased over Q2 2015 by 2.7%. But again, we continue to buy a slightly younger vehicle year-over-year. For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 9.6% and 16.8%, respectively, year-over-year and in the quarter. In addition, our North American operations improved gross margins during the quarter which included 40 basis points of improvement from the aftermarket procurement initiatives implemented during 2016. And lastly, during the quarter, we added a top 10 carrier to our Keys IQ (05:35), proprietary aftermarket parts program. This carrier was a solid win for our North American team, given this carrier was using aftermarket parts only on a limited basis. We expect to have the entire program fully deployed by November 1, 2016. In our self-service retail business during Q2, we acquired over 138,000 lower cost self-service and crush only cars which is a 5.3% increase over Q2 2015. Similar to Q1, we increased our self-service procurement to take advantage of the favorable pricing to the higher quality vehicles in this line of business. Nick will provide more details on scrap shortly. Turning to our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC. During Q2, the revenue and number of aftermarket purchase orders processed through the CCC platform grew 91% and 66% respectively year-over-year. Briefly, I want to provide an update on our sales force effectiveness and route optimization productivity initiatives discussed on the last call. During the quarter, our sales force effectiveness efforts focused on increasing the level of outbound calls per sales rep which increased from 17.2 to 18 per day, a 4% increase sequentially from Q1 to Q2 2016. In addition, in June, we launched an add-on sales program to drive incremental sales per order with a specific group of SKUs. The early results of this launch are encouraging with some of the SKUs in the program doubling in sales. Though the dollar increase in sales from this program are minimal, the intent is to instill discipline in our sales force to continuously focus on selling deeper into every customer and every order. Also, during the quarter, we continue to make great strides with the implementation of Roadnet, the Tier 1 provider we selected for the technology component of our route optimization efforts. At the end of Q2, our current utilization rate with Roadnet reached 80%, accounting for over 3,400 vehicles driving over 285,000 miles and making over 42,000 stops on a daily basis. Thus far with this initiative, our focus has been to introduce our operations to the use of Roadnet. Once we have reached full installation by year end, we will begin the arduous task of assessing all the opportunities that exist across our networks and fleet. Combined, this should generate operational efficiencies and incremental margin within our North American business. Now moving to our European operations. In Q2, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 8% and acquisition growth of 57.5%, primarily related to Rhiag which were offset by a decrease of 3.7% related to foreign exchange rates. During Q2, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 9.6%, and for branches opened more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 7.8%. I am pleased with this growth given the extremely wet weather conditions in the quarter. According to the UK Met Office, June was the 11th wettest since 1910 which had a slight impact on road travel in the midst of a normal busy driving season. During the quarter, ECP opened seven new branches, bringing our network to 206 branches. During Q2, collision parts sales at ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 18.2%. Also during the quarter, ECP collision entered into a parts agreement with CRN or the Car Repair Network, a nationwide network of over 170 repairers that combined are responsible for over 18,000 repairs per year. In addition to CRN, we successfully achieved approval status for the supply of parts to the largest UK repair group, Nationwide Accident Repair Centers, following its successful tender process. And lastly on ECP, I'd like to note that while the UK referendum to leave the EU has created some near-term uncertainty and negatively impacted its currency, we do expect that people will largely continue to drive their vehicles. As most of you are aware, the demand for the parts we sell in Europe are related to the total miles driven in the average age of cars on the road. Neither of which should be directly impacted by the results of the referendum. And frankly, in tough economic times, the value proposition of alternative parts becomes more attractive. Nick will provide additional color on the referendum impact shortly. And now turning to our Sator business. During Q2, Sator had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.4%. Also, as mentioned on our Q1 call, our investments in 2014 and 2015 continue to drive margin improvements at Sator with Q2 recording the highest gross and EBITDA margins achieved since acquiring the business in May of 2013. And now an update on Rhiag. Q2 was the first full quarter of ownership of Rhiag. Overall, Rhiag tracked in line with our expectation and is executing on its growth initiatives. Since we acquired Rhiag in March, it has added 11 new branch locations to the network. We have been very busy with the integration with our teams focused on the purchasing functions. As I speak, we are keenly focused on gathering the necessary data and putting in place the communication lines to achieve the targeted synergies for building a sustainable pan-European procurement function. As an example, we have learned that Rhiag has certain branded products that ECP will be able to distribute, allowing ECP to augment or replace some of its existing suppliers. Not only will this example reduce the number of vendors and the complexity associated with the current suppliers in the UK, but it will also improve margins. With that said, we continue to believe that we are well along and on the right path to building a company that's unique that will have benefit from our scale and common ownership to create a leading position throughout all of Europe. Now on to our specialty segment. Our specialty segment continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year total revenue growth of 18.5% in the quarter, including the benefits of the Coast acquisition and strong organic revenue growth of 8%. This continued solid organic growth is largely due to the expansion of our specialty delivery routes, the integration of the Coast business on to our existing delivery fleet, expanded warehouse service levels, a strong SAAR and enhanced inventory offerings. And lastly, specialty continued their integration activities from the Coast acquisition by consolidating additional Coast distribution centers into our existing network. At the end of Q2, only 4 of the 17 original Coast warehouses were in operation. As previously mentioned, on April 21, 2016, the company closed its acquisition of PGW, a leading global distributor and manufacturer of automotive glass products. With this acquisition, we now have a new reporting segment that Nick will cover further. Regarding their operations, during the quarter, the PGW team secured a manufacturer renewal agreement for an existing OE platform with a new model launch, and also, a one-year renewal contract with a large North American MSO for their ARG business. In addition to the PGW acquisition during the second quarter of 2016, LKQ acquired a distributor of aftermarket automotive products in Belgium. At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more details and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everybody on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter and over the next few minutes I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of our core segments during the second quarter, before touching on the balance sheet and then addressing our revised guidance for 2016. The short version of our financial performance in Q2 of 2016 is that we had a terrific quarter, and taken as a whole, performed ahead of our expectations. While the revenue growth in North America was a bit behind expectations, the margins in this segment were very strong. In addition, the European operations performed well, the two big acquisitions were slightly above target and we finally got a small boost from a sequential increase in scrap steel prices. To refresh everyone's memory, Rhiag closed in late March and was included for the full quarter while PGW closed in late April and contributed for only 10 weeks. As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the second order of 2016 was $2.45 billion, representing a 33% increase over last year. That reflects a 36.8% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by an 11.2% decrease in other revenue. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 5.4% from organic, plus 32.8% from acquisitions, for a constant currency growth of 38.2% before backing out the translation impact of FX which was a 1.4% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results. As noted on page 11 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins declined 180 basis points to 37.6% due entirely to the impact of the acquisitions. You will recall that when we initially announced the transactions, we highlighted the fact that both Rhiag and PGW have lower gross margins than our historical businesses. Excluding the two big acquisitions, gross margins were actually up by about 70 basis points during the quarter. While consolidated gross margins were down, consolidated operating expenses as a percent of revenue were also about 160 basis points below last year. Some of that reflects the impact of the different margin structure of the two acquisitions and some of it reflects improved efficiencies in the historical businesses. Segment EBITDA totaled $319 million for the quarter, reflecting a 37% increase from 2015. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 13%, a 30-basis point increase over the 12.7% recorded last year. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced an increase in restructuring cost, primarily related to expenses connected with the integration of our specialty acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization was up almost $23 million, most all of which relates to the impact of the two big acquisitions. The same holds true for interest expense which was up by about $12 million. With that, pre-tax income increased 16% over last year. Our effective tax rate during the second quarter was 34.75%, down from the 34.85% in 2015 and consistent with the annual guidance we provided in April. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.46 which was up 18% compared to the $0.39 reported last year. Adjusted EPS which is before restructuring charges, the loss on debt extinguishment, the hedging gain, intangible asset amortization and a non-cash inventory step-up adjustment related to the PGW acquisition was $0.55 a share versus $0.41, reflecting a 34% improvement. As mentioned, the impact of scrap was a bit of a tailwind in the quarter and actually helped earnings per share by about $0.02. Currency fluctuations negatively impacted earnings per share by about $0.01 during the second quarter and we anticipate that currencies will have a bigger negative impact in the back half of the year, given the devaluation of the pound sterling following the Brexit vote. As highlighted on page 13, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins. This became more accentuated now that we have closed both Rhiag and PGW and you saw a shift in the second quarter metrics where in North American parts and services revenue accounted for less than 40% of the consolidated total. And with that, let's get on to the details of the operating segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the second quarter of 2016 increased to $1.81 billion or a 3.4% increase over 2015. This is the combination of a 5.6% growth rate in parts and services, offset by 11.4% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was due primarily to the sale of our precious metals business at the end of Q2 of last year, and lower prices received for other metals such as aluminum, platinum, palladium and rhodium relative to Q2 of last year. The 5.6% growth in North American parts and services was the combination of 3.1% organic growth and 2.8% acquisition growth, offset by a 30-basis point FX decline due to the weakness of the Canadian dollar. There is no doubt that the impact of the mild winter had a bleed over impact on our Q2 revenue. According to CCC, repairable collision claims were down on a year-over-year basis in many of the big population snow belt states, including Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois. Collision parts simply don't sell as well when accident frequency is down. As Rob mentioned, this was not consistent across North America, as our Central and Southeast regions which had excellent organic growth in Q1 continued to report above average organic growth in Q2. Gross margins in North America during the second quarter were 44.1%, a 170 basis-point increase over 2015. The benefits of the procurement initiatives started to manifest themselves in Q2 and the lower cost of aftermarket inventory added approximately 40 basis points of improvement to the gross margin of our overall North American operations. Salvage also experienced a slight increase in gross margins, while our self-service operations contributed a 110 basis-point increase to North American gross margins, largely reflecting the sequential improvement in scrap steel pricing. You will note that scrap spiked in May, reaching over $150 per ton, but has reversed course and we're now back down into the low $100 range. With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we gained about 30 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of last year, reflecting improvements in both the wholesale and self-service operations. On the upside, we continue to experience improvements in both fuel and facility cost, relative to last year, but on the downside, we lost a bit of margin related to freight expense. In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the second quarter was $164 million, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the North American segment was 15.2% in Q2 of this year, up 190 basis points from the 13.3% reported in the comparable period of the prior year. You will recall that in Q1, we indicated that we expected the benefit from our productivity initiatives to pick up as we move through the year. As just mentioned, we saw some benefit in our cost of goods sold, related to the procurement savings of our aftermarket parts inventory. In addition, there are procurement benefits in many other expense categories across North America. The route optimization effort is now rolled out across 80% of the country, and we anticipate we will begin to see the positive impact of that program begin to accrue over the next few quarters. In total, we estimate that the aggregate benefit of the productivity initiatives during the second quarter was approximately $0.01 a share. Moving on to our European segment. Total revenue in the second quarter accelerated to $824 million, up from $510 million, a 62% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the second quarter was 8%, reflecting the combination of 9.6% growth at ECP, 4.4% growth at Sator, and 9.9% in Sweden. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 58% increase in revenue with most \u2013 with the most significant amount reflecting the addition of Rhiag. So, on a constant currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 66%. These gains were offset by a 4% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling. As you can see on page 19, the average rate during the quarter for the sterling was about 6% below last year, and it fell an incremental 7% to about $1.33 at quarter end due to the Brexit vote. More recently, the sterling has been down further to about $1.30 to $1.31. The translation impact of this will absolutely weigh on a reported U.S. dollar result for the rest of the year, probably to the tune of $0.01 in each of the third and fourth quarters. Gross margins in Europe were 37.4%, a 50 basis-point decline from the comparable period of 2015, largely reflecting the impact of Rhiag. Excluding the impact of Rhiag, gross margins in Europe increased 100 basis points as we continue to benefit from improved procurement in the UK and the internalization of the gross margin from our acquisitions in the Netherlands. As mentioned when we announced the Rhiag acquisition back in December, given the three step distribution model in Italy and Switzerland, Rhiag has a lower gross margin structure than either ECP or Sator. The impact was not as significant as initially anticipated, however, and after mapping Rhiag's general ledger accounts to LKQ's chart of accounts and completing the conversion from IFRS to U.S. GAAP, Rhiag had gross margins of about 34.6% during the second quarter. With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 60 basis-point improvement on a consolidated European basis. We benefited from a 170 basis-point reduction in operating expense due to the addition of Rhiag which has lower operating expenses as a percent of revenue than either ECP or Sator. We also saw about a 40-basis point improvement in SG&A expense as a percent of revenue primarily at ECP. Offsetting these gains was 140-basis point increase in facility and warehouse expense. As you will recall, we started paying rents and related property costs on the new distribution facility in Tamworth, England in February. The incremental costs related to this project in Q2 were approximately \u00a32.2 million or about $3.2 million which reflects a 40-basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue for Europe. We were also impacted by new branches in-housed at ECP and an increase in warehouse personnel at Sator related to new product introductions. European EBITDA totaled $90 million, a 67% increase over last year, reflecting solid performance at ECP and Sator and the positive impact of Rhiag. Excluding the negative impact of FX rates, constant currency EBITDA growth in Europe was 71%. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA for the second quarter of 2016 was 10.9% versus 10.6% last year, a 30-basis point improvement, even after taking into account the impact of the T2 project. Turning to our specialty segment. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $337 million, a 19% increase over the comparable quarter of 2015. The organic growth rate of 8% was quite strong while the impact of the Coast acquisition in August of 2015 added 11% to revenue growth. Gross margins in our specialty segment for the second quarter decreased about 160 basis points compared to last year, largely due to the impact of stocking two new specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington State, which were not in operation at this time last year, as well as increased customer volume rebates associated with the higher sales levels. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in specialty were up about 30 basis points. Facility expense increased due to certain costs related to the two new distribution centers mentioned a bit ago. On the plus side, we continue to see the SG&A leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network as well as the benefit of the lower fuel prices. EBITDA for the specialty segment was $42 million, up 4% from Q2 of 2015, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the specialty segment decreased 170 basis points to 12.4% in 2016 compared to 14.1% last year. Remember, this is a highly seasonal business and you should assume these margins will moderate as we move through the back half of the year. On page 22, you can see the impact of the acquisition of PGW. Revenue for the quarter was $210 million which again reflects 10 weeks of activity. You should note, Q2 tends to be a very strong quarter for PGW. Gross margins were 18.4%, but this included a one-time non-cash charge of $10 million, reflecting the write-off of inventory. You may recall that on the Q1 call, I mentioned that under U.S. GAAP, we had to mark the closing date inventory of PGW up to the market value, and this increase would get amortized as a non-cash expense as we turn the inventory. We anticipated an $8 million to $12 million charge and it came right in the middle at $10 million. It doesn't affect our adjusted net income or adjusted EPS, but it was a one-time hit to gross margin, diluted net income and diluted EPS during the quarter. Excluding this one-time non-cash item, the gross margin at PGW would have been 23.3% which is generally consistent with the expectations we highlighted at the time the transaction was announced. EBITDA margins for PGW were 11.1%, slightly higher than the annual level mentioned when we announced the transaction, largely reflecting the seasonality of the business as Q2 tends to be relatively strong. Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on slide 23, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations during the first six months was approximately $355 million as we experienced strong cash earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. During the first six months of 2016, we deployed a little more than $1.9 billion of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $102 million to fund capital expenditures and almost $1.8 billion to fund acquisitions. The acquisitions of Rhiag and PGW were financed by drawing down on our line of credit, and the completion of a euro note offering back in April. We closed the quarter with approximately $273 million of cash, of which, $196 million was held outside of the United States, and we had slightly more than $3.3 billion of total debt outstanding. So our net debt was approximately $3.1 billion, and on a pro forma basis, taking into account the impact of the acquisitions, our leverage ratio was about 2.8 times, latest 12-month EBITDA. At quarter end, total availability under our credit facility was approximately $1.1 billion which we believe is sufficient to support the continued growth of our businesses. Finally, as you noted in the press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016. Again, Rhiag closed on March 18 and PGW on April 21, so we will record a tad more than nine months and eight months of their respective results in 2016. As it relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we slightly reduced the guidance for 2016 to 5.5% to 7.0%, reflecting the softness in the North American year-to-date results following the mild winter. Our range for adjusted EPS which excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization is now $1.79 to $1.87 per share with the midpoint of $1.83. The increase from the previous midpoint of $1.81 reflects the better than expected Q2 results, partially offset by anticipated headwinds from the currencies in the back half of the year, particularly the pound sterling, lower scrap steel prices than experienced in Q2, and a better appreciation for the seasonality of the two new acquisitions, particularly related to typical Q4 slowdowns. The new EPS guidance assumes the pound sterling and euro exchange rates of $1.30 and $1.10, respectively, and importantly that scrap remains at current levels as well. Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains constant at 34.75%.Our current guidance for cash flow from operations is up a bit to approximately $585 million to $635 million, and the guidance for capital spending is unchanged. At this point, I will return the call back over to Rob to wrap up. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Nick. To summarize, we are pleased with our second quarter performance. As we enter the back half of 2016, I am confident that we will continue to execute on our performance priorities of organic growth, margin expansion, the leveraging of our networks and our passion for delivering our one-stop shop solution and industry leading fill rates to each of our customers. We believe that great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together. Every day, our 38,000 plus employees work together to build a better company for our customers and shareholders, and for that, I would like to say thank you. This team effort combined with our unique competitive position in each of our business segments continues to translate into consistent earnings growth for our shareholders which has allowed us to increase our guidance for 2016, despite the unpredictable weather anomalies we faced earlier this year. And with that, Devon, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Rob, it looks like you mentioned collisions were soft. But are you seeing any impact from growth in the number of cars in your sweet spot that might offset some of the weakness in collision activity? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Craig, it was soft as I said in my prepared remarks. CCC reported 2.3% growth, and we came in at 4% for the first half. So we still are taking market share, but to answer your question about the cars hitting the sweet spot, we expect that at the end of this year, early 2017. So, as the cars start coming out of that \u2013 hitting that three-year spot, so it's pretty flat right now year-over-year. But at the end of 2016, early 2017, we start to see it expand. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And then, Nick, to what extent can you quantify the impact of the efficiency projects you're undertaking in North America? I know you've made a number of changes there. I'm wondering what you think the full annualized impact might be down the road. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Again, Craig, as we mentioned on several calls here, we're going to report that as we go. We are thrilled that in Q2, the total impact was $0.01 per share to the positive. Just to put that in perspective, that's \u2013 $0.01 a share is $5 million of pre-tax. We would anticipate that we've got that locked in for the rest of the year. We do anticipate to be able to garner some improved efficiencies as we move through 2016 and 2017 because some of the programs take a little bit of time to ramp up. But, again, on a \u2013 if you want to annualize the second quarter, that'd be $0.04 a share or the better part of $20 million. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good morning, gentlemen. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Nate. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: So just to dig a little bit further on the organic growth, I mean clearly, weather is what it is. Normally, with some of the positive factors in terms of the miles driven, more parts to repair, all the things that we've talked about, particularly and again, with somewhat of the market share gains, I'd still normally expect the spread between the industry growth and you guys to be just a little bit wider, I mean still positive. Just wondering if there was anything going on there in terms of the mix of geographies? Again, you pointed out some were stronger, some were a little bit weaker. And then, also, whether may be the conversion to Roadnet had any bit of, at all, any disruption in terms of that organic growth at all? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Certainly, the geographic differences, Nate, were pretty stark actually. We were very strong in the South and the Central regions. And the Rust Belt or the Winter Belt was very, very light. it really matched up almost identical with what CCC gave us for claims. One other thing that CCC pointed out to us was pretty interesting, a later model car is being repaired now, which is a little bit of headwind at first because obviously newer cars will get new parts. There aren't a lot of used parts in for the stream yet as well as the aftermarket parts for that matter. So we are expecting when that sweet spot moves our way, we are expecting to see more growth in our \u2013 for those type of products because it will just be much more demand. Remember, we talk about that three to eight years, we're bringing in that 2009 model year now car where it was the lowest SAAR production of all. So we'll get through it next year, and we think a lot more cars will start hitting the sweet spot. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then in terms of \u2013 well, and maybe this is a separate question then. But in terms of the conversion over to Roadnet, obviously, you'll get a lot of ultimate efficiencies on that. But is there any like near-term disruption in terms of your drivers just getting used to that or in terms of just the different routing schedules? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. There are some pretty smoothly actually. We did a very controlled rollout of that, so no hiccups there. What we do anticipate is once we get the whole country rolled out, we'll start looking at the individual routes to really start to drive the efficiency. So no real hiccups in that rollout at all. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. But, Nate, just to be clear, there's absolutely no correlation between the distribution of the parts which is really what Roadnet goes after and the ultimate sale of the part. The reality is, when collision frequency is down, you're going to sell less parts. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Sure. Totally get that. Okay. And then in terms of the procurement effort over in Europe, that obviously seems to be progressing well. Can you talk about, particularly with now Rhiag in the fold a little bit in terms of how those discussions are going and how much further you think in terms of the opportunity, in terms of those procurement savings? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Obviously, what we're doing now, Nate, is working with each individual manufacturer and pooling our combined purchases. And that's an arduous task to get through to get them to, obviously, agree to the terms that we're looking for and pooling all of those orders together. As we add more and more companies, it kind of resets it every time. So the talks are well under way. We have consolidated our purchasing under one lead person now for Europe. And those talks will continue and we'll continue to obviously work those. September is \u2013 big conference over there, it's called Automechanika. We have meetings with every one of our manufacturers and expect some positive results out of those meetings. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then just a check-the-box question but any updates on State Farm in terms of how those discussions are going? Obviously, maybe they got a little bit of reprieve in terms of accident rates here in the first half, but obviously, the pressures keep building I would think. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I would love to say that that top 10 carrier I mentioned in my prepared remarks was State Farm, it was not, unfortunately. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right. Okay. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It was a carrier who had multiple brands and only one of the brands was using my aftermarket parts and now they're bringing the whole company over. So that's a good win. As far as State Farm goes, no, nothing new there, Nate. I agree with you that they may have gotten a little bit of reprieve this half, first half, but GEICO continues to take market share and we keep talking to State Farm on a regular basis. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks for all that. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Nate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks good morning, guys. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Ben. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: So, if I look at your organic parts and services guidance for the full year, and I try to infer second half North American organic growth, it looks like it's something mid single-digits. Is it fair \u2013 which that suggests a sequential acceleration in the two-year stack in North America, is it fair to think that the tail for this weather impact starts to dissipate here as we move into the back half? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's our thoughts, Ben, that we should start to normalize here now. And we are anticipating mid single-digits back to where we projected earlier in the year. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, Nick, if you could, and this is a little bit handholding, but are you able to quantify the embedded assumptions around the impact from FX scrap steel on an EPS basis for the balance of the year? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. We believe that if the currency rates stay where they are, basically $1.30 on the pound and $1.10 on the euro, that will hit us as I indicated in my prepared remarks for about $0.01 a share a quarter, so $0.01 in the third quarter, $0.01 in the fourth quarter. On scrap, we got $0.02 to the positive in the second quarter. That was an unexpected surprise. If you look at the chart in the deck, you saw that the scrap prices during the month of May hit just north of $150 a ton. The average for the quarter was $1.38 which is up from $91 in Q1. And now we're back down to $115, right. And so, if you look at the change last year from Q2 to Q3, we went from $140 a ton, down to $123. And if you went to the Q3 script last year, that was $0.02 a share to the negative. So, if you just replay that this year, there could be as much as $0.02. We're hoping it will be a little bit less just because we were on a consistent downward trend in scrap pricing last year. This year, it's only the one quarter tick up and then it looks like back down. So there's a chance it won't be quite as significant, but figure $0.01 or $0.02 in the back of the year for scrap as well. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks. That's helpful. And then I think, Nick, I heard you say that when everything shook out on Rhiag, gross margins in the quarter were 34.6%, which is materially higher than what was anticipated on a full year basis. How does that change your expectation for the full year basis for Rhiag's gross margin profile? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So the total doesn't change when you think about the underlying profitability of the company. It's just \u2013 under IFR \u2013 International Reporting Standards, right, you have different costs get reported in cost of goods sold as opposed to operating expense. So, while the total doesn't change, it's just a shift, higher gross margins and the offset is in operating expenses. We anticipated that Rhiag would be at like an 11% EBITDA margin. When we announced the transaction back in December, they were north of that. For the second quarter, there is seasonality to their business. As an example, there is \u2013 in their Italian business, there's three less working days in the back half of the year than the front half of the year. In the Czech Republic, there's two less days. And so the fourth quarter which traditionally is a little bit softer in our European businesses, you're going to see that with Rhiag as well. So one key thing, and this is true with PGW as well, is there have been no changes to the annual plans for either Rhiag or PGW. We are very confident that the accretion expectations that we set forth when we announced those transactions will absolutely occur. Again, there's a little bit of shift between the quarters with Q2 being a really good quarter for both those entities. And so the benefits will be a little bit less in Q3 and Q4. But again, we're thrilled with how both the big acquisitions are performing under the first quarter or so of our ownership. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Ben, I just want to add one more thing to what Nick said on the Rhiag deal, we announced that we, in my prepared remarks, I said we did 11 branch openings. We're going to do an additional 20 to 25 in the back half of the year as well because we're so pleased with the way the acquisition's going. So it's going to mimic a lot of what we did at ECP, the year we bought that as well. So very pleased with that acquisition. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: That's great. That helps. And then just last one for me, if I think about the implications of Brexit, obviously, it's pretty nebulous at this point, but how do you think that impacts your acquisition strategy abroad, if at all? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, a couple comments on Brexit, we do see likely an increase in cost of goods coming into the UK. However, because of the devaluation of this pound sterling, we do expect all of our competitors to face that obviously. So we expect to pass that through. In terms of the acquisition strategy, as I mentioned and Nick mentioned as well, we're going to keep building out the Rhiag network through greenfields. And we will look for acquisitions as well. Likely, probably going to turn down a little bit, we expect some of the sellers might pull back and wait for the smoke to clear a little bit. But we are watching and we think it's an opportunity to continue and grow the business. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Good luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Bret. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Hey, is there a way to look at the North American growth, sort of breaking out traffic versus ticket maybe? Is there any trend either on inflation or deflation in pricing? And/or change in penetration of alternative parts? Just trying to get a feeling for that, the drivers of organic? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So nothing that \u2013 none of the data that we analyzed on a daily, weekly, monthly basis, whether it's the number of calls we're receiving, the number of formal part request, the number of estimates, conversion rates, et cetera, et cetera, would suggest that there's any substantive changes in the market as a whole. The reality is, well in general, miles driven should correlate positively to collision activity, right, number of cars on the road. At the end of the day, the key metric is the number of accidents that actually occur. And it's been soft in the first half of the year. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I will add to what Nick said, Bret, that CCC did \u2013 we had a quarterly update from them on that chart that we have in our slide deck, our investor deck that shows the part penetration per estimate, another increase by the alternative parts industry for Q2. So continue to take market share from the OEs. I just think it's a \u2013 the result of just the lower claims volume right now. But when that returns to normal, I think we'll see the acceleration come back. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. And then your comment about a top 10 carrier that you've added, obviously, not State Farm. Are there other top 10s that are under-indexed to alternative parts? We've all focused on State Farm but is there other share to gain there? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That was the last one that had half of the \u2013 or actually about three quarters of their company not writing and a quarter writing. So that's it other than State Farm of course. Allstate, when you take a company like Allstate, they only write certified parts and that's why we always highlight the number of certified parts hitting the marketplace. So they have limited use, in other words they won't write all parts. But everyone else on the top 10 are writing some form of alternative parts now, other than State Farm, on aftermarket. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And a last question, you mentioned PGW picked up an MSO renewal. What percentage of PGW's replacement glass business is through MSOs? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's pretty small actually, less than 2%. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge. Please proceed with your question. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Great. Thank you for taking the question and good morning, gentlemen. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Jamie. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Jamie. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : I wanted to follow-up on sort of two key topics. So first you alluded to in your slides, and apologies if you went into more detail on the prepared remarks, I had to dial in a little bit late, apologies for that, you're buying fewer units for slightly higher dollars per unit, so higher quality vehicles and there's some expected follow through, I think, as we discussed in the past that you can maybe sell those parts for higher prices as well. Just wanted to get an update on that sort of theme and how it's playing out? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we are intentionally buying a better vehicle. It's slightly newer. Younger, I should say in age with that intent of \u2013 as that car part shifts to a newer car, Jamie, we want to have obviously newer model parts in the inventory. So it is going to plan. We are buying that younger vehicle and we are absolutely getting more gross margin dollars. We run a report here that it is showing that we are actually getting more dollars out of the same amount of cars. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : And as the Houston (52:55) operation improves, are you starting to see benefits of an inventory turn perspective as well? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Not really. The inventory, historically, has turned about three times a year. There's no big changes there. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Got it. Okay and then... Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : On a consolidated basis, it'll begin to turn a bit faster just because of PGW has a much higher turn, because their OE business has basically direct delivery to the assembly lines. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : And the PGW turns just from a housekeeping perspective, roughly you're saying that your core business is three times, what's PGW? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Order of six to seven times. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Got it. And then I mean there's clearly a lot on your plate with respect to Rhiag and PGW integration, the AlixPartners and Tamworth initiatives, so I don't want to sort of add more to your plate, but it does seem from some peer reports in the auto aftermarket that results have slowed or certainly decelerated on a comp store sales basis. And I'm wondering if that presents an opportunity for you, as you think about other North American verticals, whether that's wholesale channels or other sort of larger acquisition opportunities. And I know you discussed that, it was a later decade sort of endeavor but wondering if you're pulling forward that or thinking about pulling that forward, at all? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think that's fair Jamie. It is opening up new opportunities for us, particularly in the accessories space. Those vertical moves \u2013 we have a lot of opportunities there to expand that size of the business. We are not in the reman transmission business today. We think that's a great opportunity for us. So we are looking at those opportunities very closely now. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Okay. I appreciate the additional color and best of luck in the next quarter. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jamie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Just wanted to ask you guys just a clarification question. I know you're a little downbeat the weather trends curtailed some of the U.S. growth in the first half. But it seems like you're excited about and pleased how PGW performed in the last two months of the quarter since the end of April when you took it in your operations. Is it reasonable to assume, by that, that you're seeing parts and service business kind of the traditional parts ex-glass perform well in May and June, maybe better than what you saw in the first, call it, four months of the year? And, if anything, it's hard to believe that the glass business could be doing really well and then the component part of the business not doing so well? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I mean, John, PGW was \u2013 had a really good contribution to the quarter. Again, they haven't changed their overall projections for the year, their budgets or their plans. So they're right on target. That's a combination of both the aftermarket business and the OE business. Obviously, the OE business plays to different dynamics than our historical businesses if you will. The reality is they're very \u2013 they're different, right. And the drivers of our core North American business are different than the core drivers of the PGW business. Again, we think our core North American business had a great quarter. I mean the margins were up. Gross margins were up. Operating margins were up. Profitability was up nicely. Yeah, the organic growth was a little bit lower than I think was expected. But given what was happening with total, the frequency of collisions, I mean all put together, we think we had a terrific first quarter in North America. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: John, I'll just add to what Nick said with the PGW acquisition. We are starting to sell glass in our LKQ facilities. So those reps have access to that. So, yeah, we are \u2013 we do like that the \u2013 certainly, the distribution side of the business, to be able to cross-sell in our different entities. We're looking at opportunities in Europe as well. So we're very pleased with that acquisition. John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Great. And then I just wanted to ask, you gave the statistic about the benefit you're getting out of the sales force productivity, I think you said 17 calls or 17.2 calls going to 18 calls maybe. Where do you ultimately see that going to over time? And how much productivity do you think that you can really drive from an external sales standpoint amongst the sales force? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, the biggest benefit we think we can get is just training. By consolidating our call centers and getting our people better trained and better monitored is the ultimate goal here. We talked about the CCC initiative where more and more is going online as an opportunity as well. So we just see just more effectiveness with our sales reps and just being able to better handle called line (58:19) as well. The way we're situated now with sales reps spread out all over, we now have the ability to move our phones. If the phones go down, we can move it to a different call center. We do plan on going to extended hours so that at 5 in the morning if someone on the West Coast wanted to order a part, if they're up early, those will ring on the East Coast. And when we close down at 5 o'clock in the East Coast, those calls will be ringing on the West Coast. So we expect expanded service because of the way we're going to be routing the calls and handling the sales force. So we do expect some good efficiencies to come out of this. John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Please proceed with your question. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Just back to the North American market again, is it possible to separate the percent of revenue generated from collision versus mechanical repair? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Collision today is roughly 30% of our total revenue. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : And how about the performance of that 30% for North America in the quarter? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. The \u2013 again, I think the question you're asking is collision, kind of performance of collision versus mechanical? Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Just the North American, I'm just trying to flesh out the collision performance versus the rest of the business there? Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. The collision side actually performed a little bit better than mechanical. I mean the two biggest parts we take off of a salvage vehicle is obviously the engine and the transmission. On the aftermarket side, we saw no mechanical. So mechanical strictly relates to the salvage side of the business. The reality is those parts start selling kind of year seven or so. If you take a look at the request that we get for engines and transmissions, about 15% of the total request relate to model years that are one to six years old. 65% of the requests come from model years that are seven to 15 years old. And so the kind of the sweet spot for the mechanical side, yeah, are older vehicles, and as \u2013 the strong SAAR rate over the last several years, it's going to take some time before those cars come in to the sweet spot on the mechanical side. So a little bit stronger performance on the collision versus the mechanical. But nothing \u2013 not significant. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : And what is the approximate annual revenue generated from the UK collision market? Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's annualizing roughly about $80 million now. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Thanks very much. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jason. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wagman for closing comments. Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you everyone for your time today, and we look forward to speaking with you in October when we report Q3 2016 results. Have a great day. Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Rob Wagman. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thank you, Joe. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today. This morning, I will begin our review with a few high-level financial metrics followed by an update on our operating segments and some macro trends we witnessed in Q3. Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our financial performance. Turning to slide 3, Q3 revenue reached $2.39 billion, an increase of 30.3% as compared to $1.83 billion in the third quarter of 2015. Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $122.7 million, an increase of 21.1% as compared to $101.3 million for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, net income was $139.3 million, an increase of 26.8% as compared to $109.9 million for the same period of 2015. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2016 was $0.40, an increase of 21.2%, as compared to the $0.33 for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share was $0.45 in the third quarter of 2016, reflecting a 25% increase over $0.36 for the same period of 2015. During the quarter, we continued to witness the lingering effects of a mild winter and the headwinds of certain trends in the North American car park. Despite these dynamics the company delivered organic revenue growth for parts and services of 3.7%, an enviable performance compared to many companies in the global auto industry that were confronted with similar challenges and subsequently witnessed negative growth in the quarter. Turning to our North American organic revenue growth, during the quarter, organic revenue growth for parts and services was 2.1%, which is down from the first half of the year and below our expectations. Clearly, the macro trends in North America, such as miles driven and the size of the car park, continue to trend in our favor. But in order to grow our business, the number of collisions need to grow that will then increase the demand for our collision parts. According to CCC, collision and liability related auto claims for the first 9 months of 2016 were up only 2.4% nationally, not far from the 2.3% increase witnessed for the first 6 months of 2016. Furthering that point, when looking at state-level claims data from CCC, we continue to experience large regional variations. The Northeast and Midwest regions faced soft conditions, both experiencing year-over-year declines in repairable claims in certain key states. These two regions combined represent over 30% of our North American revenue. In addition, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, miles driven in the U.S. were up 3.4% in August, a measure that also witnessed significant regional differences. During August, miles driven in the Northeast and North Central regions were up only 1.2% and 2.1%, respectively. Lastly, though difficult to quantify, we believe the surge in the SAAR rate over the last 3 years is initially a headwind, as new vehicles tend to get new collision parts. The surge also impacts our engine and transmission sales, because these type of mechanical parts are covered under manufacturer's warranty. We also believe that the increase in vehicles in operation of model years 11 years and older has played a role in driving total loss rates above historical levels. Regardless of these short-term headwinds, we continue to believe that the car park is shifting in the right direction towards our collision sweet spot of vehicles 3 to 10 model years old. In fact, the number of vehicles in that sweet spot is expected to increase by a few percentage points in 2017. And now turning to operations. During Q3, we purchased 70,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American wholesale operations, a 1.4% decrease over Q3 2015. Procurement cost at auctions decreased over Q3 2015 by 1.9%. For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 12% and 17%, respectively, year-over-year in the quarter. In our self-service retail business, during Q3 we acquired 132,000 lower-cost self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 3.1% increase over Q3 2015. Similar to the first half of the year, we increased our self-service procurement during Q3 to take advantage of the favorable pricing for higher quality vehicles in this line of business. And lastly, I am pleased with the benefits we are witnessing with our productivity initiatives. During the quarter, North America realized 60 basis points of gross margin improvement from the aftermarket procurement savings alone. And now that we are fully installed with Roadnet, our route optimization technology, we are optimistic about its potential savings. Today, 95% of our delivery routes are actively using Roadnet. And we are already witnessing some initial cost savings per stop across 49,000 daily deliveries with 3,300 trucks. During his presentation, Nick will discuss the financial impact of these initiatives in the coming quarters. Now moving to our European operations. In Q3, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.7% and acquisition growth of 54.6%, primarily related to the Rhiag, which were offset by a decrease of 10.6% related to foreign exchange rates. During Q3, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.9%. And for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 5.3%. During the quarter, ECP opened three new branches, bringing our network to 209 branches. During Q3, collision parts sales at ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 13.2%. Turning to Sator. During Q3, Sator had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 5.1%. This organic revenue growth was primarily driven by the ongoing three-step conversion and integration efforts we have put in place. Now on to Rhiag. Rhiag tracked in line with our expectations during the quarter. Importantly, and as mentioned on the last call, we continue to aggressively gather the necessary data and communication plan amongst our European businesses to create a targeted and sustainable pan-European procurement function. To highlight the opportunity, Sator had an existing agreement on a particular brand and product category that Rhiag is also buying, but at a 10% higher cost. By leveraging the Sator agreement, Rhiag has budgeted a savings of \u20ac200,000 annually, and again on one product. Rhiag continues to execute on its growth initiatives and expand its footprint (9:23). During the quarter, the Rhiag team opened eight branches in Eastern Europe. Given the growth opportunities in the market, I am happy to announce that we have an additional 14 branches scheduled for Q4. Now onto our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment posted a year-over-year total revenue growth of 9.9% in the quarter, including the benefits of The Coast [Distribution System] acquisition, and organic revenue growth of 3.7%. We believe the modest organic growth was related the overall specialty market facing an unfavorable mix shift, as certain key product areas witnessed model year changes. Though still relatively high, we also faced a slight reduction in the year-over-year SAAR rate during the quarter. Lastly, Specialty finalized the integration activities from The Coast acquisition by consolidating all of The Coast distribution centers and sales processing into our existing network. And now an update on PGW. During the quarter, the PGW team secured another manufacturing renewal agreement for an existing OE platform with a new model launch. On PGW's aftermarket business, the team continues to receive industry accolades as the supplier of choice. These accolades were validated this quarter by signing an agreement with a major customer to procure an incrementally higher volume of windshields and sidelights in 2017. Turning to corporative development. In early October 2016, we acquired substantially all the business assets of Andrew Page Limited, a distributor of automotive parts in the United Kingdom. As part of this transaction, we acquired 102 Andrew Page branch locations. Andrew Page has a proud history of being a value-added supplier to the automotive repair industry in the UK. With this acquisition, we believe that the transaction will benefit Andrew Page's customers with an extended range of products and a continuation of the exceptional level of service that their employees have historically provided. As we did expect, the UK Competition and Markets Authority, or CMA, commenced the review of the acquisition to assess whether the transaction would unreasonably lessen competition in the UK market. During the CMA's review, we are not allowed to integrate the business subject to certain exceptions to allow us to support key operations. And there's always a risk that they may ask us to divest some or all of the business. Accordingly, until the CMA approves the transaction, we will not be able to achieve any of the projected synergies afforded by the integration of the combined businesses. We do anticipate the acquired business will continue to be modestly unprofitable during the review process. In addition to the Andrew Page announcement, during the third quarter of 2016, we acquired a distributor of automotive products in the Netherlands, a distributor of recreational vehicle products and accessories in the United Kingdom, a distributor of aftermarket automotive products in Ireland and a heavy-duty truck salvage yard in Minnesota. Our acquisition strategy has always been to acquire the best assets we can with high-quality management teams and use those strengths to lever the growth of the business. As we look across our key segments, the pipeline is healthy with tremendous opportunities to grow our existing market share in key markets, expand the depth of our product lines and enter new geographic markets and, in particular, throughout Europe. At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everybody on the call. I'm delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter. And over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of our core segments during the third quarter before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our revised guidance for 2016. The third quarter of 2016 when taken as a whole was an excellent quarter with revenue, Segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS of 30%, 32% and 25%, respectively, when compared to the third quarter of last year. While the revenue growth in North America was a bit behind expectations, the margins in this segment were very strong. In addition, the European operations continue to perform well and the two big acquisitions generally performed on target. As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2016 increased 30% over last year. That reflects a 33.2% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by a 9.4% decrease in other revenue. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 3.7% from organic, plus 32.6% from acquisitions for constant currency growth of 36.4% before backing up the translation impact of FX which was a 3.2% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results. As noted on page 11 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins declined 190 basis points to 37.0% due primarily to the impact of the acquisitions. You will recall that both Rhiag and PGW have lower gross margins than our historical businesses. Excluding the two big acquisitions, gross margins were actually up about 60 basis points. While the consolidated gross margins were down, consolidated operating expenses as a percent of revenue were also down about 200 basis points lower than last year. Some of that reflects the impact of the different margin structure of the two acquisitions and some of it reflects improved efficiencies in the historical businesses. Segment EBITDA totaled $274 million for the quarter, reflecting a 32% increase from 2015, and as a percent of revenue, Segment EBITDA was 11.5%, a 20-basis-point improvement over the 11.3% recorded last year. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced a $3.8 million increase in restructuring costs related to the integration of our acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization was up about $26 million, mostly related to the addition of Rhiag and PGW. The same holds true for interest expense which was up about $12 million. And with that, pre-tax income increased 16% in the quarter relative to last year. Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 31.7%, down from the 33.9% recorded in 2015. This lower rate reflects an ongoing rate of 34.75% and a $5 million benefit associated with the adoption of ASU 2016-09 which tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. All companies need to adopt this new accounting standard by the first quarter of 2017, and we elected to adopt early. We have excluded this benefit from our adjusted EPS calculation in order to provide an apples-to-apples comparison. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.40, which was up 21% compared to last year. Adjusted EPS, again, excluding restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization and the discrete tax benefit just mentioned, was $0.45 versus $0.36, reflecting a 25% improvement. Scrap had a small negative impact on earnings per share for the quarter, about $0.005, and currency fluctuations negatively impacted EPS growth by about $0.01 as well. As highlighted on page 13, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this revenue mix shift impacts the trends in consolidated margins. This has become more accentuated with our ownership of both Rhiag and PGW. And you saw a shift in the third quarter metrics where in North American parts and services revenue accounted for less than 40% of total consolidated revenue. And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Total revenue in our North American segment during the third quarter of 2016 increased to $1.047 billion or about 1% over 2015. This is the combination of a 2.3% growth rate in parts and services offset by a 9.5% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was due primarily to lower volumes and, to a lesser extent, lower prices received for a variety of metals. When looking at the North American growth, it's important to recognize that there were variations across the platform. As Rob mentioned, there were geographic differences with the Central and West regions performing much better than the Northeast and Midwest regions. Recycling grew at a faster rate than aftermarket, and even within aftermarket, certain car types like the core Keystone fenders, hoods, and lights grew faster than some other products related to cooling or aluminum wheels. So, there were spots of strength and spots of weakness. Gross margins in North America during the third quarter of 2016 were 43.8%, a 160 basis point increase over last year. Approximately 90 basis points of the improvement relate to the aftermarket operations, and the benefits of the procurement initiatives accounted for approximately 50 basis points of the 90 basis point improvement. Our salvage and Self Service operations contributed 70 basis points of increase to the North American gross margins. You will note that while scrap averaged $118 a ton during Q3, in October, scrap has rolled back down to slightly below $100 a ton. With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we lost about 50 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of 2015. On the upside, we continued to experience improvements in both fuel and facilities cost relative to last year. On the downside, we lost a bit of margin in personnel cost and freight expense. In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the third quarter of 2016 was $141 million. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the segment was 13.5% in Q3 of 2016, an increase of 110 basis points from the 12.4% reported in the comparable period of last year. Last call, we indicated that we expected the benefit of our productivity initiatives to pick up as we move throughout the year. As just mentioned, we saw some benefit in our cost of goods sold related to the procurement savings in connection with our aftermarket parts inventory. In addition, there are procurement benefits in other expense categories across North America. In total, we estimate the aggregate benefit of the productivity initiatives during the third quarter was approximately $8.6 million, up from the $5 million reported in Q2 or a little bit less than $0.02 a share. Moving on to our European segment, the total revenue in the third quarter accelerated to $770 million from $511 million, a 51% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the third quarter was 6.7%, reflecting the combination of 6.9% growth at ECP and 5.1% growth at Sator. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 55% increase in revenue with the most significant amount reflecting the addition of Rhiag. So, on a constant currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 61%. These constant currency increases were offset by an 11% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling. As you can see on page 19, the average rate during the quarter was about 15% below last year, and the sterling was at $1.30 (sic) [$1.31] (22:54) at [ph] quarter end (22:55). More recently, the sterling has fallen a further 7%, down to $1.22. And the euro is also down about 3% to $1.09 (sic) [$1.08] (23:10). The translation impact of these latest drops will weigh on our reported U.S. dollar results for the rest of the year, probably to the tune of about $0.01 in the fourth quarter. Gross margins in Europe were 36.2%, a 210 basis point decline from the comparable period of last year, largely reflecting the impact of Rhiag. As mentioned in prior calls, Rhiag has a lower gross margin structure than either ECP or Sator. During Q3, Rhiag had a gross margin of about 33.5%, which reduced the consolidated European gross margin by about 150 basis points. Excluding the impact of Rhiag, gross margins decreased 60 basis points, primarily due to ECP, which experienced an increase in customer rebates, and the impact of some of the incremental costs of the new distribution facility in Tamworth rolling through cost of goods sold. With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 150 basis point improvement on a consolidated European basis. We benefited from a 240 basis point reduction in operating expenses due to the addition of Rhiag, which has lower operating expenses as a percent of revenue than ECP or Sator. Offsetting these gains was an 80 basis point increase in facility and warehouse expense, reflecting some of the cost of the Tamworth facility as well as new branches and hubs at ECP. In addition, we lost about 30 basis points of margin in the U.K. related to the impact of translation losses on inventory purchases, which are denominated in a foreign currency. With respect to the Tamworth project, the incremental costs related to this project in the third quarter were approximately \u00a32 million or about $2.6 million. Again, some of this was recorded in cost of goods sold and some in SG&A. In total it reflects a 30 basis point impact on European margins. European EBITDA totaled $73 million, a 38% increase over last year, reflecting a solid performance at ECP and Sator and the positive impact of real. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA margins in the third quarter were 9.4% versus 10.3% last year, a 90 basis point decline, again 30 basis points of which relate to the Tamworth project. Turning to our Specialty segment, revenue for the third quarter totaled $313 million, a 10% increase over the comparable quarter of last year. The organic growth rate was 3.7%, while the impact of the acquisition of Coast in August of 2015 added 6.2% to revenue growth. In the last couple of calls, we indicated that the high level of organic growth in Specialty was not sustainable, and overall, we were happy with the third quarter growth rate. Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the third quarter were flat compared to last year, as the impact of stocking two new specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington State, which were not in operation at this time last year, was offset by an increase in advertising credits. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down about 100 basis points. Facility expense increased, as certain costs related to the two new distribution centers just mentioned. But on the plus side, we continue to see SG&A leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network as well as the benefit of the lower fuel prices. EBITDA for Specialty was $32 million in the quarter, up 24% from the third quarter of last year. And as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased 120 basis points to 10.4% in 2016, compared to 9.2% last year. Remember this is a highly seasonal business, and you should assume these margins will decline as we move through the historically soft Q4 period. On page 22, you can see the impact of the acquisition of PGW. Revenue for the quarter was $259 million, while gross margins in Q3 were 22.6%, which is very consistent with the expectations we highlighted at the time the transaction was announced. EBITDA margins for PGW were 10.7% in the third quarter. Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on slide 23, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations during the first 9 months was approximately $524 million, as we experienced strong cash earnings and only a moderate increase on working capital. During the first 9 months of 2016, we deployed a little bit more than $1.9 billion of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $153 million to fund capital expenditures and about $1.8 billion to acquire businesses. We closed the quarter with approximately $272 million of cash, of which $226 million was held outside of the U.S. And we had roughly $3.3 billion of total debt outstanding. So our net debt was approximately $3 billion. And on a pro forma basis, taking into account the impact of the acquisitions, our net leverage was a little bit less than 2.7 times latest 12 months EBITDA. At quarter-end the total availability under our credit facility was approximately $1.2 billion, which we believe is more than sufficient to support the continued growth of our business. Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016. As it relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we reduced the organic growth guidance for full year 2016 to 4.5% to 5%, reflecting the 5.1% rate for the first 9 months, and an expectation that we don't anticipate any major movements during the fourth quarter. For those trying to back into the Q4 growth, the range implies a 2.6% to 4.6% growth rate. But it is important to note that there is one less business day in Q4 of 2016 than Q4 of 2015, and while that may sound trivial, it's a 1.5% fewer business days compared to last year. Customers don't buy more on other days to make up the difference, so the calendar simply puts us in a 1.5% hole to start. In addition, the hurricane earlier this month closed some of our operations and some of our customers' operations in Florida and the Carolinas for a couple of days. Our range for adjusted EPS which excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization and the tax benefit of adopting ASU 2016-09 is $1.78 to $1.84 per share with a midpoint of $1.81. As in the past, we have narrowed the range to reflect the fact that we are nine months through the year. The new range reflects the fact that Q3 results were right on track, and the outlook for the core business for the rest of the year is largely unchanged, except for the anticipated headwinds from currencies, lower scrap prices, and the dilutive impact of owning Andrew Page as a completely independent company without the ability to integrate operations. To be clear, the new EPS guidance assumes pound sterling and euro exchange rates of $1.22 and $1.09, respectively, and importantly, that scrap remains at the current levels as well. Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains at 34.75%, excluding the benefit of adopting the new accounting pronouncement. Our current guidance for cash flow from operations also narrowed a bit to approximately $575 million to $600 million, and the guidance for capital spending is unchanged at $200 million to $225 million. At this point in time, I'll turn the call back over to Rob to wrap up. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Nick. As a company, we are always focused on financial performance, but we are equally focused on facing change head on and rapidly adapting in order to continuously deliver positive results for our stockholders, employees, and most importantly, our customers. There is no question that weather impacted various lines of business and many markets for our companies thus far in 2016, a similar scenario to what we witnessed in 2012. We firmly believe that like 2012, this impact is temporary and that the macro trends continue to present opportunities for all of our segments. Yet we don't rest on our laurels and simply blame softness in our business on uncontrollable circumstances. Rather, during those periods, we strive to maintain our historical growth rates and our leading positions by focusing on what we can control such as the margin improvements we recognized in this quarter. It is clear as headwinds present themselves, our team of nearly 41,000 employees globally actively adjust to market conditions to effectively and profitably manage their businesses not only for today but to position us well for the future. This focus allowed us again to deliver double-digit EPS growth in the midst of a challenging environment. So, a big thank you to the LKQ team. And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for the questions. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc. Your line is now open. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Ben. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: You talked about some of the performance disparity in the CCC numbers across geography persisting into 3Q. That's a little bit surprising I guess with the thought that maybe the impact from weather would be less substantial in 3Q across the markets. Maybe your thoughts as to why there's that disparity still in 3Q despite what I would think would be a little bit less impacted. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Ben. We certainly look into that with CCC and with some of our customers. And what we find is that the vast majority in collisions are drivable collisions. So, they do tend to take time to get repaired when the customer is ready to get the car into the shop. So, it does tend to drag on through the entire year actually with the drivable collisions. And then you look at just the overall claims volume being up just 2.4% for the whole year. There is just been a light amount of claims being filed this year. It's just been a really soft year that has carried through all through Q3. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. Ben, this is Nick. Think about the map of the United States. I'm going to give you some names of the states where claim volume was down year-over-year: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. The only big states missing there in that swath are New Jersey and Illinois. New Jersey was up 0.5% and Illinois was up 0.2%. So, that whole Northeast and Midwest section of the country just has lower claim volumes. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: One other area too, Ben, that we saw was weak was Western Canada, the decimation of the fracking industry up there. Our claim volume is down, way down there as well, as well as our business. So, it's not just weather. It's some economic conditions as well. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Interesting. That's really helpful color. Thanks. And then shifting gears to the Andrew Page business, it looks like from some of the numbers that we've looked at, actually the sales productivity per store is pretty good, but it sounds like maybe operationally that they're underperforming and not particularly profitable stores. Just curious as to what best practices you can bring there to that business to improve the profitability of the stores and then ultimately, what you think the contribution could be from that chunk of stores. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Sure. Unfortunately, under a whole separate world, we were not allowed to integrate the businesses. But we do believe purchasing will be the biggest benefit. We tend to buy a little bit better than they do. We are, under the whole separate world, allowed to sell to each other, so we are supporting the business today. But until we can fully integrate the business -- when we do integrate the business, it will be logistics. We believe we have a much \u2013 with Tamworth 2 coming online, we're going to be able to much better support those businesses with inventory and deliveries, which we think will make a huge operational benefit for those stores that they have. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, just to be clear, Ben, that business was sold. It basically went into receivership, and we bought it basically through a prepackaged bankruptcy process to give you the U.S. analogy, if you will. So, obviously, the performance of the business was headed down by the time we got the assets. We do think there is an ability, by adequately stocking their warehouses and their stores, to actually drive revenue back north to where it was pre their financial issues . Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: And just one last update on the CMA. We are close to filing our submission to the CMA. They have up to two months to decide what the next steps are. So, when we get released, we'll be ready to start integrating the business hopefully by Q1. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Ben. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is now open. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions as well. I wanted to probe the North American business a little further. Could you explain how much of that business is tied to collision trends versus mechanical trends? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: So, the salvage business or the recycling business, Craig, is roughly a 50/50 split. The aftermarket business is almost wholly collision-focused. So, when you look at it in its entirety, out of our total revenue on a consolidated global basis, slightly less than 30% of our revenue is collision-based. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): That's helpful. And then, Rob, you mentioned a statistic from CCC that claim volume is up only 2.4%. That sounds like a decent number. Could you give some context to that? What was that figure in the full year of 2015, for example? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: We'll get that. We're looking for that right now, Craig. I just want to state that I know in 2012, we had very similar results to what we're seeing this year. In 2013, it did bounce back. And we believe just some of those macro trends that we're seeing, new car sales are definitely a little bit of a headwind at first, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Those are starting to come out of warranty, so we do expect some help there. We did mention on the call the increase in total losses. The good news there is that CCC is anticipating that those start to level off now because of the newer car part getting into the system. And then of course, the regional segmentation that we're seeing. As Nick mentioned, the Northeast and the Midwest, just really getting decimated by claim volume. So, we are hoping for a normal winter, and we do expect it to obviously bounce right back. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And as you look for that number, if I could just slip in a quick question on Europe and the margin there. I know it's under pressure due to the mix of some of the new businesses you've acquired, but where do you think that margin can settle over time at the gross margin level as you extract purchasing synergies? And thank you. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Well, we were at 36.2% in the quarter. Last quarter, we're at 37.4%. Some of that is just seasonal differences, Craig. So, gross margins, you figure \u2013 with the addition of Rhiag, I think I mentioned in my comments, Rhiag was at around 33.5% gross margin, so that's what's pulling it down from historical levels. We would hope to get a 1% or 2% from procurement over time. That's a hard process. The vendors are not anxious to just give us big discounts. But we're working at it very hard. John and his team over in London, they've got a dedicated group that's focused on nothing but trying to execute a pan-European procurement program. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: And, Craig, on the number you're looking for, we'll circle back with you. We need to get in touch with CCC on that. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from James (sic) [Jamie] (41:09) Albertine with Consumer Edge. Your line is now open. Jamie Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Great. Thank you and good morning, gentlemen. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Good morning. Jamie Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Wanted to ask just as a point of reference, I know you are a few months, maybe a quarter or two out from the CMA process kind of fulfilling its duties, but if we were to look at prior integration of something like Unipart would that be a good proxy for us to think about with respect to dilution initially and then sort of the opportunity over time with Andrew Page? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. Andrew Page, we've got actually earlier in the process by the time that Unipart kind of went out the stores or basically vacant. Andrew Page, its stores were ongoing. We have inventory, depleted inventory but inventory in the stores which we're rebuilding and the like. So, we do think, however, that we will be able to get Andrew Page back to profitability. It's probably going to make us for $0.01 to $0.015 in the fourth quarter. And so, we would look in 2017 once we are able to kind of fully work with their team, get their customer service levels where they need to be particularly the fulfillment levels and inventories back at the right levels. We can grow revenue and that will help the profitability as well. We'll take some cost savings just related to procurement, some back-office stuff, maybe a little bit on the logistics, but we do think we can drive it back into profitability, which will, obviously, help the overall margins. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, Jamie, unfortunately, with the hold separate (42:54), we can't really dig into the locations at this point. So, initially, our focus will be on purchasing, logistics, and the back-office functions. Jamie Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then a quick question, if I may, on Pittsburgh Glass. Congratulations on the new customer you signed up on the aftermarket side. I just want to understand sort of what that can do to your margin if we kind of look forward, just sort of maybe asking for reminder on the OE versus aftermarket contribution to gross margin. And then a point of clarification, we understand that PGW is your only business exposure to OEMs directly. Is that true or is there another business channel or subchannel that we're missing with respect to OEs directly? Thanks. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: I'll answer that question and let Nick take the margin question, Jamie. It is the one exposed to OE the most. We have a little bit of exposure on the KAO side, the accessories side, because we do see that as new car sales are up, we do well on the accessory side. But it's sort of a secondary issue there. But the OE business is the only one that has true cyclicality to the OE production. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. Jamie, this is Nick. As you can imagine, the gross margin profiles of the aftermarket business and the OE business are very different. Operating costs are as well, since there's no real distribution and selling expense related to the OE business. But order of magnitude, the ARG gross margins are well north of 30%, where the OE margins are in the mid-teens. Jamie Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Okay. Great. So this sounds like it'll be a mixed benefit, based on the fact that you're adding that aftermarket customer if I heard you correctly. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Exactly. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Correct. Jamie Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Great. Perfect. Thank you so much and best of luck. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Jamie. Operator : And your next question comes from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, Rob. Good morning, Nick. How are you? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Good, Sam. Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Nick, if you had this in your prepared remarks and I missed it, I apologize. Within your North American parts and services organic growth, the 2.1%, can you parse out volumes versus price mix in that? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, we got benefit from both. The pricing was slightly more than the volume impact. That doesn't mean we were necessarily increasing prices across the board, Sam. As I mentioned I think last quarter, a good portion of the price increase comes from just selling a newer part and the mix shift as to what parts we're selling. And so it may come across and looking like we're taking prices up, but it just has to do with that we're selling a slightly more expensive part. But again slightly more than half of the growth was price related. Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Two more quick questions. And I guess one of them is more critical than the other. The first would be, I mean with the increase in total losses \u2013 I recognize that it's a smaller percentage of the overall claims versus repairable claims. But with the increase in total losses, does that have the threat of either overwhelming or offsetting the advantages you have with the SAAR sweet spot over the next few years? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: I don't think so, Sam. I don't think \u2013 we like total losses because that's where we get our inventory from as well. So there's still 82% of the cars that are in accidents are getting repaired. So I see that as a wash actually. Although fewer cars are being repaired, but they tend to be older cars is what CCC is telling us. So they are totaling an older car, which makes sense because the average model year is up to 11.5 model years old. But the SAAR rate is much more important to us, getting new cars into the system, because the new car is going to be fully insured. And that's why I'm pretty bullish on 2017. We're getting these 1- to 3-year cars out of warranty into our sweet spot. So we'd like to see a strong SAAR rate by far. Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Last quick question. Obviously, Germany made some news with respect to the resolution, trying to ban combustion engine production over time. I know it's a long-tailed item and it's far from even being industry standard, but how does that affect your business longer term, Rob, if it does become kind of the world we live in? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: If there's a shift to electric vehicles, that's a little bit more of a problem. If it's going to be more diesel, that's actually a positive. Diesel engines sell for far more than what we get for a gas engine actually, so depending on where it goes. I was actually in China last week, and they're having similar initiatives over there as well. But nobody seemed concerned about it, the people we talked to. So it's a long tail as you said. Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you both, gentlemen. I appreciate it. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Sam. Operator : Your next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Your line is now open. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Morning, Nate. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Hey, Nate. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: So wanted to talk just \u2013 I hate to harp on the North American issues a little bit. But, one, just wondering if you had any thoughts in terms of the fact that the miles driven were up, but the claims were less in terms of being up. I get the disparity across regions and what not, but usually, those have a little bit of a tighter correlation in terms of why those claims wouldn't follow directly with the miles driven. And then second part of that in terms of going in next year, obviously, Rob, you've been very bullish in terms of, hey, assuming a normal winter, we have easy comps or easier comps. In theory we should be back to that 5% to 7% North American parts and service organic growth range. Is there anything underlying the surface? Assuming again a normal winter and things kind of go back like they did in 2013, anything underlying the surface that you would think would be such a substantial headwind where we wouldn't get there? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Nate, when I look at some of the normal weather conditions, as I said, we're getting cars starting to come into that sweet spot. There's a lot of macro good tailwinds for us in terms of miles driven. The late model car park for our KAO business, normal winter will certainly spur our glass business as well. I don't see any major headwinds that could impact that other than another mild winter. And on top of easy comps, as you said. It just feels like there's enough positive tailwinds behind us that are going to make 2017 look like 2013. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And I haven't heard of anything, but no underlying shifts or anything that we might not be seeing that your customers are saying in terms of something going on that we wouldn't be thinking of? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: The only thing that we've heard from our customers interestingly enough is that they're having a hard time hiring technicians. And just getting the work out the door has been a little bit of a challenge for that side of the business, but that they will fix. They will find people to fix the cars. I'm absolutely convinced of that. So, no, nothing underlying that we're hearing from our customer base whatsoever. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then, two, you talked about obviously controlling what you can on the margin side, and kudos for delivering that. And it still feels that we're kind of in the relative early innings in terms of seeing the results as you pointed out mix sequentially, so that continues to go well. Anything else on the top line though that you can do to help your cause in terms of whether it's trying to buy more cars or we talked before about getting into the transmission remanufacturing business or anything on the incremental side of trying to just push incrementally on the sales effort? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Absolutely. We did mention that we've been trying to buy a better car in anticipation of these newer cars coming into the sweet spot. So, we will be pushing more cars through the system, absolutely. That is our goal. We're in the process of acquiring more property wherever we can to process more vehicles, so that is absolutely a focus as well as introducing new product types. We talked about the number of certified parts continue to go up. We're carrying a much stronger level of those parts as well. So, I think our inventory is going to be well positioned to meet the organic growth needs that we have. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just last question, Rob, just because you brought it up in terms of hiring technicians. Is there anything going on in the surface, underlying again in the surface where the cars are becoming so complex and the diagnostics so complex that any worry even past the warranty period that more cars, whether it's a collision or a mechanical repair would be going back to the dealer for some reason? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: We don't think so. I've talked to honestly the MSOs quite regularly on their thoughts on that, and they don't believe that technology is not insurmountable for a technician not trained in a dealership environment. So, they are confident, as you can see, by their acquisitions. They continue to acquire companies. They think they're well positioned to be able to handle those repairs. More importantly, I think, is our manufacturers' ability to replicate those parts over in Taiwan, and they're seeing no issues whatsoever acquiring the correct aluminum or the high-strength steel. So, no issues on either side. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: And, Nate, one other thing is even if there were more cars headed into dealer collision repair shops, that doesn't mean that there is more OE parts because the insurance companies are still mandating which parts are going to be used. Just the week before last, I was \u2013 spent the day with customers out in the field, including dealers, and they basically have said that they don't have the ability to select the parts being used. The insurance companies are driving it all. So, it doesn't make a difference where the repair is being held and done. The choice of parts selection is still being driven by the insurance companies. Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Outstanding point. Thank you very much for the time. Appreciate it. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Nate. Operator : And your next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Hey, Bret. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Question. I guess you've given the CCC number on repairable claims growth year-to-date of 2.4%. What's the total claim so we can factor in the losses? Because obviously, some of the salvage auction guys are seeing more volume flowing through theirs. Insurance companies opt not to repair, but what's the total crash rate? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: It's about 6%, which includes comp, which are flood losses, tornadoes. So, yeah, the auctions are getting that benefit. Those are cars that don't get repaired because of the floods and hail damage, severe hail damage that totals a car. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then I guess on Andrew Page, 102 stores, assuming it's finally approved. How many of those you think you need to close? Is there a lot of duplicate real estate there with ECP? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: No. There is, however, they've got a unique customer base. So, we're going to look at that on an individual basis, but as it stands right now, we plan at keeping the vast majority open because they have service to different customer to a certain extent, and the brand is so strong. We'll look at that post CMA clearance. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then one last question on Specialty. I think you said you were pretty happy with the 3.7% growth. Where do you see that being? And I guess, when you acquired the original Keystone, it was sort of seen as growing in line with the core North American business at the time. I guess, now that we've owned it for a couple of years, is it something that you think is a lower single-digit grower or is it the change in the mix as you've bought Stag and Coast that has brought the growth down into the low to mid single as opposed to mid to upper single? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: True to the three quarters, we're actually above the North American growth, and I think that's going to continue, Bret. I think that the volume continues to be strong. The RV sales are up year-over-year. So, as long as that continues, we do expect decent organic growth in that line of business. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, for the first nine months, the organic growth in Specialty was 7.3%. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Right. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And I guess, from the competitive landscape in Specialty, do you see anything changing? Obviously, Amazon is talking about auto parts these days, our favorite topic recently. And Specialty and performance is a category they are focusing on. Do you see any change? Are they making inroads or is it pretty much status quo from your customer base? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, status quo. Amazon, these are big bulky parts, as you know. They have not shown any desire at this point to stock a lot of that product. So, at this point, our customer base is still very strong, coming direct to us. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : All right. Thank you. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Bret. Operator : And your next question comes from Bill Armstrong with C.L. King. Your line is now open. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, gentlemen. On the North American 2.1% growth, are you seeing any disparity or divergence between mechanical versus collision repair? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: As Nick mentioned in his prepared remarks, our core parts business did well. Where we saw a little bit of softness, Bill, was in the wheel business and the collision cooling business and obviously, a little bit of paint that's tied to the collision itself. Soothe mechanical side of the business did okay and the salvage side of the business. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then your Q4 guidance or the implied Q4 guidance, you mentioned your foreign exchange assumptions of $1.22. What would be the cents per share impact of that lower foreign exchange? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, Bill. Thanks for asking the question. The FX is likely going to hit us for $0.01, maybe slightly more than $0.01. We think that scrap is going to hit us for at least $0.005, maybe a little bit more. As I mentioned, Andrew Page will likely hit us for close to a $0.015, and that's really the sum and substance of the slight tweaks to the guidance. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Bill. Operator : And your last question comes from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Your line is now open. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a question again on North America. Have you seen any change for OEM price matching or any other change in the competitive landscape? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: No, not at all, Jason. The OEs are still doing the same things they've done and haven't increased their price matching programs whatsoever. It's interesting on the \u2013 you can talk about competition. We are obviously active acquirers in the business, and we obviously get to see financials, and we're seeing the industry struggle. They don't seem to be taking market share from anybody, our competition, so from the financials we've seen. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : You mentioned weather. I mean, is this more of a function of the economy, just customers not repairing their cars, as you say, drivable collisions? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: That's definitely a part of it. There is certainly some economic uncertainty out there with the elections going on. That's for sure. Yes, when the car is drivable, the consumer can elect to pocket that check that they get from their insurance company. It is interesting when we've done our channel checks on that, Jason. The insurance companies never know if the car actually got repaired. It's pretty interesting. When they write a check to a third party, that customer can repair the car or obviously take the money. They would not know unless there was a supplement. In other words, they wrote an estimate for $1,000, ship said they need $1,200, then they would know obviously because they have to write an additional check, but the vast majority of the time, the insurance company doesn't even know if the car got repaired. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Okay. And then finally, just looking at the collision revenue number in the U.K., up 13%, which is still strong but maybe off a little from historical growth rates. Just wondered if you could talk about that business and your efforts to increase benefits there? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, still very pleased with our collision growth there, double digits. They too had a mild winter, and it's also been similar to the United States, an influx of new car. Registrations are up dramatically in the UK, so they're getting a little bit of headwind from the new car, again, that it tends to get new parts. They are also coming out of that in the next year, so we do expect the tailwind to start to emerge with the car part getting a little more in the sweet spot. So, same number of insurance companies in our program, very consistently happy with the results we've been delivering, and no one has been turning their backs on us in terms of stopping the program. So, we are starting our initial \u2013 just an update on the continent. We've talked about bringing the collision parts to the continent. We are just starting our initial talks with some of the Netherlands insurance companies to start bringing collision parts into that market as well. So, we anticipate 2017 being a launching of that program as well. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: And before we wrap up the call, I just want to make one thing clear because there was some analyst who put out notes this morning before the call with the implication that the change on the accounting standard, the benefit of lower tax rates got rolled into our adjusted EPS. That's incorrect. Adjusted EPS of $0.45 excludes the benefit, excludes the benefit of the adoption of the new accounting standard. So, if we had let it just roll through, we would have reported $0.47. Likewise, our guidance for the year excludes the benefit of the new accounting standard. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I turn the conference back to Rob Wagman for closing remarks. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We look forward to updating you on our Q4 results and the 2017 guidance on our next call in February. Have a good day, everybody. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Rob Wagman. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thank you, Joe. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today. This morning, I will begin our review with a few high-level full-year 2016 financial results, followed by an update on our operating segments. Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our financial performance in Q4 and our guidance for 2017. For full-year 2016, revenue reached $8.58 billion, an increase of 19.3%, as compared to $7.19 billion for full year of 2015. This number excludes revenue from PGW's OEM glass manufacturing business whose planned divesture was announced in Q4. Nick will provide the overall financial impacts of this transaction shortly. Net income for full-year 2016 was $464 million, an increase of 9.6%, as compared to $423.2 million for 2015. Diluted earnings per share for full-year 2016 was $1.50, an increase of 8.7%, as compared to $1.38 for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share were $1.80, an increase of 20.8%, as compared to $1.49 for 2015. For the full year of 2016, parts and services organic revenue growth was 4.8% and acquisition revenue growth was 19%, while the impact of exchange rates was negative 2.5%, for total parts and service revenue growth of 21.3%. Adjusting for differences in selling days during the fourth quarter of 2016, the company achieved global organic growth of 5.2% on a per day basis. Turning to our North American operations, adjusted for having one less selling day, our North American segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 3% during the fourth quarter, performance consistent with what we've witnessed throughout all of 2016. For full-year 2016, North America had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 2.9%, which is 40 basis points above the full year 2.5% collision and liability-related auto claims reported by CCC. It's important to note that when looking at our North America growth, there continued to be variations across the platform. There were geographic differences with the Central and West regions continuing to perform much better than our Northeast and Midwest regions where we witnessed mild weather conditions. In wholesale aftermarket, certain part types like our core Keystone fenders, hoods, bumpers, and lights grew faster than the overall North America growth rate, while paint and related products, cooling products and aluminum wheels experienced year-over-year declines. So, there were definite spots of strength and spots of weakness. As we enter 2017, we are implementing additional programs targeted at specific product lines and making some adjustments to the sales organization, all in an effort to drive improvement in the growth metrics. During Q4, we acquired 77,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is a 4.1% increase over Q4 2015. For full-year 2016, procurement of dismantling vehicles was 291,000, a slight increase over 2015. For our North American aftermarket parts business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 9.8% and 17.8% respectively in 2016. This trend validates our suppliers' commitment of investing in the development of new tools to manufacture aftermarket parts to support the growth in SAAR and related new model designs. In our self service retail business, during Q4, we acquired 129,000 lower-cost self service and crush only cars, which is a 14.5% increase over Q4 2015. For full-year 2016, vehicle procurement was 524,000, an increase of 11.3% from 2015. Turning to the 2016 results of our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC. The revenue and number of purchase orders processed through the CCC platform during 2016 grew 66% and 63% respectively year-over-year. On an annualized basis, the revenue from this initiative is now tracking over $47 million. Lastly, I am pleased with the progress of our Roadnet productivity initiative. Since inception, we have been able to increase miles per route from 101 to 129, allowing us to cover eight stops per miles driven versus a previous average of six without any significant increase in head count. At the end of 2016, Roadnet was operating at 319 locations across North America with 3,900 vehicles traveling 9.6 million miles per month across a network of 74,000 routes and making 1.1 million stops per month. During his presentation, Nick will discuss the financial benefit of our overall productivity initiative realized in 2016 and their projected impact in 2017. Now, moving to our European operations. In 2016, our Europe segment had solid organic revenue growth for parts and services of 7.2% with limited contribution from new branch openings, and acquisition growth of 47.1% primarily related to Rhiag. This growth was offset by a decrease of 7.9% related to foreign exchange rates. For full-year 2016, ECP continued its impressive track record of delivering strong organic revenue growth for parts and services of 8.1%. For branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 6.6%. This performance is particularly impressive in the midst of all the market uncertainty surrounding Brexit. In addition, collision parts sales at ECP continued their double-digit growth, posting 15.4% in 2016. Operationally, the collision team had a busy 2016, which included entering the Republic of Ireland with our paint business and the integration of six UK paint locations into existing ECP branches. This integration will produce synergies with a shared fleet and will provide a collaborative sales approach between our collision parts specialists and our paint sales advisors to target and service the body shop requirements with a one-stop shop solution. Today, we offer over 18,000 unique collision SKUs to both the UK and the Republic of Ireland. With respect to the T2 project, I am pleased with our continued progress. We expect to begin testing the T2 automation in Q2. Once the automation process is solidified, we plan on starting deliveries in early Q3 and to be fully live in Q1 of 2018 for ECP's base business. This project continues to be both on budget and on schedule. Regarding Andrew Page, the UK Competition and Markets Authority continues to review the acquisition and assess whether transaction would be \u2013 would unreasonably lessen competition in the UK market. With that, we do expect this transaction to have a dilutive impact on 2017 earnings. With the number of licensed vehicles in the UK and overall traffic levels reaching an all-time high in 2016, and the inevitable ageing of the UK car park, ECP is very well positioned to continue their growth with their extensive network, robust product offerings, and the opening of T2 in 2018. Turning to our Sator business. In 2016, Sator achieved organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.5%, the highest annual rate since we acquired this business in 2013. Also, since acquiring the business, Sator achieved their highest annual margins in 2016. This ongoing performance is a clear validation of our strategy to convert their network to a two-step distribution model, the expansion of their existing product lines, and the leveraging of procurement synergies with ECP and now with Rhiag. And with respect to Rhiag, it continues to track in line with our expectations. We opened an additional eight branches during the quarter, primarily in Central and Eastern Europe, bringing the total, since acquisition, to 28. Importantly, and as I mentioned on the last call, we continue to aggressively gather the necessary data and communication plan amongst our European businesses with the objective of implementing a targeted and sustainable Pan-European procurement function. Now, on to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment posted year-over-year total revenue growth of 13.5% in 2016, including the benefits of The Coast acquisition and an impressive organic revenue growth of 6.9%. During 2016, the Specialty team continued to focus on streamlining fulfillment processes, route optimization, ensuring best-in-class inventory availability, and expanding product and service offerings including dealer-friendly online solutions. This focus enabled our Specialty segment to generate their best EBITDA margin since the company entered this segment in 2013. Now, turning to the glass business. As previously mentioned, on December 19, 2016, we announced the sale of our OEM glass manufacturing business to a subsidiary of Vitro. The results of our OEM glass manufacturing business are reported in discontinued operations for 2016. Importantly, this divestiture will allow our team to focus on the existing aftermarket glass distribution business and the synergies that exist with our North American aftermarket locations and customer base. Going forward, the aftermarket replacement glass or ARG will be combined with our North American segment from an operating perspective. To understand the synergy opportunities and facility overlap, please turn to slide 8 in our earnings deck, which highlights the ARG locations in relations to our \u2013 the existing aftermarket locations. For 2017, we are projecting integration of nine ARG locations into LKQ existing wholesale warehouses and adding three new satellite locations into our existing network. And now, turning to corporate development. On December 1, 2016, the company acquired a 26.5% equity interest in Mekonomen Group from Axel Johnson. Headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, Mekonomen Group is the leading independent car parts and service chain in the Nordic region of Europe. Mekonomen will remain independent of LKQ's existing European operations. However, we look forward to exploring, together with Mekonomen's management, areas where the companies can work together in a mutually beneficial manner. Following the announcement of this investment on January 10, 2017, Joe Holsten and John Quinn were appointed to the Mekonomen Board of Directors. In addition to the previously mentioned acquisition of Andrew Page and our investment in Mekonomen, during the fourth quarter of 2016, LKQ acquired a distributor of aftermarket automotive products in the Netherlands, a salvage yard in Sweden, a distributor of automotive paint products in Pennsylvania, and three heavy-duty truck aftermarket radiator distributors in the U.S. Also in the fourth quarter, LKQ's European operations opened two new Euro Car Part branches in United Kingdom and eight new branches in Eastern Europe. At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our 2017 guidance. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Rob. And good morning to everybody on the call. I'm delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our guidance for 2017. In December, we announced we had entered into an agreement to sell the OEM operations of the PGW business. And with that, the accounting rules require us to do several things that make the fourth quarter results a bit confusing. So, I will spend a little less time on the segment results, which I set forth in the presentation, and I will spend a bit more time trying to get everybody on the same page in understanding the correct apples-to-apples comparisons. The sale of the OEM business, which is slated to close on February 28, requires us to treat the OEM activities of PGW as a discontinued operation, and thereby, eliminating the related OEM revenue and expenses from the consolidated totals both for the quarter and for the year as a whole. So, the revenue and expense line item amounts shown in our income statement include the aftermarket replacement glass side of PGW, which we refer to as ARG, but exclude the OEM side. The impact of the OEM business is netted down to a single line item on the income statement labeled Income from Discontinued Operations. In arriving at the OEM income, under U.S. GAAP, 100% of the costs related to any person or expense item that had some involvement with the aftermarket business during the year, regardless how limited, had to be recorded as continuing operations even though the people and/or expenses are actually going to Vitro as part of the sale. So, even though most of the PGW officers like the President, CFO, Heads of HR and IT, et cetera, and most of the Finance IT and HR teams will be employees of Vitro after the sale, 100% of their costs since the acquisition date are recorded as part of ARG and included in continuing operations. So, it will appear that the OEM business is more profitable and the ARG business less profitable than how their respective businesses will actually perform post-closing, everything else being equal. Next, even though the sale has not closed in Q4, we needed to record a non-cash charge reflecting the difference between the anticipated sale proceeds and the book value of the assets of the OEM business. In our 8-K filing last December, we highlighted a probable loss of $25 million to $35 million, and we came in near the lower end of that range at $27 million on a pre-tax basis. The after-tax impact of the loss is netted against the OEM operating income and is included in the line titled Income from Discontinued Operations. Finally, you will note that we have eliminated the glass segment from our line of business reporting. Due to differences between the glass manufacturing business and our prior lines of business, we have been reporting the entire glass business as a separate segment. With the sale of the OEM business, the aftermarket glass operations will be melded into our North American aftermarket management structure. Importantly, as Rob noted, we are in the process of physically integrating a handful of existing PGW aftermarket branches into LKQ aftermarket warehouses, and anticipate more of that to come over the next few years. So, while ARG represents a new product, it's basically the same business, the distribution of aftermarket auto parts sold and delivered to repair shops. And the business now reports up to Justin Jude, our Senior Vice President of North American Wholesale Operations. With all that, the glass business no longer qualifies as a separate reportable segment and is now part of North American operations. Since the margin structure of the ARG business is slightly different than our historical North American businesses, some of the year-over-year margin changes in the North American segment simply reflect a mix shift in the addition of glass, and I will try to point out the impact of those changes as we go through this discussion. Revenue for the ARG business will continue to be accounted as acquired revenue until the anniversary of the acquisition at the end of April, at which point in time, it will be folded into the North American organic growth metric. So, now onto our results. The fourth quarter of 2016, when taken as a whole, was an excellent quarter. Organic growth for parts and services in the fourth quarter was right in the middle of the range we discussed during our last call, and adjusted earnings per share fell right on top of the consensus estimates of the analysts who cover our company. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 23% over last year. That reflects a 23.5% increase in revenue from parts and services, the components of which include approximately 3.8% from organic growth plus 23.5% from acquisitions, for constant currency growth of 27.3%, before backing out the translation impact of FX which was a 3.8% decline. Remember, we had one less selling day in 2016 compared to last year. So, on a same day basis, the organic growth was 5.2%. The OEM sale does not impact any of the metrics for organic growth in parts and services, as all of the PGW revenue fell in the acquired revenue bucket in 2016. As noted on slide 13 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins declined 130 basis points to 38.6% due primarily to the impact of the big acquisitions. You will recall that both Rhiag and PGW have lower gross margins than our historical businesses. While consolidated gross margins were down, consolidated operating expenses as a percent of revenue were also down by about 80 basis points lower than last year. Some of that reflects the impact of the different margin structure of the two acquisitions and some of it reflects improved efficiencies in the historical businesses. Segment EBITDA totaled $222 million for the quarter, reflecting a 15% increase from 2015. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 10.3%, a 70-basis-point decline from the 11% recorded last year. Depreciation and amortization was up about $22 million, mostly related to the acquisitions; and the same holds true for interest expense which was up by about $11 million. With that, pre-tax income in the quarter was up 3.1%. Our effective tax rate during the fourth quarter was 32.9%, up from the 30.4% in Q4 of 2015. This reflects a base rate of 34.75% and the benefit of a few discrete items. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter, including the impact of the loss on sale, was $0.28, which was down 9.7% compared to last year. Importantly, adjusted EPS, excluding restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, the adoption of the new accounting rule related to the tax treatment of stock-based compensation, and a variety of other non-recurring gains and losses, was $0.39 in 2016 compared to $0.34 last year, reflecting a 15% improvement. The $0.39 was comprised of $0.35 a share from continuing operations and $0.04 from discontinued operations. Again, continuing operations include certain overhead costs that will be transferred with the sale of the OEM glass business. As anticipated, during the Q3 call, currency fluctuations negatively impacted earnings per share in the fourth quarter for continuing operations by about $0.02, and the acquisition of Andrew Page had a $0.02-drag on earnings during Q4 which was a touch higher than initially anticipated. For the year, diluted earnings per share was $1.50 a share. And adjusted EPS was right on top of the consensus estimates of $1.80 a share, comprised of $1.69 from continuing operations and $0.11 from discontinued operations. The impact of the costs allocated to continuing operations that will be gone with the sale of the OEM business was about $0.03 a share. And with that, let's briefly touch on the segments. In North America, total revenue during the fourth quarter of 2016 increased to $1,114 million or a 9.4% increase over the last year. This is the combination of a 9% growth rate in parts and services and a 14% increase in other revenue. The total parts and services growth included organic growth of 1.5% and acquisition growth of 7.4% primarily related to the aftermarket glass business. The organic metric was reflective of the one less selling day. And on a constant day basis, the organic growth in North America parts and services was 3% during Q4. Gross margins in North America at the end of fourth quarter of 2016 were 43.4%, a 20-basis-point improvement over last year. We continue to benefit from the procurement initiatives in our aftermarket collision parts business and improvements at our salvage and self service operations, which collectively contributed to an 80-basis-point increase in North American gross margins. On the other side, the inclusion of the aftermarket glass operations, which have lower gross margins than the rest of North America, had a 60-basis-point negative impact on the segment's gross margins. In total, segment EBITDA for North America during the fourth quarter of 2016 was $140 million. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the North American segment was 12.5% in Q4 of 2016, down 30 basis points from the 12.8% reported in the comparable period of the prior year. Importantly, the margins for our historical North American businesses, excluding glass, increased 110 basis points and reflected the highest fourth quarter EBITDA margins in the last five years. So, while the growth was a bit lower than we would prefer, we are making great strides in terms of controlling costs and increasing margins. In total, we estimate that the aggregate benefit of the productivity initiatives during the fourth quarter was approximately $9.3 million, up from the $8.6 million in the third quarter of this year. The inclusion of the aftermarket glass operations had a 140-basis-point negative impact on North American EBITDA margins, in part, due to the inclusion of the allocated overhead costs that will disappear post-closing. So, we're up 110 basis points in our historical businesses, down a negative 140 basis points from glass for a net impact of down 30 bps. Moving onto our European segment, total revenue in the fourth quarter accelerated to $779 million, a 60% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the fourth quarter was 7.2% on a reported basis, reflecting the combination of 8.4% at ECP and 2.6% growth at Sator. On a same day basis, European organic growth was 8.3%. The impact of acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 66% increase in revenue with the most significant amount reflecting the addition of Rhiag. So, on a constant currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 73% in the fourth quarter. This constant currency revenue increases were offset, in part, by a 13% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling. As you can see on slide 21, the average rate during the quarter was about 18% below last year, and the sterling was at about $1.25 at year-end. More recently, the sterling has continued to trade in the $1.21 to $1.27 range, while the euro has fallen to about $1.05 from $1.10. The translation impacts of these FX rates will weigh on our 2017 results, which I will quantify in just a bit. Gross margins in Europe were 36.1%, compared to the 38.9% recorded in the comparable period of 2015, largely reflecting the impact of Rhiag in the 2016 results. Rhiag has a lower gross margin structure than either ECP or Sator. And during Q4 of 2016, the inclusion of Rhiag reduced the consolidated European gross margins by about 190 basis points compared to last year. European EBITDA totaled $64 million, a 34% increase over last year. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA margins in the fourth quarter of 2016 were 8.2% versus the 9.7% last year, a 150-basis-point decline, of which about 30 basis points relate to the incremental costs associated with the Tamworth project, some of which was recorded in cost of goods sold and some of which was in SG&A, and then a 110-basis-point decline related to losses at Andrew Page. Again, the incremental costs related to the Tamworth project in Q4 were approximately \u00a31.6 million or about $2 million, and again, it reflects a negative 30 basis points' impact on the European margins. Turning to our Specialty segment, revenue in the fourth quarter totaled $259 million, a 5.7% increase over the comparable quarter of 2015, all of which reflected organic growth, which was up from the 3.7% reported in Q3. On a same day basis, organic growth in Specialty was 7.4%. Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the fourth quarter were down about 220 basis points compared to last year, primarily related to the timing of advertising credits and costs related to stocking of the two new distribution centers brought online in 2016. EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $19 million which was up 28% from Q4 of 2015. And as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased 130 basis points to 7.4% in 2016, due largely to improved efficiencies in SG&A, which more than offset the lower gross margins. This is a highly seasonal business with the Q4 always being the softest. For the year, EBITDA margins for the Specialty business was the highest in the three years we've owned these operations, reflecting the integration benefits of the tuck-in acquisitions. Now, let' move to capital allocation. As presented on slide 24, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from continuing operations during 2016 was approximately $571 million. During 2016, we deployed a little more than $2.2 billion of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $183 million to fund capital expenditures and approximately $1.8 billion to acquire businesses and make strategic investments like our minority ownership position in Mekonomen. We closed the quarter with approximately $227 million of cash, of which $175 million was held outside of the United States, and we had roughly $3.3 billion worth of total debt outstanding. So, our net debt was approximately $3.1 billion; and on a pro forma basis, taking into account the impact of the acquisitions, our net leverage was approximately 2.7 times the latest 12-month EBITDA. We intend to use the $310 million of proceeds from the OEM sale to repay balances on our revolving line of credit, so our net debt should continue to decline. At quarter-end, the total availability under our credit facility was approximately $1 billion. And with the sale of the OEM business, we will have just over $1.3 billion of availability which we believe is sufficient to support the continued growth of our business. Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2017. To be clear, these metrics exclude the OEM glass business and reflect the activity from continuing operations only. As it relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we have set guidance at 4% to 6%, which we believe is very good relative to other automotive parts distributors. Importantly, 2016 was a leap year, which means we have one less selling day in 2017, and that will hit the reported full year for about 0.5% of growth. For those building quarterly models, the one fewer day actually falls in Q3 and will result in approximately a negative 1.5% impact on the reported growth rate during that quarter. Given the year that we've been through, we are tempering expectations for North American growth to the 2% to 4% range. Importantly, Q1 growth will be lower than the year as a whole, as some of the trends from 2016 have continued into the beginning of 2017. Our range for adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations is from $1.80 to $1.90 a share with a midpoint of $1.85, reflecting a 10% growth rate over the earnings per share of $1.69 from continuing operations recorded in 2016. There are a number of discrete items influencing the 2017 EPS guidance, so in an effort to bridge the year-over-year growth, we've included a new slide, number 28, which is a bridge from our actual 2016 results to the midpoint of our 2017 guidance range. For purposes of a simplified presentation, we show each bridge item as a point estimate, but in reality, there's a range of potential impact for each item. The biggest uptick, about $0.17 a share, relates to the continued growth of our businesses. We will also benefit by about $0.03 a share from owning Rhiag and the aftermarket glass business for the full year. As mentioned earlier, the carve-out accounting rules don't reflect how the PGW aftermarket business will be run post-sale, so relative to 2016, we will pick up about $0.03 a share by eliminating certain expenses included in the 2016 results from continuing operations that will move to the new owner. We will, however, give about $0.01 of that write-back in 2017, as we need to record the allocated overhead to continuing operations for the first two months of this year. The next phase of the Tamworth build-out will cost an incremental $0.02 a share in 2017 compared to last year. Assuming current exchange rates hold for the year, the weakness of the European currencies relative to 2016 will clip us for yet another $0.03, and the losses at Andrew Page will amount to an incremental $0.01 or more decline on a year-over-year basis. Importantly, the positive items on the bridge are permanent in nature, while the items having a negative impact are more transitory in nature. It's also worth pointing out that when thinking about the year-over-year comparisons, the negative impact related to FX will be felt more in the first half of the year. And again, we have to include the allocated PGW expenses in the first two months of 2017, and that $0.01 headwind will hit us in Q1. The net income associated with the EPS range is $560 million to $590 million, and assumes an effective tax rate of 34.75%. Our current guidance for cash flow from operations is approximately $610 million to $640 million, and the guidance for capital spending is $200 million to $225 million. To be clear, the 2017 guidance assumes pound sterling and euro exchange rates of $1.25 and $1.05 respectively. And importantly, that scrap remains at the current levels of about $150 a ton. For consistency, we would ask that all the analysts adjust their models to be on a continuing operations basis. And to help get things on an apples-to-apples comparison, appendix number 5 on slide 39 provides quarterly data for 2016 reflecting the performance of our continuing operations only. At this point, I will turn the call back over to Rob to wrap up. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Nick. In closing, I am proud of the hard work and dedication of our 40,000-plus employees delivered for the company, our stockholders, and most importantly, our customers in 2016. I am equally proud of our teams' commitment to deliver continued growth in 2017. This focus allows us to project solid EPS gains for 2017 with the midpoint of our guidance representing a 10% increase over the comparable 2016 EPS results. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Ali Faghri from SIG. Your line is now open. Ali Faghri - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Ali. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning. Ali Faghri - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Can you talk about the cadence of North American organic growth trends through the quarter? And then, maybe as a quick follow-up, you mentioned continued geographic differences in performance between certain regions in the U.S., did you see that performance gap between those regions close at all in the fourth quarter relative to last quarter? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, I'll let Nick talk about the cadence over the four quarters but let me just touch, Ali, on what we saw on organic growth, and I also want to talk about the sales initiatives that we have in place for this year. From the data we have from CCC, the weather was clearly an impact. For 2016, CCC reported claims volumes up 2.5% versus 4.6% in 2015. So, there was a definite decline. We did some studies on our top 20 states that we do business in, which is the lion's share of the population. They were up 1.3% compared to our 2.9% increase, so we're definitely seeing some momentum in the right places. There are regional differences that continue to this day, the West and the Central are definitely doing better than Northeast and Midwest. The core business though of our hoods, fenders, lamps, covers were all higher than our overall North American, again across. So, I am convinced when collision returns to normalized levels, we will reap the benefits. We're well positioned for inventory as soon as all those collisions start coming back. I do want to touch quickly on total losses, those were up 18.8%. From a few years ago, they're about 16%. We do expect that to plateau though as these newer cars come into the process. So, total losses cut both ways for us. Obviously, the cars don't get repaired, but that's how we require our inventory. So, a healthy total loss rate isn't a bad thing for us either. And the last thing I'd say, just on the acquisition \u2013 on the organic growth rate, just from acquisition financials, our pipeline still remains robust. We're seeing this as an industry issue. We're seeing some pretty soft financials come into the M&A. So, we do anticipate this to turn around, and I'll take this time just to talk about those sales initiatives I mentioned in my prepared remarks. One of the big things we're going to be doing is moving from a transactional pay to a customer result for our sales reps. So, instead of getting a commission on every single sale they make, they'll be tied to a customer and the growth of that customer. So, this brings us more to a proactive rather than a reactive approach with our customer base. We've always had a customer focus, however, this raises the bar for our sales reps to drive that revenue on a customer basis. Our goal obviously is to get more of the wallet of their share \u2013 wallet share of that customer's purchases. But we do expect, if we're successful at this, we'll also improve our operational costs because we're delivering more to the same customer. As part of that, as I just mentioned, we're looking to get better inventory fill rates, and balancing our inventory as necessary. I mentioned in my prepared remarks as well the success we've had with Roadnet, that's going to allow us to increase our delivery service, so provide better service. And the final thing we plan on doing is targeted pricing for those product lines that are a little soft for us. We're going to go after those customers. Nick, do you want to talk about the cadence? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Sure, Ali. It's \u2013 it was a little bit unusual, we started off the quarter \u2013 and I think your question was how do things roll from October to December. You recall that at the very beginning of the quarter, the Southeast got hit with the hurricane, and that clearly had an impact on our growth in October, particularly in the Southeast region, which is actually down on a year-over-year basis for the quarter as a whole. Things picked up a bit in \u2013 obviously, in November and December. We can't quantify exactly the impact of the hurricane. We do know it had negative impact on the results for the quarter and particularly in October. But I wouldn't say that there was a big acceleration from October to December when you try and adjust everything out, if that's helpful. Ali Faghri - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : It is. Great. Thanks for all that color. So, just to be clear, you're guiding North America to 2% to 4% growth in 2017, it sounds like you're saying probably closer to the low end of that range in the first half of the year and maybe improving throughout the year, is that the right way to look at it? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: That's right way to look at it, yes. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Absolutely. Ali Faghri - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great. Thank you. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Ali. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Hey, thanks for taking my questions as well. Just wanted to ask that North American question in a slightly different way, but we saw reports from Copart and Insurance Auto Auction yesterday showing a surge in activity at salvage auctions, and that's driven by distracted driving and other factors. So, help us reconcile that trend with the soft trends you're seeing. I realize there are regional differences and maybe a change in the totalled frequency, but maybe just for investors trying to reconcile that, what would your explanation be? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, Craig, I think the answer is that it \u2013 we're totalling an older car. We get stats from CCC that show older cars are definitely totalling. We still have an average model year of 11.5 years old, it doesn't take much to total that car. The volume at auctions is definitely up. We'd track that on a weekly basis. And they are surging for sure, but it is an older car, it appears. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: And the higher the total loss rate goes, that means those cars are not getting repaired and we can't sell parts to help repair those vehicles. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thank you. And then, just as a follow-up, get you on record if I could, on the border adjustment tax proposal, I realize there are lots of different proposals out there and who knows what's going to pass, but how have you positioned yourselves for tax policy changes and what issue should we anticipate? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, Craig, the reality is the border tax proposals and the like are incredibly vague and incredibly complex. So, we really can't put a number on it. Here is what I can tell you, that between our aftermarket and our specialty businesses, we purchase about $1.3 billion worth of product that is manufactured outside of the United States. But there is about $500 million of that, that we actually procure from the U.S. subsidiaries of those foreign suppliers. So, only $800 million is actually purchased from non-U.S. companies. So, with respect to the $500 million, it's absolutely unclear as to who would get hit with the theoretical border tax, if you will. The reality is, in the parts that we procure, there are not a lot of U.S. domestic suppliers that we can turn to, to acquire the volumes that we need to service our customers. The other part of the border tax is a lower corporate tax rate of 20%. Included in that is immediate deductibility of capital expenditures. Of the $225 million of CapEx, about $140 million of that is really U.S. based. So, that would help move things in the other direction. But again, there is \u2013 it's so unclear, it's almost impossible to quantify the real impact on the business. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: And let me just add, Craig, one of our largest manufacturer actually overseas does have manufacturing capacity here in the U.S. And we had a team over there last week talking to them that in the event there are some taxes imposed that they would ramp up production here in the U.S. So, we are actively looking at alternatives should that happen. But the other piece of good news is that the OEs are actively against this and have been very vocal about it. So, I think they have the same exposure we do. So, all in all, it could be an even playing field at the end of the day. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That's really helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Your line is now open. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Hey, Ben. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Ben. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: I have \u2013 just one point of clarity on the incremental Tamworth cost of $0.02, is that on top of the prior $0.07 to $0.09 you were expecting when you initially discussed the dilution associated with that? Or is it on top of the dilution you experienced last year? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: It's on top of the dilution experienced last year, so we think that at the end of the day, the overall kind of duplicative cost over the span of the project will be less than we originally anticipated back in the summer of 2015 when we've put this on the radar screen for everybody. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great. And then, maybe just a quick follow-up to that. You had alluded before that you would see accretion in 2018, are we close enough to 2018 to where you can take a stab at what you think that level of accretion could look like? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: No, it's going to really depend on how quickly we can kind of turn down the two facilities that we're going to ultimately close because that's where the benefit is going to come from. We will be \u2013 at that point in time, in January of 2018, we'll be fully staffed up and running at T2. And then, we will ultimately close the facilities, either transfer or eliminate labor at the two other facilities, and obviously save the lease payments as well. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks so much. And then, if I could ask a question about the organic growth disparities between geographies, do you think you've seen enough normalized weather coupled with the comparisons from last year, such that you would expect those gaps to close as we move into the balance of 2017? Maybe just help us think about that comparison year-over-year. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Well, two days ago, here in Chicago, it was 75 degrees. And this morning when I came in to work, it was 55. So, the normalization of the winter weather has not been even across the country. And so, my expectation is, particularly like in the Midwest which seems to be having really May weather here in February, we're not going to get much of an uplift, if you will. Obviously, the \u2013 essentially, the significant rains out West down in the Texas area, that should help us out. So, my expectation is we're going to continue to see regional differences from a growth perspective. But, Rob, you may... Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. I would just add to that, Ben, that we track miles driven by regions, and the Northeast in December was negative 1.4, and the North Central was negative 2.3. So, it seems like it's going to be a little soft, but we do hit some softer comps in the back half, so we're cautiously optimistic. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. And just one last quick one from me. Is the repayment of debt with the proceeds from the OE sale of glass business, is that reflected in the EPS guidance? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: It is. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. Best of luck. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Ben. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Ben. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. I did want to go to... Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Samik. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, Rob. I did want to go back to the North America parts and service organic growth, and you're guiding to 2% to 4% in 2017 for organic growth. It will be interesting to know how you're thinking about how this impacts long term the growth for that business. Do you think there are headwinds here that sort of persist for a few years, and hence, impacts \u2013 Rob, I believe you've said in the past that you're sort of looking at this business being a mid-single digit grower, but do you think this impacts about how you think about this longer term as well? And maybe just a quick follow-up on that, the sales initiative that you're working on, how long do those take to sort of kick in and deliver some improvement in the growth? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, the \u2013 on North America, I do have \u2013 I'm very bullish on the long term actually. The 2% to 4% this year is really related to what Nick just mentioned, Samik, just a minute ago about being soft weather that we've had, so far, this month certainly in Chicago and across the North. So, now I do believe the macro trends are definitely in our favor. We've had a strong SAAR rate for a couple years. Those cars are going to get to be four or five years old and really come into the sweet spot. You've got miles driven for the most part increasing, a later-model car park is going to be fully insured. The cars are much higher valued, so much more difficult to total. So, I think long term, we're fine. And the number of cars hitting our sweet spot are starting to increase. So, the macro tailwinds are definitely in our favor for the outlier years. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. And any color on how long does it typically take, in your experience, for the sales initiatives to sort of gather pace in terms of delivering some growth? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, we're starting roll those out as we speak. So, I think we'll start to hopefully see some positive impacts here in the back half of the year. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, got it. And then, on Andrew Page, you've started to include it in your guidance for 2017, is there any updated thoughts that you have on how many of those branches that you intend to keep? Is there a cash bent towards restructuring some of the branches there, any color on that? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, let me give you an update on Page. We are still under the hold separate order. However, we do have limited contact now with the Andrew Page management team, and we're assisting in procurement, fleet management, and the back-office. What we're prohibited from doing is sharing market plans or pricing. So, to answer your question, it's a little hard to figure out which branches, what we'll close, what we'll keep. But we are, from a 35,000-foot view, analyzing that. The biggest problem they had was that many suppliers had cut them off. So, while their overhead costs had remained flat, revenue was negatively impacted by the lack of inventory. So, with ECP's help over the last couple months, we were able to stabilize the business, reestablish those supply agreements, and improve the fleet logistics in the internal controls. Now, that it's stabilized, the Andrew Page team is looking to rightsize the cost structure. The full integration and synergy capture can't occur until we get the release from the CMA. So, to comment on how many locations we'll keep, it's a little early still to be able to do that. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. Great. Thank you. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine from Consumer Edge. Your line is now open. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Great. Thank you and good morning, gentlemen. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Jamie. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Jamie. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : It just seems like it's the right thing to do. So, let's keep the ball rolling on North America. Look, we get a lot of questions in a lot of different ways, and some of those have been asked already. The way I want to look at this is strictly speaking from a residual value perspective. What's your view \u2013 you mentioned loss ratios, you have a view on that. How do residual values play into your outlook? And to the extent \u2013 really what I'm focused on is not so much the 11-year-old-beyond vehicle that might get total loss, as Rob alluded to earlier. At the earlier part of the curve, you've got vehicles with much more expensive content, whether it's headlights that are significantly more expensive, taillights with blind spot detection or what have you. And I'm wondering, if residual values were to fall off, will insurance companies be more likely to sort of total loss those vehicles or is there a risk of that? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Sure. Absolutely. We believe we're strongly tied to the Manheim. Used car values, residual values, as cars, that diminishes, obviously it's much more easy to total a car. However, we do believe that the cost of these vehicles is substantial in these newer vehicles, that a lot of these cars are going to repair. I think the proliferation of a $3,000 headlight or taillights are still years away. I think we're still well-positioned, Jamie, to weather that storm. Talking to insurance companies, they don't believe they're going to see a huge spike in total losses because of that anytime soon. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. I mean, in general, the rule of thumb in the industry in every insurance company is a little bit different, as a car will get totalled when the cost to repair starts to get to around 65% of the value of the car. So, if the value of the car comes down because of used car pricings and the like, that could push a few more vehicles into the total camp than not. But when you have cars that are coming out that are very high-priced, it takes a boatload of damage to get to 65% of just that higher number. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : So, if I'm hearing you correctly, and I appreciate that additional color, the 65%, but it sounds like we're not near that pivot point from a strictly-speaking higher part perspective. But I guess as a follow-up to that, are you seeing OEMs act differently as they're becoming more aware that there's a \u2013 there could be a big market opportunity for them to supply those parts? And it does take some time, right, before the newest vehicles make their way to auctions and sort of off-warranty and whatnot, so any competitive sort of changes that you've seen would be helpful. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: We have not seen the OEMs do anything in terms of anything more aggressive quite frankly. We track their prices regularly, and we are still averaging that 1% to 1.5% increase in part prices. So, nothing abnormal from them at all. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Okay. And if I can sneak one last one in, strategically on acquisitions, and thank you for the time. Just given the fact that you have seen some weakness and you've kind of benchmarked that for us, right, you said in certain markets, it's sort of worse than what you're reporting. And so, your spread is still, if I hear you correctly, holding up. But if the benchmarks are weakening, the markets are weakening, wouldn't that, in theory, sort of open up some acquisition opportunities for you? And I'm wondering, there's any \u2013 if you have eyes to maybe accelerate your plans to get into the mechanical parts business in North America in the near term? Thanks. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. I will say, that the pipeline is extremely robust, Jamie, it's \u2013 we get a weekly report from our M&A team of the status of our deals, and it's quite a spreadsheet now. So, there is quite a bit of activity there. As far as the hard part side of the business, we're continuing to look at opportunities there. As you know, we've been quite successful in Europe with our hard part strategy. In the UK, specifically, with the combination of collision and hard parts. So, it is absolutely on the radar for sure. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Great. Thank you again. And best of luck. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Jamie. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Hey, morning, guys. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Hi, Bret. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : I got to get my North American question in. So, if we're looking, I guess, your comment about the softer first half of 2017 as a result of some residual issues from 2016, could you weight the residual weather versus the residual total loss increases in that impact, which one is more significant and sort of give us some buckets? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, that's really hard to do because at the end of the day, all we know is kind of what's happening from a repairable claim perspective, that was 2.5% increase for the year as a whole, the fourth quarter number was 2.8%. The reality is we don't sense that we're losing any share, kind of call volumes are consistent. We do have some anecdotal information, Bret, in chatting with our vendors which we do all the time, right, and a couple of our largest providers of aftermarket parts over in Taiwan have told us that their non-LKQ sales last year were flat to down, which says that our competitors, if you will, were buying the same or even a little bit less aftermarket inventory, which is I think just reflective of the market and a relatively low increase in repairable claims. But it's almost impossible for us to split weather from other market trends. The key, it's important I think the folks to understand is that the growth of the kind of the core products was higher than the 3% overall in the fourth quarter, okay, when you think about that core aftermarket product of hoods, fenders, mirrors, bumpers and the like. As some of these secondary products, the paints and the radiators and like where we've got some special programs being designed to attack that, they were actually down on a year-over-year basis. And so, our core kind of collision \u2013 your question, I think, really went to the trends in the core collision market, in those core collision products, we're more than holding our own and we think we're probably continuing to take a little bit of share. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: And then, let me just add, Bret, your comment about the auction and what we're seeing there. Q4 year-over-year, our salvage purchases were up 5.2% at $47 less a vehicle. So, that surge of inventory \u2013 like I said, it's allowing us to buy more inventory at a cheaper price, our self service was up 14% Q4-over-Q4. So, the inventory being available is not a bad thing for us. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then, the highlight obviously ECP comps, the 12-month stores being up over 6%. What's going on over there, is that the market growth rate? Are you taking a lot of share ? And I guess, is that also benefiting from the collision mix that you're putting through those stores or is that separate? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. The collision was definitely helping because that is in the numbers as well. But we are definitely taking market share, and we believe the industry is growing likely GDP. Interesting enough, Brexit has not hurt us at all in terms of the driving population. In fact, they've coined the term staycations that the BRICS can't go to Europe because their dollar is not \u2013 the pounds is not travelling as farther. So, they're staying home. So, we're seeing miles driven up. We believe \u2013 we're very confident in ECPs continued growth in that marketplace. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Bret. Operator : This concludes the Q&A session. Mr. Rob Wagman, I turn the call over to you. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We look forward to updating you on our next call in April when we report Q1 results. Have a great day. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Julie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the LKQ Corp.'s First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Boutross, LKQ's Director of Investor Relations. You may begin. Joseph P. Boutross - LKQ Corp.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Rob Wagman and Nick Zarcone.

And with that I am happy to turn the call over to Rob Wagman. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thank you, Joe. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today. This morning, I will begin our review with a few high-level financial metrics followed by an update on our operating segments and some macro trends we witnessed in Q1. Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our financial performance and revised guidance. Turning to slide 4, Q1 revenue reached $2.34 billion, an increase of 21.9% as compared to $1.92 billion in the first quarter of 2016. Revenue growth in parts and services was a strong 24.5% on a constant currency basis. Income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2017 was $140.8 million, an increase of 25.5% as compared to $112.2 million for the same period of 2016. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2017 was $0.45, an increase of 25% as compared to $0.36 for the same period of 2016. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.49, an increase of 16.7% as compared to $0.42 for the same period of 2016. During the first quarter, global organic revenue growth for parts and services was 4.5%. Now, turning to operations. Organic revenue for parts and services in North America was 1.8%, roughly in line with our expectations and guidance, and the performance we anticipated given the mild weather we were experiencing as we entered 2017 when we provided our initial guidance. According to NOAA, during March, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was over 10% warmer than the 20th century average. Record and near-record warmth spanned the West and Great Plains. Behind Q1 2012, the first quarter of 2017 was the second warmest first quarter period on record. Comparatively, the first quarter of 2016 was the fourth warmest. According to CCC, collision and liability related auto claims for the quarter were up only 1.1% nationally, 70 basis points lower than what we were able to achieve in North America parts and services growth. Furthering that point, according to the industry and supplier research, many of our collision shop customers and the smaller distributors faced flat-to-down results during Q1. Importantly, our core collision products such as Keystone Platinum Plus fenders, hoods, and lights and our key salvage collision and mechanical parts grew at a faster pace than the overall North America organic rate. With that said, and despite the weather headwind, during the quarter North America witnessed tremendous margin improvement with segment EBITDA increasing 210 basis points sequentially and 110 basis points year-over-year. Nick will provide margin details shortly. During Q1, we purchased 75,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American wholesale operations, a 4.2% increase over Q1 2016. As for volume at the auctions, the outlook for supply remains strong and the pricing dynamics we are witnessing are attractive. With inventory already on hand and the continuation of our current run rate for acquiring cars, we should have sufficient inventory for our recycled parts operations. We are confident our business will benefit from these trends. For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see the expansion of our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 9% and 17%, respectively, year-over-year in the quarter. Also during the quarter, our aftermarket and PGW auto glass teams integrated three glass locations into our existing LKQ wholesale warehouses. The glass location integration is on schedule with six additional locations planned for the balance of the year. In our self-service retail business, during Q1 we acquired 133,000 lower cost, self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 6.4% increase over Q1 2016. During Q1 we increased our self-service procurement to take advantage of the favorable pricing for higher quality vehicles and increasing scrap prices in this line of business. Lastly, I am pleased with the ongoing benefits we are witnessing with our productivity initiatives. During the quarter North America realized 50 basis points of gross margin improvement from the aftermarket procurement savings alone. Roadnet, our route optimization technology, has made tremendous progress in the past year, and today is active in 343 locations with minimal locations active this time last year. At quarter end nearly 52,000 daily deliveries were tracked on a Roadnet system across 78,000 dispatched routes. In regards to macro trends, the North American market continues to grow its product offerings, the SAAR rate is robust and trends, such as miles driven and unemployment, continued to move in our favor. APU trends are favorable reaching 37% in 2016, a 100 basis point improvement over 2015. The number of certified parts continues to grow and our productivity initiatives are yielding quantifiable results. Now, moving to our European operations. In Q1, our Europe segment had strong organic revenue growth for parts and services of 8.5%, and acquisition growth of 51.5%, primarily related to Rhiag, which were offset by a decrease of 9.9% related to foreign exchange rates. During Q1, ECP drove solid organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.8%, and for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 5.1%. During the quarter, ECP integrated six new UK paint locations into existing ECP branches. At the end of Q1, ECP was operating 212 branches. During Q1, collision part sales of ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 18.9%. With respect to the T2 project, I am pleased with our continued progress. During Q1, we started testing the T2 automation. As indicated on our last call, once the automation process is solidified, we plan on starting deliveries in early Q3, and to be fully live in Q1 of 2018 with ECP's base business. This project continues to be both on budget and on schedule. Now turning to our Sator business. During Q1, Sator had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 3.4% and achieved its highest first quarter margin since we acquired the business in 2013. Now, on to Rhiag. March 18 marked the one year anniversary of Rhiag acquisition and, going forward, Rhiag will no longer be considered acquired revenue. Rhiag tracked in line with our expectations during the quarter and continues to execute on its growth initiative and expand its footprint. During the quarter, the Rhiag team opened 12 branches in Eastern Europe. With respect to the broader integration of our European operations, work is progressing on a number of major initiatives including procurement, cataloging, garage management systems, garage concepts such as branding garages with an LKQ brand name, a private label sourcing, and pricing. Now on to Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment posted year-over-year total revenue growth of 6.7% in the quarter largely due to impressive organic revenue growth of 6.3%. The sales of light trucks and RVs continued their upward trend at a solid pace. And given the depth of our product offerings, we believe our Specialty segment is well positioned to participate in that future growth. Now, turning to corporate development. In addition to finalizing the previously announced divestiture of PGW's automotive glass manufacturing business, during the first quarter of 2017, LKQ acquired parts recycling businesses in Michigan and in Sweden, and a specialty products business in Pennsylvania. Also, I am pleased to announce today that we are entering the $2.4 billion transmission repair market with the greenfielding of a remanufacturing transmission operation in Oklahoma. This project and new product line fits well with our operating philosophy of putting one more part on the truck. We anticipate opening this operation in Q4 this year. Our acquisition strategy has always been to acquire the best assets we can with high quality management teams and use those strengths to lever the growth of the businesses. As we look across our key segments, the acquisition pipeline is healthy with tremendous opportunities to grow our existing market share in key markets, expand the depth of our product lines, and enter new geographic markets and, in particular, throughout Europe. At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2017 guidance. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everybody on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter before touching on the balance sheet and then addressing our upward-revised guidance for 2017. When taken as a whole, our financial performance in the first quarter of 2017 was excellent and slightly ahead of our expectations. We experienced solid revenue and earnings growth, headlined by the best margins our North American business has achieved in several years. My comments this morning will focus on the results from continuing operations which exclude the two months of activity for the PGW automotive glass manufacturing business which was sold on March 1, 2017, for $310 million. Consolidated revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $2.3 billion representing a 21.9% increase over last year. That reflects a 21.7% increase in revenue from parts and services, aided by 25.9% increase in other revenue. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results. As noted on slide 12 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins improved 10 basis points to 39.7%. The uptick reflected significantly improved productivity in North America, offset by a decline in Europe, largely resulting from the inclusion of Rhiag which has lower gross margin structures and a decline due to our Specialty segment which has the lowest gross margin structure of all of our businesses. We gained about 10 basis points of efficiencies in our operating expenses largely due to lower facility and warehousing expense as a percent of revenue, reflecting the inclusion of Rhiag in the 2017 results as it has lower facility and warehousing expenses than our other businesses. Segment EBITDA totaled $290 million for the first quarter of 2017, reflecting the $54 million or 23% increase over the comparable quarter of 2016. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 12.4%, a 10 basis point increase over the 12.3% recorded last year. During the first quarter of 2017, we experienced a $12 million decrease in restructuring cost compared to the prior year, but a $17 million increase in depreciation and amortization, the latter of which was due largely to the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions. With that, operating income for the first quarter of 2017 was up about $50 million or almost 27% when compared to the same period last year. Interest expense increased $9.4 million due to the increased borrowings to fund the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions. Non-operating expenses improved by about $7 million over last year as the Q1 2016 results included some one-time items related to the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions. With that, pre-tax income during the first quarter of 2017 was $213 million, up $47 million or 28% compared to the first quarter of last year. Our net tax rate during the first quarter was 33.9%, up from 32.1% in 2016. The 2017 rate reflected an effective rate of 35.25% and some discrete items that reduced the reported rate, the most significant of which is the excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. The effective rate of 35.25% excluding discrete items is higher than last year due to a shift in the geographic mix of our earnings. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.45, which was up 25% compared to the $0.36 reported last year. Adjusted EPS which excludes restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation, and other one-time unusual items, was $0.49 in the first quarter of 2017 versus $0.42 last year, reflecting a 17% improvement. Stronger scrap prices added slightly more than $0.01 to EPS in Q1 2017. And as anticipated, the translation impact of currencies had a negative impact of $0.01 a share during the quarter. As highlighted on slide 13, the competition of our revenue continues to change due to the varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins. And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the first quarter of 2017 increased to $1.208 billion, up 11.8% over 2016. The overall growth in revenue resulted from a combination of 10.4% growth from parts and services and a 25.5% increase in other revenue, the latter of which was due primarily to higher prices received for scrap steel and other metals. The 10.4% growth in North American parts and services was the result of a combination of 1.8% organic growth plus 8.3% acquisition growth, and an additional 20 basis points of increase from the FX impact due to the strength of the Canadian dollar. There is no doubt that another very mild winter had an impact on our revenue. Rob mentioned the CCC statistic that repairable claims were up on average of only 1.1% in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2017. Indeed, 23 of the 50 states reported declines in collision and liability repairable claim volume on a year-over-year basis. Gross margins in North America during the first quarter were 44.4%, a recent high and up 180 basis points over the 42.6% reported last year. The strong results reflected the benefits of procurement initiatives in both our salvage and aftermarket operations, offset in part by the inclusion of the PGW aftermarket glass operation which, structurally, has lower margins. With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we lost about 50 basis points of margin compared to comparable quarter of last year. Almost all of the increase in expense as a percent of revenue was due to the inclusion of the PGW aftermarket glass operation in the North American results in 2017 and with almost $6 million of shared PGW corporate expenses for the first two months were recorded as continuing operations even though these expenses went with the glass manufacturing sold on March 1. These shared costs will no longer be incurred by the PGW aftermarket operation. In total, EBITDA for the North American segment during the first quarter was $176 million, a 20.9% increase over last year. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the North American segment was 14.6% in Q1 of 2017, up 110 basis points from the 13.5% reported in the first quarter of last year. Again, these are the best margins the North American segment has reported in many years. As noted, scrap prices were stronger than anticipated in the first quarter of 2017 compared to last year and added slightly more than $0.01 to Q1 EPS. Assuming prices stay at the current levels, we will not get the same level of positive impact during the rest of the year. Moving on to our European segment, total revenue in the first quarter accelerated to $821 million, up from $547 million, a 50% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the first quarter was 8.5%, reflecting the combination of 6.8% growth at ECP and 3.4% growth at Sator. Note that the Easter holiday fell in Q1 of 2016, but Q2 of 2017. So some of the European countries picked up extra selling days in Q1 of 2017, which increased the reported organic rate. This will reverse in Q2 as there are less selling days in some of the countries in April of 2017 compared to last year. On a per day basis organic growth in Europe was approximately 3.4% in the first quarter of 2017. New branch openings at Rhiag since the acquisition contributed to the overall European organic growth rate in the first quarter of 2017. And all of Rhiag will be fully blended into the organic growth results next quarter, albeit with a few less selling days. Gross margins in Europe decreased to 37%, a 110-basis-point decline over the comparable period of 2016. While both ECP and Sator reported the highest first quarter gross margins each has achieved in several years, the inclusion of Rhiag weighed down the consolidated European margins. As mentioned in prior calls, given the three-step distribution model in Italy and Switzerland, Rhiag has a lower gross margin structure than either ECP or Sator. And the shift in the revenue mix negatively impacts the consolidated European margins. Now that we have reached the one year anniversary of the Rhiag acquisition, this mix impact will largely disappear going forward. With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 30-basis-point improvement on a consolidated European basis. On the positive, we benefited from the inclusion of Rhiag, which structurally has lower operating expenses than our other European business, and we also benefited from improved SG&A leverage in the UK. Offsetting these items were increased facility cost related to additional branches, the new T2 national distribution center in the UK, and the inclusion of Andrew Page, which is still losing money while we need to operate under a hold separate order issued by the Competitive Markets Authority (sic) [Competition and Markets Authority] (22:47). European segment EBITDA totaled $79 million, a 36.9% increase over last year. Relative to the first quarter of 2016, the pound declined 13% and the euro declined 3% against the dollar. So on a constant currency basis, EBITDA growth in Europe was 47.5%, which we believe is quite robust. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA on the first quarter was 9.6% versus 10.5% last year, a 90-basis-point decline. Approximately 70 basis points of the decline relates to the impact of Andrew Page and the incremental cost in 2017 related to the new T2 facility. Note the CMA is still reviewing our Andrew Page acquisition under the UK competition law. And it appears it could be moving toward a Phase 2 review for some or all of the business. That will likely extend the review time line for any portions referred into Phase 2 by an additional six to nine months. Turning to our Specialty segment, revenue in the first quarter totaled $315 million, a 6.7% increase over the comparable quarter of 2016. The organic growth rate of 6.3% reflected the continued strength of sales of truck, towing, and RV parts, offset a bit by lower levels related to performance part sales. Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the first quarter decreased 240 basis points compared to last year, largely due to lower supplier discounts, unfavorable product mix, and higher warehouse cost capitalized into inventory due to the two new distribution centers added last year. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down about 230 basis points as we continue to see the leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network. EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $35 million, up 6% from Q1 of 2016. And as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment was flat with the prior year at 11.3%. Remember this is a highly seasonal business and the first quarter is typically pretty strong, as demonstrated by the graph in the lower right-hand corner of slide 18. Consistent with normal seasonal patterns, you should assume these margins will moderate as we move through the back half of the year. Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on slide 19, you will note that our after tax cash flow from continuing operations during the first quarter was approximately $176 million as we experienced strong earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. During Q1 we deployed $117 million of capital to support the continued growth of our businesses, including $41 million to fund capital expenditures and $76 million to fund acquisitions and other investments. The largest capital changes reflect the paydown of $326 million of debt, largely funded by the net proceeds derived from the sale of the PGW glass manufacturing business. At March 31, we had a little more than $3 billion of debt outstanding and approximately $265 million of cash, resulting in net debt of about $2.8 billion or approximately 2.6 times LTM EBITDA. We have more than $1.3 billion of availability on our line of credit, which together with our cash, yields total liquidity of over $1.6 billion. Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided updates to guidance on a couple of our key financial metrics for 2017. As it relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we continue to be comfortable with the range of 4.0% to 6.0% for 2017, essentially consistent with our recent experience. Our range for adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations which excludes restructuring expenses, the after tax impact of intangible amortization, and the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, was increased to a range of $1.82 to $1.92 a share, with a midpoint of $1.87, up $0.02 a share. Based on our shares outstanding, that range implied an adjusted net income of approximately $565 million to $595 million with a midpoint of $580 million. Our assumed effective tax rate before discrete items for 2017 is 35.25%. Our guidance for cash flow from operations is approximately $615 million to $645 million with a midpoint of $630 million, while the guidance for capital spending remains constant at $200 million to $225 million. Finally, page 23 sets forth the updated chart included in the Q4 call materials, which bridges the actual 2016 earnings per share from continuing operations to the midpoint of our updated 2017 guidance. You will note that with the exception of the growth in the base business, which increased by $0.02 to $0.19 a share, all the other items are on track with the levels anticipated at the time of our call back in February. And at this point, I'll turn the call back over to Rob to wrap up. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Nick. As a company, we are always focused on financial performance, but we are equally focused on facing change head-on and rapidly adapting in order to continuously deliver positive results for our stockholders, employees and, most importantly, our customers. It is clear, as headwinds present themselves, our team actively adjust to market conditions to effectively and profitability manage their businesses, not only for today, but to position us well for the future. This focus has allowed us again to deliver double-digit EPS growth. And before we open the call to Q&A, I would like to thank all of our nearly 40,000 employees, our stockholders, our board, our external constituents, friends and, most importantly, my family, for your trust, loyalty, support and commitment over the last six years as LKQ CEO. There simply are not enough words to explain my gratitude. As I step aside and enter a new chapter of my life, I can say with utter conviction and enthusiasm that I have never been more excited about the future of LKQ and delighted that the board have selected Nick to be my successor. The transition is on schedule and would expect to formally pass the baton to Nick over the next month or two. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Your line is open. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Ben. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Rob, best wishes. Thanks for everything over the years and hopefully we can stay in touch. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Ben. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: So, the remanufactured transmission greenfield late in the year, that's interesting. Could you frame up the size of that market? What the acquisition opportunities might look like over there as far as the pace or the cadence of the rollout of that program? And is that your reman engine business that's quite a large business today for you (30:52). Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. Research tells us, Ben, that it's about a $2.4 billion a year repair \u2013 just the automatic transmissions that we're going to focus on \u2013 which also Oklahoma City because it's near our core division in Texas. What's interesting about what we do obviously is we're selling roughly 300,000 used transmissions into the marketplace. We pick up a core with everyone of those. So, we're going to be able to put them right back into reman and put them back on our shelves. What's also good about the data we have is that we know which transmissions are on high demand based on our activity for used transmissions. So, we're going to focus on those high, fast-moving units at first. The management team is hired. As you mentioned, we have a very strong reman engine division. They're actually overseeing this. I have the utmost confidence in our team. And quite frankly, the reason why we're greenfielding is there really aren't a lot of good acquisition candidates out there. There's a lot of what we call bench techs where \u2013 like in AAMCO Transmission where they pull your transmission repair and put it back. So, there aren't many doing this on this level. So, we're excited about the opportunity. We expect our first transmission to be sold in Q4 and we think it's going to be a sizeable opportunity for us. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then the gross margin improvement in North America, can you talk about how the progress you've made there, the $9.4 million year-to-date, tracks relative to your expectations? What your expectation is for what's left there? And then sort of the cadence of that as we move through the year? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Sure, Ben. This is Nick. Obviously, the improvement in the North American gross margins are coming from really all parts of the business, whether that's the full-service salvage, the aftermarket parts, as well as our self-service operations and the like. The key there is the procurement. It has less to do with selling prices. It all has to do with improvements from a procurement perspective. The activity at the auctions continues to be very strong as far as product flow. We're buying good product at good prices. We're focusing on getting a few more parts off of each of those cars because, ultimately, we earn more money when we sell a part than when we send it to the crusher, if you will. Clearly, the improvements and the focus on aftermarket procurement that we put into place about 18 months ago is really helping. Again, the total productivity initiatives, which includes things beyond just cost of goods sold items was over $9 million in the quarter. We are about $9 million last year or last \u2013 in the fourth quarter of last year as well. So, we're annualizing now at about $35 million, $36 million. All of that helps. All of that helps drive down the cost of goods sold and improving the margins. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Great. And then just one last one for me. On the Andrew Page expense impact, looks like it moderated from 4Q to 1Q. I'm curious that move from, I think 120-basis-point impact in 4Q to 80-basis-point impact. Is that seasonality or is this moderation sort of a cadence that we should expect as we move through the balance of the year? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Well, we are doing a little bit better than we were in the fourth quarter when we initially acquired the business. But we still have to operate under the hold separate order. And so, there's only so much, Ben, we can do as it relates to the day-to-day activities at Andrew Page. Our goal is to keep the losses to a minimum until we can get full control of the business. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. Best of luck. Thanks. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Ben. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Hi, Rob. Hi, Nick. Just wanted to get your \u2013 good morning. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the North America parts and service group. You mentioned that results there have been stronger in 1Q than you expected particularly on the margin front. But related to the organic growth, how do you calculate it for your expectation and even putting the weather issues that you had mentioned previously aside, how you're feeling about the strength of the underlying market there? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So, the North American organic of 1.8% is consistent with what we signaled during our fourth quarter call. At that point in time, we said that for the year, we were looking at 2% to 4% in North America. We anticipated that the first quarter in particular was going to be at or below the low end of the range, at 1.8%. That's exactly where we came up. The reality is January and February were tough, March was the best month of the quarter. From a growth perspective, March tends to be a stronger month, in general. So, we are cautiously optimistic with respect to what that could mean for the rest of the year. We're still comfortable with the 2% to 4% range. Again, at the low end of the range, if we just do 2.1% for the back nine months, we'll hit 2%. To get to 4% we need to be at 4.7%, on average, for the back nine months. We probably need some help from the industry trends to get us to the upper end of the range. But again, it's still \u2013 in theory, it's still within reach. At the midpoint of the range, if we do 3.4%, we'll annualize out at 3.0% for the year. So, at the end of the day, the trends \u2013 Rob talked about the 1.1% increase in repairable collision and liability claims, that's as low it has been for quite some time. The reality, I mentioned the 23 states were actually down. The states that had the largest increase included locations like Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho. I mean, it's great that they're up significantly but there's no cars in those states. So, it didn't really help us very much. So, again, we remain cautiously optimistic that the trends will improve through the year and coming off of a relatively slow start. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: I'd actually like to add to that, obviously, we got to do some easier comps in the back half of the year. We are seeing more cars moving to that sweet spot as the sour rate from three years ago really starts to move in. As Nick mentioned there was macro trends. It was nice to see that APU finally went up 100 bps to 37%, miles driven, unemployment, fuel is still relatively cheap. So, we feel good that those macro trends has turned into more claims. I think we're well positioned. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good. And just quickly on the EPS guidance, you raised the guidance in simple terms. Is it really driven by any of the revenue expectations like, for example, revenue expectations from Europe, anything improving on that side? Or is it more a reflection of the margins trend that you saw across your businesses? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: It's really \u2013 we anticipate that we're going to fall into our guidance from a growth perspective, that the margins will continue to be pretty strong. Again, we did a little bit better than we anticipated in Q1. Now, we also know that a penny of that was the higher scrap prices which we did not anticipate. And we don't think we will get the same uptick on scrap in the balance of the year. Again, you got to remember scrap prices in Q1 of last year were in the $92 range or somewhere thereabouts. So, it was a pretty big lift on a year-over-year basis. Again, we were anticipating scrap at $125 a ton or so coming into the year and it was a little bit better than that. So it's a combination of consistent growth, consistent with our guidance, and good margins. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And one final question if I may. One common pushback, investor pushback that I get is really \u2013 and I know you've probably answered this before \u2013 is the increasing complexity of new vehicle parts or parts used by new vehicles trade (40:10). And so when you look at the aftermarket suppliers that you work with, how are you \u2013 what are your thoughts on their preparedness to sort of supply these increasingly complex parts going forward? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. Really no issues there at all. Aluminum, high-strength steel, all of our manufacturers have access to that. In fact, they're producers for the OEs. So they have an aftermarket division and an OE division. So that should not be an issue at all. As far as some of the sensors that go into the components, insurance companies won't use aftermarket or recycled sensors. So those were parts we really couldn't sell before anyway. So it's really not an issue. The more expensive components though, should bode well for us, because we can replicate them and obviously, we have them in the used as well. So we should receive a little bit of a tailwind there. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Got it. Great. Thanks for taking our questions. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Samik. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. And, Rob, from employee number 55 to the CEO of this great company, congratulations on a great career. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Craig, appreciate that. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So as the board pursues Nick's successor, could you give us any color on what type of attributes they're looking for? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Sure, Craig. And I can assure everyone the search process has been launched. We've retained a firm. The initial feedback from prospective candidates has been incredibly positive. We've reviewed dozens of candidates on paper over the last couple weeks. We'll move into the next part of that process very shortly. I'm highly confident that finding capable candidates is not going to be the issue. The key is going to be finding somebody who fits LKQ from a cultural perspective. When you think about the attributes, clearly somebody who has public company experience would be helpful, either as a sitting CFO or as a strong number two. If we could find somebody with distribution and/or automotive experience, that would be a plus obviously. A big part of our business is overseas, so some international experience would be helpful. We do a lot of M&A work, and so somebody who has been part of that process again would be helpful. Capital markets expertise. The fact that we are going to continue to grow business quite rapidly, and we're going to need to fund that growth. And ultimately, we're looking for the best candidate with the best fit. But if we can find a diverse candidate, that would be an added plus. So you put all that into the mix. We doubt that anybody is going to fit all that perfectly. But that's kind of what's on the wish list, Craig. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That helps. And then I had a question about your Specialty business. Growth in that business was stronger than we had anticipated. I'm wondering how much of that is market demand versus things you might be doing to improve SKU count or drive growth in other ways? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. I think it's fair to say it's both, Craig. Obviously the SAAR rate, most people are projecting that's going to start to plateau. Truck sales and SUVs are very strong, which is the core bread and butter of that division. We constantly add new SKUs and grow the business through that side, through inventory. But clearly the demand is very strong for these type of products. So we are cautiously optimistic that's going to continue, with the SAAR rate being strong in those type of vehicles. So we're expanding. We look for new geographic \u2013 and of course geographic locations and of course, our announcement last quarter of our expansion of this product line into Europe and the UK. So we think there's opportunities in Europe as well. So that's going to be a good product line for us going forward. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks and best wishes. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Craig. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Rob, Nick, and Joe for taking my questions. Can you help me with the extra day just to think about it in halves? If I look at first half of 2016 versus first half of 2017 and the day moving around, how do I think about the 3.4 (44:48) looks like what to 2Q on a like-for-like basis? What am I talking about? 40 basis points? 100 basis points moving around? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So, Michael, this is Nick. And good morning. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, Nick. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: The first half kind of balances it out. It really had to do with the Easter weekend in Europe, where you had the biggest impact. Easter was in I believe the last week of March or towards the last week of March in 2016. Obviously impacted Q1. Some of the European countries, it's basically a day off, both on Good Friday and on Easter Monday, the Monday after Easter. That fell into April this year. So when you look at the first half, it should basically cancel each other out. So a little bit stronger growth in Q1. It would be a little bit softer growth in Q2 on a reported basis, just because of the impact of the Easter holiday. But it should all wash out. We talked about in the Q4 call, last year was a leap year. And so there's one less day on the calendar. That really manifests itself in the U.S. Actually the way the calendar falls from a working day perspective, it doesn't pop out till the third quarter, if you will, where we're down one day. So hopefully that helps. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Well, I get all that. What I'm really trying to figure out, what's one day equal in volume? Is it... Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Well, one day on a quarterly basis is about 1.5%, right? Because in the U.S. we tend to have about 63, 64 business days in a quarter. So if you take one day out, you're about 1.5%. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And so \u2013 and that's the same math for Europe then? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: So yes. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. Okay. All right. That helps. And then if you net out the year-over-year difference in scrap in your North American margin, that delta is 30 basis points, 40 basis points, you still would have shown an improvement. I'm just trying to get to the (47:05)... Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: The scrap gave us a little bit more than $0.01. A $0.01 is about $5 million of pre-tax. So, that's probably the best way to think about it. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, that's more like 20 basis points, 25 basis points, the difference. So, 14.3 looks like 14.1 (47.26) without the benefit of the metal? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then in North America, we talked about the mix between collision repair versus mechanical trends. If I balance out \u2013 so I'm thinking 65% of revenues are collision and 35% are mechanical, what were the trends inside that part of the book? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. The trends were actually pretty similar, if you will. Again, the salvage side of business really serves both markets, right. Obviously, we sell sheet metal and the likes off of a recycled vehicle, but the most valued parts of the engine and the transmission which go into the mechanical side of the business. And again, the growth of the aftermarket and what I'll call the core collision aftermarket product, the hoods, the fenders, the lights, the bumpers and the like, was pretty comparable actually to the growth of the salvage business. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: I will add, Michael, that obviously, the aging car part bodes very well for our mechanical, used engines, used transmissions, and future reman transmissions as well. So, we think we're well positioned on the mechanical side. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. All right. Rob, good luck. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Michael. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And thank you for taking my questions. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge. Your line is open. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Great. Thank you very much and let me just add my sentiment as well. Rob, wish you the best. You've been great to work with and, like I said, wishing you the best in your future endeavors. And, Nick, very excited that you're going to be taking on some responsibilities here in the interim and look forward to that as well. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Jim. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thanks. And Rob is not going far. He's going to stay as a consultant with us, and I've got all sorts of ideas as to how to keep him plenty busy. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Well, in that case then, glad to have you around. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: (49:44) James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Very good. At any rate, I wanted to maybe ask in a different way North America organic growth. We've talked about now in several quarters the fact that units in operation, there is this older-than-average car park, and as values come down for those vehicles, there's just different determinations as to what makes sense to repair versus total loss. And it sounds like we're going to be in this air pocket for a while and I'm wondering if we're watching closely in terms of values of vehicles, and we've seen residual values decline more recently here, NADA data and so forth. Is there a potential for a negative pivot even further if we see a further erosion of residual values? And how should we think about that perhaps impacting your organic growth rates next nine months? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Clearly, total losses are tied to residual values or actual cash values, but the insurance industry uses the term. Obviously, we expect, and with the aging car part, to see total losses to continue. Now, we meet with CCC every quarter. There was a slight uptick in total losses in Q1, but it's hanging right around that high-18% range. Their prediction is it starts to level off as these newer car part gets into the repair cycle here. But the older cars are certainly sticking around. As used car values drop, that will obviously increase the total losses, if that happens. Interesting, Manheim reported they were slightly up last month. So, we haven't really seen that happen yet, that the residual value is coming down. Should that happen, though, I remind everybody that how we get our inventory for salvage. So, even if it takes up to 19%, 20%, that's still four or five cars are repairing. And one of the things that I think holds us back in our organic growth is the availability of inventory. So, if there's an uptick in total losses, it's not necessarily a bad thing where there's so many cars still being repaired. Now, if that was to go up dramatically, then I think I would change my tune on that, Jamie, but for now, I think there's a healthy balance between total losses and repairable. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. And the other thing CCC mentioned is they believe that the uptick in the total loss rates is directly tied to the age of the car part. The reality is when we're buying a car that's 9, 10, 11 years old at auction, we're not buying it for the sheet metal, we're not buying it for the hoods and the fenders, and the doors, if you will, because most of those cars aren't getting repaired anyways. We're buying it for the mechanical components, the engine and transmission, because the sweet spot there is really cars 7- to 14-years model years old. And so, the more of those cars we can buy, the better we will be to service our customers. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: And that was my comment to Michael on the previous question, was that \u2013 it's the older cars \u2013 our mechanical businesses was well primed for that side of the business. So, the more total losses, older cars, more inventory we can get for those mechanical components. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Okay. And obviously, you've reiterated today your 2% to 4% outlook. And so, to the extent that you would have seen something incremental in this data, you would have, I guess, revisited that and you didn't, right? So, it seems like you, maybe at the lower end of that range, have baked in some of this already, if I'm interpreting that correctly. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. I think that's (53:11) James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Okay. Very good. Well, thanks again. And like I said, Rob, best of luck with everything, and look forward to staying in touch. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Jamie. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is open. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Hey. How should we think about the cadence of the CCC data in the sense that it was down \u2013 it's marginally up year-over-year, but the first quarter of last year, I think was probably better. Does the comparison ease as you get into 2017? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. Interestingly, we said that \u2013 Bret, that it was 1.1%. For Q1 of 2016, it was 1.4%. So, claims line actually came down this year versus last year. Where they go, claims line, in the future months, we're not sure obviously. But our comps do get easier so that's why we think we're going to be okay on the organic growth. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then, on the reman business, how do we think about the longer-term margin impact, assuming that's a successful business you've grown in that $2.4 billion category? How does that compare to the North American average? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So, the best gauge we can tell you is our experience on reman engines because we have a pretty active business there. And the margins there are very consistent and very strong of gross margins relative \u2013 north of 40% range, which is consistent with our North American business. And we fully anticipate that our margins in the reman transmission business will be in that same zip code. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. And then last question, I guess on the Mekonomen Group. I think I saw that John Quinn had become Chairman of that operation. Is that something that \u2013 what's your longer term plan there as you get more involved? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So, as we announced last quarter, we have the 26.5% ownership position in Mekonomen are publicly held entity over in Sweden. We actually have two board members, both John Quinn and Joe Holsten, our Chairman, serve on the board of Mekonomen. We're very happy with our current position there. We believe it's a terrific company. They're working through some growth issues as well, but we're going to remain a very interested shareholder and, again, we're happy with our current position. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And if I can squeeze one last one in. On the APU, it's good to see that growing again. Is that industry-wide uptake on alternative parts or is that sort of being driven by this sort of the secular market share gains from the MSOs? I mean, obviously you've got a few big consolidators out there gaining a lot of share and they over-index to APU. Is it across the board or is it being driven by some of the big guys taking market share? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: I think it's both, Bret. I think that MSOs are driving it as well as the insurance companies. About 50-somewhat-percent is going through a true DRP environment, the other 50% is being driven by the insurance industry. So, it's a combination of both. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you, guys. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Bret. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Ryan. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Ryan. Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC: So, first question for me is on your guidance as it relates to operating margins. It looks like you're expecting operating margins to rise in the second half of the year. Is this mainly driven by North America or did the other segments started to help as well? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. No. Nobody should anticipate a significant uptick in margins, if you will, in the back half of the year. The growth will help. We have \u2013 our business is a little bit seasonal, part of the reason we put in the historical margins on a quarter-by-quarter basis for each of the businesses into our chart is so folks can take that into account, if you will. Clearly, if you just track historically, Q1 and Q2 tend to be good quarters. The third quarter tends to be a little bit softer and then we pick up again \u2013 generally, pick up a bit in Q4. Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. And then, secondly, it looks like accident claims, the year-over-year growth in the first quarter was a little slower than the fourth quarter, yet you saw a little bit of a pickup in North American organic. So, is this share gains and possibly the sales initiatives kicking in here? Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: They're definitely taking market share, we believe that. Just as we are very inquisitive, we look at other people's \u2013 our competitor's financials as we buy companies. We are definitely taking up market share. No doubt about it. Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC: And now the sales initiatives that you've instituted, are those kicking in or is that going to take a little while. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: That's going to take a little while, Ryan, but we certainly \u2013 we're focusing on more market \u2013 more wallet share of our customers and we're slowly aligning our sales reps towards those goals. So, that's going to take a little bit more time. Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : I just wanted to follow up with the last question on the sales force compensation changes. Just more detail on what you've done so far and if you've seen any turnover as a result of the changes. Thanks. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. It's not sales force compensation changes. We haven't changed the compensation of our reps. It's more just how they're being commissioned on the growth of those customers. So, we are not seeing a turnover of those reps at that level. It's just rewarding them more for growing a segment of our business. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Rob for closing remarks. Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.: Thank you, everybody, for joining the call. We look forward to updating you in July when we announce our Q2 results. Thanks, everybody. Have a good day. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Take care. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Nick Zarcone. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. I am delighted to share the results for our most recent quarter with you. I will begin with a few high-level financial metrics before providing an update on our operating segments and discussing a few of the macro trends we witnessed during the quarter. I will then turn the call over to Michael Clark, who will provide some segment-level financial detail, and then I will come back to comment on our updated guidance and make a few final remarks before taking your questions. All-in-all, we believe Q2 was a strong quarter for our company and we are pleased with the results. As noted on slide 3, consolidated revenue was $2.458 billion, a 6.7% increase over the $2.3 billion recorded in the second quarter of last year. Total revenue growth from parts and services was 6.4%. Importantly, organic growth in parts and services was 3.8% on a reported basis. After taking into account the fewer selling days in Europe related to the timing of the Easter holiday, organic growth was a solid 4.9% on a same-day basis. It's nice to see the organic growth begin to pick up from the levels we experienced in the first quarter. Income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2017 was $151 million, an increase of 9.5% over the comparable quarter of last year, resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.49 as compared to $0.45 for the comparable period of 2016. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.53 compared to $0.52 for the same period last year. Let's turn to the operating highlights. As you'll note from slide 6, parts and services revenue for our North American segment grew 5.5% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable quarter of 2016. Organic revenue growth for parts and services in North America was 2.8%. This reflect a nice uptick from the 1.8% recorded in the first quarter and a touch above our expectations coming into the quarter. There is no doubt that the mild winter weather patterns, which hit us particularly hard in the winter months, carried over into the spring as our body shop customers have limited backlog of work coming into the second quarter. As witnessed for several quarters now, we continue to grow our parts and services revenue faster than the market as a whole. According to CCC, collision and liability related auto claims on a national basis were up only 1.7% in the second quarter of 2017, following a 1.1% increase in the first quarter. So, our growth of 2.8% in Q2 reflects a 110 basis point outperformance, and gives us confidence that we continue to do the right things to serve our customers. Importantly, the growth in our core collision product continues to be stronger than the North American average as whole. We also had an excellent quarter in terms of the sale of salvage mechanical parts, and the PGW aftermarket glass business, which we owed for a full year as of April 21, 2017, was a solid contributor to the overall North American organic growth rate during the remainder of the quarter. The total loss rates continue to increase, reaching 19% at the end of the second quarter. CCC believes this increase is the result of the mix effect and hangover of an older vehicle fleet and a slight uptick in the vehicles one- to three-years old being deemed a total loss. It's important to note that cars in both these age groups are not representative of our collision sweet spot of 3 to 10 years. So despite this slight uptick in the total loss rate, we don't believe that it had a material impact to our current business. Additionally, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, miles driven in the United States were up 1.2% on a nationwide basis in April. But miles driven in the Northeast and South Gulf regions were only up 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively. So clearly, we are, again, witnessing significant regional differences in some of our key markets where miles driven are trending below the national average. During the second quarter, the impact of acquisitions added 2.9% to parts and services growth in North America, with most of that reflecting a few weeks of revenues related to the acquisition of the PGW aftermarket glass business. We lost about 20 basis points of growth due to currencies, primarily related to the Canadian dollar. We purchased 77,000 vehicles for dismantling at our full-service wholesale operations, a 6.9% increase over the comparable quarter of the prior year. The auctions continue to be healthy and we have access to the vehicles, we believe, we need to continue the growth of our recycling operations. For our North American aftermarket business, we have been expanding both our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 9.1% and 17.6%, respectively, year-over-year in the quarter. In our self-service business, we acquired $141,000 lower-cost self-service and crush-only vehicles, reflecting a 2.2% increase over the second quarter of last year. Our self-serve team has proactively managed the fluctuations in the scrap market by quickly adjusting the cost of goods sold relative to the current market conditions and having an operating culture focused on cost management. Overall, I'm happy with our operating performance of the North American business. During the quarter, gross margins improved 40 basis points compared to the prior year, in part due to enhanced productivity of our salvage operations, wherein the revenue per car increased at a faster rate than the car cost, reflecting refinements to buying algorithms and an emphasis on inventorying more parts per car and also holding the cars a bit longer. I'm particularly happy with the ongoing benefits we are experiencing with our productivity initiatives. Although you won't see the same year-over-year improvement in margins because the major benefits from the procurement initiative were first realized about a year ago, we continue to benefit from the ongoing savings which are estimated to be about $9 million on a quarterly basis compared to the base 2015 levels. With respect to Roadnet, for the month ended June 2017, we were operating at a 97% usage level across our fleet with year-over-year increases of 60% in terms of miles dispatched, 28% for stops dispatched, and 34% for routes dispatched. I'm particularly pleased that we have reduced our missed service windows by 53%, which today stands at less than 1%, another validation of our continued commitment of stellar delivery service to our customers. Lastly, we integrated three PGW branches into an existing LKQ facility during the first quarter, added another in Q2, and have completed two more early in Q3. We have an additional seven-branch consolidation scheduled for the remainder of the year, which will bring the total consolidations to 13 for 2017, and this will help the cost structure on a going forward basis. Moving to the other side of the Atlantic, our European segment achieved total revenue growth of 7.9%. Importantly, organic revenue for parts and services witnessed growth of 4.1% on a reported basis and 7.1% on a same-day basis. Remember, we lost up to two selling days in many European countries due to the Easter holiday falling in Q2 this year compared to the first quarter of last year. Now that Rhiag has reached its anniversary date and it was included in the results of operations for the full quarter, both this year and last year, we are going to report the growth on a segment basis only, just like North America, as opposed to on a business-by-business basis. What I can tell you is that on a same-day basis, the organic growth of ECP and Sator were above 5%, while Rhiag was in double digits, which we believe are terrific results for all of the entities. Acquisitions added an additional 10% revenue growth in Europe during the second quarter of 2017, but the weaker currencies, when compared to the 2016 rates, resulted in a 6.2% decline, largely due to the significant year-over-year decline in the pound sterling. The UK team performed extremely well in light of a challenging macroeconomic environment. The stagnant wage growth in the UK, when combined with currency-induced inflation resulting from the Brexit referendum has created a challenging operating environment for our UK business. Despite those challenges, our team remains focused on driving market share and continuously creating a great service experience for our customers. In particular, our collision offering in the UK provides insurance carriers an attractive value proposition as they face the same dynamics as domestic carriers with increased repair cost and pressure on cycle time. Our Netherlands operation recorded some of the highest same-day growth since we bought the business and is reflective of the ongoing integration of the tuck-in acquisitions we've completed over the past few years. And the double-digit same-day revenue growth at Rhiag is a result of better-than-expected performance in Italy, and a growing, yet very old car park in Eastern Europe, which creates excellent demand for the types of parts we distribute. During Q2, we opened up a total of 13 new branches in Europe, including one new location in the UK and 12 new locations in Eastern Europe. Over the past 12 months, we have opened 47 new branches in Europe, including seven in the UK and 40 in Eastern Europe. With respect to Tamworth the warehouse, our T2 project, I am pleased to report that ECP is still on plan with the implementation process and is almost finished with system testing. Product stocking at T2 started the last week of June. And this past Tuesday, we had the very first shipments out of the facility to just a couple of our branch locations. We continue to believe we'll be fully operational at T2 by the end of the year and the project remains on time and on budget. With respect to Andrew Page, as anticipated during our call last quarter, the UK Competition and Markets Authority, or CMA, has initiated a Phase 2 investigation of our acquisition of this company. We anticipate this review will be completed by year-end. We remain optimistic and believe that the evidence supports that our acquisition of Andrew Page will not lead to any material lessening of competition. But the end decision rests with the CMA and we could be required to divest some or all of the business. While the CMA investigation is ongoing, we have been required to operate under what is called a hold separate order, which means we are not able to integrate the companies, and ECP and Andrew Page must continue to operate as competitors in the marketplace. As a result, we are very limited as to what we can do to improve the business as we cannot eliminate any of the duplicative expense. We know there are solid synergies and customer benefits available if we can put the companies together, but until we get the requisite clearance, our hands are tied and Andrew Page will continue to be unprofitable. The overall outlook for our European segment and its strategy remain favorable in terms of our ability to grow both organically and through acquisition. According to statistics included in the European Automobile Manufacturers' report, we currently operate in countries representing about 50% of the European car park, including operations in four of the five fastest-growing car parks. So, we have plenty of runway to grow. And finally, our Specialty segment continued to perform very well, achieving organic revenue growth of about 5.9% during the second quarter of 2017. Truck and SUV sales, which benefit our Specialty segment, remains very healthy. Additionally, the performance of our Specialty segment was aided by the strength in the RV market, which is benefiting from increased consumer confidence, the retiring of America's workforce, attractive financing options and lower fuel prices. According to RV industry statistics, in 2016, total RV unit sales reached an all-time high, and related accessories represent key product categories for our Specialty segment. To help support the growth of this segment, we are in the process of adding a new 450,000 square foot Specialty Parts Distribution Center in California that is expected to come online in the second quarter of 2018. Our corporate development activities have continued in earnest as evidenced by our acquisition of seven businesses during the second quarter. Most of these were smaller companies with a combined annualized revenue of about $68 million. These include a salvage operation in Pennsylvania, a transmission rebuilder in Atlanta to augment the greenfield capacity we are bringing on in Oklahoma City; three small aftermarket distributors acquired by ECP, including another distributor in the Republic of Ireland; one small aftermarket distributor in Italy, and another small automotive paint business in Sweden. In addition, on July 3, the first business day of the third quarter, Sator closed on the acquisition of four aftermarket distribution businesses in Belgium that will help to solidify our competitive position in that market. And on July 10, Sator acquired a small garage management software company. So, the pace of activity continues to be brisk. We will continue to look for opportunities to grow the breadth and depth of our customer offerings through the addition of successful, well-managed businesses to our family of companies around the globe, and the pipeline of potential transactions is robust. And now, I will turn the discussion over to Michael Clark, who will run through the details of the segment results. Michael S. Clark - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone on the call today. While I've been working behind the scenes on our quarterly calls for quite a while, this is my first time speaking to the group, and I'm excited for the opportunity. Nick touched on a few of the key financial statistics, and I will take you through the more detailed review of the consolidated and segment margins for the quarter. Nick described the trends behind our reported revenue of $2.46 billion, so I'll start with our consolidated gross margin. As noted on slide 13 of the presentation, the consolidated gross margin percentage was flat quarter-over-quarter at 39.3%. The result reflects improved margins in North America, mostly on the salvage side, offset by roughly equal decreases in our Europe and Specialty segments. We saw about a 40 basis point increase in our operating expenses, largely due to our Europe segment. We continue to experience negative impact from costs associated with the Andrew Page acquisition. Until we receive clearance from the CMA, we are unable to implement a full integration, which has left us with some cost inefficiencies. Segment EBITDA totaled $306 million for the second quarter, reflecting a $6 million or 2.1% increase over the comparable quarter of 2016. As mentioned, there were fewer selling days in Europe in the second quarter of 2017 compared to last year, which would negatively impact our segment EBITDA dollars this period. As a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was 12.4%, a 60 basis point decrease over the 13% recorded last year. During the second quarter of 2017, we experienced a $7 million decrease in restructuring costs compared to the prior year, but a $1 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, largely due to recent acquisitions. With that, operating income for the second quarter of 2017 was up about $12 million or roughly 5% when compared to the same period last year. Interest expense was flat quarter-over-quarter, as we had similar average borrowings and effective interest rates. Non-operating items were favorable by about $5 million compared to last year, as Q2 2017 includes a $3 million gain on bargain purchase, primarily related to adjustments to the Andrew Page net asset values. We pulled this gain out of adjusted income from continuing operations and diluted EPS. Other non-operating income includes foreign exchange gains and losses and various ancillary income, such as late payment fees. Non-operating income and expenses are difficult to forecast from quarter-to-quarter, so I caution on projecting future periods based on the Q2 results. Pre-tax income during the second quarter of 2017 was $226 million, up $18 million or 8.4% compared to the prior year. Our net tax rate during the second quarter was 33.6%, down from 33.7% in 2016. The 2017 rate reflected an effective rate of 35.15% and some discrete items that reduced the reported rate, the most significant of which is the excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. The effective rate, excluding discrete items, of 35.15% is 40 basis points higher than Q2 2016 due to an increase in the effective rate for our Europe segment, resulting from tax law changes and a shift in the geographic mix of our European earnings. Diluted EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter was $0.49, which was up 8.9% compared to the $0.45 reported last year. Adjusted EPS, which excludes restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, the tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation, and other one-time unusual items, was $0.53 in the second quarter of 2017 versus $0.52 last year, reflecting a 2% improvement. Stronger scrap and other metals prices added about $0.01 to EPS in the second quarter of 2017. And as anticipated, the translation impact of currencies had a negative impact of about $0.01 during the quarter. With the U.S. dollar weakening and having passed the anniversary of the Brexit vote, the translation impact of currency should have a lesser impact on the remainder of the year than what we experienced in the first half of 2017. And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the second quarter of 2017 increased to $1.207 billion, up 6.1% over 2016. Gross margins in North America during the second quarter were 43.9%, up 40 basis points over the 43.5% reported last year. The strong results reflected the benefits of procurement initiatives in both our salvage and aftermarket operations, partially offset by reductions due to higher customer discounts in our aftermarket business and a decrease in our self-service margin. While scrap steel remained a favorable factor for this business, it was less impactful on the second quarter of 2017 than it was in 2016. With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we lost approximately 50 basis points of margin compared to last year. We saw benefit of about 30 basis points from eliminating shared PGW corporate costs after the sale of the OEM business in March. Outside of this benefit, overhead expenses were up 80 basis points, of which about a little less than half came from personnel-related costs. The remainder of increase relates to various individually insignificant items, mostly in selling, general and administrative costs. In total, segment EBITDA for North America during the second quarter of 2017 was $174 million, a 4.6% increase over last year. As a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was 14.4% in Q2 of 2017, down 20 basis points from the 14.6% reported in the comparable period of the prior year. While the margin was down slightly in Q2, 14.4% is on the high end of the range of what we've seen in North America over the last five years. Looking at slide 18, scrap prices were up 9% over the last year and moved about 4% higher in Q2 relative to Q1. As noted previously, the impact of scrap prices was a benefit to Q2 EPS, but was seen mostly in April and had minimal minimum impact in the subsequent months. So assuming prices stay at current levels, we will not get the same level of positive impact during the remainder of the year. Moving on to our European segment, total revenue in the second quarter accelerated to $890 million from $824 million, an 8% increase. Q2 is the first quarter in which we had a fully comparable period for Rhiag. Thus, the mix impact in gross margin and overhead expenses related to Rhiag that we discussed on prior calls is no longer a factor in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. However, we won't annualize Andrew Page until Q4, so this acquisition continues to have an impact on the comparisons to prior period. Gross margins in Europe decreased to 37.2% in Q2, a 20 basis point decline over the comparable period of 2016. Gross margins at Rhiag had a 40 basis point negative impact, which is attributable to higher customer rebates, contributing to lower net prices. Our ECP operations had a 20 basis point negative impact due to higher costs related to the new national distribution center, or T2. Our other European operations, primarily the Sator business, had a net favorable 40 basis point quarter-over-quarter impact. We're emphasizing procurement initiatives across our European organization, including negotiating consolidated rebate and discount programs with suppliers, and we expect the yield benefits late in the year and into 2018. With respect to operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, we experienced a 140 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis quarter-over-quarter, and 30 basis points sequentially. The factors negatively impacting operating leverage remain similar to the prior quarter : the inclusion of Andrew Page, which is still losing money while we operate under the hold separate order; increased facility costs related to additional branches in the UK; and higher personnel costs in our Sator business. European segment EBITDA totaled $84 million, a 7% decrease over last year. As shown on slide 21, relative to the second quarter of 2016, the pound declined 11% and the euro declined 3% against the dollar. On a constant currency basis, EBITDA in Europe declined by just 1%. As a percentage of revenue, European segment EBITDA in the second quarter of 2017 was 9.4% versus 10.9% last year, 150 basis point decline. Approximately 90 basis points of the decline relates to the impact of the Andrew Page and the incremental costs in 2017 related to T2. Having fewer selling days, both relative to the prior-year quarter and sequentially, negatively impacted our leverage on fixed costs compared to both periods. Turning to our Specialty segment, revenue for the second quarter totaled $363 million, a 5.5% increase over the comparable quarter of 2016. Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the second quarter decreased 90 basis points compared to last year, largely due to unfavorable product mix with a smaller negative effect from higher warehouse costs capitalized in inventory due to the two new distribution centers added in 2016. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in Specialty were down about 170 basis points as we continue to see the leverage from integrating recent acquisitions into our existing network. We're very pleased with the cost savings we've achieved in this segment over the last year. Segment EBITDA for Specialty was $49 million, up 12% from Q2 of 2016, and as a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was up 80 basis points to 13.4%. Specialty is a highly seasonal business and the second quarter is typically our strongest. Consistent with the normal seasonal patterns, you should assume these margins will moderate as we move through the back half of the year. Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on slide 24, you will note that our cash flow from continuing operations during the first half of 2017 was approximately $366 million as we experienced strong earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. Through June 2017, we deployed $184 million of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $88 million to fund capital expenditures and a net $96 million to fund acquisitions and other investments. The largest capital changes reflect a pay down of $423 million debt, largely funded by the net proceeds derived from the sale of the PGW glass manufacturing business in March. Going to slide 25, as of June 30, we had about $3 billion of total debt outstanding and approximately $300 million of cash, resulting in net debt of about $2.7 billion or 2.5 times last 12-month EBITDA. We have more than $1.4 billion of availability on our line of credit, which together with our cash yields total liquidity of over $1.7 billion. At this point, I will turn the call back over to Nick to cover the guidance update. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Michael. With respect to our guidance for 2017, we've made some updates based on where we are sitting at the halfway mark of the year. Organic growth for parts and services has been narrowed to 4% at the low end and 5.25% on the high end, reflective of the fact that we're sitting at 4.1% for the first six months. Likewise, we have narrowed the range for our adjusted diluted earnings per share from $1.84 at the low end to $1.92 on the high end, increasing the midpoint to $1.88 per share. The corresponding adjusted income from continuing operations is $570 million to $595 million, while cash flow from operations has been revised up to $620 million to $650 million. Capital spending has remained constant at the $200 million to $225 million range. The updated guidance reflects an effective tax rate of 35.15% and exchange rates in the back half of the year of $1.30 for the pound sterling, $1.15 for the euro and scrap at $150 per ton. As it relates to our effort to bring on a new Chief Financial Officer, the response to our search process was terrific and we have had the opportunity to meet with some incredibly talented professionals over the past few months. Whittling down the talent has been hard, but we are in the final phase of the process, and I expect we will have a final decision in the near future. In summary, Q2 was a solid all-around quarter accentuated by an uptick in organic growth across all of our segments. The overall results reflect the collective efforts of our more than 40,000 employees around the globe, who are working hard to serve our customers each and every day. I would like to thank each of them for their dedication. Finally, I would like to thank Rob Wagman for his efforts during his 19 years at LKQ. As you know, Rob stepped down on June 1, and is now serving as Executive Advisor with a focus on corporate development activities. Rob's contributions during his tenure were countless, and I look forward to his continued insights as we move forward. And operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge. Your line is open. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Great. Thank you, and good morning, gentlemen. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Jamie. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : And I want to add as well, thanks to Rob, if he's listening, and really have enjoyed working him over the past many years, and wish him the best. If I may, organic growth, North America, first. It seems, when we look at the broader units in operation sort of in this cycle that we're finally getting to a point where you're getting a bigger supply of that sort of three- to four-year-old segment that off-lease vehicle, if you will, as a proxy. I would imagine that that should continue for the remainder of this year and into next year. But wanted to hear from you guys, as you are seeing parts orders coming in and you're serving customers, are you getting a sense that there is growing number of orders for those sort of younger vehicles? And so, even though, compares are easier in the back half that maybe there is an additional tailwind from that units in operation sort of flurry? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Sure. So, a couple of questions you got built in there, Jamie. But all-in-all, we are expecting that the car park and the age of the car park will be a gentle tailwind as we move forward. In our standard information that we provide the investment community, our standard investor relations deck, we include a slide, as you know, that is what we call our collision sweet spot of 3 to 10 years. And for the first time in many years, the number of cars that fall into that age bracket in 2017 is actually ticking up a little bit. Now, it's not significant, so we don't anticipate any major movements here in 2017, but at least it's movement in the right direction, I believe, from about 101 million units to 103 million units. Then we get another more substantial uptick in 2018 and 2019. So, there is no doubt that we've sold the better part of 52 million vehicles in this country over the \u2013 new vehicles over the last three years, as those vehicles begin to come in to our 3- to 10-year sweet spot, there will be more cars that will need the types of parts that we sell. We do the best we can to track the vintage of parts that we're selling. We haven't seen a material shift, if you will, thus far. But again, we do believe that as the number of cars in a sweet spot grow that that will be a gentle tailwind to our business. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Okay. Great. And then my last one, if I may ask, on Europe sort of a similar question. I know the business over there is a little different. But can you help us frame kind of where the car park in Europe is within the cycle and how we should think about that? And then a point of clarification, I think I heard you say Rhiag was growing at a double-digit rate. Want to clarify if you were talking organically. And so, as we think about that coming into the organic base for the third quarter, if that's going to be a double-digit contributor and we should take that into account in our models? Thanks. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So, with respect to the European organic, again, the business there is differently because we are adding branches, they get closer to the customer base. You have to remember that in the European business, we need to be within 30 to 60 minutes of delivery time between our branches and the customers in order to fulfill their expectations. Part of the way we do that is to add new branch operations to get close to the customer base. That's how we grow actually our market share, if you will. So, some of the growth in Europe comes from, what I'll call, the organic growth of the more mature branches. Some of the growth comes from having just more dots on the map, right. And so Rhiag \u2013 and this is all same day, to make it simple and take the calendar out of the mix, right? Rhiag was just north of 10%, on a same-day organic basis. About 55% to 60% of that was the contributions for what we would call the more mature stores. And then the balance of it was the impact of those 40 new branches that we've added in Eastern Europe over the last 12 months. If you move back to the ECP, where organic growth was just shy of 6% on a same-day basis, about 85% of that came from the stores that we've had for more than a year and about 0.9% of growth came from those seven new stores that we added over the last 12 months. The car park in Europe, it's aging a little bit as well, but it's \u2013 you've got a couple different car parks in Europe right. You have Eastern Europe where the average age of a car is still 9.5, maybe 9.6 years old and then you've got Eastern Europe where the average age of car is over 14.5 years old. So there's some very different dynamics based on the geography. But the car park is continuing to grow. It's growing faster in Eastern Europe than it is in Western Europe. That's said, in 2016, the number of auto registrations in the UK hit an all-time high. So, there is a good backdrop for our businesses as we continue to move forward. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Well, thank you so much for that detail. I appreciate. The 55% to 60% of the mature stores in Rhiag, though, can you give us a number in terms of what they're growing at? I know the bend is above 10%... Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Well, yeah... James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : ...in the mature stores? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: So, it's 5.6% to 6%. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Understood. Thank you again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Nick, for taking my questions. Can we dig a little bit into the collision business, and the parts and service numbers in the U.S. versus your relative position? So, if we think of the business as sort of 65%-35% collision versus mechanical, can you give us some flavor on what was happening in that mix given that there is two different sweet spots and collision is getting better, but mechanical probably gets a little worse? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Actually, no real shift, Michael, in our, kind of, if you want to think, product line revenue or growth. I mean, the reality is the core collision product, think about Keystone (41:43) in a box, if you will, the core aftermarket product grew higher than the 2.8% total. Our salvage mechanical parts, engines, transmissions and some of the other big mechanical pieces, right, they were above the 2.8% as well. Again, as has been the case now for several quarters, we do have some product lines that are soft. We talked about this in the past. Aluminum wheels, paint, cooling continue to be soft. But again, there has been no major shift in kind of the relative contribution of salvage versus aftermarket or mechanical versus collision. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, we dug into the sort of a hot items like bumpers, mirrors, doors, they're showing really good trends and that's clearly a sign of, you're still gaining share relative to the market? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. And again, the fact that our organic was at 2.8% and total repairable claims are only up 1.7%, that gives us confidence that we are continuing to, at a minimum, hold our own and likely gaining share... Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Absolutely. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then if I switch gears to Europe, if Andrew Page got closed December 31 and T2 comes on as planned, how do you think about what that margin \u2013 the favorable margin implication of that is in 2018? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. Well, so last year, in 2016, Andrew Page hit us for about $0.02 a share. As we've indicated this year, we think it's going to hit us for $0.03 a share. It's going to take some time. Once we get our \u2013 the ability to truly mange Andrew Page, it's not going to be an overnight flip, but ultimately we will be able to rationalize the way we believe all those losses and ultimately get it into a profitable situation. And so, yeah, I'd call, $0.02 to $0.03 of incremental value potentially next year. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Well, that's just getting to zero, right, I mean, as opposed to \u2013 take it from a loss of zero is $0.03? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Correct. Now, we anticipate we're going to be able to get it into profitability. But again, that doesn't happen overnight, Michael. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Got it. The leverage is greater than $0.03, because you'd start working towards your overall margins, which are prior to this sort of $0.10, $0.11. So that's, if I go from whatever the negative is, equated to $0.03 multi \u2013 three, five years plan, I head towards $0.11. That's what I'm playing with. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So, the key is going to be, we're \u2013 we continue to be optimistic, we continue to feel strongly in our perspectives. At the end of the day, it's how many of the branches that we've acquired are we going to be able to keep. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Does your case get made stronger, because of Uni-Select's Parts Alliance acquisition, now that there is a well-capitalized bigger player, owns the 160 branches? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Probably not, because the competitors on the street corner are still the same competitors on the street corner. They're just owned by somebody else. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then I presume that the Benelux transactions are key component from going from three to two-step and how quickly can that happen? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So, just as we did in the Netherlands, where we brought some of the larger distributors that we were selling to, we brought some of our larger customers, the flip from three-step to two-step, that's really what the acquisition of the four businesses in Belgium were all about. They have a good market share and that will allow us basically to get to the last mile for the garage which is what \u2013 we were missing that. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And that integration to make that switch now that they're owned is relatively immediate, I mean, like within 90 days? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Well, again, nothing happens quite that fast, Michael. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, yeah. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: But over the next year, just like over the last year, as we've integrated the Netherlands tuck-in acquisitions, over a year, you begin to move it a little bit and, ultimately, it'll look like the one big seamless enterprise in Belgium. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. And then last question for me on opportunities to further consolidate market. So, you're not in Germany, France, Spain. There's big family businesses in Germany. There's two big businesses owned by private equity in France and lots of little companies in Spain. It appears that the bigger companies in France and Germany are being acquisitive too. So, couple of questions on this front. Are they being rational when they're being acquisitive and valuations are staying within reasonable ranges? And two, what's your opportunity, if they're showing a \u2013 they're being acquisitive, what's what your opportunity to penetrate those markets? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So, again, we haven't bumped up against the big French companies in acquisitions kind of head-to-head, so I can't comment directly as to whether they're being rational or not. They're good companies, they're solid companies, they've got good capital structures, right. Whether they decide to sell is going to be up to their private equity owners. With respect to some of the other countries, Germany, Spain, if you will, we believe that given our presence in the marketplace, we will have an opportunity to at least look at those businesses if and when they come to market. And we think that with our base of operations, we have as much, if not more, ability to create synergies than anyone else in Europe. But we have to wait. Again, we can't force somebody to come to market. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: No problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is open. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about the UK collision business gaining some traction as a cost saving initiative. Could you tell us what we are doing in collision revenues and maybe the growth rate over there? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So, the collision business, relative to the ECP is still relatively small, right? It's running somewhere on the order of \u00a350 million, \u00a360 million. But it's growing nicely. Collision in the UK, I think, was up about 10% in Q2 over Q2 of last year. So, still outperformance from a growth perspective. The key there is, ultimately, the insurance companies in Europe are no different than the insurance companies in the U.S. And they've got the same pressure to try and get claims costs down. And part of the way they do that is through parts, and part of the way they do that is through cycle time. I mean, we have, as you know, ongoing pilots and programs with 18 of the larger insurance companies over in the UK, and a couple of them have told us that, as a result of our ability to get them parts and get them parts quickly, they're seeing their cycle times begin to move down. So, we think that, ultimately, that bodes well for our ability to create an ever meaningful business in collision parts over \u2013 not just in the UK where we are today, but ultimately to bring that on to Continent as well. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then in the U.S., obviously, Specialty was a pretty solid and it looks like Stag and Coast deal have worked well on the RV side. Would you give us the mix of RV versus vehicle performance parts within Specialty? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: We don't disclose that, Bret. But if you backed into kind of what Coast was almost exclusively RV, and Stag was exclusively RV. So, you're \u2013 probably a little bit north of a third. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. And then, I guess, in a collision publication, not too long ago, there was mentioned that maybe you're getting into some distribution of OE parts, with Fiat Chrysler as a partner. Could you comment on that initiative at all? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: We don't comment on any particular customer and the like, because of agreements that we have with some of our customers, at all. But the reality is, is we're always looking to expand our distribution of parts. I think there is a lot of folks in the marketplace who recognize the power that we have as being the largest distributor of collision-related parts in North America and that there is opportunities for them to leverage our distribution background. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. So you are doing some OE parts, I guess, is the answer? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: We are. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. And I guess one last question, I shouldn't even bother to ask the State Farm question, but anything going on with State Farm? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: No new news. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : All right. Thank you. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Well, thank you, Bret. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Good afternoon. Good morning. Michael, nice to hear you on the call as well. I wanted to follow up on a prior question, regarding T2 and sort of the redundant costs you're facing in 2017 and how that might look in 2018 when those redundant costs roll off? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Craig, this is Nick. Good morning. As we've stated now going back to the mid 2015, right, we are incurring costs at T2 even though \u2013 well, at least up until last Tuesday hadn't shipped a single product out of the facility because we've been paying rent and we're paying utilities, we're staffing up with labor and the like. And in the meantime, we're keeping the other two facilities that will ultimately get shut down, they're running full bore. So we're still paying the rents and the utilities and the labor and everything else there. Ultimately, once we know that T2 is operating exactly as it needs to be and there is little to no risk of any fulfillment issues as it relates to keeping our 200 plus branches stock full on a daily basis, we will shut down two of other facilities. And so, we will save the rent and the labor and the like. We quantified that the impact of T2 was $0.03 last year, another $0.02 this year, so $0.05 in total. We won't begin to rationalize the other two facilities until 2018. So, we won't get the entire nickel back next year, but we will get, we believe, some good portion of that back. And then by 2019, there should be the rest of the positive benefits. Michael S. Clark - LKQ Corp.: Craig, this is Michael. Just of note, the impact of T2 is transitioning from below gross margin to above gross margin as we move it into operation. So, you start to see the impact more on the gross margin than just on EBITDA. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. And then with respect to Europe, I'm guessing that some of your competitors there think of LKQ as their potential exit strategy given your M&A strategy. But I wonder to what extent you've got the scale necessary to attack some of those markets organically, at least where you have nearby operations? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Probably, we can go both ways. I mean if you think about what we've done with Rhiag, okay, we bought a really big business, and yet we've added more than 40 additional branches, which is a program that we brought to the table more than what they were doing on their own. I always believe that it's not just what you buy that's important, but what you do with what you buy, that's really important, and the ability to add branches is critical. We can go into some of those other locations and try and greenfield, if you will, and just add branches. Part of it is, though \u2013 creating a presence is hard and that would be a long road. So, it'd probably be a combination, Craig, of both acquired entities to get a base and then to continue to build the branch network, which we can do on our own once we have a base. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. And then last question from me, just in terms of North American organic growth, what is embedded in your forecast for 2018? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So, if you take a look at \u2013 we narrowed the range based on where we are. The reality is, at the low end of the range, at 4%, if North American organic isn't around where it was in Q2, that will cover us for the low-end. At the high end, North American organic would probably need to move close to 4% in the back half of the year. So, longer looking, we would anticipate that North American organic, obviously, would continue to move up, particularly if we get any sort of normal winter weather pattern in 2018. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, that helps. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Ben. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: If I could follow up on the North American organic growth side, recognizing that you have one less selling day in 3Q, you saw a nice sequential acceleration from 1Q to 2Q. Is it your expectation that growth should be similar to 2Q on a headline basis, or is there the potential for sequential further acceleration on headline front (57:06)? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Let's talk on a same-day basis, because that takes the calendar out of the mix. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: On a same-day basis, we think that Q2 kind of serves as a baseline. We're cognizant of the fact that as we move though the back half of the year, we get slightly easier comps, because as you recall, the organic growth comps in the back half last year were still coming in. So, I would say, a baseline that's slightly moving north in the back half of the year from a North American organic perspective. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, similarly, in 2Q, is there any color you could provide around cadence within the quarter as well as geographic disparities in performance? I know you touched on that in prior quarters that there was quite a bit of geographic disparity. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So, the Northeast and the kind of the Midwest, which are kind of key winter states, continue to be a little bit behind the curve on a relative basis to the overall LKQ footprint as a central region, and the West continue to be a bit stronger. Again, people got to remember, this is a big country. And what happens in the Northeast could be completely different than what's going on in the Southwest, right. And from a cadence perspective, we don't disclose results, Ben, as you know, but we're comfortable with where we're headed into Q3. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: That's great. And then just one last one for me, as it relates to your M&A strategy. You've steadily reduced leverage on the balance sheet as we've moved into the year. How much more do you think you need to delever the balance sheet before you feel comfortable making a major acquisition if the opportunity arises? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: If the opportunity arises, we're ready to go today. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Great. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: The reality is, is we're going to pay off or continue to pay down our debt, because we generate a lot of cash. And it's not a question of waiting to do an acquisition to get our \u2013 because we want to get our leverage down, it's really waiting for those acquisitions to come to market. We don't control the timing there. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Understood. Thanks, and good luck. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. Hi, Nick. Just on... Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Samik. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Morning. Just on the North America segment, just wanted to get your thoughts. I know the aftermarket here has been a bit more challenging than years past, but do you see an opportunity to maybe accelerate some of the cost optimization plans you had for maybe like \u2013 initially scheduled for next year and excluding those to sort of pull ahead the earnings growth, is there some plans regarding that? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So, the reality is we're trying to continue to grow and optimize all of our businesses, whether it's on the salvage side or on the aftermarket side. Again, the core products on the collision space are actually performing quite well. As Michael indicated in his comments, the margins \u2013 gross margins in aftermarket were down just a tad. And part of that, quite frankly, has to do with \u2013 bigger customers get bigger discounts, and as the MSOs continue to get larger and larger and create a bigger piece of the pie, that's actually good for us, because they use a lot of the parts that we sell. On the operating side, again, we're trying to do the best we can to optimize our overall cost and whether it's things like the procurement initiatives, which were largely through Roadnet, which is \u2013 as I indicated in my comments, we think will continue to add benefits. Again Roadnet, it's not salvage versus aftermarket, it's our total parts, North America, but we will be able to get leverage there. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Got it. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Is that helpful? Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Yeah. Defiantly. And just thinking about Europe and how much of headroom you have there still in terms of store expansions. I know on slide 19, you sort of specify what your store count is for ECP and Rhiag, and that's grown considerably since last year. How should we think about sort of what the long-term target would be for store count for like ECP and Rhiag, just to get a sense of how much growth is left just in terms of store expansion? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, the ECP question, Samik, is really going to depend on where we end up with Andrew Page and how many of those 106 branches that we've acquired we'll be able to keep, because assuming if we are able to keep most, all those, the need then to add incremental branches to be able to get closer to the customers goes down a bit. In Eastern Europe, where we've added those (1:02:55) branches over the last 12 months, we are in the early days there. That's a market where the car park is growing, the age of the cars is really old and so we sell \u2013 the demand for the types of parts we sell is really high. The organic growth there, we think, is going to be good for years to come and there's the ability to add, call it, 10 to 12 branches a quarter for a long time. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. And just finally, clarification, I know in the Specialty segment, you mentioned a negative mix this quarter. Can you just provide some more details on what was that? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Could you ask that again? Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : The negative mix in the Specialty segment which impacted gross margin this quarter, I believe that was part of the prepared remarks. Michael S. Clark - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, there's a negative mix related to the sales channels we use, a little bit more on the drop ship side which has lower margins. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. Great. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to the presenters. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. We do appreciate the time that you spent with us. Hopefully, this was helpful to everybody, and we look forward to chatting again in about 90 days. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Baird Bret Jordon - Jefferies Ben Bienvenu - Stephens James Albertine - Consumer Edge Research Brian Butler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co David Stratton - Great Lakes Review Operator : Welcome to LKQ Corporation's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. I'll now turn the call over to Joe Boutross, LKQ's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joe Boutross : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Michael Clark, Vice President of Finance and Controller. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com. For our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide deck presentation for this call. Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.

And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Nick Zarcone. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. I am delighted to share the results of our most recent quarter with you. But before I jump into the review, I would like to introduce Varun Laroyia, our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As many of you read from our press release in September. Prior to joining to LKQ on October 1, Varun was the Chief Financial Officer of CBRE's Global Workplace Solutions Business. A multi-billion full service real estate outsourcing firm with approximately 40,000 employees in over 50 countries. So from a size, scale and level of complexity it was quite similar to LKQ. Prior to joining CBRE in 2015, Varun spent close to 10 years at Johnson Controls in a variety of senior financial positions around the globe. And prior to that, he held diverse financial positions both overseas and in the US, at Gateway Computers, General Electric and KPMG. In short, Varun brings significant global financial and operational expertise to LKQ will be an outstanding addition to LKQ's unique people culture and I'm thrilled to have him on the team. Now onto the quarter; all in all we believe this was a strong quarter for our company and we're very pleased with the results. As noted on Slide 4, consolidated revenue was $2,466 million and 11.7% increase over the $2.2 billion recorded in the third quarter of last year. Total revenue growth from parts and services was 11.4%. Importantly, organic growth in parts and services was 3.2% on a reported basis and after taken into account the impact of one pure selling day in 2017 compared to 2016. Global organic growth was a solid 4.7% on a per day basis. Very few companies in our sector are generating organic growth at this level. Income from continuing operations was $122 million an increase of 11.4% as compared to $110 million for the same period of 2016. On an adjusted basis income from continuing operations was $140 million an increase of 11.1%. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.39 in Q3, 2017 as compared to $0.35 for the comparable period of 2016. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.45 compared to $0.41 for the same period last year. Let's turn to some of the operating highlights. All you'll note from Slide 6, total parts and services revenue growth for our North American segment grew 4.3% in third quarter of 2017 compared to the comparable quarter of 2016. Organic revenue growth for parts and services for this segment was 2.5% on a reported basis and after taken into account one less day in North America, organic growth was 4.0% on a per day basis. A particular note, this solid performance during the quarter was achieved notwithstanding the fact that our Houston and Florida markets were confronted with devastating hurricanes. The Houston area experienced upwards of 50-inches of rain in certain areas, resulting in unprecedented levels of flooding. And the winds in Florida created significant damage and knocked out power in many areas for several days. As a result, our eight Houston area locations and in majority of our 79 Florida locations were shut down for a few days resulting in some loss of business both prior to the storms and their subsequent aftermath. Importantly to LKQ, our employees and their families in both markets are safe despite many sustaining damage to their homes and having to deal with the challenges of managing their daily affairs. Fortunately the company didn't experience any significant property or asset loss at any locations in either Texas or in Florida. When taken into account the impact of the storms, we believe organic growth for parts and services on a per day basis would have been even a bit higher if not for these unfortunate events. On the bright side, the negative earnings per share impact from the storms in the quarter was far less than we initially anticipated. As witnessed for several quarters now, we continue to grow our parts and services revenue faster than the market as a whole. Accordingly, to CCC, collision and liability related auto claims on a national basis were actually down four tenths of 1% in the third quarter of 2017, so our per day growth of 4% reflect significant out performance. This growth gives us confidence that we're continuing on the right track by offering our customers products that represents a significant value proposition in the midst of ever increasing repair cost. Our solid revenue growth is also impressive because according to the US Department of Transportation miles driven in the United States during July were up only eight tenths of 1% on a nationwide. With miles driven in the Northeast in South Atlantic regions up only two tenths and four tenths of a 1% respectively. So, when you consider the hurricane impact, negatively repairable claim data and soft growth in miles driven, our North American segment really came through in terms of the top line revenue while importantly reporting the best gross margins and EBITDA margins of any third quarter in the past five years. I could not be more proud of the effort of the team. As I relate to the recent hurricanes, according to CCC there were over 300,000 total loss vehicles between both storms. Similarly, the Hurricane Sandy in 2012, we believe that surge and storm related total loss vehicles creates a dynamics for us that increase the volume of our bidding and procurement efforts at auction and in turn further enhance our inventory levels to continue to growth of our recycling business. Turning to our ongoing intelligent part solution initiative with CCC, the revenue and number of aftermarket purchase orders, process through the CCC platform during the third quarter grew 21% and 21% respectively year-over-year. While we're very encouraged by the progress it's important to recognize this program represents a small part of our North American revenue. Lastly, we integrated five PGW branches into existing LKQ facilities during the third quarter and we have an additional five branch consolidation scheduled for the remainder of the year. And that will bring the total consolidations for the year up to 14. These consolidations will help reduce the cost structure on a going forward basis. Moving to the other side of the Atlantic. Our European segment achieved total revenue growth of 23.8%, importantly organic revenue for parts and services witness growth of 4.4% on a reported basis and 5.6% on a per day basis given we lost one selling day in the quarter. While all the geographies saw strong results the operations in Eastern Europe again led the way with double-digit organic growth. Operations opened for more than a year accounted for about two-thirds of the 5.6% per day organic growth with the impact of new branches accounting for the balance [ph]. Acquisitions added an additional 16.5% revenue growth in Europe during the quarter, while the strengthening Euro resulted in about 3% increase due to foreign exchange. During Q3, our collision parts revenue at ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of over 16%, so a continuation of very robust activity. Also, our UK based industry relations team during the quarter secured four insurance repaired agreements that include a combination of collision parts and paint supplies tied to a specific level of repair volumes mandated through a large number of independently owned body shops throughout the UK, this bodes very well with a continued growth of this product line in the United Kingdom. During the third quarter we opened up total of six branches in Europe, including two new locations in the UK and four in Easter Europe. Also during the quarter, we rebranded seven PR Reilly locations in the Republic of Ireland and they're now on the ECP trading platform. With respect to the Tamworth warehouse project, which we refer to as T2, our team continues to be on plan and within budget. I'm pleased to announce that as of today a 158 of our ECP branches are currently being delivered out of T2 and we expect the full branch network to be serviced out of T2 by the end of November. Following the full branch migration, we will begin the process of rationalizing two of our smaller facilities with one being closed early in 2018 and the other by mid-2018. With respect to Andrew Page, on September 14, the CMA releases provisional findings which indicated that there may be a requirement for us to divest up to 10 of the 99 acquired branches. We're continuing to work with the CMA to address any potential issues with respect to those particular 10 locations. The CMA will announce their final decision on or about November 6. Once issued and assuming the whole separate order is removed or at least relaxed which we think should be the case, our team in the UK will begin to work hard to integrate the operations, but it's important to recognize that integration process is complex, and it will take several quarters to be completed. And finally, our specialty segment continues to perform very well achieving organic revenue growth of about 2.7% during the third quarter and after taken into account the one last selling day, organic growth for specialty with a solid 4.4% on a per day basis. During the quarter, we witnessed continued favorable sales trends for vehicles in our specialty sweet spot namely light trucks, SUVs and RVs. These positive trends were a bit offset by the impact to the hurricanes in Texas and in Florida. Our corporate development activities continued in earnest as evidenced by our acquisition of 11 businesses during the third quarter. These include four aftermarket parts distributors in Belgium, a wholesale distributor of light vehicle parts in Poland, a recycled parts and tire business in Sweden. And automotive workshop business in Sweden, a small specialty parts and accessories distributor in Germany and a full service salvage yard in Kentucky. We also purchased two services orientated businesses including a garage management software business in the Netherlands and a developer of management system software for recreational vehicle dealers in the United States. Also, as announced on Monday we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the aftermarket business of Warn Industries from Dover Corporation. Warn offers a product line of aftermarket winches, hoist and bumpers and has an absolute iconic brand that will enhance the market position of our specialty segment. This transaction is expected to close sometime in the fourth quarter. We continue to look for opportunities to grow the breadth and depth of our customer offerings through the addition of successful, well managed businesses to our family of companies around the globe and the pipeline of potential transactions is robust. And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun and Michael, who will run you through the details of the consolidated and segment financial results. Varun Laroyia : That's great. Thanks Nick and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I'm delighted to be part of the LKQ leadership team and I look forward to sharing our financial results with you for many quarters to come. Over the past few weeks, I had an opportunity to meet with several investors and key stakeholders such as our banking partners, equity analysts, insurance companies and others. In variably, the discussion moved to why I decided to join LKQ? Listen, while a major career change is never simple, it really came down to a few key items. First, I believe the growth potential of LKQ is significant both organic and through acquisitions. It's not very often that one gets an opportunity to join a company that is a clear leader in its core categories and key markets around the globe and a very significant potential to growth further through acquisition, both the customer offering and geographic footprint. Second, the stage at which LKQ is currently fits well into my skill set of having built and operated multi-billion businesses in a variety of sectors and geographies. This affords me the unique opportunity to help build the company into a substantially larger and an even more progressive enterprise in the foreseeable future. And finally, the cultural fit, this aspect was incredibly important for both the company and me. I truly appreciate the transparent culture, the core values and the unwavering integrity of LKQ. Personally, I thrive in such scenarios as it is core to who I am as a person. Each of these elements taken together created an opportunity that I simply couldn't pass out. And now onto the results, Nick touched on a few of the key financial stats. I will take you through the more detailed review of the consolidated results and then I'll turn it over to Michael to address our segment margins for the quarter. Nick described the trends behind our reported revenue of $2.47 billion so I will start with our consolidated gross margin. As noted on Slide 13 of the presentation, the consolidated gross margin percentage was flat quarter-over-quarter at 38.8%. We saw some relatively minor ups and downs across our segments that effectively method out to know year-over-year change. Segment EBITDA total $267 million for the quarter reflecting a $21 million or 8.4% increase over the comparable quarter of 2016. As Nick previously mentioned, there was one fewer selling day in the third quarter of 2017 compared to 2016, which negatively impacted our segment EBITDA dollars this period. As a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was 10.8% versus 11.2% recorded in the third quarter of 2016. We saw a 50 basis point increase in our operating expenses, this was largely due to our European segment as we continue to experience a negative impact from losses associated with the Andrew Page acquisition and higher operating expenses mostly related to distribution in our Sator business. Until we receive final clearance from the CMA, we are unable to begin the process of integrating the Andrew Page and this has left us with certain cost inefficiencies. During the third quarter of 2017, we experienced a $2 million in restructuring cost compared to the prior year, but a $4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense largely due to the recent acquisition. With that operating income for the third quarter of 2017 was about $16 million or roughly up 9% when compared to the same period in 2016. Interest expense was a little less than 2% up quarter-over-quarter as we had similar average borrowings and effective interest rates. Non-operating items were favorable by about $3 million versus prior year as Q3, 2017 included a $1 million gain on bargain purchase primarily related to adjustments to the Andrew Page net asset values. We pull this gain out of adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted EPS. Other non-operating income which increase by approximately $2 million versus Q3, 2016 includes foreign exchange gains and losses and various ancillary income such as late payment fees. Pre-tax income during the third quarter of 2017 was $178 million up $18 million or 11.4% compared to the prior year. And then coming onto taxes, owing to our latest forecast of geographic mix of earnings. We've updated our projected full year 2017 base tax rate down 40 basis points to 34.75% before any discrete items. The update in the forecasted effective tax rate and the discrete benefit of the stock-based compensation resulted in a reported rate of 32.7% in Q3, 2017. The comparable Q3, 2016 reported rate of 31.2% applied the same 34.75% base rate, but benefited from higher discrete stock plan deductions. Diluted EPS from continuing operations for the third quarter were $0.39 which was up 11.4% compared to the $0.35 reported a year ago. Adjusted EPS which excludes restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation and other one-time items was $0.45 in the third quarter of 2017 versus $0.41 last year, reflecting a 9.8% improvement. And finally, strongest scrap and other key metal prices headed about half a penny to EPS in the third quarter of 2017. And as we anticipated, after annualizing the effect of the BREXIT role to the UK, the impact of currencies was minimal during the quarter. And with that, let me turn it over to Michael to give you further details of our three segments. North America, Europe and specialty. Michael Clark : Thank you, Varun and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll take a few minutes to address our three segments. Particularly as it relates to some of the margin dynamics. Going to Slide 16, gross margins in North America during the third quarter were 43.6% up 20 basis points over the 43.4% reported last year. The strong results reflected the benefits of procurements initiatives in our salvage operations and increased margins in our self-service due to rising scraps deals and other metals pricing. Partially offset by reductions in our aftermarket business due to higher customer discounts and input cost. With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment. We improved operating margin by approximately 10 basis points compared to last year. We saw a benefit of about 40 basis points from eliminating shared PGW corporate cost after the sale of the OEM business in March 2017. Outside of this benefit, overhead expenses were up 30 basis points which related to various individually insignificant items mostly in distribution cost. In total segment EBITDA for North America during the third quarter of 2017 was $153 million, a 9.2% increase over last year. As a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was 12.9% in Q3, 2017 up 40 basis points from 12.5% reported last year. While the margin was down sequentially in Q3, we've typically experienced the seasonal dip in the third quarter and as Nick noted 12.9% is on the high end of the range of what we've seen in the third quarter in North America over the last five years. Looking in Slide 18, scrap prices were up 37% over last year and moved about 8% higher in Q3 relative to Q2. The benefit from scrap reflects a sequential movement in pricing as car cost will generally follow scrap prices higher or lower overtime, so we benefited from the sequential increase in scrap prices this quarter, but to a lesser extent than it experienced in the first quarter of this year. Moving onto our European segment on Slide 19, gross margins were 36.4% in Q3, a 20 basis point improvement over the comparable period of 2016. Our Sator business had a net favorable 60 basis point quarter-over-quarter impact as a result of increased private label sales and to a lesser extent the conversion of the Belgium market to two step distributions. As noted on the last call, we've been working on procurement initiatives across our European organization including negotiating, consolidated rebate and discount programs with suppliers. And those efforts produced a 30 basis point improvement in margin in the quarter. Our ECP operations had a 60 basis point negative effect primarily due to higher cost related to the T2 national distribution center. Gross margins at Rhiag were down versus the prior year which is attributable to lower margins and businesses acquired into the group in the last two quarters. With respect to operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, we experienced the 140 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis quarter-over-quarter and 40 basis point sequentially. The factors negatively impacting operating leverage remained similar to prior quarter, the inclusion of Andrew Page just still losing money while we operate under the whole separate order and higher distribution cost in our Sator business. European segment EBITDA totaled $79 million, a 9.2% increase over last year. As shown on Slide 21, relative to the third quarter of 2016, the Pound Sterling was flat, and the Euro strengthened about 5% against the dollar. On a constant currency basis, EBITDA in Europe increased by 5.8%. As a percentage of revenue European segment EBITDA in the third quarter of 2017 was 8.3% versus 9.4% last year, a 110 basis point decline. Approximately 100 basis points to this decline relates to the impact of Andrew Page and the incremental cost in 2017 related to T2. And a one fewer selling day relative to the prior year quarter also negatively impacted our leverage on fixed cost compared to the prior year. Turning to our specialty segment on Slide 22, gross margins for the third quarter increased 10 basis points compared to last year. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in specialty were also consistent with the prior year down about 10 basis points. We did see an offset in other expenses of 30 basis points due to foreign exchange losses and decreases in miscellaneous income items relative to the prior year. Segment EBITDA for specialty was $35 million up 2.9% from Q3, 2016 and as a percentage of revenue segment EBITDA was down 10 basis points to 10.6%. Specialty is a highly seasonal business and the second quarter is typically our strongest. Consistent with the normal seasonal patterns, we saw a segment EBITDA margin decreased 280 basis points sequentially. Similar to prior years, you should assume a further sequential decline in segment EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. let's move on to capital allocation, as presented on Slide 24, you will note that our cash flow continuing operations during the first nine months of 2017 was approximately $453 million as we experienced strong earnings while investing in working capital to support our growth. Through September, we deployed $382 million of capital to support the growth of our businesses including $132 million to fund capital expenditures and a net $250 million to fund acquisitions in other investments. The largest capital changes reflect the net pay down of almost $350 million of debt largely funded by the proceeds derived from the sale of PGW glass manufacturing business in March 2017. Going to Slide 25, as of September 30, we had about $3.2 billion of total debt outstanding and approximately $275 million of cash. Resulting in net debt of about $2.9 billion or 2.5 times last 12 months EBITDA. We've more than $1.3 billion of availability on our line of credit which together with our cash yields total liquidity of over $1.6 billion. At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Nick to cover the guidance update. Nick Zarcone : Thank you both for that financial overview. With respect to our guidance for 2017, we have made some minor tweaks based on where we're sitting nine months through the year. Organic growth of parts and services has narrowed a bit to 4.0% on the low end, to 4.5% on the high end reflective of the fact that we're at 3.8% for the first nine months. Likewise, we have narrowed the range for our adjusted diluted earnings per share to a $1.86 on the low end and $1.92 at the high end increasing the midpoint to a $1.89 per share. The corresponding adjusted income from continuing operations is $575 million on the low end to $595 million on the high end. Cash flow from operations has been revised to a range of $600 million to $625 million and capital spending has been revised down to a range of $175 million to $200 million. The updated guidance reflects an effective tax rate of 34.75% exchange rates in the fourth quarter of $1.30 for the pound and a $1.18 for the Euro and scrap at approximately $160 per ton. In summary, Q3 was a solid all round quarter. These terrific results reflect the collective efforts of our more than 40,000 employees around the globe who are working hard to serve our customers each and every day. I would like to thank each and every one of them for their dedication and for being LKQ proud. Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan Merkel : So, first question from me. Anything to call out for the slightly slower daily organic growth in Europe and specialty. And then sort of second to that, are you expecting that growth to stabilize in the fourth quarter or pick up a little bit. Nick Zarcone : [Technical difficulty] really happy with the growth rate per day basis, [technical difficulty] on a going forward basis. Ryan Merkel : Okay and then just secondly and the line was kind of coming in and out my phone, I didn't catch all of that answer, but second question ahead was North America gross margin it's sort of trended down since the first quarter. I know it's still up year-to-date but anything going on there and should we assume stable at 43.6% from here. Michael Clark : [Technical difficulty] North America [technical difficulty] to the business look on the chart on [technical difficulty] pattern will likely continue but broadly speaking staying in this range is a good assumption. Ryan Merkel : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Nick, I just wanted to check I know you stopped giving sort of the organic growth numbers for the European business by the three business groups like Rhiag, Sator and ECP, but is there anything you can sort of give in terms of directional ball park numbers about how they're tracking, how they track this quarter. Nick Zarcone : If you - the Rhiag business again because that's where all the Eastern European operations are centered right, have the highest organic growth of the three companies, if you will. ECP, good numbers and kind of net bid single-digit level. Sator was a little bit lower than the exceptional performance they had in Q2, but all in all we're happy with the growth rate. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. And a couple of housekeeping questions, I saw the cash flow from operations came down slightly what led for the guidance for the full year that came down, what led to that? And when I look at the 2017 EPS guide, the only change from the 2Q seems to be the equity method investment sort of block of $0.02 so what's driving that? Nick Zarcone : Yes, so on the operating cash flow, we plan to enhance investment in inventory as we continue to grow our businesses, so we brought OCF down by about $25 million, likewise the capital spending is running a little bit light, so we brought that in at $25 million, so if you want to think about free cash flow the estimate for free cash flow basically stayed the same. Your other question was? Samik Chatterjee : On the change in the 2017 guidance, the change in the midpoint of the guidance seems to be driven by contribution from equity method investment. Nick Zarcone : That relates to [indiscernible]. Samik Chatterjee : Okay and that wasn't expected back in 2Q? Nick Zarcone : We did not explicitly call that out in Q2, you're correct. Samik Chatterjee : Okay, so just a final question for you and how's the acquisition of the aftermarket business of Dover this week, which you mentioned on the call. If I understand correctly, do they have manufacturing operations, and do you intend to keep the manufacturing operations as well? Nick Zarcone : So, you're talking about Warn Industries which we purchased or are going to purchase. We've not yet closed from Dover Corporation. Yes, they have manufacturing operations and yes, we're going to and to keep those manufacturing operations. The specialty leadership team has had kind of vertical integration as part of their strategy for quite some time, this is the first opportunity to bring something to fruition, we're only going to do it in very select circumstances cases where there is market leader with a strong brand that we can control a business that operates in a large market with good growth opportunities. What Warn represented was an undisputed market leader. They've got about $140 million of revenue which is about 10% market share of slightly more than a $1 billion market. They've got an incredible brand identity. Vehicle owners ask for the Warn product by name, very good margins to this business, Samik. Circa 20% so from a margin perspective it will be accretive to both the specialty margins and our consolidated margins. We believe that just going to be an opportunity for ancillary revenue flow because in many cases you cannot put their product on a factory issued bumper, so we think it's going to be an opportunity for ourselves few more bumpers and importantly it's going be a bit accretive to the 2018 EPS. So, this case we're able to acquire only the aftermarket business. Dover actually retained their OE business, so this was a much simpler transaction then say the PGW situation. Again, at the end of the day, we think it's a great opportunity, it fits well into our product set, it's got our brand that we can control, and we like being in charge of the distribution. And from a size perspective it's about 1% of our consolidated revenue. So just keeping in perspective. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison of Baird. Your line is open. Craig Kennison : So, you've seen maybe an increase in competition in Europe, we've seen a North American distributor enter the French market. I'm wondering if you see that as validation of your strategy or whether you might see that as a strategic threat to some of the other things you want to do in Europe. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Craig. Yes, as everyone probably knows, several weeks ago. GPC which had a NAPA brand here in the US announced their maiden voyage in the Europe, by buying Alliance. Which is a large enterprise headquartered in France, significant operations in France, a bit in Germany and then significant operations at UK as well. We believe Europe is an outstanding marketplace, we've been asked quarter after quarter for the last several years, why aren't all the other US companies in Europe and we could not answer that question. We're just happy that we' were the first mover and have the largest market share in [indiscernible]. So, we think yes, Craig it really goes to show that our strategy in Europe is indeed a good and effective strategy. Look Alliance is a very good competitor in the markets in which they participate, we don't see any material changes. Due to ownership by GPC, they're a very good company, they're very good operator and they're very disciplined and at the end of the day we think that's just fine. Craig Kennison : And then real quick, could you just comment on the revenue margin and strategic implications of your RV systems management business and your Netherlands management system. Nick Zarcone : Yes, those just so you know those are two very, very small businesses. Okay, but let's take the Netherlands business, right. We sell parts to largely the independent mechanical repair shops. Those folks are very good at fixing cars. Their shops that maybe have six [indiscernible] and eight mechanics. What they're not good at is actually having a CRM system where they can stay in touch with their customers, blast out emails, promotions for oil changes or break jobs or whatever the case maybe. What this company does is to provide that kind of - of that capability for that independent garage owner, by us providing that software to our customers it will help them grow their business and our clearer goal is to use that incremental service in helping our customers to get a bigger piece of their wallet, when it comes to parch purchases and alike. Again, in the RV side, again it's providing an incremental service to our RV dealers. What we intend to do is use that to help drive a higher level of revenue, get a bigger share of the dealers' wallet when it comes to type of parts that we sell. Operator : [Operator Instructions] your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordon from Jefferies. Your line is open. Bret Jordan : Could you talk a little bit about the impact on cost of goods from what you're going to see on the salvage auction coming out of the hurricanes, something 300,000 cars, freshwater damage, a lot of truck and SUV mix? Maybe the magnitude of the benefit and the timing. Nick Zarcone : Yes, so the best way to track that is, our experience coming out of Sandy back in 2012, the reality is, there's going to be a lot of good salvage coming to market. We can't buy it all, we can't dramatically up our purchase of cars because we need to have a place to put the cars. You can't put 40 acres of cars in a 30 acre salvage yard. And that's true with us, that's true with everybody. So, we think, these cars come to market we're going to be able to buy a high quality car and an average revenue per vehicle will be a bit higher because it's not like the front end is gone or the back end is gone, right. The reality is, more parts are going to be available for sale. And we think we can get some good pricing again it's supply and demand Bret, right. And with a flood of cars coming to the market at the end of the day that should help a bit. There's not going to be massive changes, massive gains from the cost of goods sold perspective, but on the margin over the next several quarters there should be a little bit of benefit flowing to all the recyclers if you will, ourselves included just from the incremental volumes coming to the market. Bret Jordan : Okay and then a question on alternatives parts penetration, you talked about other claims rates being down four tenths, a 1% yet pretty strong organic growth. Do you have a feeling for what the AI penetration might be now? Nick Zarcone : Our sense is, is it's probably nudging up slowly. The 4% per day in North America actually our salvage and what I would call our core aftermarket product and I think about the Keystone product in the box in glass where all nicely above the 4%. Obviously, we're still continuing to feel a little bit of softness and a little bit of negative comparisons and things like paint, cooling and wheels. And then our smaller businesses like our heavy duty truck business and reman business, we're kind of in the low single-digit. So again, we think that based on our experience we can't speak for the rest of the industry, but based on our experience APU is probably nudging up a little bit like here in 2017. Bret Jordan : Okay and did you give an ECP comp number, the store is open 12 months or longer for just ECP? Nick Zarcone : No, again. We're moving towards reporting European on a segment basis, given that we're now operating and in 15 different countries, we've significantly added to our presence and places like Belgium and Ireland and Poland and alike and but again the positive trends continue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Your line is open. Ben Bienvenu : I want to ask Nick you gave some sense of magnitude of the Warn acquisition, can you help us think about what other product categories you could bolt-on in either the specialty business or North American business that you're not currently in today. Nick Zarcone : Well again on the specialty side, we're distributor at heart. There are other really strong brands in that specialty space if they came for sale and if they had those characteristics that I described, large markets, leading market shares, the ability to add and growing to adjacencies we could add. I can't give you a specific product type, Ben at the moment because it will be really any of the product types that we sell out of our specialty business and as you know, I think last year we sold 275,000 different SKUs including parts from 800 different vendors. But it would have to be a leading brand that really made a difference. Ben Bienvenu : Fair enough. And then pivoting to Europe. Andrew Page continues to be an incremental drag on the results, can you talk about some of the key factors driving the OpEx headwinds. I recognized that you're not able to integrate the business today, but it looks like there is a light at the end of the tunnel potentially in the event of potentially gaining regulatory approval. Can you give us the sense of the critical path for synergy capture? Nick Zarcone : If you think about Andrew Page, they're losing money, their revenue under prior ownership hit a decrease because they weren't investing in the business, they were not investing in inventory. But they still had a national distribution center that they had to cover the cost on, they still have the corporate office that they have to cover the cost on, and that's why they're losing money. I mean those overhead cost relative to their revenue rate are just too high. Ultimately with T2, we don't need their national distribution center. Okay and while we need some of the people in their corporate office, we don't need the total duplication and so those where the real opportunities are. Michael, you mentioned I think in your call the impact of Andrew Page on margins for Europe. Michael Clark : Yes, it was 70 basis points on the operating expenses set on the European segment. Nick Zarcone : Yes so 70 basis points on Europe overall just from Andrew Page, which means if we get it to be breakeven, we pick up 70 basis points in Europe. And we're going to get its profitability. But it's going to take some time as I mentioned in my comments. The integration is measured in weeks or months, it's measured in quarters. Ben Bienvenu : Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine from Consumer Edge. Your line is open. James Albertine : So, wanted to just, as maybe a follow-on to that previous question, that was more focused on Andrew Page and I think we can sort of see the light at the end of the tunnel. Ben mentioned but the pressures that you noted I think it was 60 basis points of margin pressures in the Benelux. Little less clear to us at least what the path forward for correcting that. Can you maybe shed some more light or dig in a little bit deeper there as to what needs to happen and how long that will take? Varun Laroyia : Yes, certainly so this is Varun Laroyia. Let me climb on to that one, to give you a more complete picture about the European OpEx headwinds. So apart from the T2 and the Andrew Page piece that Nick just mentioned, the other one was in the third quarter as we called out, we acquired some businesses in the Sator business again going from a three step to a two-step distribution, methodology. Now with those set of acquisition, there is a slightly different higher cost structure, but essentially that gets offset by a higher gross margin profile for these businesses. So that's one aspect you kind of take into account, just in terms of what took place in the third quarter with the Sator acquisition, the BCC entities and also call systems in the Netherlands, that's point number one. The other one to think through is, as we kind of move forward and we begin to integrate those recently acquired businesses into the continental mainland platform. We do expect there to be further synergies, so as you think about a single ERP versus running a multitude of those, that certainly gives us the benefits also, so apart from the Andrew Page and the T2 piece that was mentioned previously this was the other aspect that I'm hoping you get a little bit more insight into it. James Albertine : And similar with Andrew Page, we're talking about weeks and months, not quarters here in terms of the moving to a single ERP and transitioning kind of to the broader European platform. Varun Laroyia : Yes, so listen as you would have noted, I spent quite sometime over in Europe and had done similar acquisition integration listen as much as I would love to say it's matter of weeks and months, swapping out ERPs and changing out whole scale systems takes a little bit longer than that. We certainly have started the work on that front, optimistically I'm looking at the back end of 2018 into 2019 to be able to kind of simplify some of those recently acquired businesses. So, it has a slightly on the tail, but again we have a great game plan, we've got a great leadership team out there and they've got their initiatives laid out pretty well in terms of how they're going to tackle this. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Your line is open. Brian Butler : This is Brian Butler for Michael. Just one question on the Warn acquisition, now that you've kind of stepped into that vertical integration and become somewhat of competitor to some of your distribution partners, have you had any push back or feedback from those product providers? Nick Zarcone : We have not, although it was just announced on Monday, so of this week so it's only four days ago. The reality - this is a product that the vehicle owners demand by brand. And I think the other distributors who are selling the product are still going to want to sell the Warn product because of the brand identity it's a very good product for everybody in the distribution of specialty product. Brian Butler : And how about the products that you guys sell through your own partners? I mean is there I guess any pressure then to possible of those partners either not selling through you anymore but going someplace else because you're now a direct competitor. Nick Zarcone : No, we don't anticipate any significant change there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Stratton of Great Lakes Review. Your line is open. David Stratton : When we look at the planned automatic transmission repair business scheduled to start in 4Q, how is that coming along? Are there any updates that you can give us in regard to that? Nick Zarcone : Yes, you're talking about our announcement a couple quarters ago of greenfield being a reman transmission business in Oklahoma city and the update from our leadership team just on the last few days, is they anticipate the first transmissions will be coming off the reman line in the first or second week of November, so we're pretty much right on track. Now it's going to start slow, but build from there over the next several years. David Stratton : Great and then, when we talk about the impact of the hurricanes, you mentioned pretty thoroughly the impact on salvage. Will there be any to scrap steel prices that you anticipate going forward, where there might be a lower scrap price in the future? Nick Zarcone : We don't anticipate any significant moves. Obviously, all those total loss vehicles are sooner or later once we and the other recyclers are done with them, I'm going to head to the metals processors to get recycled and like. So, there will be some incremental volume, but when you think about the total amount of steel is recycled in this country and used around the globe, we don't see any material pressure. Our average scrap prices last week were right in the $160 a ton range, which is down a little bit from maybe a month ago, but not materially. Operator : [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters. Nick Zarcone : So, we thank everyone for participating on this third quarter call. We do know that this is a very busy time for all you and we appreciate your time and attention. Again, we think, we had a great third quarter, we're looking forward to a good fourth quarter and we'll talk to you at the end of February with our year end results. Thank you everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc. Operator : Good morning, and welcome to LKQ Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. I'll now turn the call over to Joe Boutross, LKQ's Vice President of Investor Relations. Joseph P. Boutross - LKQ Corp.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Also note that guidance for 2018 is based on current market conditions and does not include any results for the pending Stahlgruber acquisition. We will update guidance for the balance of the year once the Stahlgruber transaction closes. Adjusted figures exclude the impact of restructuring and acquisition related expenses, amortization expense related to acquired intangibles, excess tax benefits and deficiencies from stock-based payments, adjustments to the estimated tax reform provisions booked in 2017, losses on debt extinguishment and gains and losses related to acquisitions or divestitures. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K which we've filed with the SEC earlier today, and as normal, we are planning to file or 10-K in the next few days. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. We are delighted to share the results of our most recent quarter with you, which from our perspective represented a solid close to a strong year. Importantly, the fourth quarter highlighted excellent momentum in our business, particularly in our North American segment. I will provide some high level comments on the quarter and then Varun will dig in a bit further into the segments and related financial details before we discuss our guidance for 2018. All in all, we believe Q4 was a strong quarter for our company, and we are very pleased with the results. As noted on slide 3, consolidated revenue was $2.470 billion, a 15% increase over the $2.15 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of last year. Total revenue growth from parts and services was 14.3%. Importantly, organic revenue growth in parts and services on a global basis was 4.8% during the fourth quarter. As mentioned in the last call, very few companies in our sector are generating organic growth at this level. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.41 in Q4 of 2017 as compared to $0.31 for the comparable period of 2016, an increase of 32%. As Varun will discuss, the 2017 results reflect one-time benefits associated with the Tax Reform Act. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which among other items, excludes the impact of the tax law change was $0.41 compared to $0.35 for the same period of 2016, reflecting a 17% year-over-year increase. Now, let's turn to the operating highlights. As you'll note from slide 5, total parts and services revenue for our North American segment grew 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the comparable quarter of 2016. Organic revenue growth for parts and services for our North American segment during the quarter was 5.0%. We clearly ended the year on a high note, as the same day organic growth rates for the four quarters of 2017 were 1.8%, 2.8%, 4.0% and 5.0%, respectively, demonstrating the momentum gained as we progress throughout the year. As witnessed for several quarters now, we continue to grow our parts and services revenue faster than the repair market as a whole. According to CCC, collision and liability-related auto claims on a national basis were up 3.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017. So, our organic growth of 5% in Q4, again, reflects an outperformance relative to the market as a whole. This continued growth gives us confidence as we move into 2018, particularly as we appear to be in the midst of a more normalized winter here in the United States. In addition, with repair cycle times up nearly one full day over the past two years, plus the ongoing increases in the average cost per part and the hourly labor rates per repair, the value proposition of our alternative parts continues to be attractive to the insurance carriers. We are also optimistic about our North American operations due to the favorable trends relating to more vehicles falling into our collisions sweet spot. Also, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, our performance in Q4 was achieved, while miles driven in the United States was up only 1.1% on a nationwide basis in November. With miles driven in the Northeast only up nine-tenths of 1% and actually down seven-tenths of 1% in the north central region, both in part markets for our North American business. Notably, during 2017, our North American segment generated the best growth in EBITDA margins we've achieved in the past five years. I could not be more proud of the effort of our North American team. As discussed last quarter, we anticipated that the two hurricanes in Q3 would create an opportunity to increase our bidding and procurement activities of high value total loss vehicles. And indeed, we increased vehicle purchases, which as Varun will discuss, added a temporary increase to our working capital and a reduction in operating cash flow. Similar to what happened in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, we believe these enhanced inventory levels will foster the continued growth of our recycling business. Turning to our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC Information Services, the revenue and number of aftermarket purchase orders processed through the CCC platform during the fourth quarter each grew 30% and 26%, respectively, year-over-year. So, good growth with this program. Regarding PGW, during Q4, we integrated four PGW branches into existing LKQ facilities, bringing the total number of PGW integrations to 15 since we acquired the business. I am also happy to announce that during Q4, PGW was awarded an exclusive agreement with Mopar, a parts division of Fiat Chrysler Automotive for the distribution of Mopar batteries through their dealer network, with the first battery having been delivered in January. So today, PGW is now the exclusive OE supplier of aftermarket glass and batteries to all Mopar dealerships. Moving to the other side of the Atlantic, our European segment achieved total parts and services revenue growth of 24.6%. Importantly, organic revenue for parts and services witnessed growth of 5.0% during the quarter. The operations in Eastern Europe again led the way with double-digit organic growth. Operations open for more than a year accounted for approximately 75% of Europe's reported organic growth, while the locations open less than a year added the balance. Acquisitions in Europe added an additional 11.3% to revenue growth during the fourth quarter of 2017, while the strengthening of the euro and sterling during the quarter resulted in a FX increase of just over 8%. During Q4, we opened a total of 15 new branches in Europe, including six new locations in Western Europe and nine in Eastern Europe. Also during the quarter, we rebranded six additional P.R. REILLY locations in the Republic of Ireland over to the ECP trading name. By the end of Q4, all P.R. REILLY branches were successfully transferred from their legacy operating system onto the ECP trading platform. With respect to our T2 project, I am pleased to announce that as of year-end, all of our ECP branches were being replenished out of T2. We have started the process of rationalizing two of our smaller warehouse facilities in the UK, with one being closed at year-end 2017 and the other scheduled to close by mid-2018. With respect to Andrew Page, the CMA released its final findings in early November. And as anticipated, it included a requirement for us to divest only nine branches. In addition, we were finally able to formally begin the integration process of the remaining branches beginning in early January. To that end, we are actively seeking buyers for the selected branches to divest. And we have already closed an additional 10 branches that simply did not perform well during the extended CMA review process. So, we are moving forward with the remaining 80 branches with a goal of having them all fulfilled out of T2 by early in the third quarter of 2018. We will continue to work through the rationalization process of the Andrew Page infrastructure during the remainder of 2018. While we believe we will be able to move the Andrew Page operation to monthly breakeven by the end of the year, given the delay imposed by the CMA and being able to actively manage the business, Andrew Page will likely lose money for the full year of 2018, albeit at a lower rate than in 2017. And finally our Specialty segment continued to capitalize on the favorable trends in truck, SUV and RV sales by achieving organic revenue growth of 3.6% during the fourth quarter. To help support this continued growth, during Q4 our Specialty team began the build out of a new 450,000-square foot distribution facility in Southern California, with a targeted opening in Q2 of 2018. This warehouse should allow us to offer both improved service levels and better inventory availability for our customers in certain key geographic markets. As noted on slide 9, our corporate development activities have continued in earnest as evidenced by our acquisition of five businesses during the fourth quarter. The largest transaction was the previously announced acquisition of Warn Industries which closed in early November. In addition to Warn, during Q4, we acquired an aftermarket parts distributor in Bosnia and Herzegovina, an aftermarket parts distributor in the Netherlands, and automotive glass distributors in Kansas and New Jersey. The big news in Q4 was the December announcement related to the acquisition of Stahlgruber, the leading aftermarket parts distributor in Germany. We are currently working through the anti-trust process with the relevant European regulators and are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to close the transaction in the second quarter of 2018. And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun who will run through the details of the segment results. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Well, thanks Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call today. Nick touched on a few of the key financial stats. I will take you through the more detailed review of the consolidated and segment results for the quarter and also cover current liquidity. Nick described the trends behind our reported revenue of $2.47 billion in the quarter. So let me start with our consolidated gross margin for the same period. As noted on slide 12 of the presentation, the consolidated gross margin percentage was down 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 38.4%. We saw some softness in Europe due to incremental costs related to the T2 facility and a negative mix impact with a greater percentage of the business growth coming from Eastern Europe, which, as we've previously discussed, has a lower margin structure. Partially offsetting this movement, we continued to see solid margin improvement in our North America segment, primarily in our salvage operations. Segment EBITDA totaled $253 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting a $31-million or 14% increase over the comparable quarter of 2016. As a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was flat year-over-year at 10.3%. We saw a 50-basis point increase in our operating expenses and I will cover this in further detail as part of the segment results. Non-operating items were favorable by about $4 million versus the prior year. Each period contained a non-recurring income item as Q4 2017 included a $4-million downward adjustment to our contingent consideration liabilities and Q4 2016 reflected a gain on bargain purchase of $8 million related to the Andrew Page acquisition. We have excluded both of these items out of adjusted income from continuing ops and adjusted diluted EPS. Other non-operating income in the fourth quarter increased by approximately $8 million and includes foreign exchange gains and losses and various other income items such as late payment fees. The vast majority of the variance relates to foreign exchange as Q4 2016 featured negative impact from the weakening pound sterling and the euro, while these currencies strengthened against the dollar in the comparable quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter, we experienced a $2-million increase in restructuring costs, compared to the prior year, and a $6-million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, largely due to recent acquisitions. With that, operating income for the fourth quarter was up about $6 million or roughly 4% when compared to the same period in 2016. Interest expense at $27 million for the quarter was up about 14%, primarily due to higher average borrowings. Pre-tax income during the fourth quarter of 2017 was $150 million, up $6 million or 4.5% compared to the prior year. Moving to income taxes, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December created a significant opportunity for the business and a boatload of additional work for our tax and accounting teams over the past few months, a special call out to them for the incredible personal leadership and commitment in working long hours through the various elements of the tax reform that will benefit us for a long time. I'll split the discussion on taxes into two key elements. One the go forward rate for 2018, and two the effect on the fourth quarter results. First and more importantly, we expect the U.S. tax reform to have a favorable impact on our 2018 results. With the lower U.S. corporate tax rate, we provisionally estimate that our global effective tax rate will be approximately 26% in 2018. We expect this change to have a meaningful benefit to our earnings and cash flows, and Nick will comment on the specifics when he covers the 2018 annual guidance shortly. Second, there was an immediate impact on the 2017 financials related to tax reform. Our Q4 and full year provision reflects a $73-million tax benefit due to the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities in the U.S. And going the other direction, we recorded a $51-million tax provision related to the transition or repatriation tax on foreign earnings and profits. This provision reflects our current estimates of liability. The revaluation of deferred taxes is a non-cash item. The repatriation tax will be payable over an eight-year period. The net $22 million benefit related to the Tax Act is reflected in our GAAP diluted EPS, but is excluded from the calculation of our adjusted diluted EPS. Our base effective tax rate was roughly flat year-over-year at 34.75%. As Nick referenced earlier, diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the fourth quarter was up 32.3%, while adjusted EPS, which excludes restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, a tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation and the Tax Act reflected is 17.1% improvement. For the full year, diluted EPS from continuing ops attributable to LKQ stockholders was $1.74, up 18.4% compared to the $1.47 reported for 2016. And adjusted EPS for the year was $1.88 or 11.2% higher than the $1.69 reported last year. Turning to the segments on slide 15. Gross margins in North America during the fourth quarter were 43.5%, up 20 basis points over last year. The strong results reflected the benefits of procurement initiatives in our salvage operations, partially offset by reductions in our aftermarket business due to higher input costs. Operating expenses in our North American segment increased by 70 basis points compared to the prior year. This includes a benefit of about 40 basis points from eliminating shared PGW corporate costs after the sale of the OEM business in March of 2017. The increase primarily related to personnel costs, including rising medical costs and some wage pressure, and also an increased head count to support the continued growth in the business. Non-operating income and expenses had a positive impact on segment EBITDA of 40 basis points due to favorable foreign exchange gains and losses, and insurance recovery, and increase miscellaneous income. In total, segment EBITDA for North America during the fourth quarter of 2017 was $153 million, a 10.4% increase over last year. As a percentage of revenue segment EBITDA was 12.7% in Q4 up 20 basis points from the 12.5% reported in the comparable period of 2016. While the margin was down sequentially in Q4, this is consistent with the average rate we have experienced in the fourth quarter in North America over the previous five years. Overall, we are very, very proud of the North America leadership team's effort in bringing home a very strong quarter and year. Moving to slide 17. Scrap prices were up 38% over the prior year and flat in Q4 relative to Q3. The benefit from scrap reflects the sequential movement in pricing, as car costs will generally follow the scrap prices higher or lower over time. So we didn't see an appreciable benefit in Q4 as the average price was flat sequentially and car costs had adjusted to the scrap price change in Q3. Moving to our European segment on slide 18. Gross margins in Europe were 35.7% in Q4, a 40-basis point decline over the comparable period of 2016. I'd like to highlight a shift between COGS and operating expenses in our ECP business owing to the transition of T2 costs into COGS in 2017. And obviously there was an offsetting reduction flowing through ECP's overhead expenses. As discussed in prior calls, we have also experienced a decline in gross margin due to the mix shift in favor of lower margin, albeit higher growth Eastern European operations. And as you know, the team has been working hard on procurement initiatives across the European business, including negotiating consolidated rebate and discount programs with suppliers. And those efforts partially offset the decreases by producing a 30-basis point improvement in the quarter versus the prior year on this specific initiative. With respect to operating expenses, we experienced a 30-basis point increase on a consolidated European basis quarter-over-quarter. European expenses relating to Andrew Page were lower in the fourth quarter than the prior year, and the previously mentioned shift of T2 cost to COGS in 2017 also helped the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Working in the opposite direction, operating expenses in the Benelux region were 120 basis points unfavorable in Q4 of 2017, comprising largely one-time impacts, and so we expect going forward to see a lesser quarter-over-quarter change in that part of the European business. Non-operating income and expenses had a positive impact of 40 basis points in 2017 due to favorable foreign exchange gains and losses. So segment EBITDA totaled $78 million, a 22% increase over the prior year. On a constant currency basis, this equated to an increase of 13%. As a percentage of revenue, European segment EBITDA in the fourth quarter was 8% versus 8.2% a year ago. Moving to slide number 21, the Specialty segment had a solid quarter both on the top line, organic revenue growth and the Warn Industries related acquisition growth, but also the bottom line, despite some pressure on operating expenses. You'll recall that we closed the Warn acquisition on November 1, with the business adding an iconic brand to our portfolio and contributing financially with a higher EBITDA percentage than the rest of the Specialty segment. You will note that the reported gross margin percentage only increased by 10 basis points. However, the reported figure includes a negative 120-basis point impact of an inventory step up adjustment related to the Warn acquisition that flowed through COGS in the fourth quarter and will end once that inventory has flowed through before the end of the first quarter of 2018. Operating expenses were higher relative to the prior year, with the primary variances related to higher freight expense in 2017 and a non-recurring benefit related to the settlement of a contingent liability in 2016 that exacerbated the year-over-year comparable. Segment EBITDA for Specialty was $23 million, up 13.1% from Q4 of 2016. And as a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was up 10 basis points to 7.8%. Specialty is a highly seasonal business and the fourth quarter is typically our softest. Consistent with a normal seasonal patterns, we saw segment EBITDA margin decreased 280 basis points sequentially, though it is important to note that this was significantly better than the prior year when the decrease was approximately 300 basis points. Moving on to capital allocation. As presented on slide number 23, you will note that our cash outflow from continuing operations for 2017 was approximately $523 million. The lower than expected operating cash flow is directly related to an increase in inventory build to support the accelerating organic growth in our North America segment and favorable buying conditions for our salvage operations in the fourth quarter. We had invested a net cash investment of approximately $93 million through September, and we invested a further $106 million in the fourth quarter. We don't anticipate needing significant additional investments for inventory in 2018, and this will contribute to an increase in cash flow from operations, as Nick will reference when we go through the 2018 annual guidance. Overall, we feel confident that we are well-positioned going into 2018 to provide best-in-class customer service and achieve our growth targets. Capital spending ended on the low side of our guidance range, with some projects deferred into 2018, which explains a portion of the expected increase included in our guidance for the new year. In 2017, we deployed $682 million of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $175 million to fund capital expenditures, and the net $507 million to fund acquisitions and other investments. The largest capital changes reflect the net pay down of almost $113 million of debt, largely funded by the proceeds derived from the sale of the PGW glass manufacturing business in March of 2017. Moving on to slide number 24, we amended our bank credit facility in December, adding $300 million dollars of capacity on our revolver, extending the maturity by a further two years to January 2023, and revising certain financial covenants to create greater flexibility when completing acquisitions. As of December 31, 2017, we had about $3.4 billion of total debt outstanding and approximately $280 million of cash, resulting in net debt of about $3.1 billion or 2.7 times last 12 months EBITDA. We have nearly $1.4 billion of availability on our line of credit, which together with our cash yields a total liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion. As noted, when we announced the agreement to announce (30:27) Stahlgruber last December, we intend to finance the acquisition with the proceeds from planned debt offerings, borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility and the direct issuance to Stahlgruber's owner of approximately $8 million newly issued shares of LKQ common stock. The timing of the borrowings and the amounts to be drawn from the debt offerings and the revolver are to be determined and will depend on the timing of the expected closing of the transaction, currently anticipated to be in Q2 and market conditions at such time. And finally before I turn it back to Nick, I do want to highlight a change that we will be making in our 2018 reporting. After considering the changing profile of our business, we determined that the split of our operating expenses into three categories was no longer relevant to the business, and equally importantly brings us in line with others in both the automotive parts and distribution sectors. As a result, we will collapse facility and warehouse expenses, distribution expenses, and SG&A expenses into a single overhead category. Though please be assured, we will still continue to provide comments on the call and other discussions regarding the drivers within our operating expenses, but also with a focus on the type of expense, for example, labor, rent, freight rather than just the category. With that, I'll turn it back to Nick to share additional details on the tax reform benefit and our annual guidance for 2018. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Varun. As Varun just mentioned, we anticipate a meaningful reduction in our effective tax rate, that when compared to the rate in 2017 will save LKQ approximately $85 million, representing an increase in earnings per share of approximately $0.28 in 2018. Since the company was founded in 1998, the focus has been to reinvest all the free cash flow back into the business to support our growth. That will be the case with the majority of the enhanced free cash flow resulting from the tax savings. We will, however, utilize a portion of the benefit to invest in our people and the communities in which we operate, through a series of long-term benefit enhancements and other programs, primarily in the U.S. These include enhancements to our healthcare, retirement, and PTO benefit programs. We are also funding some employee-focused education programs and will be establishing the LKQ foundation as a tax efficient vehicle to support our communities. In total, the annual cost of these programs will be about $20 million or $0.05 a share. It's important to recognize that while the tax savings will be incorporated into the tax provision, the funding of these important programs will increase operating expenses, slightly reducing the margins of our North American and Specialty segments. But the net benefit is significant with an estimated uptick of approximately $0.23 a share in 2018. Slide 26 sets forth our annual guidance for 2018. It is important to note that this guidance does not, I repeat does not, include the impact of the pending acquisition of Stahlgruber. We will update guidance after the transaction closes. As you will note, we believe global organic revenue growth of parts and services will be in the range of 4.0% to 6.0%, with the midpoint up a bit from the 4.1% achieved in 2017. The year-over-year improvement is largely due to an anticipated uptick in North American growth during 2018 reflecting the positive momentum associated with the strong Q4 2017 results. Also, for those building quarterly models, in 2018, there is one additional selling day in North America that falls in Q4. Again, these growth rates are well above the typical automotive parts distributor. The range for our adjusted diluted earnings per share is $2.30 to $2.40 a share, with a midpoint of $2.35 which reflects a 25% increase over 2017. Again, approximately $0.28 of the increase is attributable to the impact of the Tax Reform Act which will reduce the global effective tax rate to approximately 26%. And as mentioned, we will reinvest about $0.05 in programs that support our employees and the communities. Cash flow from operations is estimated at $650 million to $700 million reflecting a significant increase from 2017. The increase reflects a higher level of profits, the impact of the Tax Reform Act, and effective working capital management by selling down the higher year-end inventory levels. The working capital swings between 2017 and 2018 are not dissimilar to those experienced during 2014 and 2015. The increase in capital spending in 2018 to $250 million to $280 million is reflective of several items including the general growth of the business, a carryover of below budgeted spending in 2017. The addition of acquired businesses, particularly Warn, which has slightly higher capital requirements, several large expansion projects within the North American Salvage and aftermarket infrastructure, and as mentioned, the new facility for the Specialty segment. In addition, we have identified a few large IT projects that we anticipate will be initiated during the year. The guidance reflects an effective tax rate of 26% and exchange rates that are reflective of the market environment here early in 2018. Slide 27 sets forth a schedule that bridges the projected 25% increase in adjusted earnings per share from the $1.88 reported for 2017 to the midpoint of the 2018 guidance of $2.35. As you can see, about $0.14 represents an increase in profitability of the base business, we pick up $0.03 from the UK, reflecting a recapture of some of the duplicative cost associated with the Tamworth project and eliminating some of the losses at Andrew Page, and the full year impact of the 2017 acquisitions adds another $0.04 a share. Assuming the recent weakness in the dollar holds, currencies will add about $0.03 a share and then we pick up the $0.28 from the lower tax rate, offset by the $0.05 of investment into employee and community programs. In summary, the fourth quarter reflected a solid all-around performance for LKQ and it sets the stage for another good year in 2018 as we enter the year with positive momentum. Our organic growth is strong, margin's healthy and the new tax law will materially improve our already strong cash flow dynamics. We have a terrific acquisition waiting to close and plenty of liquidity to capitalize on additional corporate development activities. Taken as a whole, LKQ is in a great position. These terrific results reflect the collective efforts of our more than 43,000 employees around the globe who are working hard to serve our customers every day. I would like to personally thank each of them for their dedication and for being LKQ proud. Operator, we are now ready to open the call up for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Benjamin Bienvenu with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Ben. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: I want to ask about North American organic growth, obviously really nice results in 4Q, and in the context of broader strong results across organic parts and services growth. We've got a more normal winter as you alluded to, to start the year. Curious about your expectations for that organic growth rate, in particular and kind of the glide path we should expect embedded within your overall organic growth rate guidance. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, Ben. This is Nick. We anticipate that North American organic will be in that 4% to 6% range, with a chance of being kind of north of the midpoint. We've had a great fourth quarter where we posted a 5% organic. I think it's important to recognize that our core products, think about our salvage products and our Keystone aftermarket products, the new products in a box, if you will, they were actually up north of 6% in the quarter. We are still feeling some softness in a couple of product categories. Paint was up only 1%. The good news there is that's the first quarter in the last five quarters where paint actually had a positive growth rate. And then wheels and cooling our still a little bit on the negative side. So net-net, we're feeling good about North American organic and so we basically included a kind of a 4% to 6% range into the overall guidance. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great. And then some of the operating expenses were a bit more pronounced than we are expecting in 4Q, in particular facility and warehouses expenses. Varun, I think in your prepared comments, as you walked through the slide deck, you pointed to the Benelux operating expenses, the 120-basis point headwind, some portion of that being one-time versus structural. But could you quantify that and then just help us think about what of the expense pressure in the quarter was structural versus transitory? Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, no, absolutely. Hey Ben, good morning, it's Varun (42:06). Great question and appreciate it. So in terms of talking about operating expenses, personnel costs essentially in many instances in North America cracked the higher organic activity that we had. So apart from having to recruit more people, having to invest further into our inventory, we also had to pay slightly higher rates. And then on top of that, we had a higher level of medical claims expenses here in North America. Freight for the full year was up 20 basis points, but really kind of muted in the fourth quarter as such. This is again North America specifically. So North America the vast majority of that higher expense really was supporting the higher activity that we experienced as \u2013 on the \u2013 off the back of the organic growth momentum that was coming through. On the European side, if you think about the Benelux piece as we call that, really two key factors. The first is the one-time piece and it basically is essentially related to costs that get capitalized into inventory and then become part of that inventory cost, it gets offloaded when we sell that inventory, so there was a catch up that took place out there, which essentially \u2013 so that was about 70 basis points of the 120 basis points, so the vast majority of that. And then the second one really is \u2013 and so I don't expect that to be a structural change, it was more transitory. We don't expect that to be on a go-forward basis. And then the second one is more structural. The remainder of it really is in the Benelux, as we called out last quarter going from a three-step to a two-step model, where we have a higher gross margin rate. But then associated with that, we also have a higher OpEx that comes along with it. The net EBITDA margin is still good for us, and kind of falls within our parameters where we would invest. But there is a structural change and that will continue. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge. Your line is open. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Great. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on a solid fourth quarter. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Jamie. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Maybe just a follow on to that prior question on leverage. If we can dial in to North America specifically, you've talked about \u2013 Nick specifically you've talked about initiatives you've been working on for the last couple years to try and streamline operations. And then in your prepared remarks, if I heard correctly (44:37) there's sort of this \u2013 you're embarking on this IT expenditure. Could you just sort of help us understand is 2018 going to be a greater opportunity to show some leverage in the business or are we still in an investment pattern here from North America's perspective? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, Jamie, we're expecting the margins in North America to tick up just a bit, but we are investing heavily into the business because we think there's great growth prospects for many years in the North American business, some of that goes directly to the uptick in capital spending that we noted. CapEx in North America is going to be up the better part of $65 million to $70 million. Some of that relates to some IT initiatives, but the bulk of it is really expanding our capacity within our salvage and aftermarket infrastructure. You can only push so many cars through a salvage facility before you have to get more land to expand your processing capabilities and the like, because the alternative to actually run more cars through the facility is to increase the cycle time, which means the cars are sitting out in the yards for a fewer number of days and you end up crushing a bunch of great parts that otherwise could be sold. So we're investing into the North American business and you can see that in our capital spending plans. We do think that we still have some room to go on some of our productivity initiatives. We are largely through the benefits, but there's a little bit of extra room, things like our Roadnet and our procurement and other kind of spending initiatives, if you will. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Yes. And then just to add to what you just said a few minutes ago. So, Jamie as you think about some of the cost (46:34) a few we know was up through the course of the year. But essentially as part of the investment, in terms of the efficiency programs that we've got underway, call it the Roadnet route optimization piece that Nick referred to, of that matter (46:47) continue to upgrade our fleet to newer and more fuel efficient vehicle, that essentially largely mitigated some of those expenses. Again, there's some smart investments that we continue to make. And then the other piece that I do want to highlight is that when you kind of think about the go-forward margins, the tax reform benefit and the partial reinvestment of $0.05 that we called out, that is largely here for our U.S. domestic teams, so that will flow back into the 2018 margin profile. So just wanted to kind of highlight that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions as well. I wanted to ask about T2 and Andrew Page. I know in the past you've talked about an $0.08 drag from those operations in 2017. It sounds like you're going to claw back about $0.03 of that. Can we still look at 2019 and say that should be a clean year, where you get a full $0.08 benefit or a net 5% increase over 2017 \u2013 or 2018? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Craig and thanks for the call. Yeah, we are excited about the T2 project. It's operating well. It came in from a cost perspective right on-time, it's ramping up pretty much as anticipated, if you will. Once we get these other two facilities closed and totally rationalized, we will begin to fully get the benefit. So yes, we're going to pick-up a couple cents a share in 2018 of those duplicative cost, and by 2019, we should be pretty well through and \u2013 kind of that what you would call the duplicative cost. And in 2020, we'll be generating some really \u2013 really good returns for us. You Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I guess. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: You got a question on Andrew Page? Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Well, I thought collectively those two would contribute around $0.08 when those one-time or those temporary costs go away, but we're only getting $0.03 of that back and I'm guessing that when we look at 2019, we'll see the full $0.08 benefit? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. Our expectation is by the end of 2018 the Andrew Page operation will be breakeven. Obviously, our goal is to get it actually into profitability. And so by 2019, we will collect the entirety of the $0.03 loss that we incurred this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is open. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Bret. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Good morning. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Could you talk about the purchasing synergies you're seeing, I think you said 30 basis points maybe from \u2013 on the European consolidation and I thought Mekonomen Group maybe talked about in their earnings call a week or two ago about joining sort of maybe it sounds like a buying group with you guys. So where are we as far as consolidating the supply chain? And I guess as you think about adding the Stahlgruber business, what are the thoughts as far as consolidating some of the management overhead and the operational side of the European business? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: So, I'll start Bret, the purchasing savings that we're seeing roll through are largely coming out of the initiatives that we started post the Rhiag acquisition back in mid-2016. We are getting a good response and good support from our vendor partners, if you will, and those savings are accruing. We haven't really started anything of note as relate with our \u2013 with respect to Mekonomen, but we will begin some programs there, as they announced, in 2018 which should benefit both organizations. Obviously, we anticipate another kind of step up in procurement benefits once we are able to close and begin to integrate the Stahlgruber team because they bring $1.6 billion of incremental revenue and probably close to \u20ac1 billion of incremental procurement to the overall LKQ Europe network. And we will be working collectively with the Stahlgruber team, and again with our vendor partners to try and really get the benefits of being the largest procurer of aftermarket parts in Europe by a wide margin. As it relates to integration of kind of back office and items related to the Stahlgruber transaction, that's something that will take much longer to participate. Our goal just as it has been with ECP, Sator and Rhiag is not to disrupt the day to day management and the customer interface because this is very much a local business, even though we have a global platform, the daily activities are local, and we want to make sure we keep our service commitments to our local customer base. Having said that over time, we do have plans, broader plans to do some integration as it relates to broader kind of corporate services. One of the things we need to do to make that happen, though, is to kind of normalize the IT systems. Right now, most of our European operations operate on different IT systems. So, we noted in the call that we're going to be spending more money on IT in 2018 than ever before, and part of that is to begin the journey and it is a multi-year journey ultimately to bring our European operations to a common platform. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: And then Nick just to add \u2013 Jamie (53:08) I think your second part was about the LKQ Europe, stitching together that piece. So in addition to what Nick said, listen, as you know we have a LKQ Europe CEO, LKQ Europe CFO, a European CIO, things along those lines and that really is the team. It's a small team but that's the one that is continuing to bring together each of these synergy opportunities, be they procurement or cost related. And this way around, our in-market national businesses, they are free to continue to operate and continue to deliver fantastic service to our folks, to our clients out there. But really, it's a small team, headed by John Quinn that essentially is leading the charge on some of these programs with regards to the common ERP for example across the European landscape. Certain other initiatives associated with procurement, the benefit of which we are beginning to see already, big data, single catalog, along those lines. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, Nick, Varun, and Joe. Thank you for taking my question. I have two if I may. One is on margins, one is on cash flow. On the margin, when should we think about Europe being 9.5% to 10% again, margins? What's the line of sight of that? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So, Michael thanks for your question. As we've been mentioning for some time now, we do think that the European business can get into kind of the double digit EBITDA territory over the next few years. Now obviously, when you layer out \u20ac1.6 billion of revenue from Stahlgruber, which, as we disclosed back in December, was running on a 8% margin, that will have a net negative impact a bit just from a mix perspective. But again, think about the next two to three years. We think we can get the entire complex back to a 10% margin. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that. And then on free cash flow, can you help me understand \u2013 I get that you've made this investment in inventory and working capital, but what I really like \u2013 and then capital spending's going to be up a lot this year. But what I'd like to try to understand is how does that translate into moving then the organic growth rate? Because your goal was $425 million in free cash for 2017, you did $344 million. Your midpoint of your goal for 2018 doesn't even get back to the original 2017 goal; so I'm trying to understand where the leverage is, because ultimately I think this is a free cash flow play and we've just compressed the free cash a bit. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, so Michael, hey, good morning. It's Varun (56:12). Let me answer that. So listen, as I mentioned in the remarks earlier, given the organic growth in the business and the acceleration of that, specifically here in North America and just to reiterate, going quarter-by-quarter in 2017 here in North America same day was 1.8% in Q1, 2.8% in Q2, 4% in Q3, and 5% in Q4. On the back of that, the last thing that we want to do is to have a stockout scenario. So this was a decision that we actively supported to ensure that we had adequate breadth and depth across our businesses here in North America. The other piece that I do want to highlight is, coming off the hurricanes in Q3, there were favorable buying conditions on our salvage side. So again that was an area that car buying was good and we built up a backlog of just over a week and that's the piece that we're kind of using through, so we're kind of seeing some of that benefit come through in the current quarter also. And then to kind of give you one additional example, and if you think about of the product categories that Nick mentioned earlier with regards to paint for example, that had turned positive in this past quarter, glass is another area where we actually performed really well and that actually contributed to our 5% organic growth rate. And again, within that piece to ensure that we have adequate stock given some of the kind of longer lead times that we see and to ensure we have good fill rates from our suppliers, that was the other area that we ended up investing our inventory. So a couple of those points and then, again these were the kind of main elements. There are other small items as Nick mentioned we called out the Mopar FCA inventory and deal as such. Again that kicks off in 2018. But there was some inventory build on that also. So again if you think about the overall piece of it, we are in a good position. Organic growth has been accelerating and to avoid any kind of stockout scenarios, we certainly want to make sure that we continue to invest. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Healy with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Was hoping you guys could talk a little bit more about the planned IT investments. I know you mentioned Europe would be a focus, but was kind of hoping you could give us some examples of what needs to change from an IT perspective. Are these multi-year projects and just how big of a planned project that you were thinking about there? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, John. This is Nick. Yes, so like in Europe, all of our major acquisitions came to us with completely different ERP systems. And ultimately to get the true efficiency out of the combined network, we need to migrate to a single system. Now, that's probably a five-year process, because you can't take all the various systems and convert it in a year. So, we are in the middle of making a decision as to a single ERP platform for our European operations. That is a major decision. That play out will happen, like I said, probably over the next five years as we will migrate all of our operations to a common platform and that is a very large project. It's tens of millions of dollars, it's not a couple million dollars. It's tens of millions of dollars to make that happen. In North America, we've been operating off of the same platforms for quite some time. So we're running the business today with basically the same IT infrastructure as we're running back when it was $1 billion business. And so we will again upgrade over the next couple of years to a larger common ERP platform. Currently, we run different platforms for our salvage in our aftermarket businesses and we will likely migrate that to a single platform. Again those are \u2013 that's a really big project, it's not a \u2013 again tens of millions as opposed to millions. John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Great. And then, just wanted to ask Nick just about the U.S. market. There has been a lot of chatter that we finally avoided a green winter. But I'm just wondering if you could give us any color from what you're hearing from maybe some of your larger customers on the collision side, maybe how their book of business looks for the first quarter, kind of what you're seeing in terms of orders, or backlogs at repair shops. Just any sort of qualitative fealty there to (01:01:12) help us confirm or not confirm the absence of (01:01:18). Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: So last year when we were holding this call here in late February, it was 72 degrees in Chicago, this morning, I think it's 29 degrees. So clearly Mother Nature has returned with a more normalized winter. Precipitation levels in the traditional snow states is up from last year, and so we're seeing good demand just as we saw in the fourth quarter. We think that that level of demand will pull through into the early parts here of 2018, and that should set us up well for the entire year just as the 2016 and 2017 lack of winters kind of stuck with us for the better part of the year. We think 2018 is going to be back to a more normal pace, if you will, and overall the tone feels good. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Scott Stember with CL King. Your line is open. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning Scott. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Can you maybe talk about the European segment with a little bit more granularity. You said that Eastern Europe outperformed I guess the UK and Western Europe on the continent, can maybe just give us a little bit more commentary on that? And then, just talk about within that 4% to 6% parts and service organic growth how much of that will be from Europe in 2018? Thanks again. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So there's no doubt that the Eastern Bloc countries have the highest organic growth, and part of that just has to do with the growing car park, the larger number of vehicles actually in the countries and the fact that their cars are really old. On average, Eastern Europe autos are about 14.5 years old, and those are cars that need a lot of repair parts and the parts that we provide. And so you've got a growing market and that is resulting, taken as a whole, in double digit organic growth for us. And as a percentage of European revenue, the Eastern Bloc is in that probably the 20% to 22%, 23% range of our total European revenues. So as that continues to grow at a faster pace, obviously that will help the overall organic growth for Europe. The rest of Europe is \u2013 the Western Europe is obviously grows at a lower rate. We've been messaging for some time that ultimately the 6%, 7% to 8% growth that we had historically experienced at ECP was going to slow a bit. I think that's going to be the case. When we've \u2013 since the time we bought the ECP, we've expanded the branch network from 89 to over 300 when you include Andrew Page. So, we're pretty much done putting new dots on the map at ECP, which obviously the new branch has contributed to organic growth there. But again, we still think they're going to grow at significantly above the overall rate in the UK, and then Sator and the Western European parts of Rhiag again will have kind of probably mid-low to mid-single digit kind of growth rates, if you will. So all in all, you put it together we think Europe's going to be solidly in the 4% to 6% range, it was at just over 5% in 2017, at 5.3%. And so, we're expecting pretty much a continuation in 2018. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Zarcone. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Well, again, we think we've had a tremendous fourth quarter and a great 2017. We think the table is set for another great year in 2018. The management team is very excited about the prospects of our company. And again, we've got the better part of 43,000 employees today, more than 49,000 employees once we close Stahlgruber to really make it happen on behalf of our customers each and every day. So we thank you for your time here this morning, and we'll talk to you again in a couple months. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC David Kelly - JPMorgan Asset Management Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Operator : Good morning. My name is Denise, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the LKQ First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Joseph P. Boutross - LKQ Corp.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Nick Zarcone. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. We are delighted to share the results of our most recent quarter with you this morning. I will start by providing some high-level comments on the quarter, and Varun will dig in a bit further into the segments and related financial details before I come back to discuss or our updated 2018 guidance and make a few closing remarks. As noted on slide 4, consolidated revenue was a record $2.721 billion reflecting a 16% increase over the $2.343 billion recorded in the first quarter of last year. Total revenue growth from parts and services was 15.7% during the first quarter while organic revenue growth in parts and services on a global basis came in at 3.7% with our North American operations leading the charge. As mentioned in the Q4 call, very few companies in our sector are generating organic growth at this level. Please note, we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard effective January 1 of 2018 and that had a negative impact on consolidated revenue growth of just under 40 basis points. So, excluding the impact of the new accounting standard, the global organic growth rate was just above 4%. While the quarter-to-quarter impact is difficult to forecast, we expect the accounting standard impact on our reported revenue growth for the remainder of the year to be less than that recorded in Q1. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.49, an increase of 9% as compared to the $0.45 reported for the same period of 2017. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the first quarter was $0.55, an increase of 12% compared to the $0.49 for the same period last year. These EPS results were a bit short of our expectations, and during that call, we will provide some insights as to both the headwinds faced and our plans for change. Let's turn to the operating highlights. As you will note from slide 6, total parts and services revenue for our North American segment grew 8.6% during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the comparable quarter last year. Organic revenue growth for parts and services for our North American segment during the quarter was 6.5%, well ahead of expectations. We clearly started the year on a high note in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC Information Services, collision and liability related auto claims on a national basis were only up 0.8% in the first quarter, although there were significant regional differences, which were basically a reversal of recent years. According to the CCC data, the traditional Snow Belt states like Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York and Massachusetts, all experienced material growth in repairable claims, while states like Washington, California, Texas, Georgia and Florida saw year-over-year declines in repairable claims. Our revenue largely tracked these regional differences with the Midwest, Northeast and Canadian regions performing extremely strong, while the revenue growth in the South, East and the West was more tempered. Clearly, Mother Nature helped the cause in some of our larger regions. That said, the 6.5% organic growth far outpaced the CCC data supporting our view that we continue to gain market share. Also, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, our performance in Q1 was achieved, while miles driven in the United States were down 0.1% on a nationwide basis in February, although like the claims data, there were significant regional differences. Organic growth for the aftermarket parts outstripped that of salvage parts, as the repair shops were looking to improve cycle times given the increased volume of work they were processing. Importantly, we continue to see increases in our total aftermarket collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 6.7% and 13.8% respectively in the first quarter. Finally, as noted last call, we have a new agreement to distribute batteries to the FCA dealerships in North America, and that program had an approximate 100 basis point positive impact on our North American organic growth rate during the quarter. Achieving this robust level of organic growth in North America came at a cost, particularly in our collision parts business, as we incurred incremental operating expense as a percent of revenue to maintain our industry-leading service levels for our customers. As mentioned, some regions exhibited much better than expected volumes and we had to move inventory around the system in order to have the right parts in the right place to satisfy customer demand. This dynamic had a negative impact on operating margins in the quarter, which Varun will touch on shortly. Moving to the other side of the Atlantic, our European segment achieved total parts and services revenue of 26.6% during the quarter. Organic revenue growth for parts and services in Europe was 1.2%, which was below our expectations. Acquisitions added an additional 11.3% to revenue growth during the first quarter of 2018, while the strengthening of the euro and sterling continued during the quarter resulting in an FX-related increase of just over 14%. On the positive side, our operations in Eastern Europe again led the way with high-single-digit organic growth, and our Benelux operations experienced organic growth well above the overall European average. Conversely, our UK operations, which are currently our largest in Europe, produced roughly flat organic growth on a year-over-year basis and generally experienced the softest quarter since we bought ECP in 2011. While there were a number of moving pieces, I will mention the three biggest factors. First, while we remain highly confident in the long-term benefits related to the new UK warehouse project, known as T2, we have to acknowledge that the full conversion to the automation became more difficult than we had initially modeled. As mentioned in the past, this project involves moving from the utilization of three smaller legacy warehouses to the utilization of the new large highly automated T2 facility and a reconfigured existing facility. T2 is not only a major logistics initiative, but also a complex software project. While we and our vendors did extensive testing, it was only once the system was under the full load of all the ECP branches earlier this year that some issues began to surface. In particular, we experienced some replenishment issues and related stock availability at both T2 and some of our branches, which in turn led to temporary service issues. We immediately increased head count at T2 to keep the product flowing and implemented key promotional programs to maintain our customer relationships. The final material software patch was installed a few weeks ago. We have worked through the backlog and now the system is fully functional. That said, we are not fully optimized yet, and it will take a couple of quarters to continue to prove the efficiency at T2. Based on our early April results, it appears that the sales disruption has been rectified. But we still have work to do on the cost side. In the coming quarters, we will move the Andrew Page national distribution center functions and related branch network replenishment to T2. We are confident that these will be executed without the same issues we experienced during the first quarter. The second point, Europe like the United States had some unusually severe weather. For example, in March, the UK was hit by three separate storms which the media have referred to as the Beast from the East. While these storms dropped an unusual amount of snow on the Greater London area, the biggest impact was experienced in Scotland and the northern areas of England. There were a few days when some of our replenishment trucks were grounded, and many of our customers and our some of branches closed. While harsh weather is generally favorable to our business, in this case, the severity led to a negative impact on the Q1 results. Third, the timing of Easter appears to have had a larger negative impact than we anticipated. Last year, you may recall, Easter fell in mid-April and firmly in the second quarter, where this year Easter was on April 1 with Good Friday falling into the first quarter and Easter Monday in the second quarter. So again, we had three temporary setbacks. With respect to Andrew Page, we have received approval to integrate the non-divestiture Andrew Page business. Andrew Page's branch network and national distribution center is scheduled for integration into T2 by July and the head office function should be consolidated by the end of the year. At this time, we are in the process of selling 11 Andrew Page branches, including the nine required by the UK competition authorities and two additional branches that are focused on the commercial vehicle market. We are currently evaluating the bids we have received for these branches. During the first quarter, we opened up five new branches in Europe including one new location in Western Europe and four in Eastern Europe. So overall, it was a disappointing result for our European segment with the three temporary setbacks impacting our organic growth and EBITDA margins. That said, we believe the longer term impact of the weather will be favorable, the Easter timing impact will benefit Q2 when compared to last year, and that the T2 and Andrew Page integration issues are now within our control and will be resolved in the next couple of quarters. By Q3, we anticipate we will start to see the benefits and we will exit the year with these items well behind us. And finally, let's move on to our Specialty segment. During Q1, Specialty reported organic growth for parts and services of 0.3%, with most of the slowdown from historical levels coming late in the quarter. The team implemented selected customer and product mix rationalization decisions that we think will yield positive results over the long term. In the short term, however, this meant for growing business in the quarter, which had lower profitability levels while focusing on developing new business at a more acceptable margin. Importantly, unlike our North American segment, which benefits from severe winter weather, the Specialty segment was negatively impacted by the harsh March storms both on the demand side for our RV-focused products as well as our ability to distribute in certain markets. Moving on to corporate development, in the first quarter, we acquired an aftermarket radiator and related products distributor in Tennessee. During this quarter, we tempered the volume of our acquisitions primarily to digest what we had acquired in 2017, but not closing the door on attractive acquisition opportunities. With that said, I am pleased with the diligence of our development team and our operating team's effort with respect to ongoing integration efforts. We continue to see a robust pipeline of opportunities to acquire businesses that fit with our growth strategy in each of our operating segments. With respect to the pending acquisition of Stahlgruber announced back in December, we engaged in pre-notification discussions with the EU Antitrust Commission beginning in January and submitted our formal merger notification filing to the Commission on March 9. On April 4, the Commission received a referral request from one EU country asking that part of the transaction be transferred to that country's competition authority for its assessment. The referral request was not a complete surprise, as there was some overlap of business activity in that particular country. The referral request triggered an automatic 10-day extension to the EU review period and we currently anticipate receiving a formal response from the EU Commission on or before May 3. The operations in the country subject to the referral request represent only a small portion of Stahlgruber's overall revenue and profits, and we believe we will be able to close on the vast majority of the Stahlgruber business during the second quarter. Importantly, our interactions with the Stahlgruber leadership team over the past several months has only reinforced our view that it is a very high quality organization and a strong business, and that will be a terrific addition to the LKQ Europe family of companies. And now, I will turn the discussion over to Varun who will run you through the details of the segment results. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I will take you through a consolidated and segment results for the quarter and cover our current liquidity situation before turning it back to Nick for an update on full-year guidance. Nick described the trends behind our reported revenue of $2.7 billion, a new record for the company, so I will start with our consolidated gross margin. As noted on slide 11 of the presentation, the consolidated gross margin percentage was down 100 basis points versus the comparable quarter last year to 38.7%. Roughly 60 basis points of the decrease is attributable to our North America segment with the balance relating to our European segment. Segment EBITDA totaled $295 million for the first quarter reflecting a $5 million or 1.7% increase over the comparable quarter of 2017. As a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was down 150 basis points to 10.9%. We experienced an 80 basis point increase in our operating expenses largely due to personnel and freight expenses. During the first quarter of 2018, we also experienced a $1 million increase in restructuring and acquisition-related cost compared to the prior year and an $8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense largely due to acquisitions. With that, operating income for the first quarter of 2018 was down about $9 million or roughly 4% when compared to the same period in 2017. Non-operating items were favorable by about $2 million versus Q1 2017. Other non-operating income includes foreign exchange gains and losses and various income items such as late payment fees. Interest expense was up $4.5 million, approximately 19% year-over-year due to both higher average balances and interest rates. Pre-tax income during the first quarter of 2018 was $201 million, down $12 million or 5.6% compared to the prior year. Moving to income taxes, our annual effective tax rate was 26% for the quarter, consistent with the guidance we provided. In the first quarter of 2017, we applied an annual effective rate of 35.25%. So we're showing a $23 million decrease in the income tax provision this year mostly related to the lower U.S. federal tax rate that went into effect with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the first quarter was $0.49, up 8.9%. Adjusted EPS, which excludes restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization and the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation, was $0.55 reflecting a 12.2% improvement. Before I turn to segment commentary, I want to acknowledge the disappointment in our margins in the first quarter. At LKQ, we pride ourselves not only on being able to grow revenues as we have demonstrated yet again, but equally importantly to do so profitably. Our management team strives to obtain operating leverage in our businesses. We haven't lost that discipline, but we also know that there is work to be done to address the margin pressure we faced in the first quarter. I will provide color on the causes and actions underway designed for our long-term success. Starting with North America on slide 13, gross margins during the first quarter were 43.3%, down 110 basis points over the 44.4% reported last year. The aftermarket business represented about 70 basis points of the decline due to several factors. Firstly, rising costs for our supplies and commodities such as sheet metal and resin and ocean freight resulted in higher costs for our inventory. Our net selling prices, however, did not increase to match the higher inventory costs. Efforts are underway to redress this issue on a location, district and region level to offset this headwind. Secondly, a large part of the organic growth we experienced came through products such as automotive batteries, owing to the cold winter and certified OE parts. Both are lower margin products, which diluted the overall margin profile relative to the prior year. Thirdly, our self-serve business also contributed to the lower margin percentage, which initially seems unusual given this rising scrap prices. We are generating more gross margin dollars in 2018 than a year ago, though the gross margin percentage decline, as we process higher cost cars this year. Parts revenue tends to not grow significantly when car costs rise due to higher scrap prices and create a dilutive effect on the gross margin percentage. In Q1, we also recorded an increase to our reserves associated with returns and receivables that in aggregate cost us approximately $0.02 in EPS. We do not expect a similarly-sized charge to recur in 2018. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in our North American segment increased by 40 basis points compared to last year. We also saw a benefit of about 50 basis points from eliminating shared corporate costs of the sale of the PGW OEM business in March 2017. Outside of this benefit, overhead expenses were up 90 basis points related to freight, personnel and vehicle costs. With the high level of sales growth in the quarter, we had to rely on more third-party freight and vehicle rentals to maintain service levels. Like many companies, we too are seeing third-party freight cost rise with driver shortages, wage inflation and higher fuel costs. As Nick mentioned earlier, weather impacted certain regions such as the Northeast and Midwest, which experienced strong revenue growth, though this came at a price as we had to bring on expensive temp labor and incur overtime to keep up with demand. The premium for temp labor and overtime contributed to an increase in personnel costs outpacing revenue growth. Training is underway on a variety of fronts to address these headwinds, including adjusting third-party freight codes to reduce freight surcharges, sourcing less expensive freight options and resource management. Non-operating income and expenses had a positive impact on segment EBITDA of 30 basis points in 2018 due to a non-recurring asset write-off that was recorded in the first quarter of 2017. In total, segment EBITDA for North America during the first quarter of 2018 was $178 million, a 0.9% increase over the prior year. Looking at slide 14, scrap prices were up 37% over the comparable quarter last year and up 21% from Q4 of 2017. The benefit from scrap reflects the sequential movement in pricing, as car costs will generally follow scrap prices higher or lower over time. We saw a $13 million positive impact on profitability owing to scrap prices, which was $7 million higher than the benefit we experienced in Q1 of 2017. Moving on to our European segment on slide 15, gross margins in Europe were 35.9% in Q1, a 110 basis point decline over the comparable period in 2017. The decrease is attributable largely to our UK operations and to the mix shift at Riyadh (00:25:52), given the higher growth of the Central and Eastern European region, which has structurally lower margins. As Nick mentioned in his remarks, we experienced migration issues with our T2 facility in the first quarter that impacted our gross margin on two fronts. First, on the expense side, we incurred unbudgeted cost to address the issue, including increased personnel expenses to manually receive and stock product. And second, we launched promotional pricing to recapture our customers' business. Going forward, we expect to incur some additional period costs in Q2 and incremental COGS, as we sell through the inventory received in Q1. The effect of these factors drove the lower gross margin percentage in the UK operations, and we expect these to dissipate in the next couple of quarters. We did have some positive news on gross margins in Europe with our centralized procurement yielding a 40 basis point improvement from supplier rebate programs, and additionally our Sator business in the Benelux showed a 70 basis point improvement with specific strength in private label sales and the ongoing move from a three-step to a two-step model in that market. With respect to operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, we experienced a 120 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis versus the comparable quarter a year ago, of which 90 basis points were attributable to higher personnel costs, mostly related to branch openings and the Sator three-step to two-step model evolution which, as we've previously discussed, has higher SG&A costs, though offset by higher gross margin. To a lesser extent, we incurred additional costs in Q1 owing to information technology projects, as we continue to work on solutions to rationalize the many systems we operate across Europe today. European segment EBITDA totaled $76 million, a 4% decrease over last year. Our goal for Europe remains double-digit segment EBITDA margins over the next 36 months, barring the impact of any acquisitions that may be dilutive and Q1 was a step in the opposite direction. While we believe some of the Q1 issues will be behind us soon, we have more work to do, and John and the European management team are intensely focused on this task. Turning to our Specialty segment on slide 17, the Warn acquisition from November of last year created some noise in the quarter-over-quarter comparison and Q1 was the first full quarter for the business as part of the LKQ family. The Warn business has continued to perform well and, as previously discussed, has a higher margin profile than the base specialty segment. The base specialty business performed well in spite of flat revenues by protecting its margins. As Nick mentioned, Specialty dropped some low margin business, which had a positive impact on the overall gross margin percentage. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in Specialty were higher relative to the prior year, the primary variances related to higher personnel, vehicle and fuel expenses. Segment EBITDA for Specialty was $42 million, up 18.4% from Q1 of 2017. And as a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was up 60 basis points to 11.9%, a solid performance by the team, given the revenue headwinds. Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on slide 18, you will note that our cash flow from continuing operations for the first quarter was approximately $145 million. We talked earlier this year about the growth in inventory related to buying opportunities in our North America business. In the first quarter, we started to work down the inventory levels, and for North America, this resulted in a net cash inflow, while Specialty and Europe were outflows owing to lower than expected revenues. We remain optimistic about our ability to generate strong cash flows from operations for the full year of 2018. CapEx for the quarter was $62 million. The largest capital changes reflect the net pay-down of almost $118 million of debt, largely funded by the cash flows from operations and cash on hand. As we've shown in the past, if we slow down the acquisition pipeline, we have the ability to pay down our outstanding debt given our free cash flow generation. Moving to slide 19, as of March 31, we had approximately $3.3 billion of total debt outstanding and $246 million of cash, resulting in net debt of about $3.1 billion or about 2.7 times last 12 months' EBITDA. We have approximately $1.5 billion of availability on our line of credit, which together with our cash yields a total liquidity of $1.7 billion. On the 9th of April, we closed \u20ac1 billion of senior notes with \u20ac750 million maturing in April 2026 at a rate of 3.625% and a \u20ac250 million maturing in April 2028 at a rate of 4.125%. We are very happy with the support we saw in the market and the terms we were able to obtain despite the ongoing volatility in the capital markets. Funding the Stahlgruber transaction at a weighted average rate of 3.75% over both an 8-year and a 10-year tranche is a terrific outcome. We plan to mitigate a portion of the holding costs by paying down euro-denominated debt until the closing date. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Nick to cover the updated guidance. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thank you, Varun, for that financial overview. In light of the results achieved in the first quarter, we have adjusted our annual guidance on a few of the key financial metrics. With respect to organic growth for parts and services, we anticipate North America will remain reasonably strong, and the European and Specialty segments will show improvement as we progress through the year. That said, we have adjusted the top end of the full-year guidance range for global organic growth down from 6% to 5.5% to reflect both the 3.7% reported for Q1, a gradual acceleration in Europe in Specialty, and some continued headwinds from the new revenue recognition accounting standard. In terms of adjusted EPS, we have moved the range down to $2.20 at the low end to $2.30 at the high end to reflect both the actual results for Q1 and the fact that some of our profit improvement plans will take time to catch hold and yield results. That adjustment yields a range for adjusted net income of $685 million to $715 million, down $35 million from the prior guidance. We have also trimmed our capital spending plan a bit to a range of $235 million to $265 million. We also anticipate that the lower earnings will impact cash flow from operations, but the slightly lower revenue growth should require less working capital investment, which partially offsets the earnings impact. Accordingly, the revised cash flow guidance is $625 million to $675 million, a $25 million reduction. We still believe the effective tax rate will be approximately 26%, and the guidance assumes current levels as it relates to FX rates and scrap steel pricing. Importantly, our guidance does not \u2013 again, does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of Stahlgruber. We will come back and update our guidance once that transaction has closed. In closing, I am proud of the hard work and dedication our 43,000 employees delivered for the company, our stockholders, and most importantly our customers during the quarter. I am equally proud of our team's commitment to effectively manage the dynamics of the business, which they can control, while not losing focus on growing the business, developing our people, and continuously looking for opportunities to generate leverage and synergies from both our existing and recently acquired operations. Although we are facing some short-term headwinds, I am very confident in our team's ability to effectively implement their respective plans and continue to create significant value over the medium and longer term horizons. With that, operator, we are now ready to open up the call for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning for taking my question. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Ben. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: I want to ask about North America. The margins, in particular you described the dynamic around some of the incongruities in inventory where you needed them or where you have them, but the 6.5% growth is well above, I think, what you or we expected. And so I'm wondering, as you move through the year, can you leverage that business in light of a stronger growth environment? And how do you manage through that inventory incongruity in terms of availability, as you move through the year? Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Hey, Ben, good morning. It's Varun Laroyia speaking here. Listen, you had a great question and I think if you kind of go back to the fourth quarter discussion that we had where we had invested a significant sum into our North America inventory piece, it actually was the right decision looking back as we kind of previously mentioned in light of the strong organic revenue that we experienced. Interestingly, again the revenue growth was in our traditional crash box. So you look at bumpers, look at grills, things along those lines, which essentially paid off. So from that perspective, the inventory investment worked well. The other piece I will share with you is that during the quarter, we essentially \u2013 the net cash inflow from inventory was in North America off the back of the higher organic revenue, although Europe and Specialty was a net cash outflow due to the lower than expected sales. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: And Ben, this is Nick. The reality is, we buy our inventory \u2013 our crash inventory, aftermarket inventory from Taiwan, as you know. We do that literally a couple of months in advance because it takes time not only to get it onto the ship but over to our facilities. Most of our aftermarket inventory is shipped directly to specific warehouses in the U.S. And so those purchases and those shipments were put in place back in Q4 absolutely in anticipation that we're going to have a normal winter. The reality is the winter hit harder in some places than other, and we actually had to spend a reasonable amount of money moving inventory around in the system, particularly getting it up into the Midwest and Northeast where there was significant demand for our product. That should dissipate because our expectation is that the winter storms are absolutely behind us, although some of them hit here in April in the Midwest, but they are behind us and we will go into a more normal cadence from a geographic perspective. And so we shouldn't have the same level of expense in getting the right parts to the right place to service our customers. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great. And just one quick clarifier if I could ask on the guidance. When I'm looking at the bridge in your presentation, I see the year-over-year business growth went from $0.14 to $0.09, Andrew Page and Tamworth 2 went away, and then the tax reform rate went from $0.28 to $0.26, contributive to the bridge. I'd be curious, I may have missed this in your explanation, what happened there on the tax rate, and I think we've got an explanation on Andrew Page and T2. And then just on the exchange rate, the one last question there, we're at more favorable rates today than we were at the exit of fourth quarter, so why unchanged there on the $0.03 impact of exchange rates? Thanks. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Ben. So essentially \u2013 let me start off with each of those elements that you mentioned. So the year-over-year business growth piece really is linked in with what we had initially anticipated coming through into our European segment. If you think about the T2 and the Andrew Page accretion that we had shared as part of guidance, which was about $0.03, basically that will not be taking place as of now based on the commentary that we shared a few minutes ago. In addition to that, if you think about some of the headwinds we faced in our North America business, we feel confident of being able to recover those, but in terms of the time that's gone by in Q1, we don't believe we can recover that at this point in time. And then with regards to the tax reform piece specifically at $0.28, so our overall tax rate is consistent at the 26% rate guidance that we had given essentially due to the lower earnings. Essentially that number kind of comes down by a couple of cents essentially. So, that's the kind of $0.28 to the $0.26 EPS from a tax reform piece. And then in terms of Andrew Page and T2, that gets eliminated in terms of what we had anticipated. And then the final piece, I think, you had mentioned was in terms of exchange rates, listen the exchange rates are flat versus what we've kind of given guidance. We kind of said that there'd be a $0.03 increase from the prior year. We picked up about $0.015 in Q1, but if you think about the two key trading currencies that we have, both the sterling and also the euro, that's one piece in terms of how the earnings are getting impacted in those markets, number one. And quite frankly, if you see as to where those two currencies are trading this week versus when we had given kind of guidance, they're roughly kind of flat. I think the sterling was at an average rate of about $1.38 at the beginning of the year, it's at $1.39 to $1.40. And then the only two other currencies that we have some fairly substantial trading in is the Canadian dollar which is down and then also the Czech koruna. So overall, the FX piece remains flat at the $0.03 versus what we had guided. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks. I'll get back in the queue. Operator : Your next question comes from James Albertine with Consumer Edge. Your line is open. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Hi gentlemen, and good morning and thanks for taking my question. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Jamie. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : If I may just ask a clarification first before I ask my question. I just want to make sure I heard you right, Nick, on your comment a moment ago. It sounded like you had your conference call for the fourth quarter on the 22nd of February, winter happened in March, costs happened in March and you corrected a lot of that in April. Am I hearing that correctly? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yes, Jamie. I mean the reality is we've set guidance during our fourth quarter call, which was late February. At that point in time, we had the January results closed, February was not closed, obviously March was not closed, the weather in the UK had not occurred, the weather impacting the Specialty business had not occurred, the issues at T2 were continuing to accelerate. We haven't really \u2013 we didn't put the final software patch in there until really a couple of weeks ago early April. And so if you want to think of it, the deterioration of the performance during the quarter accelerated as we went through. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : North America specifically though, Nick, if I could just drill in on that, 6.5% organic growth, let's say that holds in 2Q. Could we expect leverage in 2Q or is that unrealistic? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Well, I think, you were \u2013 probably as Varun indicated, the issues impacting gross margins will probably hang around a little bit longer because those are not quite fixed, those are more \u2013 it can take a little bit more time to get after. But some of the operating expenses, we shouldn't have the same level of freight and expense in moving product around the country in the second and third quarter like we had during the first quarter. I mean the reality is we were scrambling to satisfy the demand from all of our customers in those areas that had gotten really hit hard by the winter weather and accordingly had good demand for the products that we are selling. And indeed, when the body shops were full up, if you will, they were incredibly focused on cycle time, and there was a shift, there was no doubt. And that's why our aftermarket product grew at a significantly faster rate than the salvage products because we can \u2013 generally speaking, we can get that to the shops faster, same day sometimes, than our salvage product, particularly if the salvage product is coming from a different state or a different part of the region, if you will. But getting that product to the customers quickly has cost. So we do anticipate that we should pick up some benefit on the operating expense line in Q2, Q3. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Yeah. I know I burned through questions there, but \u2013 yeah, go ahead, sorry. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Sorry, Jamie, just to kind of add two key comments to what Nick just mentioned. One, in terms of Q2, the lingering operating costs on the T2 piece that will come through in Q2 also while we're seeing early signs of are actually stepping up, there will be some associated cost, so there's some lingering overhang from a European perspective specifically that I wanted to highlight. The other piece I wanted to talk to was in terms of the timing, and as to as Nick mentioned, January was on target, on budget and also the initial couple of weeks in Feb were on target also. As I kind of mentioned, we got hit by a couple of cents on our returns reserve and some very specific bad debts related to export revenue. Those kind of activities really take place on a quarterly basis and that really came through when we closed the quarter. So, that's the other piece I wanted to highlight, which obviously, from a timing perspective we would not have known because that was something that came through at the end of March. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Great. Well, I've taken my share, guys. Thanks. I'll get back in queue. Appreciate your answers. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Thank you, Jamie. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Jamie. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Ryan. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Ryan. Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC: So let me ask a couple of questions on Europe. I think you said that sales have been rectified. Is that to mean that organic growth is back to that 4%-plus level here in April? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yes. The Varun's comment on sales being rectified really goes to ECP and some of the issues that we were having with the software in the automation and the like. And so we're all of 25 days into the quarter, but the last couple weeks, the revenue at ECP has been tracking to their original budget. We need to (00:47:21). Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then as a follow-up, just on to the margins and profitability, I think you said that you're going to exist the year at more normal levels. So I just want wanted to be clear, do you think by 4Q, you've got all these issues behind you? That's the first part of the question. And then secondly, what do you define as normal EBITDA margins in Europe? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So we do anticipate by the end of the year we're going to be kind of back to historical levels in each of our operating businesses in Europe. Part of what you got to keep in mind is, when the issues start to occur and we needed to keep product moving through T2, the answer there was to bring in a fair amount of incremental labor to manually move some of the product around. As you know, in Europe, the cost of the central distribution centers gets capitalized into your cost of goods sold. So, all that \u2013 we have a lot of inventory on the shelves today that will end up getting turned, say, in the second quarter, that has that higher level of costs, so you're not going to see \u2013 while the revenue, we think, will come back nicely, you're not going to see an immediate pickup in gross margin until we turn that inventory that has all that temporary labor, if you will, embedded in the cost. By the time you get to Q4, all that inventory should have been sold through the system and the margins should pick up. The reality is we thought initially that Europe would have margins well into the 9% for the year, given the impact of Q1 and the fact it's going to take some time to kind of work through the issues in the UK, if you will, margins in Europe will probably be in the low to mid-8s on a EBITDA basis for the year as a whole. Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Craig. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Craig. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning. So really this is a board-level question that I think addresses questions that I'm getting from your shareholders. Basically the board historically has incentivized revenue growth, EPS growth and ROE, but with margin improvement seemingly elusive, has the board considered maybe resetting those incentives to align better with margin expansion and ROIC? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: So the references that you made to revenue, EPS and ROE, that is one part of the overall compensation program for the senior folks here at LKQ and that's really the long-term incentive plan. And the other kind of incentives that we all work towards really go to, what we call our management incentive plan, the annual bonus plan, if you will, Craig, and on that it is entirely EPS-driven. In order to hit the EPS targets, we need to generate the margins that we're expecting for the year. So while it's not a direct tie to EBITDA margins, you can't hit the EPS estimates without hitting the margin estimates as well. So it is implicitly embedded in the fact that we need to generate good margins in order to get paid. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And then along those lines, in Europe, I think the plan was to get to 10% EBITDA margins in the next 36 months, which would be 2020. Is that still a realistic target? Thank you. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Yes. Craig, it's Varun out here. Yes, listen, clearly Q1 was a step in the opposite direction, but in terms of our commitment to getting to the 10% EBITDA margin level for our European segment, that remains as is. Clearly, it means that we need to kind of get back, and based on the prior question that Nick answered, we were expecting Europe to actually tick a little bit higher than the 8.8% full year for 2017 based on T2 and also Andrew Page. Clearly with Q1 coming in at 7.3%, full year is, as Nick mentioned, between low to mid-8s. But in terms of the exit rate has to be higher based on the second half acceleration coming on segment EBITDA margins in Europe to help us get back on track to the 10% goal that we've previously stated. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Craig. Operator : Your next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is open. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Bret. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Morning, Bret. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : On the Specialty business, I think you said the word noise with Warn. Was Warn in your opinion sort of inflating the growth rates of Specialty and the number that we saw was more in line, and I guess in the sense that you called out RV as a softer category and related to weather, is there anything particularly going on in that space? Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, Bret, let me answer the first part of the question. So, with regards to Warn which we closed on the 1st of November, really the noise was associated with Q4 results with regards to the step up of the inventory as a result of acquisition accounting. So really this was the first full quarter that we had with the business being part of our family. In terms of the growth, that specifically does not get caught up in our organic growth. We actually called Warn out separately as acquisition growth. So really if you think and you back off that Warn acquisition, the organic growth that we called out at the kind of 30 bps, that basically is the kind of bifurcation to kind of think through the revenue growth piece of it. With regards to RV sales, let me kind of put it back to Nick to give you some sense on that. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So the RV sales were basically in line with the overall growth. I mean, none of the Specialty business, if you will, was dramatically higher or dramatically lower, if you will, than the overall organic, though it did drop off in March. And we think a fair amount of that had to do with the dislocation from the storms because particularly kind of in the traditional winter states, if you will, when all those snowstorms went rolling through, people weren't outfitting their RVs and the like. That may just be a timing issue and may come back, but we're being cautious in our outlook there, Bret. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then the impact from T2 on the UK business, sounds like you had out of stocks as well as a number of other issues over there and some weather. You used to talk about core store sales or stores open for more than 12 months in the ECP business. Can we get a feeling for how that business looked in the quarter and maybe what we're seeing in April? Are we seeing recovery in comp? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So the overall growth in the UK was flat year-over-year as I mentioned in my comments. And the reality is the traditional stores, these stores open more than a year were a little bit flat and the new stores didn't add a whole lot to the overall growth. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: And just to add one point, as you know, we obviously shut certain stores as part of the Andrew Page integration once we had the ability and the stay separate hold order was removed. We did shut 10 stores within the quarter also, which obviously shows as negative organic. So, just want to kind of highlight that piece. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. So your comp was flat despite the disruption from the T2 out of stocks? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yes. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And T2 was back running \u2013 I guess, are we running T2 still or are we trying to fix T2 and running off of legacy distribution right now? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: No, no, no, no. You got to understand, it's not like the T2 facility was totally shut down. All of our 225 branches, ECP branches in the UK are being fulfilled exclusively on the traditional service parts out of T2. It was on the margin, there were throughput issues with the facility. So I mean we're processing tens of thousands of fulfillment orders each and every day out of T2. The issue that was happening, Bret, is at some point in time, the trucks need to leave the distribution center to go replenish the branches so they have stock for the next day. We get orders all the way up into \u2013 replenishment orders all the way up to 5, 6 o'clock in the evening, the trucks leave by 8 o'clock in the evening. Some of those late orders weren't getting queued in in time and weren't getting picked. And so, that replenishment wasn't happening. And as you know, in the UK, over half of our revenue in the UK gets delivered within 60 minutes of when we get the call from the customer requesting a product. So if the product is not in the branch, it's not going to get sold and it was just on the margin, there were some fast-moving parts that didn't get picked in time, didn't hit the delivery truck and weren't in the branch in the next day, okay? It's not like T2 was down for days at a time. Nothing could be further from the truth. It was just the throughput wasn't as strong as it was designed to be, okay? And we were putting software patches in as we are proceeding through the quarter trying to fix the issue working hand in hand obviously with our outside vendors who help design and install the entire system. You all see the T2 facility in action on our Analyst Day on the 31st of May because we're holding it over at T2. You're going to see it is a massive facility. And so we're just on the margin, we were out of stock in certain parts and so instead of fulfilling our branches at 99.9% of the time, we were fulfilling the branches at a slightly lower rate and that had an impact on revenue. Again based on the two weeks of data that we have from when that last software patch was put into place, the revenue at T2, the fulfillment, the stocking levels all seem to be holding with the original budget. So we have confidence that the revenue will come back. It's not lost forever. We do though have inventory in the shelves that include all that incremental cost. So it's going to take some time to bleed through. And so we won't get the same \u2013 the pickup on the gross margin line won't be as pickup on the revenue line. Hopefully, that helps. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay, thanks. That does. Thank you. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Bret. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. David Kelly - JPMorgan Asset Management : Hey, good morning, guys. It's David Kelly on for Ryan. Just a couple of quick ones for me, and I guess just first trying to bridge the gap between your North American organic growth and the CCC data you referenced, and I know you've spoken about the shifting vehicle population within your age sweet spot, how it's been a headwind for you. Do you think we're reaching that inflection point where the vehicle age mix is again either a positive now or will be a positive in the next, call it, 12 months or so? And then just as a follow-up, how do you view or what's your view on underlying collision repair demand in 2018? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So we don't see huge shifts in the car park, which is I think where your question was headed. Clearly as we've included in our standard investor materials that sweet spot, if you will, in 2018 as we've said for some time is coming back into our favor, if you will. And you think about the number of cars that are in that 3- to 10-year timeframe, which is really the sweet spot for collision products, if you will. Again, there are big, big regional differences in the CCC data as relates to the growth. And those states that I talked about, think about the high population Snow Belt winter states, we had exceptionally strong results. The West and the Southeast were \u2013 we still had growth, but not as high. But when you think about the 6.5% organic, again about 100 basis points of that came from that new program that we have in distributing batteries, which says everything else was up 5.5%. The core aftermarket collision product was up well north \u2013 well north of the 5.5%. Engines and transmissions were in that 5% to 6% range. Collision product from salvage, again because people were buying more aftermarket than salvage, was kind of in the lower single digits. Our glass business was double digits, which was terrific. Some of the product lines that have been slow growers over the past several quarters continue to be slow growers. Paint was flat. Paint accessories if you think about sandpaper and Bondo and tools and the like was down just a little bit. Cooling continued to be negative, if you will. But again, it was a terrific quarter from a overall North American revenue perspective. Again, Mother Nature absolutely helped this out because the winter was \u2013 from our perspective, particularly in the Snow Belt states whereas a \u2013 for us a better than average winter, more severe winter, which leads to more collisions. And the CCC data would absolutely support that with a number of those states having repairable claims in the 5% to 6% growth rate, if you will. The Western, Southwest and the Southeast, most of those states were actually negative year-over-year. So we're comfortable that North America will continue to grow nicely for the rest of the year. I'm not going to say that we're going to be able to do 6.5% because we know that Mother Nature helped us, but we think it's going to remain very healthy. And we think that's in part because of our competitive position, in part because of the continued soft tailwinds related to the car park and the sweet spot. The reality is we think alternative part usage is again trending up just a little bit at a time but every little bit helps, and then obviously a good weather condition. So, hopefully, that answers your question. David Kelly - JPMorgan Asset Management : Yeah. That's great. I really appreciate all the color. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: (01:04:01) for giving me the chance to ask the questions. So, Nick, I have an AB kind of my \u2013 on my read-through what you're saying is that the top line is going to be okay relative to your original expectations. You're bearing more costs to execute that for the reasons you've said, I think that's accurate. Specifically to 2Q, am I right reading through that 2Q EBITDA in North America and again Europe will be up versus 1Q on a margin basis, but down year-over-year? But I'll reverse the negatives, it gradually starts lifting each subsequent quarter to finish the year at the levels you've adjusted to. Is that the right way to think about what I'm hearing? Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. Well, again, Michael, as you know, we don't provide quarterly guidance if you will. But traditionally, you can see how our margins flow from a quarter-to-quarter basis. We would anticipate that those quarterly flows, if you will, will occur if you're in 2018 as well, particularly in North America. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So I just want to make sure do you expect the trend sequentially to improve? Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: We think that the traditional trends of how margins flow throughout the year will be consistent in 2018. Last year, if you will, between Q1 and Q2, Q1 was 14.6% and Q2 was 14.4%, so pretty close to the same. We would probably expect something similar where Q2 margins would be very similar to Q1 margins here in 2018. We may get a little bit of a pickup as I indicated on the operating expense line, but again some of the programs we're putting in place aren't going to fully catch hold until the back half of the year. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's the clarity I was trying to get. And then one last follow-up, this is a tough question, but I got to ask it. So, what was the message you were giving about the outlook for the business when you were in the bond market at the end of March or beginning of April? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Taken as a whole, our business continues to be incredibly strong. Our credit stats even with \u2013 the softness in Q1, the credit stats really don't move it hardly at all. I mean our leverage ratios and the like aren't as impacted by $0.01 here or there in EPS. And obviously, we were able to price on a very attractive basis. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, absolutely. And Michael again just to add to what Nick just said, apart from the credit stats, the overall underlying cash flow generation of the business, that continues to move in the right direction. So even in a sequential quarter basis Q4 going into Q1, we kind of more than doubled our overall free cash flow in any case. Nothing has been impacted from that perspective, all the kind of inventory that we had invested in in the fourth quarter in North America with growth coming through actually was a net cash inflow from the inventory piece of it. So the underlying credit stats, the underlying improving credit history the company has, the underlying cash generation abilities of the business, nothing has changed from that perspective. And the bigger picture of things, we had a pretty robust outlook in any case. And over the long term, we price two tranches, 8 years and 10 years. We are building the business for the long term and we believe that that will continue. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So just to be clear, you told the bond market, when you're in the market that you're going to have a soft first quarter, but showed them all the good fundamental credit trends and that's why \u2013 because it priced well, but they knew that you had a soft first quarter. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: No. The bond market, Michael, is much less focused on quarter-to-quarter earnings. There were no discussions about quarterly flow when we were on the roadshow. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. I just wanted to make sure I understood that. Okay, thank you. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Okay. Thanks, Michael. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Mr. Zarcone. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Well, we thank everyone for your time here today. I know we ran a little bit long, but given the release, we wanted to make sure we could get to everybody's questions. Again, we need to leave this conversation recognizing that LKQ is a very strong company. We are very optimistic about the prospects of our company, not only just for the rest of the year, but for a long time to come. We have the preeminent competitive position in almost every business that we have around the globe, and we've got 43,000 people working hard to service our customers each and every day. We run into some headwinds, we understand that, we have plans in place to make corrections. It's not going to happen overnight, but we're very confident in our ability to get back to our traditional levels of growth and profitability in each of our businesses. And that's the message I'd leave with you here this morning. So again, we thank you for your time and your participation in our call, and we look forward to seeing many of you in Tamworth at the end of May for our Analyst Day and then obviously chatting with you again in July when we report our second quarter results. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for LKQ Corporation's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Mr. Joe Boutross, LKQ Corporation's Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Joseph P. Boutross - LKQ Corp.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's slide presentation. And, with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Mr. Nick Zarcone. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. We certainly appreciate your time and attention at this early hour as we adjusted the timing of our call. We are pleased to share both the results of our most recent quarter and the progress made on the various initiatives we've implemented since our first quarter call. I will provide some high-level comments and then Varun will dig in a bit further into the segments and related financial details before I come back to discuss our updated 2018 guidance and make a few closing remarks. Overall, we had an excellent second quarter, highlighted by exceptional revenue growth in each of our segments, progress on improving margins and a successful closing of the STAHLGRUBER acquisition. As noted on slide 4, consolidated revenue was a record $3.031 billion, reflecting a 23% increase over the $2.458 billion recorded in the second quarter of last year. This is the first time the company has crossed the $3 billion threshold in a quarter. Total revenue growth from parts and services was 22.8% during the second quarter, while organic revenue growth in parts and services on a global basis came in at a robust 7.2%. As mentioned over the past several quarters, very few companies in our sector are generating organic growth anywhere close to our level. Diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ stockholders for the second quarter of 2018 was $0.50 as compared to $0.49 for the same period of 2017, an increase of 2%. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ stockholders for the second quarter of 2018 was $0.61 a share, an increase of 15% as compared to the $0.53 for the same period of 2017. These EPS results were slightly above our expectations and due largely to the strong revenue growth and progress on the profit enhancement plans discussed last quarter. Let's turn to the operating highlights. As you'll note from slide 6, total parts and services revenue for our North American segment grew 8.3% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the comparable quarter of last year. Organic revenue growth for parts and services for our North American segment during the quarter was 7.4%, which was ahead of our expectations. We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that, according to CCC Information Services, collision and liability related auto claims on a national basis were essentially flat in the second quarter of 2018 compared to last year and down sequentially from the 0.8% growth recorded in the first quarter. As was the case in Q1, there continue to be meaningful variances in growth rates across the geographic regions of North America. We believe that significant outperformance in our growth relative to the CCC data for repairable claims is due to the continued increase in the number of vehicles in our collision sweet spot, that being model years 3 to 10 years old as well as a continued market share gain. Also, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, our performance in Q2 was achieved, while miles driven in the United States were up only 0.8% on a nationwide basis in May, although like the claims data there were significant regional differences. The organic growth for aftermarket parts continued to outpace that of salvage parts, as the repair shops continued to focus on improving cycle times given the increased volume of work they were processing. Importantly, we continue to see increases in the total aftermarket collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 5.7% and 12.6%, respectively in the second quarter. Our North American team made solid progress with their recovery efforts related to many areas, including reducing unwarranted discounts, driving higher levels of stops and orders per vehicle per day with Roadnet, and reducing fleet maintenance cost per mile. These are just a sample of the several initiatives in play. We know there is more opportunity to be garnered and we are not done. Importantly, we have the right team in place to execute on our plan and capture these opportunities. Lastly, on North America and as many of you know, during Q1 and Q2 of 2018, three U.S. Code trade statutes were cited by the President of the United States as requiring investigation due to national security concerns and intellectual property rights violations. Today, under the enacted round 1 of Section 301, there has been little impact on LKQ from the tariffs or the subsequent Canadian countermeasures given that most of the U.S. origin product shipped to Canada are indirect or stocking transfers. With that said, if the imposition of tariffs gains further traction and leads to price inflation in our North American segment, we, like many other domestic distributors exposed to tariffs, expect to pass along these increases to our customers. That said, it'll be important to keep in mind that we will not be able to earn a profit on any increases related to cover the tariffs. So, should tariffs become a real consideration, it will appear as though gross profit and EBITDA as a percent of revenue will be a bit lower. Moving to the other side of the Atlantic, our European segment achieved total parts and services revenue growth of 44.2%. Organic revenue growth for parts and services was a very strong 8.3%, reflecting a significant snap-back from Q1 levels, and performance well ahead of our expectations. Acquisitions added an additional 28.8% to revenue growth in Europe during the second quarter of 2018, due largely to STAHLGRUBER being included in the June 2018 results, while the strengthening of the euro and sterling when compared to the second quarter of last year resulted in an FX-related revenue increase of 7.1%. All of the major operating units in Europe achieved organic growth in excess of 7% with the strong results reflecting both the reversal of the negative impact of the timing of Easter experienced in Q1, and the absence of major weather disruptions. In addition, you will recall that the UK had soft revenue growth in Q1 due in part to some of the branch replenishment issues related to bringing the T2 distribution facility online. During the last call, we mentioned that the software issues related to the automated elements of this large distribution center appeared to have been largely rectified in early April and sales were trending back to normal levels. Based on the excellent Q2 revenue growth at ECP, you can see that that was indeed the case. As you know, there were two redundant distribution facilities that were slated to close as part of the overall T2 project plan. As previously disclosed, one closed at year-end and, as expected, the other was vacated and handed back to the landlord in the second quarter. So, those costs are now fully behind us. With respect to Andrew Page, we continue to integrate and rationalize the Andrew Page branches that we were allowed to retain. And I am happy to report that the entire Andrew Page branch network is now completely being replenished out of the T2 distribution facility. Additionally, Andrew Page's national distribution center was vacated and returned to the landlord a few weeks ago, with the head office functions still to be consolidated by year-end. At this time, we are in the process of selling 11 Andrew Page branches, including the 9 required by the UK competition authorities and two additional branches that are focused on the commercial vehicle markets. We anticipate the divestiture will close shortly. During the second quarter, we opened up a total of 17 new branches in Europe, including two new locations in Western Europe and 15 new locations in Eastern Europe. Overall, it was a terrific quarter for our European operations from a revenue perspective, and we made meaningful positive progress on the margin front, which Varun will discuss in more detail. Let's move on to our Specialty segment. During the second quarter, Specialty reported total revenue growth of 13.6%, including organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.1% and then the Warn acquisition added an additional 9 points of growth. As you may recall, Specialty was negatively impacted by the harsh March storms both on the demand side for our RV-focused products and our ability to distribute and serve certain markets. Given this dynamic, we believe that during the second quarter, there was a bit of pent-up demand that we were able to capture, further validating the sustainability and resiliency of our business model. Also, the industry leading product design and development efforts at Warn continues under LKQ's ownership. Warn recently introduced the next generation of powersport winches called AXON and VRX, products that have received tremendous positive feedback from both our customers and industry press. Moving on to corporate development matters; on May 31 of 2018, the company announced the closing of its acquisition of STAHLGRUBER. This transaction demonstrates our ongoing strategy to expand our European footprint. We believe that STAHLGRUBER's leading market position in Germany, unparalleled distribution network, unique value proposition and strong leadership team will play a pivotal role in our efforts to grow LKQ's business in Europe. As many of you know, prior to the closing of the STAHLGRUBER acquisition, the European Antitrust Commission cleared the transaction with the exception of the wholesale business of STAHLGRUBER in the Czech Republic, which was referred for review to the Czech Republic competition authority. Accordingly, the operations in the Czech Republic, which represented an immaterial portion of STAHLGRUBER's revenue and profitability, have been temporarily retained by the seller. That said, we have filed our application with the Czech Republic antitrust authorities and have responded in early July to their comments. We remain optimistic about receiving clearance to acquire the Czech-based business of STAHLGRUBER and we'll report on our progress during our Q3 call. In addition to our acquisition of STAHLGRUBER, we completed four small acquisitions of wholesale businesses in Europe, including one in the UK and three in Sweden for a total net consideration of approximately $7 million during the quarter. And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun who will run through the details of the segment results. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I will take you through our consolidated segment results for the quarter and cover our current liquidity before turning it back to Nick for an update on full year guidance. Overall, we are pleased with our results for the quarter. After a disappointing start to the year, we feel we're headed back in the right direction. While there is still a ways to go to get our margins back to the desired levels, the initiatives we've put in place are showing promise with some benefits reflected in the second quarter and others primed for the rest of the year. As Nick mentioned, we closed the STAHLGRUBER transaction in late May. So, we have one month of operating results in our Q2 figures. I'll highlight the impact of STAHLGRUBER in the quarter as relevant later in my remarks. As noted on slide 13 of the presentation, the consolidated gross margin percentage was down 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 38.3%. Roughly 70 basis points of the decrease is attributable to our Europe segment with the balance relating to our North America segment. Segment EBITDA totaled $342 million for the first quarter, reflecting a $36 million or a 12% increase over the comparable quarter of 2017. As a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was down 110 basis points to 11.3%. We saw a 30 basis points increase in our operating expenses, largely due to freight and vehicle expenses in our North America segment. And during the second quarter of 2018, we experienced a $13 million increase in restructuring and acquisition-related costs compared to the prior year and a $10 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, both largely due to the STAHLGRUBER acquisition that we closed on May 30. With that, operating income for the second quarter of 2018 increased by about $12 million or roughly 5% when compared to the same period of 2017. Non-operating items were unfavorable by about $6 million versus Q2 of 2017. The change in gains on bargain purchase and an impairment loss on Andrew Page related to the branches to be divested represent $5 million of the unfavorable variance. Other non-operating income primarily related to foreign currency losses represented the remaining variance. Interest expense was up $14 million year-over-year due to higher average balances and higher interest rates. And interest in the second quarter related to the STAHLGRUBER financing was $11 million. Pre-tax income during the second quarter of 2018 was $218 million, down $8 million or 3% compared to the prior year. Moving to income taxes, our effective tax rate was 27.9% for the quarter. We updated our estimate of the annual effective tax rate during the second quarter to 27%, up 100 basis points from our previous estimate in Q1. The higher rate is driven mostly by the effects of the STAHLGRUBER transaction, including non-deductible interest and deal costs, as well as the higher effective tax rate in Germany. For your long-term forecasting, please note that about 60 basis points of the rate increase is related to non-deductible interest and deal costs, and should fall off in 2019. Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the second quarter was $0.50, up $0.01 relative to the comparable quarter a year ago. Adjusted EPS, which excludes restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, acquisition and divestiture-related gains and losses, and the tax benefit associated with stock-based comp, was $0.61, reflecting a 15% improvement. STAHLGRUBER's results were consistent with the projected impact as we discussed during Investor Day with a negative impact on the quarter totaling approximately $0.02. While the STAHLGRUBER operating results were solid for the month of June, the negative impacts from pre-acquisition interest cost related to the euro note offerings, the tax impact from non-deductible interest cost, and the dilution effect from issuing 8 million shares caused the overall negative impact on the quarter, as we had communicated on May 31 at our Investor Day. Moving to the segments, with North America on slide 16, gross margins during the second quarter were 43.1%, down 80 basis points over the 43.9% reported a year ago. The decrease was primarily attributable to mix, with strong revenue growth in some of our lower-margin product lines, including batteries and reman engines. Additionally, we experienced some softening in salvage margins, as a result of increasing car costs. The base aftermarket business performed consistently with the prior year comparable period. And while we don't typically talk much about sequential changes, I want to highlight a few points related to activities in the second quarter. Our second quarter gross margin percentage declined sequentially by 20 basis points. Though this variance was driven mostly by our self-service business as a result of the rising cost trend we referenced last quarter. On a positive note, our aftermarket business increased its gross margin percentage sequentially by 30 basis points. The North American management team has made a good start towards addressing cost pressures, by adjusting net prices in aftermarket to boost margin without sacrificing revenue growth. We are encouraged by the progress the team made in the quarter and are optimistic about our ability to maintain these net pricing levels. Moving on to operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in our North America segment, these increased by 30 basis points compared to a year ago, but were down 20 basis points sequentially. Consistent with last quarter, we're still facing headwinds related to freight and fuel costs like many other distributors, and these costs drove a 60 basis point increase over the prior year. We are actively working to address these headwinds to the extent we can, given the macroeconomic scenario, including adjusting third-party freight costs to reduce freight surcharges, sourcing less expensive freight options, and resource management. Going in the other direction, we had a partial offset of 30 basis points from a non-recurring charge in Q2 of 2017 related to a contingent liability. Non-operating income and expenses had a negative impact on segment EBITDA of 20 basis points in 2018, due to an increase in various miscellaneous expenses in the second quarter of 2018. In total, segment EBITDA of North America during the second quarter of 2018 was $175 million, roughly flat compared to last year and as a percentage of revenue was down 130 basis points from the prior year quarter. Sequential EBITDA margin is down 30 basis points, which reflects a seasonal pattern in our North America business. Prior to 2018, four of the prior five years had lower margins in Q2 versus Q1 in a range of 20 to 140 basis points. We also started to incur the incremental employee benefit costs as discussed on prior calls in Q2, which negatively impacted our sequential margin. In this context, we're encouraged by the relatively small sequential decrease, but we're clearly not where we think we can be. Looking at slide 18, scrap prices were up 33% over the comparable quarter last year and flat relative to Q1 of 2018. The benefit from scrap reflects the sequential movement in pricing, as car costs will generally follow scrap prices higher or lower over time. As such, there was minimal year-over-year impact from changes in scrap prices on our reported results. Moving on to our European segment on slide 19, gross margins in Europe were 36% in Q2, a 120 basis point decline over the comparable period of 2017. The decrease is attributable largely to our UK operations and to the mix shift given the acquisitions and organic growth of the Central and Eastern European region which has structurally lower margins. As we've discussed over the past few months, the migration issues with our T2 facility in the first quarter had an ongoing negative impact in Q2, as some of the incremental costs capitalized into inventory were recorded in the income statement as the inventory turned. Going forward, we expect to see the remaining incremental capitalized costs flow through COGS in the second half of the year, primarily in Q3. We did have some positive news on gross margins in Europe with our centralized procurement, yielding a 30 basis point improvement from supplier rebate programs. Also, our Sator business in the Benelux region showed continuing margin expansion, contributing a 30 basis point improvement to the segment with a specific strength in private label sales and the ongoing move from a three-step to a two-step model in that market. The STAHLGRUBER impact on gross margin percentage was immaterial in the quarter. With respect to operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, we experienced a 30 basis point decrease on a consolidated European basis versus the comparable quarter a year ago. The improvement was primarily attributable to leverage as we could grow revenue at a greater rate than our costs, including facility, freight and advertising expenses. European segment EBITDA totaled $111 million, a 33% increase over a year ago. As shown on slide 21, relative to the second quarter of 2017, the British pound was up 6% and the euro had strengthened 8% against the U.S. dollar. Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 8.6% for Q2 2018, down 80 basis points from the same period a year ago. Our goal for Europe remains double-digit segment EBITDA margins over the next 36 months. Excluding the impact of the STAHLGRUBER acquisition, which was dilutive by 10 basis points, Q2 was a step in the right direction with a sequential margin improvement of 130 basis points. We have more work to do and the European management team are intensely focused on this task. Related to Europe, I'd also like to share some news on our equity interest in Mekonomen, a leading car parts and service chain in the Nordic region. We don't control the entity and so do not consolidate Mekonomen's results in our reported figures. Instead, we record our share of its income in the equity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries line on our income statement. Since we acquired our shares of Mekonomen, its market cap has declined by approximately 25% as of June 30. While we concluded that no permanent impairment has occurred as of June 30, we will be monitoring developments closely over the next quarter as we evaluate the possibility of an impairment. That said, we remain optimistic about Mekonomen's future prospects, including its recently announced acquisition in Denmark and Poland. And we look forward to continuing our partnership with them in Europe. Turning to our Specialty segment on slide 22, the business continues to deliver solid results. The Warn business is performing well and, as previously disclosed, has a higher margin profile than the base Specialty segment. Warn contributed 90 basis points to the growth in the gross margin percentage. The base Specialty business, i.e. without Warn, generated a 4.1% organic revenue growth rate in the quarter, which was a nice rebound from Q1 and we were encouraged that we were able to do so, while maintaining gross margin expansion. Specialty underwent a program to rationalize some low-margin business which had a positive impact on the overall gross margin percentage in the quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in Specialty were 120 basis points higher relative to the prior year. The primary variances related to higher personnel, vehicle and fuel expenses and the impact of Warn, which has a higher overhead expense structure than the base business. Segment EBITDA for Specialty was $56 million, up 15% from Q2 of 2017. And as a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was up 20 basis points to 13.6%. Moving on to capital allocation and the balance sheet, as presented on slide 24 you will note that our cash flow from continuing operations for the first six months of 2018 was $329 million. We talked in February about the growth in inventory related to buying opportunities in our North American business. In the first half of the year, we've maintained a modest cash outflow of $13 million related to inventory, as we could support our strong organic growth without a significant investment in inventory. Receivables represent an outflow through the first six months which follows the seasonality of the business with our highest sales in the first half of the year. Payables represent a $25 million outflow through June of this year, which is nearly a $90 million swing to the negative relative to a year ago. Payables fluctuate from period to period based on purchasing activity and timing of payments. Payables is one of the more volatile line items on the cash flow, and historically we've seen periods with inflows followed by outflows and vice versa. So, I expect to see some bounce-back in the second half. Overall, we remain optimistic about our ability to generate strong cash flows from operations for the full year of 2018. CapEx for the quarter was $53 million and $115 million for the year-to-date period. The largest capital changes reflect the impact of the STAHLGRUBER transaction. In April, we issued \u20ac1 billion senior notes in 8- and 10-year tranches at a weighted average rate of 3.75% to fund the STAHLGRUBER transaction. Additionally, we borrowed approximately $80 million on our line of credit and issued 8.1 million shares to complete the financing of the transaction. Moving to slide 25, as of June 30, we had approximately $4.5 billion of total debt outstanding and $345 million of cash, resulting in a net debt number of about $4.1 billion or 3.1 times last 12 months EBITDA. Excluding the STAHLGRUBER transaction, with the debt pay-down in the first quarter and a further pay-down in the second quarter totaling $162 million for the first six months, we continue to make good progress in reducing our net leverage. At this net debt ratio, our credit facility margin increased by 25 basis points in June. So, we'll see a higher interest cost on all of our credit facility borrowings until we reduce our net leverage ratio below the 2.75 times tier of the credit facility. The impact of this interest rate increase was included in our STAHLGRUBER accretion estimate. And finally, we have approximately $1.6 billion of availability on our credit facility, which together with our cash yields total liquidity of $1.9 billion. With that said, I'll turn the call back to Nick to cover the updated guidance. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Varun. In light of the results achieved in the second quarter and the closing of STAHLGRUBER, we have adjusted our annual guidance on a few of the key financial metrics. With respect to organic growth for parts and services, we anticipate all the segments will continue to report reasonably strong results, though not quite at very high levels achieved in the second quarter. Accordingly, we have adjusted the bottom end of the full year guidance range for global organic growth up from 4% to 4.5% and have kept the top end of the range steady at 5.5%. In terms of adjusted earnings per share, we have moved the range up to $2.25 to $2.33 a share, with a midpoint of $2.29. This reflects both the better-than-anticipated results for the second quarter, the anticipated accretion from the STAHLGRUBER transaction, offset by the weaker euro and sterling which are down 4% and 6% respectively from when we set guidance last quarter, and the slight uptick in the estimated effective tax rate as we continue to refine the impact of the tax law changes and the STAHLGRUBER acquisition. Currencies and taxes collectively account for approximately a negative $0.04 a share impact relative to our prior guidance. So, as to be clear, starting with the midpoint of our prior guidance which was $2.25 a share, we added $0.05 for STAHLGRUBER, $0.03 for the strong Q2, and then backed off the $0.04 for the negative currency and tax rate impacts to get to the new midpoint of $2.29 a share. Those adjustments yield a range for adjusted net income of $710 million to $735 million. We also anticipate that the higher earnings will have a positive impact on cash flow from operations and have revised the guidance range to $660 million on the low end and $710 million at the high end, a $35 million increase. We have also increased our capital spending plan a bit to a range of $255 million to $285 million, reflecting the inclusion of STAHLGRUBER and the addition of a few large facility expansion opportunities, primarily in our North American wholesale operations. We believe the effective tax rate will be approximately 27% and the guidance assumes the current levels as it relates to FX rates. This guidance does not include any impact from the pending tariffs nor does it assume any meaningful impact from scrap price fluctuations, though there is a reasonable amount of speculation in the market that prices may come under pressure if the Chinese restrict the amount of imported recycled material. In closing, I am very proud of the hard work and dedication of our 49,000 employees and I am equally proud of the team's efforts to effectively address the headwinds encountered in the first quarter. While we have made good progress, there is substantial room for improvement and I am confident in our team's ability to effectively implement their respective plans. Finally, I would like to publicly welcome the entire STAHLGRUBER organization to the LKQ team. We could not be more excited to have you as our colleagues and partners, and we look forward to working with you in the months and years ahead. And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Nick, I realize the trade dynamics are fluid, but a bigger picture, how would you frame your sourcing exposure geographically? I guess, I'm asking, for example, what percentage of European costs of goods sold would be sourced from Europe, the U.S.A. and China and maybe the same question for the U.S., just so we can put some context around these tariffs. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Craig, and good morning. Yeah. The tariff issue is trying to hit a moving target, right, because there's five different programs under two different trade statutes that are somewhere between 40 years old and 60 years old that are currently at play. The reality is in our North American business, the entirety of the salvage supply chain is from the U.S. So, there's no impact related to our salvage business. The vast majority of our aftermarket product comes from Taiwan. And Taiwan is not deemed to be China. So, it's not really impacted by the tariffs that are exclusively kind of focused on China. But the last of the five programs which has very little detail around it, Craig, relates to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 where the President is talking about putting a 20% or 25% tariff on all imported automobiles and auto parts. But that's on a country-by-country specific basis, and they haven't been clear as to what countries are included in that. So, that's probably potentially the biggest exposure. When you look at the original tariff item related to steel and aluminum under Section 232, there is really no impact on us because that really related to raw materials. Under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, there's three different rounds. Round one put the tariffs on 818, what they call, tariff headings. That went into effect actually on July 6, so that's real and live. We have about 60 products that fall under those 818 headings and so the tariff impact there will be less than $5 million. Round two, which was proposed on June 20, it put a 25% surcharge on another 284 tariff headings, and we think the impact there is rather minimal. The round three, which was just kind of introduced as a possibility a couple weeks ago, put another 10% surcharge on another 6,031 tariff headings. And that's probably going to have a bigger impact actually on our PGW business, because a lot of the windshields that we distribute on the aftermarket side come from China and our Specialty business, if you will. We don't see a lot of impact on our European business from the tariff structure and the trade issues that are in the press these days, because almost all of the inventory that we sell in Europe is procured either from European or Asian sources. We're not buying product from the U.S. and moving it over to Europe. So, hopefully that helps. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: It does. Thank you, Nick. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, and congratulations on the quarter B. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thanks, Ryan. Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC: So, I have a question on North America aftermarket gross margins. I think \u2013 it sounds like you've made some progress on passing along product price increases that you've seen from your suppliers, along with passing on for higher freight. Did I hear that correctly? And then, the second part of that question is, by the end of the year, do you think you'll make more progress such that price/cost in that aftermarket piece can be neutralized? Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Hey, Ryan, good morning. It's Varun Laroyia calling in. Yes, listen, to your question about aftermarket, the base business, which is our traditional crash parts, we have been able to offset some of the margin pressures. As we'd mentioned, our recovery plans are well underway. The North American management team has been working hard on these pieces and they continue to go through tiers of customers, as we had spoken about previously. So, yes, they've made good progress. But again, as we'd mentioned previously, given the size and scale of the activity, this element will keep ramping up through the second half also. So, while we were in a position to essentially get our aftermarket margins flat on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter versus where they were trending previously, so that's been stabilized. And, yes, we do expect that piece to continue to ramp up through the back end of the year. Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Ben. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: I want to ask about, in North America, the relationship between organic growth and margins. I suspect April was a challenge to the quarter as it relates to the disparity in demand across geographies that you saw in the first quarter. And I'm just curious as to how much of that sustained inclement weather into April lifted organic growth, but also suppressed gross margins. And then, as we think about the sequential move into the back half of the year, do you think you can show margins up year-over-year in the back half? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Ben, this is Nick. I'll start and I'll let Varun jump in afterwards. So, there's no doubt that the demand in our North American business, particularly on the collision side of the business, has been very strong. You saw some very good growth in Q1, some continued excellent growth in Q2 and that growth was really pretty consistent throughout the quarter. On the margin side, we were coming off of a soft Q1 and so the margins in the quarter actually got better as we marched through the three months of the quarter. That's why Varun indicated just a moment ago that we anticipate that we're going to continue to make good progress through the back half of the year. But, Varun, do you want to add? Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, absolutely. Hey, Ben, good morning. Yes. Listen, I think to the second part of your question in terms of what we anticipate versus a year ago for North America margins and if you turn to slide 16 of the earnings deck, you'll see that the first half typically is a strong set of results for us from a margin perspective. And then, typically seasonality does tend to play its part with regards to mix. So, for example, in the first half of the year, we do tend to have more collision parts in the North America mix and that typically tends to tail off. But if you think about the dip that we have traditionally experienced first half to the second half, we don't expect that to be as significant to what we've seen in prior years. So, back to the point about a year ago 12.9% and 12.7% in Q3 and Q4 for North American margins, we would not see that, call it, 160, 170-point decline from the first half that we just reported for 2018. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.: Understood. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge. Your line is open. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Great. Thank you. Good morning. Appreciate taking the question. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Jamie. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning. Wanted to ask sort of more of a strategic question and congratulations on closing STAHLGRUBER. But wanted to look \u2013 kind of looking ahead and you traditionally take some time off after larger scale deals like STAHLGRUBER. But wanted to see kind of what your view was on sort of the growth strategy looking out over the longer term. Or are you at a size now where it makes more sense to sort of reinvest in sort of internally making sure the margin trajectories in North America, Europe and so forth sort of stabilize and start to grow again? And we can kind of think of this as about sort of optimizing the portfolio you have versus growing via acquisition and sort of via roll-up into the future. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. Jamie, this is Nick. And I'll just take everyone back to May 31 at our Investor Day at T2. And what we mentioned then is we've just come off the largest acquisition in the history of the company, the acquisition of STAHLGRUBER which, again, we are thrilled to have as part of our family of companies and we think there's huge benefits that will accrue in the years to come, but that's \u2013 there's a big integration to go on there. But the reality is we expect to do both. We'll continue to grow our business through acquisition over the next three to five years. Having said that, we also need to optimize \u2013 I think that's the word to use and I think it was a very good choice of words \u2013 we need to optimize what we currently owned. And so, it's not really an either/or. As I indicated back on May 31, no one should expect another blockbuster transaction, anything close to something like STAHLGRUBER in the near term, right, because we have a lot on our plate and we're going to be focused on making sure we get the integration right. But over time as our leverage comes down and the like, if and when the right opportunity arises, we would be willing to again do something on a slightly larger scale, but we need to get our \u2013 we need to get STAHLGRUBER integrated, we need to get our leverage down. But that doesn't in any way, shape or form take our eye off the ball of optimizing what we own, getting the margins up in not \u2013 in all of our businesses really. Again, we've been very clear about the goals in Europe. We absolutely want to drive higher margins in North America. There's a lot of blocking and tackling that goes into that. And so, we're focused on both. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks so much, Nick, and best of luck. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is open. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Good morning, guys. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Bret. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Hey, good morning. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Could you give us an update where we are as far as sort of purchasing synergies in Europe? I think you said you picked up 30 bps on some supplier rebates. But maybe how much of our purchasing has been consolidated and you talked at Sator about the private label programs, how are we across the board in private label and maybe percentage mix, and where you see that going? Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Hey, Bret, it's Varun. Good morning. Yeah. Listen, in terms of our overall European procurement program, continues to make great strides. We have a team that's been actively working with our key suppliers, and so that's how you've kind of seen that improvement come through on a year-over-year basis. We haven't given exact numbers in terms of what level has been covered at this point of time. But clearly, I can assure you, we'd call it 45 to 50 days into the STAHLGRUBER transaction, the teams have been spending a lot of quality time out there also to consolidate as to what the opportunity is with the STAHLGRUBER transaction, obviously net pricing analysis being done on several thousand SKUs at this point of time. And so, we remain optimistic not only about the STAHLGRUBER purchasing synergies, but the overall European procurement program. With regards to your second part of the question on Benelux and Sator, yes, absolutely. Listen, we've talked about this previously, the rise of private label brands. Certainly, Sator has been making great strides on that from that perspective. But really, I'll probably take you back in terms of one of our core critical businesses, ECP. They're the ones that have actually been going down the path of the private label brands. So, they've certainly shown the path to the European teams. Sator has picked up on that also. And then, obviously, we do know through our equity investment in Mekonomen in terms of the margin profile of private label brands. So, we do see that to be a key pillar for our European margins getting to that double-digit EBITDA margin rate by the end of the 36-month period that started January 2018. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. And, Bret, what I would add is, obviously, when you make a large acquisition, you don't get the procurement savings day one, right? So, if you go back to when we bought Rhiag back in 2016, we put out some broad guidance as to what we thought we could get from a procurement benefit across the European platform by combining purchasing, negotiating kind of common elements, common contracts with our suppliers, if you will. At the time, we thought we could get $10 million of procurement. And we're very well on the way of getting that. With respect to STAHLGRUBER, we really won't see the benefit of that really until very late in the first year of acquisition, which would put us into kind of mid-2019. One is you need to go and actually renegotiate some of the contracts, then you need to actually start buying at those new levels. But then you need to turn the inventory, right? And so, there's a little bit of a time lag, but we are very confident in our ability to really get our arms around all of the procurement savings that we've noted, both as it relates to the historical acquisitions and obviously as it relates to STAHLGRUBER. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Do you have a feeling for what percentage of your sales are private label? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: It really varies business by business. We don't disclose this, but ECP has the highest level of private label and STAHLGRUBER probably has the lowest level of private label business. And Sator and Rhiag are kind of in between, if you will. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Chris. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, good morning. I was hoping given the rapid moves in commodity, and just give us a quick refresh, a primer on the puts and takes to your P&L. So you're hit on the self-service side, but what about your core North American wholesale business? That's where you have inventory on hand. Initially, you would think increases are positive to get LIFO liquidations, but as you kind of turn through it, how should we be thinking about them? How that impacts margins? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So, the impact to commodities has a very little impact on our, what we call our full-service North American salvage business, if you will. These are the cars that we're buying at auction and dismantling. Because the real commodity play there is the scrap. And the scrap is a couple hundred dollars on a $2,000 purchase for which we're hoping to park the car out for maybe north of $4,000. So, there's a very little impact. Biggest impact clearly on the self-serve business where the majority of the revenue from the self-serve, more than 50% of the revenue is actually from the residual metals that we end up selling off in the form of scrap. On the aftermarket part side in North America, a lot of the product that we bring in from the Far East is either made of steel, think about hoods and fenders and the like, or plastics. The shallow, the mirror, the bumper covers, grills and so resin prices are really key there. And so, like in any business as the cost of raw materials for the suppliers that we buy from moves around, they're going to try and recoup some of their cost through higher selling prices to their customers. And we've seen a little bit of that, we talked about that in Q1. We're doing what we can to adjust our prices to take care of that. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : Got you. Okay. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Does that help? Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. That does help. And then as a related follow-up, you had referenced in the call something, the effective \u2013 the Chinese considering pulling back from purchasing recycled materials. Just want to get your \u2013 what are the puts and takes that they actually do do that? Do you have less competition for buying parts? Are there like lateral effects that we should be aware of? And then, like do you have an ability to source more aftermarket to offset that, if it is problematic? Just overall picture there would be helpful. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So, the reference that I made about the Chinese is earlier this year, the Chinese government put in regulations to effectively limit the volume of recycled materials. That's everything from paper to cardboard to metals and the like flowing into China. And really as it related to metals is they wanted a cleaner source of metals because sometimes when the metals that they were bringing into the country, you think about copper wiring, right, the copper is always coated with something, fabric or plastic and the like. And they basically put a halt on the importation of some of that material. And so, at first, their ports weren't fully compliant with the law and more recently we're hearing that they are by the end of the year going to put a hard stop. And that's going to have potentially an impact on prices. We just don't know where. But that's why I made the comment. The reality is, again, in our core North American business, most of the product comes in from Taiwan. Taiwan is deemed to be a different country. And so, the Chinese import laws as it relates to recycled materials do not relate to Taiwan. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : Got you. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much, Nick, Varun and Joe, for taking the question. Could we look at page 17 on your deck, and could you help us bridge what is in the 90 basis points of headwind from gross margin? What's making up that 90 basis points so we understand what you're dealing with and can get a hand around? Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. Michael, good morning. It's Varun Laroyia out here. Yeah, listen, going back to the margin decline on a year-over-year basis in our North America business, really it's the vast majority of it is mix driven. If you think about the base aftermarket business, as I mentioned on the call, and then to one of the questions earlier also, that was pretty much comparable on a prior year period. But if you think about the strong revenue growth similar to what we had called out even in Q1 in some of our lower-margin product lines, think about batteries, this is coming off the FCA Mopar deal that we announced and essentially got the first full quarter in Q1. While it has contributed to organic revenue, we are nowhere close to getting the margins that we would on our traditional aftermarket crash parts, or for that matter reman engines. Again, great from a revenue growth perspective, but again significantly lower-margin business. And then, finally, with the salvage side of it, also specifically on our self-service business, the rising car cost trend as a result of scrap metal prices going up, that obviously doesn't allow us to get the same level of margin for the parts we pick off those vehicles. So, that really is what comprises the kind of 90 basis points kind of down on a year-over-year basis. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. But can you give us the actual portions of that? So, how much of this is batteries versus reman engines versus salvage? Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. Michael, we don't typically disclose that entire piece in terms of what the key elements of that would be. But if you think about the key components, roughly call it 50 basis points, 30 basis points, 20 basis points between aftermarket, the salvage, self-service operations. So, that really is what we say. So, again, I would not call out anything that was de minimis, but again full-service and salvage are a key piece of it. And in the aftermarket, outside of the base business, which has some of the lower-margin product line that also roll up, those are the key pieces. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, if I may follow on it, when we were in England and the presentations were given, there was a high degree of confidence that the company would return to the starting year margin by year-end. Is that still the case in North America? Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Yes. Well, if you think about \u2013 when we've kind of broken out our Q1 headwinds specifically on the gross margin piece of it, you'll recall one of the key pieces we had called out were rising commodity prices in our traditional aftermarket crash part piece. And so, I think that really is where the key piece was. The team has been successful in being able to offset those prices. But with regards to the mix, given what we see from scrap metal prices in the full-service salvage or for that matter what we've seen come through on some of the other product lines, that is something, will just be a mix piece. So, to the time we don't lap the comps on, say, the battery business which will be in Q1 of 2019, we will see that, but in terms of that is a small part of our business, but the big base of our North America wholesale by far is the aftermarket. And that's trending well. Okay? Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Benjamin with SunTrust. Your line is open. Stephanie Benjamin - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Stephanie. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Stephanie. And again, welcome to the LKQ call and we appreciate you initiating coverage on us. Stephanie Benjamin - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Absolutely. Thank you. So, just kind of looking back at the European margins during the quarter, obviously, a lot of moving parts. Just looking at the apparent mix between Western Europe and Eastern Europe and just kind of the margin gap there, is there anything near term or long term that can be done to kind of close the gap between those two regions' margin structure? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Stephanie, the difference between Eastern Europe and Western Europe, that's really structural, if you will, almost across the board and we've seen financial statements from a lot of different companies, obviously, all over Europe. The Eastern Bloc just structurally has lower gross margins and lower EBITDA margins. The market there seems to be willing to work for just a lower level of profitability. And to be competitive, our Eastern Bloc countries also have lower margins than in the West. We think that's going to persist for the foreseeable future. We don't see a huge shift in the market. That said, we still believe we can earn a good return on capital on the Eastern Bloc operations, if you will, because those companies are growing a lot faster. And so from an absolute euro perspective, if you will, we can grow the EBITDA faster in Eastern Europe than Western Europe just because of the top line growth. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: The only one additional piece I'll add to just complement Nick's comments here, are if you go back to our Investor Day and John had laid out the key pillars of the margin enhancement for our European business, there was some of the slightly longer-term initiatives which will actually benefit all of our European segment. So, things such as logistics and warehousing optimization or for that matter shared services, back office, rationalizing the infrastructure side a bit, that certainly is a slightly longer-term piece of it, but that really allows us to make some significant moves into our cost structure. So, as Nick mentioned, the margin is what those markets will bear. But in terms of us being able to further optimize relative to competition given our size, scale and footprint in that region, we believe we will be best-in-class even on segment EBITDA margins relative to competition in that market. Stephanie Benjamin - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Very helpful. Well, thanks so much. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Scott Stember with C.L. King & Associates. Your line is open. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Scott. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Scott. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Can we just maybe just go back to price increases that we have talked about in the aftermarket business in North America? Last quarter you guys had talked about having to be careful with raising prices, just given the fact that you need to stay within a certain pocket below the comparable OEM prices. Can you maybe just talk about what you're experiencing on that front and maybe that just will give us a gauge of how quickly you can get through the price increases that you need altogether? Thanks. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. Sure, Scott. I mean, the reality is in Q2 and true going forward, it has less to do with actually raising prices and it has more to do to make sure that the level of discounts that we're giving to our customers are actually earned. The reality is not everyone earns the same level of discount. And clearly, the bigger customers who buy large volumes consistently over a longer period of time get a higher level of discount off a list than the smaller customers, and it's making sure that our sales team is being incredibly rigorous and focused on giving the right level of discount. And that's where we've made some progress here in Q2. We think we're going to make continued progress through the back half of the year. And it gets you to the same spot, right, that if you're really being more disciplined on the level of discounts, if that can increase revenue that helps obviously improve your margins, if you will. But again, we want to be \u2013 we are very careful. It's a tightrope that we need to walk. We don't want to turn off the revenue growth by being too aggressive on the price front, right, because at the end of the day, we want to continue to take market share and we want to continue to broaden the overall base. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Got it. That's all I have. Thanks. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And I'd now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Nick Zarcone, for closing remarks. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: I would like to thank everyone for their time and attention here today. I know we've ran a little bit long. Sorry about that, but we wanted to answer everybody's questions. Again, we think we had a great quarter, but we're not done, and we're working really hard and we'll continue to focus on improving the margins of all of our businesses around the globe. And we look forward to sharing our further progress with you at the end of October when we report third quarter results. And we hope to have another good report for you at that point in time. So, again, thanks for your time and attention and we'll talk to you in about 90 days. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc. Operator : Good morning and welcome to the LKQ's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I now turn the call over to your host, Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joseph P. Boutross - LKQ Corp.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for the call. Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. This includes statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's slide presentation. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. We certainly appreciate your time and attention at this early hour. We are pleased to share both the results of our most recent quarter and the progress made on the various initiatives we have implemented since our previous call. I will provide some high-level comments, and then Varun will dig into the segments and related financial details before I come back to discuss our updated 2018 guidance and make a few closing remarks. Taken as a whole, we had a very solid third quarter, and today's discussion will focus on four key things : our continued pursuit of highly profitable revenue growth, solid progress on our margin improvement plans, excellent cash conversion, and adding a tool to optimize our capital allocation strategy. In reviewing our results, you will know we had excellent organic growth in global parts and services revenue and that our margins in Europe and Specialty improved compared to the third quarter of last year. While North American gross margins on a reported basis were down a bit on a year-over-year basis, they were up when removing the self-service business, which took the brunt of the negative impact of falling metals pricing during the quarter. Varun will cover this specific segment margin details shortly. Solid profits and effective working capital management led to one of the highest levels of quarterly operating cash flow in the 20-year history of the company. And with respect to capital allocation, as hopefully you all read from our press release issued this morning, I am pleased to announce that our board of directors has authorized a $500 million stock repurchase program. As we stated in the release, our main priorities are to continue to both invest in the growth of our global business and de-lever the balance sheet. That said, our strong capital position and healthy cash flows afford us the opportunity to continue investing in our strategic growth drivers while simultaneously utilizing our share repurchase program to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. Now on to the quarter. As noted on slide 4, consolidated revenue for the quarter was a record-high $3.12 billion, reflecting a 26.6% increase, as compared to the $2.47 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2017. For the third quarter of 2018, parts and services total revenue growth was approximately 27% with organic growth of more than 4% and acquisition-related growth of approximately 23%. As mentioned over the past several quarters, very few companies in our sector are generating organic growth anywhere close to this level. Net income attributable to LKQ stockholders for the third quarter of 2018 was $134 million, up 9.6% year-over-year. On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to LKQ stockholders was $177 million, an increase of 26.9% as compared to the $140 million for the same period of 2017. Diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ stockholders for the third quarter of 2018 was $0.42, as compared to $0.39 for the same period of last year, an increase of 7.7%. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ stockholders was a record third quarter high of $0.56 a share, a 24.4% increase, as compared to the $0.45 recorded for the same period of 2017. Let's turn to some of the segment highlights. As you will note from slide 6, total parts and services revenue growth for our North American segment grew 5.5% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the comparable quarter of last year, with organic revenue growth for parts and services during the quarter of 5.2%, which was in line with our expectations. As noted the past few quarters, the new battery distribution agreement with FCA contributed about 150 basis points to the organic growth, so it comes with a lower margin structure as we essentially just get a service fee. All said, we continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC Information Services, collision and liability-related auto claims on a national basis were up only 0.3% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to last year and up only 0.4% on a year-to-date basis. As was the case in the first half of the year, there continues to be meaningful variances in growth rates across the geographic regions of North America, with key markets such as New York, California, Pennsylvania, Florida and Michigan each down low to mid-single digits. We believe the significant outperformance in our growth relative to the CCC data for repairable claims is due to the continued increase in the number of vehicles in our collision sweet spot, that being model years 3 to 10 years old, and continued market share gains. Also, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, our performance in Q3 was achieved while miles driven in the United States were up just 1.2% on a national basis in August. Although like the claims data, there were significant regional differences. The organic growth for aftermarket parts continued to outpace that of salvage parts, as the repair shops continue to focus on improving cycle times given the increased volume of work they were processing. Importantly, we continue to see increases in our total aftermarket collision SKU offerings, as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 5.7% and 11.2%, respectively, in Q3. Our North American team made solid progress with their recovery efforts despite facing the ongoing cost pressures primarily from wage, fuel and freight inflation. These efforts include being disciplined in terms of pricing and discounts and driving continued improvements with our telematics and road map platforms. These are just a sample of the initiatives in play. We believe there are more margin improvement opportunities, and we are not done. I'm very proud of our North American team and how diligently and aggressively they are working to offset these inflationary pressures, which we anticipate will be with us for the foreseeable future. Moving to the other side of the Atlantic, our European segment achieved total parts and services revenue growth of 53.7%, primarily driven by the acquisition of STAHLGRUBER. Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 2%, reflecting a pullback from the second quarter levels. While we fully anticipated organic revenue growth in Europe to decline from the very robust Q2 levels, our performance in the third quarter was a bit below our expectations. The slightly lower organic growth is reflective of several factors. First, there was soft economic growth in a few markets experiencing some level of political instability, including Italy, which elected a new government earlier this year and is dealing with major budgetary issues; and the UK, which continues to muddle through the Brexit saga. Second, there was unseasonably warm weather throughout most of Europe during the quarter. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we did not submit to price-cutting practices from our competitors and stayed very focused on our efforts to maintain our margins through profitable and balanced revenue growth. That said, there were several positive longer-term developments during the quarter. For example, in the UK, our depth of inventory, national footprint and service levels owing to the T2 investment have enabled us to continue winning national account business, evidenced by several recent wins with the likes of Halfords Autocentres, The CarShop, Formula One and the British Telecom Fleet. The new contracts will have little impact on our 2018 results, and the primary benefits are expected next year. With respect to Andrew Page, on August 31, we finalized the sale of the Andrew Page branches the antitrust authorities required us to divest. We continue to integrate and rationalize the remaining 77 branches, and I am happy to report that the entire Andrew Page branch network is now being replenished out of the T2 distribution facility. Additionally, Andrew Page's former national distribution center was vacated and returned to the landlord in July on schedule. The recently acquired STAHLGRUBER acquisition is performing consistent with our expectations, and we are very pleased to have it as part of LKQ Europe. Finally, during the third quarter, we opened a total of seven new branches in Eastern Europe. Now let's move on to our Specialty segment. During Q3, Specialty reported total revenue growth of 18%, including organic revenue growth for parts and services of 8% and acquisition growth of more than 10%. The higher-than-anticipated organic growth is a result of increased RV parts demand, positive U.S. economic conditions, including low employment, strong consumer spending, and the continued favorable trend in light truck and SUV sales. Additionally, as you may recall from our May 31 Investor Day, Bill Rogers, the President of our Specialty segment, outlined some of the key initiatives and strategy for his team, which included increasing customer penetration and expanding our exclusive brands offering. During the quarter, the Specialty team delivered on its promise by entering into exclusive distribution agreements with Yakima Products for automotive and RV market distribution of their racking products, and GRID Off-Road, a leading designer and manufacturer of specialty off-road wheels and accessories. These agreements are a testament to the power of our Specialty distribution and logistics network, the depth of our customer base, and the effectiveness of our industry leading marketing programs, which combined allow partners such as Yakima and GRID to focus on what they do best : design, innovation and manufacturing. Lastly on Specialty, I'm pleased to announce that during the quarter, we opened up our new 450,000-square-foot distribution center in Eastvale, California. This warehouse further demonstrates our commitment to continuously enhance the superior service experience for our customers, support the operating efficiencies of our suppliers, and create a higher level of safety measures for our team. Moving on to corporate development. In addition to finalizing the divestiture of the Andrew Page branches, during the third quarter, we acquired three wholesale businesses in Europe for a total net consideration of approximately $79 million. We continue to work on both the integration of STAHLGRUBER and the benefits of scale across our entire European footprint. Lastly, on August 6, the company announced the appointment of Meg Divitto, John Mendel and Jody Miller to our board of directors. As our Chairman Joe Holston stated in the announcement, these three new directors complement and enhance our board with skills and experiences in such areas as automotive technology, government affairs and finance. We are quite confident they will provide valuable perspectives as we continue to execute our strategy. And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run through the details of the segment results. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I will take you through our consolidated and segment results for the quarter and cover our current liquidity position before turning it back to Nick for an update on full-year guidance. Overall, we are pleased with the results of the third quarter, especially as each segment delivered some positive notes. North America generated solid organic revenue growth and narrowed the year-over-year gap in segment EBITDA margin relative to the past few quarters. Europe delivered a 50-basis-point year-over-year and a 20-basis-point sequential improvement in segment EBITDA margins. And Specialty had excellent revenue growth along with a 40-basis-point year-over-year expansion in segment EBITDA margins. I'll cover these results and the underlying causes in greater detail in a few minutes, though needless to say that while we continue to make positive progress in each of our businesses, we also acknowledge that we still have further work to do related to our initiatives to offset the ongoing cost pressures and improve profitability. Regarding year-over-year comparability, we completed the STAHLGRUBER acquisition in May 2018, so the third quarter represents our first full quarter with the STAHLGRUBER operation. I will highlight the impact of STAHLGRUBER on the variances as relevant. As noted on slide 13 of the presentation, the consolidated gross margin percentage was down 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 38.3% due primarily to a 20-basis-point reduction in the North America segment and a negative mix impact related to Europe off a further 20 basis points. With our STAHLGRUBER acquisition, the lower gross margin European segment makes up for a larger percentage of the consolidated result and has a dilutive effect on the consolidated margin. Segment EBITDA totaled $326 million for the third quarter, reflecting a $59 million or a 22% increase over the comparable quarter of 2017. As a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was down 30 basis points to 10.5% versus the prior year. Our operating expenses were flat year-over-year with increases in freight and vehicle expenses offset by leverage in personnel costs and a favorable mix effect from the STAHLGRUBER acquisition. During the third quarter, restructuring and acquisition-related costs increased by $2 million compared to the prior year, and depreciation and amortization expense grew by $20 million largely due to the STAHLGRUBER transaction. With that, operating income for the third quarter of 2018 increased by about $35 million or roughly 18% when compared to the same period in 2017. Interest expense was up $16 million or 62% year-over-year due to higher average debt balances and slightly higher interest rates primarily related to the STAHLGRUBER financing. Pre-tax income during the third quarter of 2018 was $201 million, up $23 million or up 13% compared to the prior year. Moving to income taxes, our effective tax rate was 22.9% for the quarter. We updated our estimate of the annual effective tax rate during the third quarter to 27.2%, up 20 basis points from our previous estimate in the second quarter. The higher rate is driven mostly by a change in the geographic distribution of earnings. We had various discrete items in the quarter, including a favorable adjustment for a $10 million true-up to reduce our provisional estimate of the transition tax related to repatriating cumulative foreign earnings. We have excluded this favorable discrete item in our calculation of adjusted EPS. In the equity earnings line, which is where we report our share of the results of Mekonomen, we recorded a $20 million loss in the quarter. This loss is attributable to a $23 million noncash impairment charge on our Mekonomen investment, which I noted as a possibility during the second quarter earnings call. Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the third quarter was $0.42, up $0.03 relative to the comparable quarter a year ago. Adjusted EPS, which excludes restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, acquisition and divestiture-related gains and losses, impairment charges, adjustments to the provisional demands related to the U.S. tax reform and the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation was $0.56, reflecting a 24% improvement. Moving to the segments with North America on slide 16, you will note that gross margins during the third quarter were 43.2%, down 40 basis points over the 43.6% reported a year ago. Our self-service operation's growth is 60 basis points decline, primarily resulting from lower revenue per car due to declining scrap steel prices. Without the self-service impact into lower scrap prices, gross margin in North America was up on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, our gross margin in the wholesale North America operations contributed a 40-basis-point improvement relative to the third quarter of 2017, owing to active margin management and pricing refinements. I'm very encouraged that our wholesale North America operations reported sequential improvement in gross margin percentage of 70 basis points. This result is the continuation of efforts that the North America management team initiated during the second quarter. I'm also encouraged that we were able to generate sequential gross margin improvement while producing solid organic revenue growth. As Nick mentioned, we will continue to pursue profitable revenue growth, which may in the short term put pressure on sales volumes. Make no mistake, this will require discipline to stick to the objective. Apart from the potential for some short-term disruption, we do believe that our customers will recognize the advantages of partnering with LKQ, namely our broad product offering, strong customer service and nationwide distribution capabilities will certainly swing things in our favor. Shifting to operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, we saw an increase of 50 basis points compared to last year and 140 basis points sequentially, which we traditionally see going from the second quarter to the third quarter due to seasonal revenue patterns. Consistent with the first half of the year, we're still facing headwinds related to freight, vehicle and fuel costs like many other distributors, and these costs drove a 50-basis-point increase over the prior year. We're actively working to address these headwinds as well as wage inflation and rising benefit costs to the pricing initiatives that I previously noted and cost controls throughout the organization. In total, segment EBITDA for North America during the third quarter of 2018 was $154 million, up 1% compared to the prior year, and as a percentage of revenue down 70 basis points from the prior-year quarter. Looking at slide 18, scrap prices were up 4% over the comparable quarter from a year ago but down relative to Q2 of 2018 by 16%. As we previously mentioned, the impact from scrap reflects the sequential movement in pricing as car costs will generally follow scrap prices higher or lower over time. The downward trend in Q3 had a negative effect of approximately $7 million on segment EBITDA or a little under $0.02 on adjusted diluted EPS. Without the negative impact from scrap prices, our segment EBITDA margin for North America would have been roughly flat to the third quarter of 2017. Sequential EBITDA margin is down 90 basis points for North America, which reflects a seasonal pattern in the business. You may recall in 2017, the prior year, the segment EBITDA percentage dropped by 150 basis points from the second quarter to the third quarter. So while we are narrowing the year-over-year gap in margin and continue to make progress on the initiatives launched earlier in the year, we've clearly got further room for improvement and the team continues to push hard. Moving on to our European segment on slide 19. Gross margin in Europe was 36.6% in Q3, a 20-basis-point increase over the comparable period of 2017. In addition, our Sator business in the Benelux region continued to show margin expansion, contributing a 40-basis-point improvement to the segment, with specific strength in private label sales and the ongoing move from a three-step to a two-step model in that market. Our centralized procurement yielded a 30-basis-point improvement from supplier rebate programs and STAHLGRUBER had a 30-basis-point favorable impact on gross margin percentage as well. As we've discussed in prior quarters, our UK operations were working through incremental costs associated with T2 in the third quarter, and these costs are mostly past us as we got into the fourth quarter. The T2 costs combined with higher inventory write-offs drove a 40-basis-point reduction in gross margin. And the Central and Eastern European mix cost us a further 30 basis points. With respect to operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, we experienced a 40-basis-point decrease on a consolidated European basis versus the comparable quarter from a year ago. This improvement was primarily attributable to lower personnel costs in the UK and a favorable mix impact from STAHLGRUBER. STAHLGRUBER's results were consistent with the previously disclosed projected impact for the remainder of the year. European segment EBITDA totaled $129 million, a 63% increase over the prior year. As shown on slide 21, relative to the third quarter of 2017, the pound sterling and the euro both weakened by approximately 100 basis points against the U.S. dollar. So, there was a not very material effect from the translation in the third quarter Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 8.8% for the third quarter of 2018, up 50 basis points from the same period a year ago. We are pleased with the year-over-year and sequential growth in margins, and the team remains committed to the previously stated objective to deliver double-digit segment EBITDA margins by the end of the three-year period that started in January 2018. Related to Europe, I'd also like to discuss our equity interest in Mekonomen, a leading car parts and service chain in the Nordic region. We noted on the Q2 call that Mekonomen's share price had declined since we acquired our shares in 2016, which could necessitate an impairment charge if the share price didn't show sufficient improvement. Well, this was indeed the case, and in the third quarter, we recorded a $23 million noncash impairment charge. Further on Mekonomen, in connection with its previously announced acquisition in Denmark and Poland, we elected to participate in a rights offering for additional Mekonomen shares. Earlier this month, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million additional shares for roughly $48 million to maintain our 26.5% ownership interest in the company. We continue to believe Mekonomen is a strong, well-run business, and we are very optimistic about its prospects going forward. Please do note that both the Mekonomen impairment and a non-operating gain related to the rights offering have been excluded from our calculation of adjusted diluted EPS. Turning to our Specialty segment on slide 22, the business continues to deliver solid results. The One (00:29:31) business is performing well and, as previously disclosed, has a higher margin profile than the base Specialty segment. One (00:29:38) contributed 70 basis points to the growth in the gross margin percentage. The base Specialty business, i.e., without One, (00:29:47) generated an 8% organic revenue growth rate in the quarter, which was a nice rebound from the lower rate that we experienced in the first half. And we are encouraged that they were able to do so while maintaining gross margin expansion. The increase was partially offset by higher inventory write-offs representing 50 basis points related to damage and defective parts identified during warehouse expansion projects. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in Specialty were 30 basis points higher relative to the prior year, and the primary variances related essentially to similar stories what you'd heard before higher vehicle and fuel expenses. Segment EBITDA for Specialty was $43 million, up 22% from the third quarter of 2017, and as a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was up 40 basis points to 11%. Let's move on to capital allocation and the balance sheet. As presented on slide 24, you will note that our cash flow from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2018 was $521 million, which is about $72 million or 16% percent higher than through the comparable period a year ago. As Nick mentioned earlier, operating cash flows for the quarter were strong at $192 million due to solid profitability, improved receivables collections and moderate inventory growth. We've adjusted our full-year guidance for operating cash flows from operations to $610 million to $660 million. You may be asking why we would take our cash flow from operations guidance down by $50 million after such a good quarter for cash flow conversion. Well, first, we are lowering our earnings guidance by approximately $20 million that will translate into lower cash flows. Second, we made a decision to unwind a large receivables factoring program in our STAHLGRUBER business, as we had a significantly more cost-effective financing available than this legacy arrangement. However, unwinding the program will slow receivables collections in the quarter, and we expect an outflow for these STAHLGRUBER receivables in the fourth quarter, which should not reoccur in future periods. Other than these two factors, we expect to continue on pace with our prior guidance. As always, we will continue to be nimble in reacting to changing market conditions. For example, while we currently have not incorporated any Brexit-associated impact, there is a chance we will need to begin to increase our inventories in the UK during the fourth quarter to protect our business from potential supply chain disruptions resulting from a lack of a robust trade agreement between the UK and the EU. As I previously mentioned, cash conversion is a key area of opportunity and focus for us, so let me give you a little insight on what we've been doing to improve cash flow conversion. First, working capital management has become a prominent component of our monthly business reviews with segment management. We covered trends in key statistics such as past due receivable, inventory turns and days payables outstanding, and we actively discuss the action items that our field management is taking to improve these metrics. Second, we are going to hold ourselves accountable for managing working capital by including free cash flow and other working capital measures in the performance targets for our 2019 incentive programs. While I am confident that we have the team's attention on working capital today, adding the compensation element will heighten that focus. And also while I appreciate that organizational change does not happen overnight, we've been laying the groundwork in the background, and I'm confident that we are setting the business for a strong year of free cash flow generation in 2019. Moving on to CapEx, CapEx for the quarter was $56 million and $172 million for the year-to-date period. In our guidance, we have decreased our capital spending plan a bit to a range of $240 million to $260 million. In the third quarter, we continue to make progress on our outstanding debt by paying down a further $74 million, which we funded from cash flows from operations. In the first nine months of the current year, we've now paid down $199 million on our credit facility borrowings. Moving on to slide 25, as of September 30, we had approximately $4.4 billion of total debt outstanding and $341 million of cash, resulting in net debt of about $4.1 billion or 3 times last 12 months' EBITDA, down from 3.1 times as of the end of the second quarter. On slide 26, we've added the key return metrics that we track, though please note that we are excluding the impact of STAHLGRUBER in the calculations to eliminate the short-term movement caused by large investments. We will add STAHLGRUBER into the calculations once we've annualized the transaction. And then, finally, on the stock repurchase program that Nick mentioned earlier, we believe we can finance the repurchases primarily through free cash flow generation with a measured approach towards future acquisitions, and our ongoing efforts to improve profitability and working capital management, we expect to generate sufficient cash flows to invest in the growth of the business, manage our leverage and return excess capital to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back to Nick to cover the updated revenue and earnings guidance. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Thank you, Varun, for that detailed overview. Considering the results achieved in the third quarter and a detailed review by our operating units with respect to their projected fourth quarter results, we have adjusted our annual guidance on a few of the key financial metrics. With our continued focus on highly profitable revenue, we anticipate our global organic revenue growth from parts and services will likely come down a bit in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, given we are sitting at 5.1% through September, we have tightened the top end of the full-year guidance by 50 basis points and now have a full range of 4.5% to 5% for organic revenue growth. In terms of adjusted earnings per share, we have moved the range to $2.19 on the low end to $2.25 on the high end with a midpoint of $2.22 a share. This reflects both the $0.56 reported for the third quarter and the revised field forecast for the fourth quarter, which historically has always been the softest quarter of the year, reflecting the natural seasonality of our businesses. Importantly, the impact of lower FX rates and metals prices collectively account for approximately $0.04 of the reduction relative to our prior guidance. Those EPS adjustments yield a range for adjusted net income of $690 million to $710 million. As Varun mentioned, we have revised the guidance for cash flow from operations to $610 million to $660 million, largely reflecting the change in earnings and the onetime increase in receivables related to the termination of a special factoring program at STAHLGRUBER. We believe the effective tax rate will be approximately 27.2%, and the guidance assumes current levels as it relates to FX rates and no further deterioration in scrap metals pricing. In closing, I am very proud of the hard work and dedication of our more than 49,000 employees as they have delivered for the company, our stockholders and, most importantly, our customers during the quarter. I am equally proud of our team's efforts to effectively address the headwinds encountered this year. We have made further progress, and while we are not done, I am confident in our team's ability to effectively implement their respective plans. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from Craig Kennison from Baird. Your line is open. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Varun, I wanted to ask about the STAHLGRUBER factoring program that you ended. I think a lot of shareholders are interested in these factoring programs as a way to promote better capital efficiency. So, clearly, you've explored that but concluded that you have a more cost-effective way of pursuing it. Shed a little more light on that because I think a lot of shareholders would like to see more factoring, not less, but I'm sure you've looked at it and would love some detail. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Yes, absolutely, Craig, and listen, good morning and thank you for calling in this early in the day. I know it's a busy day for all of you, and so really, really appreciate joining our call this morning. Yeah, so with regards to factoring programs in general, we have been working in the background. And while we're not ready to disclose anything at this point of time, we do believe there is a certain level of benefit that could accrue from a balance sheet management perspective. With regards to the STAHLGRUBER program more specifically, it's essentially a case of the cost of funding that they've been paying for their factoring program versus what we can provide on an ongoing basis. But part of it involves us essentially terminating that program, which will take place in the current quarter, i.e. the fourth quarter, and then we will replace it with an alternative program in any case. But partially, the factor that we will trip (00:40:55) into the receivables collection in the current quarter, which will lead to a slower collection effort in the current quarter. So, again back to the program itself, we believe there are certain benefits, but not at the levels of funding that STAHLGRUBER was paying. We believe there are synergies associated with the lower cost of capital that we will be deploying. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Your line is open. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Nick, Varun, for the questions. Around just (00:41:35) the $0.02 to $0.04 when you think about it operationally because like, fair enough, $0.04 is FX and scrap, help us understand what you control to be able to get that back in the future and between discounts, pricing, like are you seeing any OE (00:41:53) pricing? Can you help us with the plans that help get that back in the future? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Michael, and thanks for the question. So the adjustment to the guidance, $0.07 in total, if you will, $0.04 of that is basically scrap. You saw $0.02 of it hit in the third quarter, the next $0.02 will hit in the fourth quarter. Scrap has fallen from almost $200 a ton at the end of last quarter. Today, it's sitting in the high $150s, if you will, so even well below the third quarter average. So there's very little we can do to offset the impact of scrap metal pricing. The other $0.03 is a combination of things. Some of it has to do with the fact that we are focusing on high margin revenue growth. Every dollar of revenue is not worth the same. And the reality is in an effort to improve our margins, we're more than happy to let some of that incremental revenue go by the wayside if it's at low margins, if you will. Some of it has to do with rising benefit cost. We had a significant uptick in our healthcare expense in the third quarter in North America, if you will. We think that's going to leak into the fourth quarter as well. And then we took some legal reserves and expenses. The focus is and the key, I think, is in the third quarter, as both Varun and I mentioned, gross margins in North America. If you take out the impact of the self-serve business, which is where most of the impact of scrap is, gross margins were up. So we are making progress and climbing back on some of those inflationary operating expenses that have been a cause of concern earlier in the year. So we are making good progress. We think in the fourth quarter, actually, we're going to continue to make progress and the EBITDA margin gap on a year-over-year basis is going to shrink further, if you will. So the programs we have in place, we think, are working. It's just it's going to take a little time. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Michael, just one more piece to kind of reiterate what Nick mentioned in case that was kind of lost on everyone calling in. The previous guidance that we gave at the end of July, which had a midpoint of $2.29, that did not include any FX or, for that matter, scrap declines. That's what we've always done and that's how we've always given guidance. And so really if you kind of think of the $2.29 midpoint to call it the now $2.22 midpoint or the $0.07 drop, $0.04 of that $0.07 is essentially related to scrap, $0.02 of which was realized in the third quarter, and based on what we're seeing scrap prices currently, in the current quarter a further $0.02. So that's how you should be thinking about. And then, again, the remaining $0.03 essentially is exactly how Nick mentioned, we're focusing on margin accretive profitable business coming through and so we will keep focusing on that and margin management and pricing refinements to offset the operational macroeconomic headwinds that are buffeting our industry. Operator : Your next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Your line is open. Unknown Speaker : Hey, guys. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Ben. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Good morning. Unknown Speaker : This is actually Daniel (00:45:29) on for Ben, but thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to start actually on CapEx. As you guys work through improving margins in the coming years, Nick, I think you mentioned a few times that large-scale M&A probably slows down from here. What's the CapEx trajectory would look like from here? Should there be a continued ramp in CapEx in the coming years? Know (00:45:48) this year was more of a catch-up, but just wondering what that outlook looks like? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So we obviously brought down our CapEx estimate for the year as a whole, and some of that has to do with where we are this year and what people around the globe have spent, if you will. Again, this was a pretty big uptick in capital in 2018 relative to the past years. Next year, obviously, we're going to have STAHLGRUBER in the mix for the entire year, so that will be an incremental amount. But if you think about the non-STAHLGRUBER CapEx probably relative to 2018, probably flat to maybe down a little bit. Operator : Your next question comes from James Albertine from Consumer Edge. Your line is open. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Jamie. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Appreciate it. I wanted to ask just an operating question, if I could, and then maybe a strategic question, if I could sneak one in. First on the operating side, just wanted to get your sense on \u2013 and I apologize if I missed this in the prepared remarks, I dialed in a little late \u2013 severity versus frequency trends and sort of how you're thinking about starting to lap sort of the beginning of the uptick in organic growth in North America and how we should think about that from a modeling perspective. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So, again, we anticipate that organic growth in Q4 is going to come in a little bit from where it's been. I mentioned that in the prepared remarks largely because we are absolutely focused on making sure that each incremental revenue dollar has good margin. We do not want to chase low-margin business down the rabbit hole, because at the end of the day, that doesn't do us any good. And the easiest way to drive revenue is to drop your prices. The reality is when you have a market position like we do, which is the largest in all of our global businesses, if you will, we've got the deepest inventory, we think the best logistics and distribution system, the primary way people compete against us is through price and drop in price, and we're being very disciplined not to do that. So, I would expect and we do expect in Q4 that the organic is going to come in a little bit. Recall that last year in Q4 was the best organic growth of the year at 5%. And then going into 2019, again, we think 2019 organic is still going to be very good. Don't get me wrong, it's not going to zero or anything close, okay, but we don't think Q1 of next year is going to be another 7% quarter like it was in 2018. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Okay. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: And you hear that... James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Yeah, sorry. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yes. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : I was just going to say just to clarify, the underlying trends from a frequency and severity perspective don't concern you in light of that. It's just that you're going to go after some higher-margin business and so forth, if I'm hearing you correctly. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: That's correct. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Okay. And if I may, the strategic question, we noticed during the quarter, there had been a trial scheduled. I believe there was a settlement related to State Farm and a class action lawsuit. Believe this is several decades now of back and forth on litigation related not only in parts. Do you have any sort of views on that and how we should think about State Farm potentially flowing into the business? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Sure. Absolutely. After years of questions about State Farm where we've said no new news, there's finally been some new news. While not widely publicized, in September, State Farm reached a settlement agreement in its legal battle against the class action suit that had been going on in the courts for 20 years. The initial lawsuit related to the use of aftermarket parts in the collision repair process. And while that court case was going on over the past 20 years, State Farm largely had not used aftermarket parts in the repair of vehicles for their policyholders. This agreement needs to be finalized by the court, which we understand is going to happen in December of 2018. To our knowledge, State Farm has not made any public statement regarding its intention to reinstate the use of aftermarket parts. But once the lawsuit is out of the way, we would not be surprised if, ultimately, State Farm joins most every other auto insurer and begins to slowly reintroduce the utilization of our high-quality, cost-effective certified aftermarket parts which, by the way, come with a lifetime warranty. While we obviously can't comment as to when or to what extent State Farm may ramp up its use of aftermarket parts, we generally view this as a positive for our industry, as State Farm is the largest insurer in the United States of automobiles with about a 18% share. So, we continue to meet with State Farm on a regular basis. We meet with their leadership to discuss joint business opportunities. And we will certainly let you know during a future quarterly call if there are any material updates, but we view this as a positive. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Understood. Thank you for the \u2013 taking the questions and best of luck. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Sure. Thanks, Jamie. Operator : Your next question comes from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is open. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Hi. Good morning, Bret. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : A question and I ask for clarification. On the STAHLGRUBER factoring comments, are you looking at a factoring program for STAHLGRUBER's collections, or I guess where people were maybe looking more at it more (00:51:50) as more of a payables program where you are extending STAHLGRUBER's payables and basically reducing inventory? And it wasn't quite clear from that first line. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So, Bret, it's a yes and a yes, okay? So, clearly, in terms of the cost of funding that was being paid by STAHLGRUBER, we believe there are synergies associated with cost of funding that we will avail of that's part of our overall synergy program with STAHLGRUBER. And then with regards to the payables piece of it also, as I mentioned previously, we have activities in the works, and we will \u2013 once we're ready to inform the broader markets we sadly will, but at this point of time, we continue to operate on an as-is basis. We clearly believe there is an opportunity. But again, this needs to be carefully architected to ensure that we have all the relevant stakeholders on the same page. We enjoy good relationships with our suppliers, and we want to make sure that this is done for the mutual benefit of everybody. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Your line is open. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Ryan. Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. Good morning, everyone. So my question is on the trajectory of North America EBITDA margins. I'm wondering how long do you think it will take to offset some of the cost pressures and start delivering rising margins again, or is the message you want to deliver to us today, Nick, that you may be in a chase for a few more quarters? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So again, as both Varun and I mentioned, if you take out the impact of the self-serve business and basically the scrap hit in the third quarter, our North American EBITDA margins were flat year-over-year. So while in the first quarter they were down substantially, the second quarter a little bit less, during the third quarter, again excluding scrap, they were flat. So we are making that positive progress, if you will. Even with scrap, our expectation is in Q4, North American margins will still be a little bit under 2017 fourth quarter levels, if you will, but again the gap will close even further. And then obviously, as we get into 2019, the year-over-year comps become a little bit easier. So we think we're getting close, Ryan. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephanie Benjamin from SunTrust. Your line is open. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Stephanie. Stephanie Benjamin - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the organic growth in Europe, if maybe you could speak to the cadence maybe throughout the quarter and if these price-cutting efforts you're seeing from competitors was largely quarter-specific or kind of how we should think of it as we progressed in the fourth quarter. Thanks. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. So the reality is the competitive nature over in Europe, with pricing coming really from everybody, because when you're the market leader, that's the easiest way to compete against us is with price, was pretty consistent throughout the quarter. There wasn't a huge uptick or downtick at the end of the quarter. So we are anticipating for Q4 a little bit of an uptick but not a huge uptick in inorganic growth in Europe, if you will. Again, we were at 2% which was below our expectation, below the expectations of our leadership team in Europe. They're working hard to move that up a bit. But again, we're not going to do that at the expense of margins. And we do anticipate that gross margins, EBITDA margins in Europe in the fourth quarter will again continue to nudge up a bit just like they have in the third quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Chris. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Hey, good morning, Chris. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to kind of dig in on Europe a little bit about the pricing environment, I saw GPC's AAG business was a little bit above where you were. Wanted to get a sense if some of these North American guys are the source of the pressure on pricing. Have you seen it elsewhere? And then, secondly, I understand the macroeconomic concerns, but covering the aftermarket retailers in the U.S. generally speaking, when economic conditions tighten, you tend to see those aftermarket growth accelerate as people forgo car sales, et cetera. Is there a reason why this wouldn't apply for your own business in Europe? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Yeah, great question. The reality is we're seeing pricing pressure, if you will, from our competitors really across the European landscape. It's not just in the UK where Alliance which is owned by GPC or Parts Authority which is owned by Uni-Select operate. It's really across the board, if you will. And part of it is, in general with the warm, really warm summer, I mean, activity was a little bit slower than typical. There's no doubt about that. And I think everybody was scrambling, if you will, to get as much revenue as they could. Again, we're assuming that Q4 is going to be a similar quarter, but we have to wait and see. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Yeah. And I'll just kind of add to what Nick mentioned, listen, there are wage pressures and fuel pressures in Europe also. We do know that fuel is kind of across the board globally, a global phenomena in terms of where oil is currently trading. In addition to that, we do have some competitors who have been on a fairly aggressive branch opening spree in certain markets. Again, as we've kind of reiterated time and time again earlier but also on the call today, we are highly, highly focused on profitable margin, margin-accretive business. A number of folks want to go down the path of margin-free, calorie-free revenue and good luck to them. We believe the macroeconomic headwinds with regards to fuel, freight, wages is not going to abate anytime soon, and so there needs to be that margin discipline continuing within our business. Given our position across every geographic segment but also every product line, we believe that the customer service, our footprint and the reliability of our service that we continue to deliver will come through to our key partners. In the UK, for example, we've seen some great key account wins come through, the BT Fleet, for example, Halfords, Formula One, among others, these are multiyear contracts. And again, it is a validation of the investments we've put into our footprint, into our advanced logistics centers and, clearly, we believe that that's what will win the day in the longer term. Operator : Your next question comes from John Healy from Northcoast Research. Your line is open. John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Wanted to ask just kind of a bigger pictures question. Four or five months ago you guys had an Analyst Day and now we're starting to see some additional announcements, and I think we'd applaud those with some of the additions to the board and the meaningful step on the repurchase side. I was just hoping to kind of get your thoughts on what drove the timing for those items and especially the buyback. I mean, given the stock price, to me it seems incredibly attractive here, but just kind of a big change for you guys and I was hoping to get more color on each of those. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Sure, John, and thanks for participating this morning. Look, we're a 20-year-old company now and we've matured a lot. We've got the better part of $12 billion of annualized revenue. And so, we recognize that the days of 26% compounded annual revenue growth like we've had in the last 10 years that it's coming to a close. We're just too big to continue to grow at that pace. We will still be active in terms of corporate development, but we also recognize that we've just completed the largest transaction in the history of the company with STAHLGRUBER at \u20ac1.6 billion of revenue. And we need to be laser-focused on making sure that that integration is effective and efficient and we need a little time to digest things. We've got a lot of capital available. We've got great cash flow and, quite frankly, we've got the ability to invest in the growth of the business and repay some debt and have some capital available to give back to our shareholders. And in chatting with the board, it just felt like we were approaching the time to be a bit more balanced in our capital allocation strategy. Certainly with the stock at these levels, which in terms of your estimates, the analyst estimates for 2019, we're trading below 9 times EBITDA and below 11 times adjusted earnings per share. These are historically low multiples and creating an attractive opportunity to buy some shares. So when you take everything into consideration, the board just felt this was the right time and the right price level to introduce the share repurchase program, if you will. The addition of the new directors, terrific. We had one director, Paul Meister, had been with us for the better part of 17 years, roll off in May. We went through a very detailed search process. We didn't get to the right folks in time to include them in the 2018 proxy, and so they got added in August and, quite frankly, these are three absolutely terrific people. They're going to add a lot to the board. And so we were fine given their talent to expand the board from what was 10 to 12. And we're going to continue to keep our eyes open again for always to be on the search for good talent, whether that's at the management level or at the board level. So no real changes there. Operator : Your next question comes from Christopher Van Horn from B. Riley FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Hey, Chris. Dan Drawbaugh - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning. Hi. This is Dan Drawbaugh on the line for Chris. Thanks for taking our question. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Good morning, Dan. Dan Drawbaugh - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Good morning. Just on the Specialty business, the growth in the quarter was obviously little bit of an acceleration from the first half. And I don't think we've seen that growth rate from that segment in several quarters now. And I'm just wondering if you can talk about the sustainability there. Is this the result of the shift towards light trucks flowing down to you guys, or is it more of a onetime event in the quarter? Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: No, we don't think it's one-time. We would expect that Q4, based on the run rate of activity coming out of Q3, that Q4 is going to be pretty strong as well. Probably not going to be 8%, but it's going to be \u2013 it should be pretty healthy. It's a combination of things. You can't put your finger on just one thing. Is it the fact that truck and SUV sales have been very high now for sustained period of time? That ultimately feeds into it, kind of the RV marketplace being very strong, again, a good portion of the revenue from Specialty goes into the RV marketplace. Some of it is just the day-to-day tackling that the team is doing, some of these new exclusive relationships that we have are helping, if you will. So it's a lot of things. I would not suggest that people should model 8% growth for Specialty in 2019 because the industry isn't growing anywhere near that capacity or near that rate. But, again, we do think it's going to be a pretty good Q4 and we're optimistic about next year. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Stember from C.L. King. Your line is open. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Hi, Scott. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: Hey, good morning, Scott. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: In North America, just a quick two-pronged question, maybe just talk about your ability to raise prices and being mindful of the elasticity of demand versus OEM. And with State Farm, just remind us how big the aftermarket piece is of your North American business. Thank you. Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.: So, Scott, let me take the first part of the question and then Nick will pick up the second part of your question regarding State Farm. So with regards to our North America business, as you would have heard in my comments earlier this morning, if we were to exclude our self-service operations, essentially, that's where the scrap price hit, our gross margins are actually up on a sequential basis and also up on a year-over-year basis. So if you think about it from that perspective, that business has been actively managing its margin expectations. We've mentioned this previously also, the macroeconomic headwinds, fuel, freight, vehicle expenses, wage inflation, we do not expect that to abate in the short term. And so really that's where we need to have a margin enhancement program that the team has been pushing incredibly hard on to offset those cost pressures. We believe we've seen the stickability of those pieces. It's certainly coming through our results. And again, as I mentioned, the team is working hard and continues to push. The unfortunate part is, because our North America business includes the self-service operations also, the headline numbers that you see on a reported basis seem to show it's actually still dropping, but quite frankly, if you were to take the scrappy side effect, that business has actually been delivering against the initiatives that we put in place earlier this year. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: And as it relates to the second part which is kind of the overall size of the aftermarket business, as we always disclose in our standard slides, there's a pie chart in there, if you take kind of 2017, 2018, you kind of annualize STAHLGRUBER for a full year, the North American aftermarket business is somewhere around 21%, 22% of our consolidated revenues, if you will, so somewhere north of a $3.5 billion business. Operator : At this time, I turn the call back to Nick Zarcone. Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.: Well, we know we ran a little bit late here, but we wanted to make sure we had a chance to get most of the questions out on the table, so we appreciate everybody hanging in there. Again, we thank you very much for your time and attention. Again, we think this was a very good quarter for us. We saw very good revenue growth in our businesses. The European margins are up, the Specialty margins are up. Again excluding scrap, the North American margins were flat on a year-over-year basis. We do have headwinds coming at us from scrap in Q4. Again, that's $0.04 between Q3 and Q4, $0.04 of the earnings change, if you will. I'd love to be able to never talk about scrap but, unfortunately, goes up and down and we have to deal with it. The key takeaway is we are very focused on driving our margins. We're very focused on improving our cash flow. We had a great quarter in that regard in the third quarter. And again, we think the share repurchase program, it's just the right time to do that and to return a little bit of capital to our shareholders. So we appreciate your time and attention and look forward to chatting with you at the end of the fourth quarter. Thank you, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Dominick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. We certainly appreciate your time and attention at this early hour. This morning, I will provide some high level comments related to our operations in the fourth quarter and then Varun will dig into the segments, the related financial details, and then discuss our 2019 guidance before I come back with a few closing remarks. Taken as a whole, we made good progress in the fourth quarter with the various operational initiatives we implemented throughout 2018. We did however experienced some challenges in achieving the expectations we set forth in our previous guidance, primarily related to our European operations. Make no mistake, these challenges have not changed our focus on the four key themes we outlined in our last call. Our continued pursuit of profitable revenue growth, progress on our margin improvement plans, excellent cash conversion and the optimization of our capital allocation strategy. Now on to the quarter. As noted on Slide 5, revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $3 billion, an increase of 22% over the $2.5 billion recorded in the comparable period of 2017. Parts and services organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 2.5%. Net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ's stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $40 million, a decrease of 68% year-over-year.  Diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ\u2019s stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $0.13 a share as compared to $0.41 for the same period of 2017, a decrease of 68%. The fourth quarter 2018 results include non-cash impairment charges net of tax of $48 million related to the company's equity investment in Mekonomen and $26 million related to goodwill recorded on our 2017 acquisition of an aviation parts recycler. These impairment charges reduced diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 by $0.23. Varun will address both these items in his commentary. On an adjusted basis, net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders was $151 million, an increase of 19.7% as compared to the $126 million for the same period of last year. As noted on Slide 6, adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $0.48 an increase of 17.1% as compared to the $0.41 for the same period of 2017. With respect to capital allocation, during the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $26.41, reflecting a $60 million return of capital to our shareholders. As stated during our last earnings call, our strong capital position and healthy cash flow affords us the opportunity to continue investing in our strategic growth drivers all simultaneously utilizing a share repurchase program to maintain a balance capital allocation strategy. Let's turn to the quarterly segment highlights. As you all know from Slide 7, organic revenue growth for parts and services in our North American segment was 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the comparable quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact for the battery contract with FCA, which just started on January 1, 2018, organic growth for the rest of the North American segment, was 2.4%. Still, we continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC, collision- and liability-related auto claims were down 0.9% in the fourth quarter and up only 0.1% for the full-year 2018. We believe this outperformance in our growth relative to the CCC data is due to the continued increase in the number of vehicles in our collision sweet spot that being model years we did 10 years old and an 18% increase in the number of alternative parts utilized on a per claim basis over the past five years. Also according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, our performance in Q4 was achieved all miles driven in the United States were down 0.5% from October and up just 0.3% on a nationwide basis in November. During Q4, the salvage line of business launched the implementation of a software platform that uses predictive analytics and multiple data input beats to refine the analysis in calculating the most accurate part prices, which in turn will be used to determine the value of total loss vehicles to LKQ and provide more accurate pricing determination at the auctions. We believe the early stages of this price optimization effort played a key role in the organic growth for recycled parts outpacing that of aftermarket parts in the fourth quarter and for the first time in 2018. Related to our recycling business, I am proud of our North American teams\u2019 environmental efforts in 2018, between our full service salvage and self service businesses, in 2018, we processed over 872,000 vehicles resulting in among other things, the recycling of 1.4 million catalytic converters, 2.2 million tires, 560,000 batteries, 2.4 million gallons of waste oil in over 4 million gallons of fuel. This effort is a key pillar in our mission of being a responsible steward of the environment in a true partner with the communities in which we operate. We also continue to grow our parts offerings with aftermarket collision SKU offerings and the total number of certified parts available each growing 5.2% and 11.5% respectively in 2018. Our North American team continued to make solid progress with respect to the margin recovery efforts despite facing ongoing cost pressures, primarily from wage, fuel and freight inflation. These efforts include being disciplined in terms of pricing and discounts, and realizing continued improvements with our telematics and Roadnet platforms. During the fourth quarter 96% of the 326,000 manifests in North America were created through Roadnet with better routing inefficient trucks, fuel consumption and miles driven were reduced by 1.7%. Moving to the other side of the Atlantic, our European segment achieved total parts and services revenue growth of 47%, primarily driven by the acquisition of Stahlgruber. Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 0.3%, reflecting a pullback from Q3 levels and well below our expectations. The European demand was soft across many of our key markets, including the UK, Benelux and Italy. During the fourth quarter and full-year our Rhiag business witnessed negative growth in Italy. In Q4, 2018 Italian economy shrank by 0.2% following a 0.1% decline in Q3. With that, Italy's economy officially tripped into recession and the economic contraction is expected to continue for sometime, which could create a difficult market for our operations as well. Euro Car Parts posted organic growth in Q4 and full-year 2018, but the quarterly results were well below our expectations. The UK continues to struggle with the Brexit negotiations and the economic uncertainty appeared to have a negative impact on overall demand with most market participants reporting low single-digit organic growth. STAHLGRUBER performs in line with expectations but we are closely monitoring the economic conditions in Germany which have shown signs of a slowdown. When looking at Europe as a whole a soft economic outlook has shaped our expectations for our 2019 organic revenue guidance. Regarding Brexit the whole world is waiting to see what comes of the ever changing discussions both within the UK and between the UK and the EU. A couple of de-risk revolve around the fact that most of what is consumed in the UK including automotive parts originates outside of the UK. Indeed a majority of the inventory purchased by the ECP and Andrew Page comes from EU countries. Accordingly a further weakening of the sterling relative the other currencies couldn't place the cost of procurements and any trade disruptions in terms of getting inventory into the country could create issues in servicing customer demand. With respect to the currencies we do hedge a portion of our expected inventory purchases a few months forward using FX contracts. On the product front all of our UK based businesses have been working to ensure we have a minimum number of months coverage on all types of inventory including fast movers, mid movers, and even certain slow moving SKUs. This is involved a variety of activities including placing advanced orders increasing stock holdings at ECP facilities and working with key suppliers to have them create buffer stock at their facilities within the UK prior to the end of March. The interest of the ECP and our suppliers are directly aligned and we have been working proactively with these partners several of which have extended payable terms to offset the cash impact of building inventories. While there are many unknowns related to how Brexit will impact the UK in Europe we believe we have the broadest and deepest inventory in the market and our confident that we will be able to meet our customer's needs. While the overall European market weakness has provided some headwinds we are also actively addressing the Company specific operating challenges we've experienced to assure we can continue to maintain our market-leading positions and capture the opportunities that we believe our long-term European strategy presents for our Company and our stockholders. Some of the changes relate to new productivity programs all others involve changes in leadership. I will cover a few of our key initiatives in my closing remarks. As I mentioned in our May 2018, Investor Day talent acquisition is a key initiative for European segment and in Q4 we made solid progress on this front. On December 20 the Company announced that Arnd Franz will join LKQ Europe as Chief Operating Officer on April 1. Arnd is currently Corporate Executive Vice President and Member of the Management Board of the MAHLE Group, where he is been responsible for the company\u2019s global automotive sales and application engineering, including their aftermarket business unit. From 2006 to 2013, he was Executive Vice President and General Manager for MAHLE Aftermarket. Arnd will report directly to John Quinn, CEO of LKQ Europe. Arnd brings nearly 20 years of experience with Tier 1 automotive suppliers across Europe and has a strong record of successful integration efforts. He will be a great addition to the LKQ Europe leadership team. Specific to Euro Car Parts, on January 2 of this year, the company announced that Andy Hamilton was appointed ECP\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Andy joined ECP in 2010, where he held several executive roles, the last of which was Chief Operating Officer. During that period, ECP saw unprecedented growth as the network group from 89 to over 220 branches. Prior to ECP, Andy held a variety of management roles for Halfords Group, the UK's leading automotive and leisure retailer with over 500 locations. Additionally at ECP, we recently added two key people to the leadership team, including a Chief Administrative Officer and a Chief Supply Chain Officer. The Chief Administrative Officer and Varun actually worked together during their respective times at both CBRE and Johnson Controls. The primary task for this position is to focus on ECP support and governance functions with overall responsibility for legal, finance, and human resources, thereby freeing Andy to focus on customer facing and operating matters. The Chief Supply Chain Officer worked at ECP from 2014 to 2016 and we are excited to have him back on the team. The main responsibilities for this role are ECP\u2019s logistics and supply chain activities, including the leadership of the T2 facility. Finally, during Q4 we opened up a total of five new branches in Eastern Europe. Since acquiring Rhiag in 2016, we have opened 94 branches in Eastern Europe, and as we enter 2019, we are now focused on maximizing the productivity of our existing branches with just a handful of new openings planned for this year. Now let's move on to our Specialty segment. During Q4, Specialty reported total revenue growth of 8.9% including organic revenue growth for parts and services of 5.8% and acquisition growth of more than 3%. Specialty continues to deliver strong results with EBITDA margins in the fourth quarter and full-year 2018 both achieving their highest levels since we entered this segment in 2014. During the 2018 SEMA Show, the Specialty team launched a new mobile app that is capable of putting the power of their industry best eKeystone business-to-business system into any device. This app harnesses mobile device technology, including voice-to-text capability to allow users to search for products simply by saying a category or brand and utilizes the mobile device camera to scan QR, UPC and vehicle VIN numbers and VIN barcodes. The eKeystone app includes all the proprietary data in Keystone\u2019s B2B system, thereby providing subscribers access to approximately 800,000 cataloged SKUs, 400,000 images, 20,000 videos, and 40,000 installation instructions and more. We are pleased with the early adoption rates of the app which thus far have generated close to 4,000 downloads from our Keystone Automotive Operations customers. This was a tremendous initiative and I credit our Specialty teams\u2019 effort to think outside the box and deliver solutions that enhance customer service and drive incremental sales. Moving on to corporate development, during the fourth quarter, we acquired three wholesale businesses in North America and two wholesale businesses in Europe for a total net consideration of approximately $14 million. And finally, I would like to highlight that our Board has approved management suggested changes to the structure of our compensation programs, whereby the incentives are directly in lined with our Company wide objectives. For our key leaders across the globe, the 2019 annual bonus program will incentivize EBITDA, both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue, as well as improvements in free cash flow generation. For the long-term cash incentive plan, the incentives will be based on return on invested capital, organic revenue growth and EPS growth over a three-year period. In addition, we are creating a new long-term performance share program high to the achievement of the same target metrics. And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who run you through the details of the segment results and discuss our 2019 guidance. Varun Laroyia : Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I will take you through our consolidated and segment results for the quarter, cover our current liquidity position, and provide 2019 guidance before turning it back to Nick for closing remarks. The fourth quarter results featured several solid accomplishments and some further opportunities for us to realize. On the positive side, three key points to highlight. Number one, we continue to integrate STAHLGRUBER and I am happy to report that the business is performing in line with expectations and that we are achieving the synergies projected at this stage. Two, our Specialty segment, which historically had generated its lowest segment EBITDA, margin in the fourth quarter, so an 80 basis points year-over-year improvement in this metric, largely due to effective margin management initiatives. And finally, three, operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $190 million, which in total produce the highest annual operating cash flow in the Company's history at $711 million and free cash flow of $461 million. I am very proud of the team's dedication to working capital management, which I am confident will carry through into 2019 and beyond. On the other side of the ledger, as Nick described, we experienced some softness in revenue growth in the quarter in both North America and Europe. As previously noted, the North America segment was able to withstand the revenue softness relatively well, while in Europe the softness in revenue growth created pressure on a segment EBITDA margin. I will provide further color on this when we discuss segment performance. There is a larger spread between our GAAP and adjusted figures this quarter than we are typically accustomed to reporting. The variance is attribute to the under-performance of two specific investments, which resulted in an impairment charge in the fourth quarter totaling $75 million on an after-tax basis or about $0.23 per share. Firstly, we recorded a $33 million goodwill impairment charge related to our aviation recycling business in North America that we acquired in early 2017. The changing market conditions have dampened our outlook for this business, prompting the charge, which was recognized as part of our annual test for goodwill impairment. And second, in the equity earnings line, which is where we report our share of the results of Mekonomen. We recorded a loss of $46 million in the quarter. This loss is attributable to $48 million non-cash impairment charge on our Mekonomen investment. We recorded $23 million charge in the third quarter and unfortunately the stock price decline further through December 31, necessitating another write-down. Since year end, Mekonomen has announced its fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results and revised its dividend policy that has resulted in yet another drop in its stock price. Unless there is a turnaround in the stock price in the coming weeks, we will need to record a further impairment charge in the first quarter. We clearly disappointed in the performance of our investment in Mekonomen, and are hopeful that the worst is behind us. Now I\u2019ll turn to Slide 13 and 14 of the presentation for a few points on the consolidated results. The consolidated gross margin percentage increase 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 38.7% as positive improvements in both Europe and Specialty segments more than offset a negative mix impact related to Europe. Specifically the lower gross margin Europe segment now makes up a larger percentage of the consolidated results following the STAHLGRUBER acquisition, but again as I mentioned we could more than offset this impact. Our operating expenses increased by 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter primarily attribute to the negative leverage effect in Europe due to revenue softness that I mentioned earlier. Interest expense was up $10 million or 37% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, due to higher average debt balances primarily related to the STAHLGRUBER financing. Moving to income taxes, our effective tax rate was 28.3% for the quarter the annual base tax rate was roughly 27.2% which is consistent with third quarter estimate. The higher rate for the fourth quarter reflects a roughly $1 million net negative impact from discrete items. We completed our analysis of the impact from U.S. tax reform and I'm happy to report that there were no adjustments to the provisional amounts in Q4. Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the fourth quarter were $0.13 down $0.28 relative to the comparable quarter a year-ago. Adjusted EPS was $0.48 reflecting a 17% improvement year-over-year. Moving to the segments with North America on Slide 17, gross margins during the fourth quarter were 43.5% of flat compared to the prior year. Our pricing initiatives in the aftermarket line have been successful in realizing gross margin benefits that we experience in offsetting decrease in a salvage operations at car costs have moved higher with the mix shifting towards newer model year purchases. Similar to our aftermarket line we are implementing pricing tools for salvage products to enhance the gross margin generated on each car. Our self-service operations gross margins were roughly flat on a year-over-year basis with non-recurring insurance recovery of setting the negative impact of declining scrap steel prices. Shifting to operating expenses for North America we saw an increase of 10 basis points both compared to last year and sequentially. There were a few factors working in opposite directions this quarter. Facility expenses increased 50 basis points due to higher rent and utilities expenses and non-recurring these terminations charge. Consistent with the first three quarters we faced headwinds related to freight and vehicle expenses and these costs drew a 30 basis point increase over the prior year. We actively working to address these headwinds as well as wage inflation and rising benefit costs to the margin initiatives noted previously and also through cost controls throughout the organization. Going the other direction we had non-recurring gain on an asset sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 that had a favorable 30 basis point impact. The remaining 40 basis points improvement primarily related to a reduction in bad debt expense reflecting our strong emphasis on receivable collections. And finally, we saw a 40 basis point unfavorable movement in segment EBITDA related to the non-controlling interest line. While the operating results of a whole - of a non wholly-owned subsidiaries impact the reported gross margin and operating expense figures, the allocation of the profit or loss from these businesses fall below operating profit. Last year we allocated a loss from our non wholly-owned subsidiaries in North America to the minority shareholders, but reported income in these businesses in 2018 thereby creating the unfavorable year-over-year comparison. In total segment EBITDA from North America for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $153 million roughly flat compared to the prior year. Looking at Slide 19, scrap prices were flat versus the comparable quarter a year-ago, but down relative to the third quarter of 2018 by 3%. As we previously mentioned the impact from scrap reflects the sequential movement in pricing as car costs will generally follow scrap prices higher or lower over time. Changes in scrap steel prices had a negative effect of approximately $5 million on segment EBITDA or a little over $0.01 on adjusted diluted EPS. The management team remains intensely focused on margin realization and the cost mitigation initiatives launched last year. Moving on to our European segment in Slide 20, gross margin in Europe was 36.7% in the fourth quarter, a 100 basis point increase over the comparable period of 2017. Our Sator business in the Benelux region continued to show margin expansion, contributing a 30 basis point improvement to the segment with specific strength in private-label sales and the ongoing move from a 3-step to a 2-step model in that market. Our centralized procurement yielded a 40 basis point improvement from supplier rebate programs. With respect to operating expenses, we experienced a 120 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis versus the comparable quarter from a year ago. The lower sales growth had a negative impact on operating leverage. STAHLGRUBER results, as I previously mentioned were consistent with the previously disclosed projection for the year. European segment EBITDA totaled $107 million, a 38% increase over last year. As shown on Slide 22, relative to the fourth quarter of 2017, both the pound sterling and the euro both weakened by 3% against the dollar causing about a $0.01 negative effect from translation on adjusted EPS in the quarter. Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 7.5% for the fourth quarter of 2018, down 50 basis points from the same period last year due to revenue softness and lower than expected results both in the United Kingdom and Italy. The management team has implemented cost controls over all geographies, including reviews of discretionary spending and stringent additional approvals for headcount. The European team has reiterated its commitment to the previously stated objective to deliver double-digit segment EBITDA margins by the end of the three-year period that started in January 2018. Turning over to our Specialty segment on Slide 23. This business continues to deliver solid results. The gross margin percentage improved by 230 basis points in the fourth quarter relative to the comparable period of 2017. Of this amount, 120 basis points related to a non-recurring amortization impact in 2017 related to one purchase accounting, and additional 30 basis points increase is attributable to mix. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in Specialty were flat relative to the prior year. Higher vehicle and fuel expenses and FX causes were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense falling on from the previously mentioned focus on collections. Segment EBITDA for Specialty was $28 million, up 20% from the fourth quarter of 2017, and as a percentage of revenue segment EBITDA was up 70 basis points to 8.5%. Let's move on to capital allocation and the balance sheet. As presented on Slide 25, you will note that our operating cash flows for 2018 was $711 million or up $192 million, a 37% increase versus 2017. Operating cash flows for the quarter was strong at $190 million following the momentum in the third quarter or into an emphasis on receivables collections, and moderate inventory growth. CapEx for the quarter was $78 million and $250 million for the full-year. In the fourth quarter, we made further pay downs on a credit facility borrowings, while repurchasing $60 million of LKQ stock under the repurchase program launched late last October. For the full-year of 2018, we paid down $206 million on a credit facility borrowings all of this was funded by a strong operating cash flows. Trade working capital has defined as receivables and inventory offset by payables as a percentage of revenue improved by 250 basis points, reflecting our commitments towards delivering strong cash flow. I am very heartened by the scale of improvement we could deliver as this has come ahead of the structural change to the incentive compensation program in 2019 and more broad-based working capital efficiency programs. Moving to Slide 27, we amended and extended our credit facility in the fourth quarter. The changes increase the capacity of a revolving credit facility to $3.15 billion, offset by a lower term loan, extended the maturity through to January 2024, simplify the pricing tiers and immediately reduced our borrowing margin by 25 basis points. As of the 31 December, we had $332 million of unrestricted cash, resulting in net debt of about $4 billion or 2.9x last 12 months EBITDA. Breaking through the lesson 3x benchmark is a crucial threshold as a further lowers the cost of our credit facility borings based on the revised pricing tiers as part of the credit facility amend and extend, we executed in the fourth quarter. On Slide 28, we've had the key metrics that we track, though please note that we are excluding the impact of STAHLGRUBER in the calculations to eliminate short-term movements caused by large investments. We will add STAHLGRUBER into the calculations once we've analyzed the transaction. Now I'd like to detail our annual guidance for 2019. Please note that the guidance assumes that scrap prices and FX rates hold at current levels and the annual tax rate is dialed in at 27%. Additionally, the guidance assumes no material disruptions associated with the United Kingdom's potential exit from the European Union. We have set organic parts and services revenue growth at 2% to 4%. Given our fourth quarter revenue growth, the economic uncertainty in Europe and are continuing emphasis on profitable revenue growth, we are moderating our growth assumptions for 2019. Diluted EPS, on a GAAP basis is a range of $2.05 to $2.17 while adjusted diluted EPS is the range of $2.34 to $2.46. We are projecting solid business growth from a margin improvement efforts and an incremental $0.09 from a full-year of Stahlgruber. On the negative side, lowest scrap prices and a stronger U.S. dollar reduce the year-over-year expectations by $0.07. Cash flows from operations reflect a range of $775 million to $850 million. We believe our focus on working capital management and increase profitability will drive higher cash flows in 2019. Capital spending set at a range of $250 million to $300 million, a modest increase from the current year level, though flat to slightly down on a year-over-year basis, when we normalize the expected increase or into a full-year of STAHLGRUBER CapEx and various European projects, most notably the ERP implementation. Taking the lower and the top ends of both OCF and CapEx, we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of $500 million in 2019. In summary, we remain encouraged by the strength of a market leading businesses do acknowledge that we still have further work to do related to fully realizing the benefits of our initiatives to offset the ongoing cost pressures and to continue to improve profitability. Now I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing remarks. Dominick Zarcone : Thank you, Varun for that financial overview. I believe that we are taking the necessary steps to position the Company for continued long-term success. Looking back on 2018, we crossed major milestones that our team of over 50,000 employees across the globe should be proud of, including achieving the highest annual topline revenue in the Company's history, up 22% over 2017, generating the highest annual cash flow figures in the Company's history. With operating cash flow and free cash flow up 37% them 36% respectively over 2017 levels. Closing the STAHLGRUBER acquisition the largest acquisition in the Company's history, completing the largest capital raise in the Company's history through notes with a in tenure maturities at attractively low fixed interest rates and amending our credit facility to provide more flexibility and better pricing. With that let me summarize a few of the key initiatives for 2019. First, we have built strong businesses with leading companies in our core geographies. Our focus will now shift towards operational excellence through the integration and simplification of our operating model. The management team will concentrate on leveraging the strengths of the business units for profitable revenue growth, margin improvement and cash conversion. Second, all of our businesses will be closely monitoring cost to drive-out duplicative expenses, heighten controls over discretionary spending and react quicker the changing market conditions. Third, we will invest in our future through long-term projects like the ERP implementation in Europe, a centralized European catalog system, and the multi-year development of a new NDC in the Netherlands. All these projects often don't produce an immediate benefit they are essential for positioning the business for future growth and profitability. Finally, the revamped compensation programs well help ensure the management incentives are in even tighter alignment with the key priorities of the Company and the expectations of our stockholders. In closing, I am proud of how our team of over 50,000 employees performed doing 2018 in the midst of various operating challenges in both North America and Europe. Our team never took their eye off the ball and continued to work tirelessly to create and evolve what we all believe is a unique company. Our extensive distribution networks the breadth and depth of our inventory and our industry-leading fulfillment rates position as well to deliver consistent profitable growth and drive higher levels of operating efficiencies across all segments. This focus on operational excellence should translate into continued long-term value for our shareholders. And with that operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning, Dan. Varun Laroyia : Good morning, Daniel. Daniel Imbro : I wanted to start on the European business and kind of the outlook for expenses. One clarifier and then a question. Varun, did I hear you right, where there any one-time expenses that drove that deleverage or was it just the lower sales growth of the business that drove the year-over-year decline? Varun Laroyia : Yes. So if you look at the European margins, Daniel, it was specifically the revenue softness, which caused a loss of operating leverage on that. There weren't any specific one-time is there were, some of the smaller ones, not that material. But that was really associated with some management departures that had been undertaken. But other than that nothing that would come to mind beyond that. Operator : You next question comes from the line of Stephanie Benjamin of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Stephanie Benjamin : Hi. Thanks for the question. Good morning. My question really just goes with expectations and I know reiterated the expectations in Europe to continue to really see that margin improvement in double-digit EBITDA growth in reiteration of that. I'm just wondering, as I look to the guidance for 2019, I think expectations are for a softer topline growth kind of similar to the fourth quarter. So I'm just kind of wanting to hear the puts and takes for you to - for your expectations for margin improvement in Europe in 2019, so you don't see kind of that continued operating deleverage we saw in fourth quarter. So just kind of wanting to hear the offsets of there would be great. Thanks. Varun Laroyia : Yes. Absolutely, Stephanie. Good morning. It\u2019s Varun Laroyia. Great question. I think, if you kind of look back into 2018 with regards to our European segment. Going back to Q1, you'll recall we had some challenges in the UK operations with our Tamworth facility. Coming out of that, obviously there was a capitalized cost to recover that central distribution center and then they're on, there was also some price discounting that was taking place. So that was kind of one piece that we don't really expect to continue into the future as we think about 2019. The other piece is, as you think about the broader European landscape. Italy, we know has been soft. And clearly there was a deleverage that ended up taking place out there. And then obviously, some other elements, we get the full-year benefit of some of the distribution centers that we had shutdown in anticipation of Tamworth coming through, and the same thing with Andrew Page also. So, as you think of some of those kinds of puts and takes, clearly there are certain elements that impacted our 2018 operational results in the European landscape. And as we think about 2019, we do believe that those elements would have stabilized and despite the lower economic activity expected across the European segment, we believe that with the active cost containment programs that are in place, we do believe that we will get better operating leverage from that segment. Dominick Zarcone : Stephanie, this is Nick. As we go through the planning process each year and a very detailed budgeting process, clearly the expectations for every one of our businesses around the globe is not only to generate good organic growth, but also to improve their margins. And that is true in Europe. It's true actually in the North American and Specialty businesses as well. And I think you will find the underpinning really of the consensus that Varun walked through is an assumption and some pretty detailed plans by our operating businesses to improve margins across the board with one exception and that's the self-serve business here in the United States, which has to deal with scrap prices, and there's only so much they can do to offset the negative impact from scrap as it relates to our operating margins. But again, it's important to understand that the expectation internally is that all of our businesses on an annual basis have plans to find positive operating leverage in their business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Bret Jordan : Hey. Good morning, guys. Varun Laroyia : Hey. Good morning, Bret. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : Hey. Varun, can you give us an update on where we are from a working capital standpoint or your thoughts on leveraging working capital maybe what you could do with payables in Europe or the U.S.? Varun Laroyia : Yes, absolutely. I think, if I take your question Bret in terms of what's driving \u2013 what drove free cash flow higher in 2018 and as to what gives us the confidence going into 2019 for the free cash flow guidance, two key pieces, really to think through. One, 2018 to 2019 that clearly is the higher profitability from the focus on pursuing profitable revenue, the margin realization initiatives that we launched last year, and also the cost containment programs that are currently in place. So that's kind of just the starting point for free cash flow. The second point is just active working capital management. And if you think about the momentum that we saw in the third quarter, which we continued into the fourth quarter, really the focus has been on some very simple elements in the balance sheet. Within our cash flow statement, you can actually see this come through, the focus with collections. In 2017, it was a $56 million outflow and in 2018 it was basically flat. So we didn't invest, despite the fact that business grew significantly. We didn't really invest that much more in receivables because we were actually going and collecting the cash that was due to us. The second point is if you look at inventory, inventory did grow also on a year-over-year basis with the larger scale of business, but it was about $77 million lower than what it was in 2017, right. And then the final piece quite frankly is the opportunity that's still out there for us to go get. The single biggest piece, which kind of held us back I'd say is, on a year-over-year basis there was $122 million swing on accounts payable. It was a significant outflow, right. And so as you think about each of these key elements, and as to what we continue to focus on, simplistically there is further opportunity in any case. I think the final piece, which actually is a rapper across the entire working capital and free cash flow piece is the incentive compensation plans and these obviously have been aligned with the goals in 2019. We don't specifically call out the weightings of each of those elements, but I will share with you, it is not a token measure. It is a substantial chunk of people's incentive compensation to generate free cash flow. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Dominick Zarcone : Hey, good morning, Chris. Varun Laroyia : Good morning, Chris. Christopher Bottiglieri : Hey, good morning. I wanted to ask about \u2013 with revenue growth is slowing a little bit, also recognizing that you're going through implementing a number of projects with fixed margins. Can you help frame for us OpEx growth next? What's kind of like your run rate assumption from SG&A for organically from inflation that what's the net impact of costs saving initiatives versus investments to cut costs, just how you're thinking about that next year? Varun Laroyia : Yes. So Chris, its Varun Laroyia. With regards to cost containment efforts and also OpEx, a few things to kind of think through, firstly here in North America, a bunch of our wage inflation or the freight elements essentially get analyzed. And again, what we have seen \u2013 I've seen over the last four to five months as being not a de-acceleration or a downward trend, but basically being a flattening out of some of those expenses that are kind of coming through. So that's point number one. And clearly from the second half of the fourth quarter, we saw fuel come down, also some not enough to offset the various elements given the fact that wage pressures have kind of flown into the freight costs also. And as you think about going into 2019, the cost containment efforts specifically what headcount had, we essentially trying to make the business more resilient with the revised projections from a growth perspective, which I believe actually very pragmatic. And quite frankly, the cost structure will follow this level of pragmatism rather than building up across infrastructure, which was geared for far higher growth level as such, right. And then finally if you think about it, as Nick mentioned in his opening comments, also the overall expectation for each of our businesses is to secure a positive operating leverage. And again, with the change in the incentive compensation plans, there is margin growth both in absolute dollars, but also on a margin percentage that we expect. So again there are only so much that one can do in terms of being able to realize certain margin benefits. But clearly the cost containment and the OpEx productivity is a key lever and being able to deliver higher year-over-year margins. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Kennison from Baird. Your line is open. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning, Craig. Varun Laroyia : Good morning, Craig. Craig Kennison : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On a new compensation plan, what are the thresholds for your key performance indicators that you would need to reach in order to generate the incentive? Dominick Zarcone : Yes. Craig, we don't disclose the absolute thresholds, but you can be assured that they are tied exactly into the 2019 budget, which is tied exactly into the guidance step Varun gave just a bit ago. Operator : Your next question is from Brian Butler from Stifel. Your line is open. Brian Butler : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Could you provide a little bit more color maybe on the parts and service business down at the geographic level in Europe and U.S. kind of thoughts on how we should think about growth rates and margins \u2013 EBITDA margins for each part of that? Varun Laroyia : Sure. We don't officially provide guidance on a segment basis, but again 2% to 4% overall, I think you could probably assume that North America, we think North America on an annual basis will be somewhere in the middle of that range. We think Europe is going to be towards the lower end and specialty towards the upper end. So we're really spread across the three businesses. I think it's also important to recognize that this will vary as we roll through the four quarters of the year. It's not a nice \u2013 set of growth in Q1 and Q2 2018 had monster comps that were working against, if you recall that the organic growth in North America in Q1 2018 was in around the 7% range. So that is creating a pretty big hurdle. If you will there are a couple things that we anticipate in Q1 that will run against organic growth first, we annualize the battery contract with FCA just to refresh everyone's memory that added about 1% to our organic growth as to what we reported in 2018. So that positive increment will come off the boards if you will. It is also become a parent that as FCA was ramping their activities with us, that there was some kind of one-time benefits if you will that we got in getting the program up and running and that will not return in 2019. We're really at a steady state now with the FCA battery shipments. And so we're anticipating batteries were actually be down year-over-year in the first quarter. Also AeroVision clearly not meeting our expectations that's the business where we took the impairment charge here in Q4, our expectation is the businesses underperforming and it will also be down in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. From a margin perspective, again, we're anticipating upticks and margins in each of our businesses with North America being muted a little bit by the significant downdraft on the scrap prices, which has noted in the deck hit us for the better part of $0.04 a share so for the year. And that will be a particularly pronounced kind of in the first quarter, I'm assuming scrap prices hang in where they are today. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Your line is open. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Merkel : Hey, good morning, everyone. Varun Laroyia : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Merkel : So on free cash flow conversion guidance in 2019 applies a little bit of improvement, about 70% my math is right? But I'm wondering what is your long-term target and then more importantly how long it going to take to get there? Varun Laroyia : Yes, Ryan. So I think as we kind of spoke last May at an Investor conference, I kind of laid out a chart for our investors and obviously a number of view from a sell side perspective also just in terms of the way the business had been trending. And really what I use is I try and keep it as simple as possible and take out all the noise and rate specifically focused on three key elements of working capital. So receivables plus the inventory offset by accounts payable and there's a slide in the deck that you'll see really, which I cannot highlight with regards to where we went 17 versus the kind of progress you've made in 2018. In 2018 the denominator is actually trailing 12 months performer revenue, which includes a full-year of the transactions, namely Stahlgruber. So we don't taking reported numbers, we actually taking performer numbers so you can kind of work the count and actually works against us. But that's where the focus has been. And quite frankly, I think, with the incentive compensation, peaceful, so being tied into free cash flow generation. I am quietly confident that our businesses will continue to deliver. Again, step back and look at the history of the Company, which has been very growth oriented and at this stage of our maturity curve as a company, north of $12 billion is what we kind of forecasting for total revenues in 2019. There are elements that if not growth at all costs and so just management of that piece. But there's an embedded culture and as you know culture is take time before they kind of change. So again, we put out guidance, which I think is above where the market was expecting us to be. But again, we have plans in place to be able to go deliver on it. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves in terms of what's going for 2020, 2021, 2022. I'd say its one step at a time and I'm really happy to report to successive quarters of improvement on that side. We've clearly put our money where our mouth is with regards to 2019 also in raising overall free cash flow guidance and one step at a time, but I'm confident in terms of the plans we've put in place and as to how those are currently tracking. Operator : Your next question comes from Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Your line is open. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Thanks [indiscernible], hop back in the queue for a follow-up guys. Last quarter, Varun you updated us on your attention to unlock cash flow through increased factoring in the European business specifically at Stahlgruber. Can you provide some more color on that market or an update? And can you remind us on how you guys think about the longer-term opportunity from increasing your factoring in that market? Varun Laroyia : Yes. So Daniel I think you kind of referring to the unwind of the factoring program that we had through one of STAHLGRUBER subsidiaries. So it wasn't a case of starting up a factoring program. It was actually unwind off a factoring program, which would result in those receivables coming back to us. So that's what it was. We don't really have an active factoring program we don't want to go down that path. It really where the opportunity is as we've talked about from a European perspective, a number of the same supplier community does provide product into the North American folks out here. So again, they are well tuned in terms of what the expectations are and we do have a tremendous opportunity from a European perspective to be able to unlock that piece, whether it'd be through a vendor financing program or through an extension of peoples, the end goal is the same to be able to have our payables essentially match the days inventory on hand to a point right. And that's how the conversion would work and then obviously active management on idea so with regards to receivables. So you are right about the fact that there is an opportunity for our European business. And again it has been contemplated in the plans we've put together with that business and it also reflects the targets that are being tossed with for 2019. But again just to confirm, there was no startup off the factoring program. It was actually unwind of the factoring program for one of the STAHLGRUBER subsidiaries in the fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe. Your line is open. Christopher Bottiglieri : Hi, thanks for taking the second question. Just a question North America, so now you guys are getting a lot tougher on discounting and trying to contain the pricing, what are the CI\u2019s you're thinking about the Caliber and Abra merger? How do you guys manage through that and kind of to what extent you've articulated something that your guidance from this will be helpful? Thank you. Dominick Zarcone : A great question, obviously both Caliber and Abra are excellent organizations. They've been incredibly good customers of ours for years and years. No surprise. There are a couple of our largest customers, just due to the total number of shops that they operate. On a combined basis, they're going to be at about 1,050 shops across the country, if you will. And they've got posted plans to grow that to north of 1500 shops I think over the next three years or so. We've got a great relationship with both organizations, and we look forward to being a great partner with them as they continued to move forward in their business plans. Again we believe that we provide an excellent level of service to these organizations. That's why they are big customers of ours. We can get them the parts they need, when they need them. There's no doubt about it. They already get our largest discounts, if you will, because they're already, amongst our top three or four customers. So we don't anticipate any major changes there. To the extent that they have market overlap because you got to remember this is a very much a local business. And what happens to go on, say in Dallas, doesn't have anything to do with goes on, and say up in Boston or in Portland, Oregon, right? It's a local business. And to the extent in any given market, local market, they have overlap where we can find ways to be more efficient in servicing the combined organization. We're absolutely going to have discussions with them to see how we can make their business better and our business better. So again we have tremendous relationships at the very senior levels of both organizations. We're not anticipating any major shifts in our business as a result of the merger. Operator : I now turn the call back over to Nick Zarcone. Dominick Zarcone : So that completes our 2018 full-year earnings call. We absolutely appreciate the time and attention you've given us here this morning. We look forward to chatting with everyone in about 60 days at the end of April when we announced our first quarter results. So again, we think we ended the year, a strong some real progress on a couple of key factors, particularly, the working capital on the cash flow, which is Varun indicated will carry us into the future. And we're look forward to chatting with you again in 60 days. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the LKQ Corporation's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Joseph Boutross : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning, as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the next few days. And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Dominick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. We certainly appreciate your time and attention at this early hour. This morning, I will provide some high level comments related to our operations in the first quarter, and then Varun will dig into the segments and related financial details, before I come back with a few closing remarks. Taken as a whole, Q1 represented a solid quarter and played out pretty much as we anticipated. We made good progress with the various operational and productivity initiatives we began implementing in 2018 and the business performed in line with our expectations knowing that we faced exceptionally tough growth comparisons for North America, a challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe, and significant negative headwinds from the year-over-year impact of scrap and FX. Now on to the quarter. As noted on Slide 4, revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was $3.1 billion, a 14% increase over the $2.7 billion recorded in the comparable period of 2018. Parts and services organic growth for the first quarter of 2019 was essentially flat year-over-year on a reported basis, but when adjusting for one less selling day in the quarter, organic revenue growth for parts and services was 1.3%. Diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ's stockholders for the first quarter of 2019 was $0.31 as compared to $0.49 for the same period of 2018. However, the first quarter of 2019 results include $52 million of noncash impairment charges net of tax composed of $40 million related to the company's equity investment in Mekonomen and a $12 million charge for net assets held-for-sale. These impairment charges reduced diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2019 by $0.17 a share. So on an adjusted basis, net income attributable to LKQ stockholders was $176 million, an increase of 4% as compared to the $170 million for the same period of 2018. Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ stockholders for the first quarter of 2019 was $0.56 as compared to $0.55 for the same period last year. Let me briefly touch on the impairment of net assets held-for-sale, which Varun will cover in more detail during his remarks. As you are all aware, we\u2019ve on several occasions discussed our four key strategic pillars, which include : growing our customer offering, expanding our geographic footprint, adapting to changing technologies and rationalizing the asset base. With respect to the latter, I view the efforts to rationalize the business as an ongoing evaluation of our assets to ensure that we have the right combination of operations for our long-term success. As you might expect, undertaking this evaluation will from time-to-time identified businesses that no longer represent a strong fit with either our long-term strategy or financial return objectives. After careful consideration, we reached a conclusion to sell a few of our operations in the upcoming year. While each of the subject businesses has its strengths, we don't view them as being critical to our core operations. These businesses neither individually nor collectively reflect a significant amount of revenue or EBITDA. The sale of these non-core assets will, however, help improve our overall margins and simplify our operating model. With respect to capital allocation during the first quarter of 2019, the company repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average price per share of $26.66. Since initiating our buyback plan in late October of last year, we have repurchased 4.9 million shares reflecting a $130 million return of capital to our shareholders. Let's turn to the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 7, organic revenue growth for parts and services for our North American segment declined 1.4% in the first quarter of 2019, but was up slightly when adjusting for the one less selling day. As anticipated, the PGW glass business and the airplane recycling operation exhibited negative same day organic growth. While the largest part of our North American segment, the Automotive Salvage and Aftermarket Parts operations exhibited same day revenue growth of approximately 1.8%. Importantly, organic growth in North America ended on a strong note with the March organic revenue growth showing significant improvement from the levels posted in January and February. We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC, collision and liability related auto claims were down 2.6% year-over-year in the first quarter. We continue to believe this outperformance in our growth relative to the CCC data is due to the increase in the number of vehicles in our collision sweet spots, that being model years 3 to 10 years old and auto insurance carriers ongoing efforts to reduce the cost pressures associated with increased cycle time and labor due to shortage of technicians. Despite some challenges on the top line, including facing a tough comparison from Q1 of 2018, our focus on profitable growth help drive year-over-year margin improvements in North America with segment gross margins and EBITDA margins improving 90 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively, when compared to the first quarter of 2018. Removing the self service business which was impacted the most by the decline in scrap prices, gross margins and EBITDA margins for the rest of our North American segment were up 170 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. Varun will address this in more detail, but I wanted to highlight that our margin enhancement efforts are indeed working. We also continue to grow our parts offerings with aftermarket collision SKU offerings and the total number of certified parts available growing 5.8% and 11.6% respectively year-over-year in the first quarter. Moving to the other side of the Atlantic, our European segment achieved total parts and services revenue growth of 39%, primarily driven by the acquisition of STAHLGRUBER. Organic revenue growth for parts and services in the first quarter of 2019 in Europe was 1.3% on a reported basis and 2.1% on a same day basis, which was above our expectations given the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds facing Europe. Importantly, each of our European platforms witnessed positive organic revenue growth for parts and services on both a reported and same day basis in the first quarter. Europe has seen many of its economy slowing as evidenced by lower new vehicle sales and lower or negative GDP growth. Discussions with our suppliers and other industry participants have confirmed the negative impact, the poor economic growth is having on the European marketplace. Our sense is that the economic conditions have led to an initial deferral of repairs and maintenance. While a near-term headwind, we believe that core automotive maintenance can only be deferred so long and the demand will eventually rebound. Our U.K operation continues to make good progress despite the fact that the market continues to struggle with the uncertainty around Brexit, which continues to undergo negotiations with a new deadline of October 31. That has been widely reported in the media Brexit is having a negative impact on overall consumer demand in the United Kingdom. With respect to the automotive parts space, most market participants are again reporting low single-digit to negative organic revenue growth rates. Despite the softness in the market ECP performed well by delivering meaningful improvements in both organic revenue growth for parts and services and EBITDA margins on a year-over-year basis. The team at ECP continues to make progress with the ongoing optimization of our T2 distribution facility. Yet there's still more room for an improvement and I am confident we are now have the right team in place to position and optimize the long-term performance of our U.K business. Additionally, ECP's collision business performed above expectations and above the European segment as a whole. We continue to believe ECP's aftermarket collision parts and paints offerings offer an attractive value proposition to U.K auto insurance carriers as they confront profitability challenges. According to the Association of British Insurers, U.K carriers have witnessed pressures similar to the domestic carriers with increased parts cost, vehicle complexity, and increased cycle times. In 2017 and 2018, claims cost reached record highs in the U.K. Unfortunately the positive improvements experienced at ECP were largely offset by the mix impact related to the inclusion of STAHLGRUBER and the Q1 2019 results and soft margins relative to the prior year elsewhere in Europe, particularly in Italy and Belgium. At STAHLGRUBER we are on track with our projected synergies. We've also begun some testing with respect to utilizing Sulzbach-Rosenberg, our state-of-the-art national distribution center in southern Germany to support the Rhiag operations in Central and Eastern Europe. We have also begun to expand the utilization of private-label products into STAHLGRUBER's product offering. Finally, during Q1, we opened two branches in Western Europe and in Eastern Europe we opened five new branches, while closing three underperforming locations. Now let's move on to our Specialty segment. During the first quarter, Specialty reported total revenue growth of 0.5% with organic revenue growth for parts and services of 1% being offset by a negative impact from currencies. Adjusting for one less selling day in the quarter, Specialty had organic revenue growth of 2.6%. During the first quarter, our Specialty team hosted their industry leading tradeshows, including the RV Expo in Nashville and the Automotive Focus Big Show in Dallas with both events witnessing solid year-over-year increases in supplier and customer attendance as well as show orders. The Expos training and education programs continue to be a strong draw as witnessed by the largest attendance ever at the Expos RV University. Moving on to corporate development. On April 1, after the close of the first quarter, we announced the acquisition of Elite Electronics. This transaction is directly aligned with our strategic pillars of growing our customer offering and adapting to new technologies. We have been signaling for some time now that select service offerings could be an excellent complement to our North American parts business. Elite's mobile and on-site technical solutions are provided to automotive collision and mechanical repair facilities that are facing the rapidly expanding requirements related to vehicle diagnostics and calibration. Elite services include reflashing, programming. pre and post collision repair diagnostics, ADAS related calibrations, airbag replacements, theft and vandalism repair and frame replacements. The robust service offering assist LKQ and Elite's customers in completing time-consuming and challenging repairs. Allowing a lead to handle any number of these operations, improved cycle times and reduces associated repair expenses thereby resulting in better customer experiences. We are delighted to have the Elite team join LKQ and we look forward to adding additional service focused businesses to our suite of customer offerings. We will continue to complete tuck-in acquisitions and during the first quarter we closed on two small transactions in Europe. And with that, I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our 2019 guidance. A - Varun Laroyia : Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I will take you through our consolidated and segment results for the quarter, cover our current liquidity position and discuss our 2019 guidance before turning it back to Nick for closing remarks. As we have discussed on the past few calls, we are focused on delivering profitable growth, expanding on margins, generating free cash flow and optimizing our capital allocation strategy. The first quarter provided evidence of continued progress on these initiatives as we grew our consolidated gross margin by 30 basis points over the prior year, produced $124 million in free cash flow, paid down $60 million of debt, and as Nick mentioned, repurchase $70 million in LKQ stock while maintaining our net leverage ratio. While we're pleased with the progress on our initiatives, we still have work to do on our segment margins. And I will comment on these drivers behind the quarter-over-quarter variances in a few minutes. Diluted EPS attributable to LKQ stockholders for the first quarter was $0.31, down $0.18 relative to the comparable quarter last year, primarily related to a few impairment charges on which I will provide further details. Adjusted EPS, which excludes restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, acquisition and divestiture related gains and losses, impairment charges and the tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation was $0.56, reflecting a 2% improvement over the comparable quarter last year. I want to highlight a few items that affected quarter-over-quarter comparability. First, scrap prices trended down in the first quarter of 2019 with a sequential decrease of 9%. Whereas the opposite was true in the first quarter of 2018 when scrap prices rose 21%, sequentially. We benefited by roughly $0.03 in the first quarter a year-ago due to the price rise of scrap compared to a negative impact of about a penny in Q1 2019, resulting in a $0.04 negative swing year-over-year. Second, the U.S dollar was stronger in Q1 2019 relative to the prior year, which created a negative impact from translation and transaction gains and losses of almost a penny and a half. Taken together, scrap prices and currency impacts represented about a $0.05 headwind relative to Q1 of 2018. As we disclosed during the fourth quarter call, the Mekonomen stock price declined significantly between the 1st -- 31st of December and February 28. We indicated that without a recovery in the stock price by quarter end that we would need to record a further impairment. Unfortunately, there was no rebound and we have booked a $40 million impairment charge for the quarter in the equity earnings line of our income statement. The Mekonomen share price appears to have stabilized in recent weeks, so we are hopeful that the significant impairment charges are behind us. As we continue to refine our capital allocation strategy and to simplify the operating model, we have undertaken a review of our businesses to identify underperforming assets. We identified several businesses that we intent to sell over the course of the next year. These units which represent approximately $170 million in annualized revenue and a nominal amount of EBITDA outside of our core business and all geographies. Under the accounting rules, we are required to classify these assets as held-for-sale on the balance sheet because of our intention to sell the businesses in the near-term. Additionally, we have to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets as of quarter end. We concluded that the expected recovery would be less than the carrying value and as a result we recorded a $15 million impairment charge, which is excluded from our calculation of adjusted diluted EPS. Other than the impairment charge, there is no impact on the income statement presentation for these businesses. That is the revenue and expenses flow through the same lines as before the held-for-sale classification and will continue to be presented as such until the sale is completed. Given the ongoing negotiations related to the potential transactions, we know you will appreciate the need for confidentiality and why we are unable to provide further details currently. We will of course provide updates on subsequent calls. On a combined basis, the Mekonomen and the assets held-for-sale impairment charges reduced our GAAP diluted EPS by $0.17. Now I will turn to Slides 11 and 12 of the presentation for a few points on the consolidated results. The consolidated gross margin percentage increased 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 39% with meaningful gains in both our North America and European segments. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, there is a negative mix impact as the lower gross margin European segment makes up a larger percentage of the consolidated results, and hence have a dilutive effect on the consolidated margin. Our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased by 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter, primarily attributable to the North America and European segments, which I will discuss a bit later. Interest expense was up $8 million or 27% compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to higher average debt balances, primarily related to the STAHLGRUBER financing in April 2018. Moving to income taxes, our effective tax rate was 27.1% for the quarter, which is roughly in line with our full-year estimate. I've already mentioned the Mekonomen impairment in the equity earnings line, but I also want to point out that the reported fourth quarter 2018 Mekonomen earnings declined relative to the prior year. Therefore, our share of their earnings, which we pick up in our first quarter reporting was down relative to the prior year by about $2 million after-tax. Moving to the segments. While North America -- on Slide 14, gross margin during the first quarter was 44.2% or 90 basis points higher than last year. Our aftermarket team continues to do really strong work on pricing initiatives to offset the general wage inflation and higher logistics costs prevalent in the U.S market. While aftermarket is the primary driver of the segment improvement, we are also encouraged by progress on margin in our glass product line as a result of pricing initiatives and renegotiating underperforming contracts. There was a partial offset of our self-service operations gross margin, which decreased relative to the first quarter of 2018 due to the scrap price impact that I referenced and Nick called out the impact in his comments earlier. Shifting to operating expenses, we saw an increase of 100 basis points compared to a year-ago. The negative leverage effect resulting from quarter-over-quarter decline in revenue of $28 million drove a significant portion of the decrease. Having one fewer selling day in Q1 of 2019 increased the expense as a percentage of revenue of fixed costs, such as facility rental expenses and administrative personnel salaries. Additionally, the decline in other revenue primarily related to lower scrap prices created a negative leverage effect as highest scrap revenue doesn't require additional overhead costs such as commissions and delivery costs. That said, this segment did incur higher expenses in rent related to expansions and renewals, employee benefit costs due to enhancements implemented across the U.S business last April and vehicle insurance costs. In total, segment EBITDA for North America during the first quarter of 2019 was $177 million, down $1 million compared to a year-ago and as a percentage of revenue was up 20 basis points from the prior year quarter. Sequential changes in scrap prices had an unfavorable impact of $4 million for the quarter compared to a positive impact of $13 million in Q1 2018 creating a $17 million year-over-year negative swing. On the surface, a 20 basis point improvement in segment EBITDA may not sound very impressive, but when you factor in the gross margin increase and the scrap price and leverage headwinds, the North America team took a solid step towards achieving its margin goals. Moving to our European segment on Slide 16. Gross margin in Europe was 36.8% in Q1, a 90 basis point increase over the comparable period of 2018. Our centralized procurement yielded a 50 basis point improvement from supplier rebate programs as we continue to benefit from the synergies created with the STAHLGRUBER acquisition. Our U.K operations contributed a 30 basis point increase with lower distribution costs. You recall that we had some challenges in our T2 facility in early 2018, which produced an incremental operating costs that did repeat this year. With respect to operating expenses, we experienced a 60 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis versus the comparable quarter from a year-ago relative to lower sales growth partially attributable to fewer selling days in the quarter had a negative impact on operating leverage, given the segments relatively high fixed cost base especially with regards to personnel. Partially offsetting, we had a 40 basis point decrease primarily due to freight and also facility rental expenses. European segment EBITDA totaled $105 million, a 39% increase over last year. As shown on Slide 17 relative to the first quarter of a year-ago, both the sterling and the euro weakened by 6% and 8%, respectively, against the dollar causing almost a penny and a half negative effect from translation and transaction gains and losses on adjusted EPS in the quarter. Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 7.3% for Q1 2019, flat compared to the same period last year. Compared to a year-ago, we made progress towards integrating STAHLGRUBER and putting T2 back on track. However, with challenging economic conditions and fewer selling days, negative the effecting revenue in Q1, we are working actively to manage operating leverage. Turning to our Specialty segment on Slide 18, the gross margin percentage declined 160 basis points in Q1 relative to the comparable period a year-ago. Of this amount, 120 basis points related to higher net product costs as a supplier discounts will lower than realized in the prior year. We benefited from higher discounts in the fourth quarter of 2017 that carried over into our first quarter 2018 gross margin. The balance related primarily to increased customer incentives due to higher volumes with certain customers. Operating expenses improved 50 basis points relative to the prior year with reductions in personnel and advertising more than offsetting higher facility expenses related to warehouse expansion projects that went live after the first quarter of 2018. While these projects generated an increase in year-over-year expenses, we believe that the investments were necessary to support the segments growth and profitability objectives and that the short-term margin effect will be mitigated as the warehouses are optimized. Segment EBITDA for Specialty was $38 million, down about 10% from Q1 of 2018 and as a percentage of revenue EBITDA margin was down 120 basis points to 10.7%. Our Specialty business has produced solid results in recent years and we believe that the Specialty team will be able to make up the shortfall and produce growth in both EBITDA dollars and margin percentage for the full-year. Let's move on to capital allocation and the balance sheet. As presented on Slide 19, you will note that our operating cash flow for the first quarter was $177 million, 22% higher than Q1a year-ago. With the change to our compensation plan, our teams are focused on driving working capital improvements, though I do need to call out that there will be some ups and downs as we move throughout the year based on seasonality and timing of certain transactions. For example, in our STAHLGRUBER operation customer rebates get paid in the month of March, which triggered a large outflow in receivables for the quarter that wasn't present a year-ago. On the other hand, we were able to reduce inventory by $72 million and that resulted as a cash inflow for the quarter. CapEx for the quarter was $53 million resulting in free cash flow for the quarter of $124 million and almost 50% improvement relative to year-ago. In addition to share repurchases of $70 million in the first quarter, we paid down $60 million of debt. Our strong cash flow generation allows us to delever while at the same time returning capital to our shareholders. On January 1, 2019, the long-awaited lease accounting standard ASC 842 went into effect. And you can see a large impact on our balance sheet. We added about $1.3 billion in assets and a similar amount in liabilities related to operating leases that were off balance sheet under the prior accounting rules. There was no material impact on our income statement due to the new accounting standard and our net leverage ratio covenant under the credit facility was unaffected. Moving to Slide 21. As of 31st of March, we had $360 million of cash, resulting in net debt of about $3.9 billion or about 2.9x last 12 months EBITDA. Now I would like to provide an update on our annual guidance. Please note that the guidance assumes that scrap prices and foreign exchange rates hold at current levels. Additionally, the guidance continues to assume no material disruptions associated with the United Kingdom's potential exit from the European Union. As Nick noted earlier, the first quarter came in line with our expectations. North America excluding self-service performed well and we expect the specialty margin decline to be short-lived. While we see challenges with European economic conditions holding for the remainder of the year, we believe that the business is resilient and that the management team will adapt appropriately to meet the targets. Therefore, we are leaving our 2019 full-year guidance unchanged with the exception of our full-year forecasted U.S GAAP income going to the first quarter activity. Let me run you through the guidance figures quickly. Organic parts and services revenue growth remains at 2% to the 4% corridor. Diluted EPS on a GAAP basis is updated to a range of $1.87- to $2 accounting for the Q1 activity, primarily related to the non-cash impairment charges I referenced earlier. Adjusted diluted EPS remains unchanged for the year. The range remains at $2.34 to $2.46. Cash flows from operations continues to reflect a range of $775 million to $850 million. And capital spending is unchanged at a range of $250 million to $300 million. In summary, the first quarter was a solid start to the year and we remain optimistic about our prospects for the balance of the year. Now I'll turn the call back to Nick for closing remarks. A - Dominick Zarcone : Thank you, Varun for that financial overview. And with that, let me reiterate the key initiatives discussed in February that we will continue to focus on during the balance of 2019. First, we will integrate and simplify the operating model. Our management teams will concentrate on leveraging the strengths of their respective business units for profitable revenue growth, margin improvement and cash conversion, and as discussed, work on divesting the businesses that don't represent the right long-term fit for our organization. Second, we will closely monitor costs and react quicker to changing market conditions. We believe that we can adapt to market trends and economic conditions to deliver our full-year targets. Third, we will invest in our future through projects like the European ERP implementation, which continues to move forward. And finally, we will create even tighter alignment with the key priorities of the company and the expectations of our stockholders through revised compensation programs. I am happy to report these programs and targets have been communicated throughout the organization and the teams are actively working towards achieving their respective goals. In closing, I am very proud of the momentum we\u2019ve created with our Q1 performance and how our team of over 51,000 employees performed amid various operating challenges in both North America and Europe. Importantly, I want to recognize how our leaders across each of our segments have embraced our productivity initiatives and the metrics we have implemented as we progress through 2019 and beyond. These factors should continue to create long-term value for our stockholders. And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Your line is open. Michael Hoffman, your line is open. Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Benjamin from SunTrust. Your line is open. Stephanie Benjamin : Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to get a little bit more color on expectations for European EBITDA margin for the remainder of the year flat for the first quarter, but what kind of are the drivers to see improvement as we move through the year? Thanks. Varun Laroyia : Stephanie, good morning. It's Varun Laroyia. How are you? Stephanie Benjamin : Doing well. Thank you. Varun Laroyia : So listen, in terms of -- excellent. Listen, so in terms of our European margins, while we were really pleased with the way our ECP and our U.K operations bounced back. As Nick noted in his opening comments, there was some macroeconomic softness, which obviously pull down the overall organic growth numbers. But in terms of the overall full-year number for our European business, while clearly, Q1 was a little disappointing from an operating leverage standpoint. We do know that in the remaining nine months, the team is actively working towards delivering on their targets. That is again a fair bit of the year yet to run and the team is actually proactively working through a series of different initiatives to ensure that they hit their margin targets. I think if you\u2019re referring back to the broader 3-year program that we had called out following January 2018, so that full-year 2021 we would hit the 10 points of segment EBITDA margins, that remains unchanged. So no change to that program that we had called out for the 36 month period. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is open. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : Could you talk about the accounts payable balance? Maybe as its specifically around the European side of the business? How you\u2019ve done as far as leveraging payables? And then sort of -- along with that as STAHLGRUBER enter the mix, could you give us some feeling for STAHLGRUBER's accretion maybe in Q1 what it added? You talked about some incremental margin and the purchasing mix, that maybe you could talk about it sort of standalone profitability? Varun Laroyia : Yes. Hey, Bret. Good morning. It's Varun. Let me answer the first part of your question and then I think Nick will pick up on the second part of your two-part question. So in terms of payables on an enterprise-wide basis, they were flat on a year-over-year basis. But you are indeed correct, in terms of being able to get a vendor financing program up and running, we've had great discussions and we continue to work towards getting it across the final finishing line. So we\u2019re excited about that, but we do believe that really is where there is a significant amount of upside. For no other reason than it is a common set of suppliers, that also supply to the big box folks here in the U.S. So again, discussions are underway. We have great financing partners lined up also and we actually anticipate seeing some of that come through in 2019. Dominick Zarcone : And Bret this is Nick. Good morning. As it relates to the STAHLGRUBER accretion, indeed that acquisition added to our earnings per share. On a direct basis, it is a few cents, as we\u2019ve noted in other conversations, not all of the synergies related to STAHLGRUBER will [indiscernible] themselves at STAHLGRUBER, because some of the procurement, really that\u2019s some of those [indiscernible] gets spread overall the different operating units in Europe. So we are happy with the acquisition and how its performing. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Baird. Your line is open. Craig Kennison : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning, Craig. Craig Kennison : Varun, first if you could -- good morning. Varun, if you could give us the per day organic growth for each segment? I am sorry, I missed it. And then with respect to Specialty, maybe just add a little color to what happened in the first quarter and what makes you confident that business will recover as the year unfolds? Thanks. Varun Laroyia : Yes. Hey, Craig. Good morning. It's Varun. So in terms of on a per day basis for each of our reportable segments. As Nick mentioned, North America was marginally up about 10 basis points on a per day basis. Europe was up 2.1% on a per day basis and Specialty achieved organic revenue growth of 2.6% on a per day basis. The key out here really is, if you think about some of our businesses that Nick also called out and I also refer too, in terms of whether it would be our glass business where we\u2019ve focused on margins, that\u2019s certainly pulled us back in terms of overall per day on a -- in North America, for example. And again as Nick mentioned, if we were to pull up the glass and the airplane recycling business, as they both exhibited a negative same day growth. The largest part of our North American segment, being salvage and the aftermarket piece, essentially grew about 1.8% on a per day basis. So just wanted to kind of reiterate that\u2019s a solid performance across each of our large business segments. And with regards to the second part of your question on Specialty, so yes, Specialty gross margins were down 160 basis points, but about a 120 basis points of that's almost three quarters of that related to and this is -- I\u2019m going to ask folks to dive into their memory banks, but in the fourth quarter of '17 where we had a significant investment in overall inventories, you will recall apart from the hurricane buying opportunities we had, we also invested into our Specialty business. And some of those opportunistic buying conditions related to getting some pretty attractive discounts from our suppliers, those discounts essentially get capitalized and get rolled into 2018 results for the Specialty unit, which obviously boosted certain margins. But at this point of time, that obviously has flown through that balance sheet and the income statement and the team is actually working to -- continue to hit its numbers. So again, we are quietly confident about the Specialty segment being able to hit its full-year targets. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Your line is open. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Hey, good morning, guys. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning, Daniel. Varun Laroyia : Good morning. Daniel Imbro : I have question on North America. Obviously, growth slowed. It sounds like you\u2019re about flat on a same day basis, but we still saw margin up year-over-year as you guys execute on your pricing and discounting program. Can you talk a little bit about how your customers are responding to those changes? I mean, are you seeing any pushback from them? And then related to that, have we seen any update on OEM pricing here domestically? Thanks. Dominick Zarcone : Yes. So, again, we got a little bit of a dichotomy in the North American growth with the core business actually as Varun just said, up about 1.8% on a same day basis. So I'm feeling pretty good about that. And as I mentioned in my comments, March was a lot better than January as well. So the near-term trends are good. We are adjusting our pricing based on the inflationary conditions that we\u2019re facing with respect to wages and rates and the like. We are being very thoughtful as to how we are doing that with our customers. It is a very competitive environment out there as you well know. And we are taking it day-by-day, and really customer by customer. All we are trying to do is have -- recover the incremental operating costs we are facing in running the business on a day in and day out basis. But given the [indiscernible] condition we have in this country and the impact that has on wages and the like. And the second half of your question? Daniel, you have a two-part question, I believe. Okay. We will go on to the next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Christopher Bottiglieri : Thanks for taking the question. So the question is on the EBIT margin improvement x self-service. It was exceptionally like very strong, which is great to see. As you assess your non-core operations, can you talk about your self-service business? And if you consider this to be a good business and core to your offering? And holding scrap prices steady, can you talk about the margin profile and capital intensity relative to the rest of North America? Thank you. Dominick Zarcone : Yes. So our self-service business in North America is clearly the most cyclical, because that\u2019s where the largest impact that scrap pricing -- its manifest. In times where scrap is rising and we get benefit of that, that\u2019s obviously a clear benefit to the self-service business. In times like what we\u2019re seeing right now where scrap has come down materially since the first of the year, it's working against this. When you take it over kind of a multiyear view, the self-service business is a good performer with good double-digit margins and it adds to the overall value of the organization. More broadly, we\u2019re very proud of the North American margin improvement that we had as we initiated 170 basis points on the top line and 120 basis points improvement at the EBITDA line. When you take out the impact of self-service, which is really the impact of the scrap on the overall segment. We think that is very good. It's -- really the first time in about five quarters that we\u2019ve been able to post a positive year-over-year growth and EBITDA margins in North America. And we are looking forward for the team to continue that momentum as we complete the rest of the year. Varun Laroyia : And Nick just to add to the comments you mentioned, so Chris, effectively if you look at on North America segment, which had an uptick with regards to gross margins by about 90 basis points. Without the self-service business that would have been up 170 basis points, so an incremental 80 bps. And if you think of it in terms of how that flows all the way through to EBITDA margins, while we are incredibly proud of the fact that the overall segment reported a 20 basis points up. As Nick mentioned, without the self-service business, it would have been 120 basis points up. So there's 100 point delta, 100 basis point delta right there at the EBITDA level. And I think the final part of your question was about the capital intensity of our self-service business. Listen, in terms of self-service capital intensity, it's actually pretty good. It actually lowers the overall capital intensity of the business. But if you think of the business model for our self-service where we have our stores or yards, take a pick in terms of what you would like to call them. The inventory that we have on offer on the salvage side has to be fresh, right? Once people come and pick their parts out of those vehicles, if it's there for more than call it three, max four weeks, it become stale. And so that's really when it become -- it gets kind of crushed and kind of again sent to the shredders, but effectively from a capital intensity perspective that product moves pretty darn quick. So on a capital intensity adjusted basis, the returns of that business are pretty good. The only issue, as you and Nick also kind of pointed out, is the volatility associated with the broader macroeconomic scenario with regards to scrap steel prices. That really is what kind of comes through. And then from an EPS perspective on a year-over-year basis, just to kind of reiterate, the reversal on scrap and as we\u2019ve talked about it in our guidance also that hit us for $0.04 on a year-over-year basis, Q1 '18 versus Q1 2019. So a $0.04 hit effectively on a year-over-year basis came through. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan Merkel : Hey, guys. Two questions for me. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Merkel : Morning. So, first, in North America can you provide a little bit more color on the aviation and glass headwind? Is it one-off or should it continue? And then, secondly, can you comment on the competitive environment in Europe if things are the same or getting a little bit worse? Dominick Zarcone : Sure. As it relates to the glass business, we\u2019ve taken a very purposeful approach to make sure that we can drive good margins there. Clearly it had a little bit of an impact on our revenue in the first quarter, that\u2019s probably going to linger with us as we proceed through 2019. Though, again, that\u2019s a business again where the costs get a little bit easier as we get into the back half of the year. The aviation business, again that -- it's different from the rest of our business and that\u2019s -- it's much fewer transaction of -- bigger dollar size per transaction, if you will. You\u2019re not selling a used engine for $800. You\u2019re selling used engines literally for hundreds of thousands of dollars. And so there is going to be more volatility. We are -- our expectation is in the aviation business. And again, the outlook for the year is -- the team is looking to hit their flat [ph]. Varun Laroyia : And then I think, Ryan, your second part of your -- of your two-part question was competition in Europe. So let me address that also. Listen, in terms of what we've talked about previously, we know there's a general downdraft with regards to economic sentiment across Europe in any case, the fact that there have been other folks that have public companies that have reported, which may have experienced negative growth. Each of our organic numbers that we\u2019ve kind of posted for our European business, each of our platforms actually delivered positive year-over-year organic. While it may have been anemic, they\u2019ve all came out with positive year-over-year organic. So, from that perspective, we feel good about it. We knew going into Q1 versus a year-ago, our European business a year-ago had been impacted by some operational challenges that have been well discussed and articulated. We are really happy with the way ECP has come through. That business as a market leader has continued to deliver and without the operational stumbles, is actually delivering on the promise we had -- we know that business can deliver. So on a broader basis, listen, the competition has always been there. Do we see any more intensity? Not really, it's always been pretty darn intense in any case. So from that perspective, no major shifts that we see specifically. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Stember from CL King. Your line is open. Scott Stember : Good morning. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning, Scott. Scott Stember : Could you maybe frame out a little bit more the Europe organic sales situation. You did say that you saw that ECP was up nicely, I guess, compared to the rest of the regions. But maybe just give us an idea of how much it was up and maybe just frame that against some of the other regions? Just give us an idea of the performance in Eastern Europe. Thanks. Dominick Zarcone : Yes. Scott, we don\u2019t provide guidance on a country-by-country basis. What I can tell you is on a same day basis Europe was well north of 2% and that was pretty much in line with ECP and most -- all of the businesses that we\u2019ve. So, no significant kind of deviation. Obviously, STAHLGRUBER is not in the organic numbers since we did it, complete that acquisition until May 31 of last year. So they won't really come into the whole, but for a month in Q2 and then really we will fully commence with the organic calculation going to get into Q3 of this year. But, again, across the board all of our platforms, if you will, think about ECP [indiscernible]. Rhiag, we are all in kind of that -- kind of low single-digit, 2% plus range that on a total basis was for the European segment. And that compare ECP last -- first quarter last year and then [indiscernible] organic. So that\u2019s where the big [indiscernible] came on a year-over-year basis. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes Review. Your line is open. Jason Rodgers : Yes, you mentioned, you saw a significant improvement in March from January and February. I wonder if you could put any numbers around that and perhaps talk a little bit about what you're seeing in April? Dominick Zarcone : Yes, so we don't provide monthly guidance, Jason. But let's just say that March was more consistent with where we had been historically, and the January numbers were pretty soft. Varun Laroyia : Yes, and again Nick just to add to -- Jason, just to kind of confirm what we did mentioned in the opening remarks was specifically the sales intensity in our North America segment in the first quarter where January and February was slow. March has come through very strongly. Now, again, a whole host of different anecdotal information. What we do know as a fact is that there was the federal government shutdown in the month of January where 800,000 federal employees were essentially not being paid or essentially not at work, and that obviously has an amplification impact also. But again, as we talked about, we didn\u2019t talk about margins, we specifically talked about North America sales intensity that continue to improve as we ended towards the back end of the quarter. Dominick Zarcone : Yes, and as we talked about last call too, right, the first two quarters of last year in North America had pretty much modest organic. So there is going to be tough comps, right. We are at, I think 6.8%, like 7.2% in Q1 and Q2 organic of 2018. And so again, we are going to have another quarter as we head into Q2, what we have -- some pretty high comps. And then the back half of the year obviously get much easier comps on a year-over-year basis. Operator : And we have no further questions in queue. I will turn the call back to Nick Zarcone for closing remarks. Dominick Zarcone : Well, thank you everyone for listening to our first quarter call here. We do appreciate your time and attention. Again, we feel very proud of the quarter we delivered. We think it puts us in very good standing as we head into the balance of the year. Again, there's nine months to run, if you will, so there's a lot of runway ahead of us. But all in all, we\u2019re feeling confident about 2019 and we certainly look forward to chatting with everybody in another 90 days when we report our second quarter results. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the LKQ Corporation's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Joseph Boutross : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning, as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the next few days. And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Dominick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. We certainly appreciate your time and attention at this early hour. This morning, I will provide some high level comments related to our performance in the second quarter, and then Varun will dive into the segments and related financial details, before I come back with a few closing remarks. When taken as a whole the second quarter of 2019 played out largely as we anticipated when we announced our first quarter results 90 days ago. There were both some clear positive movements and some disappointments, but we are encouraged by the overall result. On the plus side our North American segment experienced a significant uptick in both gross margin and EBITDA margin, which gives us confidence that our disciplined approach to the market and keen focus on controlling our cost are creating positive outcomes. Also our global focus on trade working capital management lead to significant cash generation, which was well ahead of our 2019 expectations. While there were some positive items related to the timing and we will give a bit back as we move through the remainder of the year, we are ahead of our initial plan from a free cash flow perspective for the first six months and we believe we will remain so for the balance of year. On the plus side, we knew we had very difficult year-over-year revenue growth comparisons with respect to both our North American and European segments, but the organic revenue growth came in below our tempered expectations. Additionally, there was one less working day in Europe in the second quarter of this year compared to last. So it's important to focus on the same day result, there is no doubt that the soft macroeconomic conditions across Europe are weighing on our industry and our revenue comparisons. We are performing better than many of our peers, but organic revenue in Europe was down and that softness lead through the operating margins. And finally, by quarter end scrap prices fell further 20% from the March 30th levels, which impacted Q2 results and will continue to weigh on our result for the balance of the year. Now onto the quarter. As noted on Slide 5, revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $3.25 billion, a 7% increase over 3.0 billion recorded in the comparable period of 2018. Parts and services organic revenue growth for the second quarter of 2019 declined 2.1% on a reported basis, but when adjusting for the one less selling day in Europe the decline in organic revenue or parts and services, was 1.3%. Net income was $150 million compared to the $157 million for the same period of 2018, diluted earnings per share for the second quarter 2019 was $0.48 as compared to $0.50 for the same period last year. However, the second quarter of 2019 results included a non-cash impairment charge of $25 million net of tax. Regarding this impairment charge as we reported last quarter, we intend divest a few of our non-core business units over the next year and thus have recorded related assets and liabilities held for sale. Each period we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. In the second quarter, we concluded that the expected recovery would be less than carrying value, and as a result we recorded an impairment charge of about $0.08 a share, which is excluded from our calculation of adjusted diluted EPS. On an adjusted basis net income was $204 million an increase of 6% compared to the $192 million reported for the same period of 2018. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2019 were $0.65, compared to $0.61 for the same period last year, a 7% increase. With respect to capital allocation, during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares of our common stock returning approximately $120 million of capital to our stockholders. Since initiating our plan in late October 2018, the Company has repurchased 9.3 million shares for a total of $251 million. Let's turn to the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 7, organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment declined [four tenth] (Ph) to 1% in the second quarter of 2019. As anticipated the PCW glass business and the airplane recycling operations exhibited a decline in same day growth, while the largest part of our North American segment that being in the automotives salvage and the aftermarket parts operations exhibited positive same day growth of approximately [seven tenth] (Ph) to 1%, while our focus on driving profitable revenue growth has the result of shaving off some low margin revenue it has the material positive benefit our margins. We continue to form well in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC collision and liability related auto claims were again down 2.6% year-over-year in the second quarter. This softness was nationwide with 40 of the 50 states recording a decline in repairable claims. Additionally miles driven has slowed with the lower growth coming from increased vehicles and operation versus miles driven per vehicle and increase in the number of people working from home and the shift towards online shopping. Despite some macro industry challenges on the top-line and facing another tough comparison against the second quarter of 2018, our North America's team's focus on profitable growth drove excellent year-over-year margin improvements. Segment gross margins were 44.1% and EBITDA margins were 14.4%, reflecting improvements of 100 basis points and 130 basis points, respectively, when compared to the second quarter of last year and representing some of the highest level in the history of the Company. Furthermore, when we move into self-service business, the business unit that experienced the greatest downward impact on margins from the decline in scrap prices. Gross margins and EBITDA margins for the rest of our North American segment were up 160 basis points and 190 basis points, respectively. Bruin will address this some more detail, but I wanted to highlight the positive results from our margin enhancement efforts. We also continue to grow our parts operations with aftermarket collision SKU offerings and the total number of certified parts available growing 5.4% and 11.5%, respectively year-over-year in Q2, related to certified parts as some of you may be aware, in late June LKQ receive notification from NSF International that it will discontinue its automotive parts certification business and affiliated automotive certification and registration programs effective September 30th of this year. Many parts which are certified by NSF are also covered by CAPA a largest certification body and we are confident going forward that discontinuation will not have a material impact on our certified parts availability. Moving to the other side of the Atlantic, our European segment achieved total parts and services revenue growth of 18%, primarily driven by the acquisition of Stahlgruber. Organic revenue growth for parts and services in the quarter of 2019 declined 4.3% on a reported basis and was down 2.8% on a same day basis, which was below our expectations. As noted by other public companies with European exposure, the softness is an overall industry headwind not an LKQ specific issue. Indeed our performance on a relative basis appears to be fairly strong, which gives us confidence that we are not losing share. Additionally, the diversification of our geographic footprint in Europe generally reduces the volatility in our segment performance because we are not overly exposed to reliance on any one specific country, while we don't disclose country-by-country detail, I will note that Italy was the softest in terms of organic revenue growth and the Eastern block was the strongest, albeit still below its historically high levels. Europe has seen many of its economy slowing as evidenced by negative or flat GDP growth and lower new vehicle sales. Discussions with our suppliers and other industry participants have confirmed the downward pressure that poor economic growth across the continent is having on the European parts marketplace. The consensus view is the soft economic conditions have led to an initial deferral of repairs and maintenance. While a near-term headwinds, we believe that core automotive maintenance can only be deferred for so long and the demand will eventually rebound that said we anticipate the soft industry conditions will continue through the balance of 2019. We believe our team has done a reasonably good job of reacting to the new revenue paradigm, but the revenue decline have resulted in a deleveraging of our operating expenses, and lower margins when compared to the prior year. Lastly on Europe, during our investor day back in May 2018, we outlined some of the key categories of focus designed to drive the future performance of our European enterprise. There were both some near-term and longer activities identified and we are making good progress on each of these initiatives. Since them we have also spent considerable time strategizing about how to best optimize the strength of our various businesses in Europe and to that end, we have engaged with a third-party consulting firm to assist in this ongoing review. Once complete, we will likely settle on an even broader and deeper array of initiatives than those highlighted a year ago. To be clear, the primary focus of this optimization project is to create an even stronger enterprise and to enhance our already leading competitive position in the markets in which we operate, by providing a best-in-class customer experience. To do that across our European platform, we intend to transform and more fully integrate the European businesses to operate more as a single entity. The transformation will be designed to allow LKQ Europe to take advantage of its scale and be more efficient entity. We anticipate most of this analysis will be completed in the next two months and we are currently targeting a call with the investment community in the second week of September, so we can share some of the key highlights of the project including the anticipated long-term benefits of the optimization initiatives, as well as the related costs required to complete the transition. Now let's move on to our Specialty segment. During the second quarter, specialty reported flat total revenue growth with organic revenue growth for parts and services of 1/10 of 1%, being offset by negative impact from currency. Specialty witnessed particular softness in Canada, which accounts for about 10% of the segments, revenue, largely related to Canada\u2019s weak economy. Additionally RV part sales were off slightly due to lower dealer retail sales across all regions. Our Specialty team is laser focused on spending controls, which will continue to help offset the impact of lower revenue. Despite the softness, light truck and SUV star rates still running at healthy levels and the number of RVs on the road are at an all time high, favorable dynamics for our RV business and the RV replacement part offerings. Moving on to corporate development. It was a relatively quiet quarter from a corporate development perspective, closing on just three smaller transactions, including two companies in the United States and one regional distributor in Belgium. For a total net consideration of $38 million. Our pipeline of opportunities remains quite healthy, and we will continue to acquire businesses that can add value from a customer offering or geographic perspective. Additionally, our development team continues to make solid progress with our assets held for sale efforts and during the quarter we entered into a definitive agreement to divest a small operation in Europe, which we expect to close in the third quarter.  Finally, during Q2 we opened up three branches in Western Europe, and one in Eastern Europe, while closing five underperforming locations, including one in Western Europe, and four in Eastern Europe. And with that, I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our updated 2019 guidance. Varun Laroyia : Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. Overall, we feel that the second quarter was a qualified success, providing some positive developments in our North America segment and also free cash flow generation, while also offering a few areas for improvement. Before diving into the results. Let's start with the key financial highlights. Operating cash flows in the second quarter were $461 million, the highest quarterly amount in the Company's history by a factor of more than two times. Free cash flow from the quarter totaled $413 million dollars, or $282 million higher than the same period in 2018. We have talked about the past few calls about our emphasis on cash flow generation. And I want to thank our teams across all three segments for their efforts to deliver substantial year-over-year growth. We are raising a full-year guidance for free cash flow, more details a little later. The strong cash flows enabled us to buy 4.4 million units of LKQ stock for approximately $120 million in the quarter. Additionally, we also paid down debt by $220 million in the quarter and in the six months through June 30th, have paid down $281 million. Returning cash to our shareholders, while reducing our net leverage ratio speaks to the strength of our business to generate strong consistent cash flows. Our North America segment was able to withstand some revenue softness to process highest segment EBITDA margin percentage since the second quarter of 2017. I want to commend the North American management team for taking a proactive approach to protecting margins to offset inflationary pressures, and proactively working to optimize its cost structure. Our European specialty segments also face soft revenue and we are taking actions in both segments to advance our stated strategic objectives and address current market conditions. Last quarter, we disclosed our plans to divest certain low margin business that fall outside of our core operations in geographies. This quarter, we are announcing a restructuring program that we expect to enhance our competitiveness in the current macroeconomic environment. The restructuring program covers all three of our reportable segments and advances our efforts to eliminate underperforming assets and cost inefficiencies. With underperforming assets we intend to close branches and warehouse locations that are not supporting a sufficient return on investment. Our current plan includes approximately 40 locations across the business, both in North America and Europe. We intend to migrate as much of the revenue as possible from these locations to other facilities in the LKQ network, but there will likely be some low margin revenue loss as a result of the closures. The restructuring charges will include facility closure costs, such as lease termination fees and moving expenses to relocate inventory and equipment. Additionally, through this process we have identified selective personal reduction that will benefits future periods, but will require upfront severance that will be charged to restructuring. We estimate that the restructuring program will cost approximately $25 million to $30 million over the next year to implement and will generate savings of a similar amount on a run rate basis. While this program represents a significant move forward in our plans to improve our competitiveness we will continue to evaluate our businesses and cost structure to identify further opportunities for simplification and cost efficiency. Regarding Europe the restructuring program was aid our efforts to deliver sustainable double-digit segment EBITDA margin. These efforts are part of, but do not reflect the entirety of the optimization project that Nick referenced earlier. In conjunction with European margins I want to highlight that we expect various integration costs such as ERP implementation to have a negative impact on that segment EBITDA margin over the implementation timeline. We have incurred some of these cost in the past, including in the second quarter, but expect some acceleration as the integration projects ramp-up. We think it will be important for investors to understand the nature and amount of these enablement costs and therefore we will provide disclosure of the expenses incurred as part of our quarterly reporting cadence. Now I will cover our consolidated and segment results, to save myself on words when I refer to net income and diluted EPS. Please note that I will be referring to the amounts from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders. In addition Nick covered the details on net income and earnings per share. So I will not repeat. Please turn to Slide 12 and 13 of the presentation for a few points on the consolidated second quarter results. The consolidated gross margin percentage increased 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 38.4%, driven by 100 basis points improvement in North America. While Europe was flat compared to 2018 as we discussed previously, there is a negative mix impact at the consolidated level as the lower gross margin European segment makes up a larger percentage of the overall results and hence has a dilutive effect on the consolidated margin. The mix impact will be less impactful going forward now that we have annualized the Stahlgruber acquisition. Our operating expenses increased by 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter with a rise in our European segment. Restructuring and acquisition related costs were $8 million as a result of ongoing expenses related to acquisition integration activities previously disclosed, as well as some initial charges of approximately $5 million from the restructuring initiatives. Interest expense was favorable by $2 million or 6%, compared to the second quarter of 2018. going to both lower interest rates and lower average debt balances. Moving to income taxes, our effective tax rate was 27.1%, which is roughly in-line with our full-year estimate. Please turn to Slide 16 for highlights on segment performance, starting with North America. Gross margin was 44.1% or 100% basis points higher than last year as I previously mentioned. For the most part, the margin expansion reflects the continued benefits of pricing initiatives in both our aftermarket and salvage operations, as well as effort in our glass business to get recognized for the quality of service and the breadth and depth of inventory that we provide and renegotiate underperforming contracts. We had an additional non-recurring benefit of 25 basis points related to an insurance settlement that was realized in the quarter. The self-service operation was a drag segment gross margins, with a quarter-over-quarter decrease due to scrap pricing. Sequential changes in scrap prices had an unfavorable impact of $2 million for the quarter, compared to a positive impact of $4 million in the second quarter of 2018, creating a $6 million year-over-year negative swing. Operating expenses were unchanged at 30.1% relative to the prior year, given the pressure on both parts and services and other revenues, and the resulting net leverage effect, holding the percentage flat and actually reducing the absolute dollars by $4 million is a very respectable outcome. This quarter is the first quarter without a quarter-over-quarter increase in expense as a percentage of revenue since the third quarter of 2017. Wage inflation and higher medical costs continue to negatively impact our operating leverage. Though the North America team had effectively managed expenses to counteract a portion of the impact. We generated further savings through improved safety performance have seen through a reduction in workers compensation themes and a favorable variance in bad debt expense from ongoing collection efforts. In total segment EBITDA for North America was $190 million up $15 million compared to last year. And as a percentage of revenue was up 130 basis points from the prior quarter. We have been talking about North America's margin enhancements over the last year, and the numbers show the progress that is being made. A year ago we disclose a 130 points decrease in segment EBITDA margin in a period with 7.4% organic parts and services revenue growth. This year, North America recovered the full 130 basis points in margin, despite the 40 basis points organic parts and services revenue decline. We are also encouraged by the fact that the North America team still feels that there are additional cost efficiency opportunities available and is working on plans to achieve these savings. Moving on to the European segment on Slide 19. Gross margin in Europe was 36% flat to the comparable period of 2018, centralized procurement yielded a 50 basis points improvement from supplier rebate programs as we continue to benefit from the Stahlgruber synergies. With respect to operating expenses we experienced a 100 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis versus the comparable quarter from a year ago. The quarter-over-quarter sales decline, partially attributable to one fewer selling day in the quarter had a negative impact of operating leverage. Given the segments relatively high cost base primarily with personnel costs. Additionally, there was a 30 basis points headwind associated with the ongoing transformation efforts, primarily the ERP and the broader project that Nick referenced. Partially offsetting we had a 30 basis point decrease going to reduce bad debt expenses as the team's focus on collection efforts. European segment EBITDA totaled $116 million a 5% over last year. As shown on Slide 21 relative to the second quarter of 218 both the Sterling and the Euro each week by approximately 6% against the U.S. dollar causing a negative effect from consolation. This was offset by favorability in transaction gains and losses netting to an immaterial impact on adjusted EPS for the quarter. Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 7.7% for the quarter down 90 basis points compared to the same period a year ago. As noted earlier, have taken action through restructuring programs throughout our European operations and we continue to believe that we have the best assets in Europe and are poisoned to achieve significant integration synergies. As Nick mentioned earlier, we will provide an update to the investment community in September on the European transformation project. Turning to the specialty segment on Slide 22, gross margin declined 130 basis points in the second quarter, relative to the comparable period a year ago. Office amount 60 basis points related to higher net product cost as of supplier discounts were lower than those realized in the prior year. The balance related primarily to unfavorable product mix. Operating expenses improved 40 basis points with reductions in personnel and freight costs more than offsetting higher facility expenses related to warehouse expansion projects that went live after the second quarter of 2018. Segment because for specialty was $52 million, approximately four million down from the second quarter of 2018, and as a percentage of revenue down 90 basis points to 12.7%. The specialty team is taking cost actions to protect its margins, aimed at producing benefits in the second half of 2019. Let's move on to liquidity and the balance sheet. As presented on Slide 24 and as previously mentioned, you will note that our operating cash for the second quarter was $461 million or 152% higher than the second quarter of 2018. On previous calls we have talked about driving working capital improvements and the team did a phenomenal job this quarter. It was a total team effort as all three of our segment's contributed with North America and Europe posting significant gains. Our key working capital accounts that is trade receivable, inventory and payables generated a cash inflow of $189 million this quarter compared to an outflow of $49 million in the second quarter of 2018. I wanted to especially mention to the North America team for working with our vendor partners to ensure LKQ receive market conventions payment terms, no different than other large customers and to the European team for its disciplined purchasing approach in light of soft creating conditions. As you would expect, I do want to offer a few words of caution on the strong year-to-date cash flows. There will be ups and downs in working capital and cash flows as we move throughout the year, based on seasonality and the timing of certain transactions. We will also actively use our liquidity to pursue opportunities that support our business objectives, for example, in funding the restructuring costs and those of our key vendor partners by making selective inventory purchases. CapEx for the quarter was $48 million, resulting in free cash flow for the quarter for $413 million and $537 million on a year-to-date basis. And finally moving to Slide 25, as of the June 30th, we had $376 million of cash resulting in net debt of about $3.7 billion or 2.8 times last 12 months EBITDA. Now, I would like to spend a few minutes and provide an update on our annual guidance. Please note that the guidance assumes that scrap prices and foreign exchange rates hold at current levels. Additionally, the guidance continues to assume no material disruptions associated with the United Kingdom's potential exit from the European Union, currently scheduled to occur on the 31st of October. As Nick noted earlier, the second quarter came in-line with our expectations. North America performed well and we expect Specialty to bounce back in the second half of the year. We see challenges with European economic conditions holding for the remainder of the year. And despite the underlying businesses being resilient, the management team will adapt to the software market conditions by accelerating the integration and cost efficiency programs. In addition to simplifying by carefully evaluating various programs that may not deliver benefits in the near-term. As mentioned earlier, scrap metal prices have continued to trend down and British pound is trending lower, based on the ambiguity that continues to reign in the United Kingdom with a new prime minister and his very definitive views on Brexit. Given these scenarios, we are trimming our 2019 full-year guidance by 2.5%, or $0.06 at the midpoint for adjusted EPS, while increasing expected free cash flow for the year by $50 million. Let me run through the updated guidance figures. Organic parts and services revenue growth revised to 50 basis points to 2% for the full-year. Diluted EPS on a GAAP basis is updated to a range of $1.73 to $1.81 accounting for the first half activity primarily related to the non-cash impairment charge I referenced earlier. Adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $2.30 to $2.38. You will note that at the midpoint of the range, we are down $0.06 per share from a prior guidance. Of this, $0.035 relates to low scrap prices and FX rates relative to our prior guidance and the remaining $0.2.5 largely reflects the net anticipated ongoing softness in Europe in the second half. Cash flows from operations has been increased to a range of 800 million to 875 million and capital spending is reduced to a range of 225 million to 275 million resulting in a net increase at the midpoint to free cash flow for the full-year by $50 million, despite the trim in earnings. In summary, the second quarter have separate highlights shrink where our actions of bearing fruits such as North America margins and generating strong free cash flow that is funded the ongoing share repurchase program and debt pay down. However, the softer macro conditions in Europe and the volatility in scrap and FX give us full support and hence we have trigged a cost reduction and efficiency programs to adjust to the market conditions. Overall, we remain optimistic about our prospects for the future. Now I will turn the call back to Nick for closing remarks. Dominick Zarcone : Thank you, Varun for that excellent financial overview. In closing I would like to review a few of the key initiatives discussed on previous calls that will continue to be points of focus during the balance of 2019. First, we will integrate and simplify our operating model. Second we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth to create sustainable margin expansion. Third, we will drive better levels of cash flow, which in turn will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy and fourth, we will continue to invest in our future. As you can see from the second quarter results these programs and targets are gaining momentum throughout the organization and the teams are actively working towards achieving the respective goal. I am proud of the momentum we have created with our second quarter performance and how our team of over 51,000 employees performed a various market challenges in both North America and Europe. Importantly, I want to recognize our leaders across each of our segments have embraced our productivity initiatives and the performance and compensation metrics, we have implemented as we progress through 2019 and beyond. I am confident these factors will create long-term value for our stockholders. I look forward to having you joining our European discussion in September and we will announce final details as we get closer to that call. And with that operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator instructions] Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Your line is now open. Daniel Imbro : Yes, thanks. Good morning guys, thanks for taking my questions. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning Daniel. Varun Laroyia : Good morning. Daniel Imbro : Wanted to think about the European margin actually Varun starting with the gross margin-line. I think you said gross margin were flat year-over-year despite a 50 bip tailwind from procurement and we left some of the issues from Q2 last year, but if you could just kind walk through some of the puts and takes of what is going on in that line and then as comparison get more difficult in the back half, how you guys are expecting that gross margin on the trend in Europe. Thanks. Varun Laroyia : Yes. Absolutely Daniel and good morning and thank you for calling at the hour. Yes. If you think about our European gross margin it was flat and deep, so you actually read that correct. You really think about it in terms of while we did get the centralized procurement benefits with the organic decline coming through there is pressure on margins, right. And so, as you think about other competitors also out there, the one area where they go through to be able to kind of sustain the revenue side is on the margin peace of it. So margin did come under some pressure as a result of that. Nothing more, nothing less, we have always had those competitors are there. But clearly with a falling market as such, that is really where folks end up in trying to give value to their customers. So there were some pressure from that perspective. I think if you step back and think about it, while the headline number would suggest that the European segment EBITDA margins declined by call it 90 basis points a year-over-year. Put this entire piece into context, as you think about the fact that a year ago, Europe delivered at 8.3%, organic growth number. This year, the reported number is negative 4.3. That is 12.5 percentage points swing. And as you think about the fixed cost structure, largely you know a more so in the European Space. That is the kind of deleverage that ends up coming through. And even if we were to be able to hold flat, for example, rather than negative 4.3, if it were flat, and you were to run the math, the SG&A or the OpEx expenses would actually declined by 100 basis points with all other things being similar. So think about the deleverage that takes place in a market that is shrinking. And it doesn't just show up in the gross margin-line, it actually shows up in multiple lines, in terms of not being able to get the operating leverage. Operator : Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open. Craig Kennison : Hey , I'm sure there will be more questions on Europe. But I wanted to shift to North America and the collision business. How do you explain that soft collision trend? And to what extent is the total loss rate which appears to be climbing, resulting in fewer repairs and really just fewer opportunities for LKQ? Dominick Zarcone : Good morning, Craig. This is Nick. Thanks for your question. We have a very deep and ongoing relationship with CCC. We get a lot of data from them on a on a quarterly basis. And when we sat with them a couple weeks ago, we asked them point blank, their perspective as to the decline in repairable cranes in particular, because that is really what drives our business. In general, they indicated that the winter of 2019 was a bit milder than 2018 and that has an impact of reducing collision volume, if you will. And there is no doubt that on April 1 beginning of the second quarter, right, the collision repair shops have less backlog, if you will, in 2019 than they did on April 1st of 2018. You are absolutely right. Total loss rates have continued to nudge their way upward just a bit. And on the margin that takes a few cars out of the repair shops and put some into the salvage auctions, which is not a bad thing for us, because we have more cars to purchase. Total loss rates for the June 2018 to May 2019 time period was 19.3% that compares to 18.7% for the June 2017 to May 2018 time period so up just about a half a percentage point or so. Miles driven, has really started to flatten out from May 2018 April 2019 up only [six tenths] (Ph) of 1% compared to the May 17 to April 18 time period and most of those miles there increase is in fleets as opposed to personal miles. What I would call the accident-prone portion of the population think about our teenagers out there and then maybe some of the very elderly, they are not in the fleet segment and so that they believe and we believe it\u2019s having perhaps a slight impact as well. So the good news on a longer-term basis is that the number of cars in the sweet spot is up and APU continues to shift upward very slowly, but it does shift up a bit and we believe quite frankly that account for the positive spread between our organic growth and actually the negative repairable claims growth. And lastly obviously we were measuring against a 7% comp of Q2 last year and those comps will get a little bit easier in Q3 in a much easier in Q4. Operator : Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is now open. Michael Hoffman : Hi, I\u2019m going to change gear completely and talk about cash. Looking at the revised guidance, my thinking about the second half correctly, if I take the midpoint of the net income in the free cash flow. It would suggest you do about 300 million in net income helps about 180 million of DNA and then setting that some of the other things in the cash flow statements unchanged other than working capital. That is the comment you made Varun, is there is about 140 million or 150 million walked back of working capital in the second half and that puts you at the midpoint of the cash flow from ops. Varun Laroyia : Yes Michael. So yes, good morning this is Varun actually. And yes I think the mechanic to fuel utilizing in your model from free cash flow or an OCF prospective are appropriate and I think if you also kind of look back into it, you just take 2017 and 2018 two prior years. We typically do have an outflow on create working capital in the second half verses the first half. So in terms of different ways to look at it, clearly with the slide frame of 20 million, 25 million at the midpoint for adjusted net income, don\u2019t also forget that with the restructuring program that we called that also takes us back. So I would not say the usage on a working perspectives is about 140, 150 I think just take into account the lower earning plus also the restructuring that we called out that will be utilizing cash and then just in terms of the first half, second quarter use of free working capital. Overall the mechanics that you are thinking of are appropriate and hence both Nick and I referenced that there will be certain timing associated with payments. But we do expect there to be certain opportunities for us to be able to invest more on the inventory side, just given the state of the market on a broader basis. If not us, that is seen some on a softer revenues, it\u2019s happening to competitors and we are certainly seeing it from some of the suppliers specifically over in Europe in terms of what they have been calling out. But thank you for the question, we are very pleased with the way cash is been coming through the business and really happy with the momentum that we picked up from the second half of last year and that is carried into 2019. We believe there is more to come. Operator : Stephanie Benjamin with SunTrust. Your line is open. Stephanie Benjamin : Hi, good morning. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning. Stephanie Benjamin : I was hoping if you could talk a little bit about just the headwinds we are seeing from the aviation, and glass businesses. And when you would - start wrapping those. I understand it's just kind of a comp because they are small businesses where small base, but you can see some nice swings quarter-to-quarter. So just first, just when we should expect to comp some of that going forward. And then additionally, if you could just walk through in a little bit more detail, just what is driving the kind of significant margin improvement in North America, whether it's pricing, just cost control, just as any - a little bit more color on how we can think about that going forward would be helpful. Thank you so much. Dominick Zarcone : Okay, great. Well I will start. Clearly, we indicated in past calls, as it relates to our glass business, that when we bought the business, we inherited some less than profitable contracts. And so we have moved away from some of that revenue intentionally. That is all part of the idea of focusing on really profitable revenue growth. That comes with a decline in revenue on an organic basis, if you will. And sometimes you need to be willing to walk away from business. And that is what we have done there, if you will. That project and some of those contracts really started at the beginning of this year. So by the time we get into the late Q4, and first quarter, next year we will have fully anniversary that project. The aviation business, again, you need to keep in mind, which is also by the way, a negative drag on organic growth in both the first and second quarter. That is a business that is very, very lumpy. The average ticket sale there is not necessarily a few hundred dollars for our part, but we are talking tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousand dollars for parts. So timing on a quarter-to-quarter basis can have big impacts. Again, our expectation would be - it's going to be tough sliding there for the rest of the year. Varun Laroyia : Stephanie this is kind of at the result. I think on your second part, the question about North America margin improvement, it\u2019s actually is very, very tightly linked with what Nick started off by saying our focus on profitable revenue. Listen, we have talked about this in the past. Also, there are a number of businesses, there is a lot of revenue that is potentially available. And in the past, the company has taken advantage of it. But has been kind of looked into the market pressures, and really in terms of what is the contribution margin for that additional dollar of revenue, whether it be certain customers, whether it be certain product lines. We have consciously walked away from some of that. How should we say, lower margin or EBITDA free revenue. And yes, we did anticipate the organic growth numbers coming in as a result. And I think the way we would suggest is, Nick mentioned this in his overall comments. If we look at our core automotive parts and services business, which essentially is full service - and also aftermarket business, that business still grew about 70 basis points year-over-year, despite some tough comps from a year ago. So from that perspective, we are very happy in terms of where the focus by the team has been. So think about that specific piece, is this being conscious about the revenue that we go chase because there is cost associated with picking up the parts in the warehouse, delivering them in certain cases having to pay for the returns and so just being very conscious in terms of the revenue that we chose. Operator : Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is open. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning guys. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning Bret. Varun Laroyia : Good Morning. Bret Jordan : I will go back to Europe. Your peer in the space was commenting about some sequential - improvement around whether driven demand, I guess could if you talk about what you are seeing their sort of - if you are handicapping how much is economic and how much is weather and on the prior question just to add in, are we talking about the Fiat Chrysler battery distribution business as profit with sales. Dominick Zarcone : So as it relates to Europe as a whole, your question I think really relates to what are we seeing here early in the third quarter and you know we have got basically three weeks worth of data which is not enough to former trend. Some of our operations are seeing a slight uptick on the revenue side, but again it's three weeks and we are headed into the big holiday season that being the vacation season over in Europe and so we are not going to - we are not working under the assumption if there is going to be significant uptakes in revenue growth in the back half of the year. We think its though slating, the reality is we talk to our competitors, we talk to our customers, the garages and obviously our suppliers and everyone is I think working under the assumption that these industry conditions are going to with us for a while. If they turn we think we will be a huge beneficiary of that, but we think it prudent to work on the - assumption that it\u2019s going to be - these business conditions are going to be with us for the balance of year. On the your question as to the battery business. Again, we started that in 2018 as a new programs, so we fully anniversaried that we are continuing to distribute batteries on behalf of the FCA organization that being in the Mopar batteries to their dealers across the United States that is a good relationship and a good contract for us. Operator : Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning. Chris Bottiglieri : Hey, good morning. Really so we call in September, but I am a patient as our most investors, so want to cut it by layer what you have already told us and trying to think through what we do know already today. So as I understand it, there will be non-GAAP restructuring costs that you have laid out and then there is currently already a 30 basis point headwind from integration systems and that will not be non GAAP. You would expect 30 basis points to accelerate moving forward as you get further on those projects. And top of that as you go to the planning process there will be more potential cost to recognize these savings. So I guess the question is will those additional cost be non GAAP or those be just the headwind or earnings and how should we begin to think about 2020? I would think this would cause a decrease to European margins and free cash flow, but wanted to kind get anything you do know today would be helpful? Varun Laroyia : Chris, It's Varun out here. So yes, you are right and just for the broader attendees on the call also Nick did mention that in the second week of September we will provide an update on the various European initiatives that we talked about at the Investor Day last May. So there will be a full, deep dive associated with the various initiatives and really as to how we see the overall three plus year program that we talked about a little over a year. Your specific question with regards to restructuring, yes. But again, I do want to clarify the $25 million to $30 million of restructuring that we have triggered already. And you would have seen that in the second quarter numbers also. We have actually started that activity so it\u2019s not as if you are starting it now. It actually impacts each of our three reportable segments, not only Europe. The other piece that I would like to call out is, with regards to the broader European optimization and integration program, the restructuring that we have currently talked about is not the entirety of that piece. So yes, if you play the tape forward, there will be a costs associated with integration. And really, the point is to kind of give the market some foreshadowing language with regards to transformation costs, right. There will be a cost associated with being able to integrate those businesses. And we will provide an update of that also in the September timeframe. And again, I think it just is helpful for the investment community to understand, business as usual versus costs associated with taking the business to the next level, and essentially digging the mood that much deeper around what we expect to be best-in-class businesses in any case. So there will be some costs associated with being able to make those investments, but also to get some of the cost structure that is currently embedded out there. But again, more on that when we get to the September review. Operator : Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan Merkel : Hey, thanks for filling in. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning. Varun Laroyia : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Merkel : Good morning. So I have two questions on Europe. So first what percent Europe segment sales, which you defined is more discretionary in nature. And the reason I asked them is trying to get a better understanding of the cyclicality that we might see if the Europe macro stay soft. And then secondly, on the Europe optimization plan, what is the main scope of work for the consultants that you hired? And the reason I ask that is because you are already restructuring and I presume you have already looked at divesting assets. Maybe just a little more clarity there would be helpful. Dominick Zarcone : Yes, so I will start with the second half of that question, Ryan. It's important to keep in mind that the restructuring activities and what I call the optimization project, they are linked, but they are separate. Restructuring initiatives are all about kind of right sizing our business for the current market conditions. And that involves a consolidation of facilities and the elimination of lower margin activities at a local level as Varun described. The optimization project in Europe is really a longer term focus. And really, the intent is to gain efficiencies by morphing the European Organization and operating structure from what today is a fairly independent country based model to a slightly more integrated model that leverages a higher level of centralized resources. To be clear, in Europe we sell into local markets and our focus on customer service needs to remain to be a very activity, so nothing is going to change their, but there are many activities where we can create a better customer experience across the European platform and become more efficient by utilizing a more centralized structure, particularly when you think about things like procurement, category management, logistics IT and alike. Getting from here to there is no easy task and it\u2019s not going to happen overnight, it\u2019s going to happen over several years, but we believe and some of the initial work with our outside consultants have clearly documented that there could be significant benefits of doing this and that is why we are headed down the path. There are costs to get there, things like a new ERP program which is going to get kicked off - which was kicked off back in October is going to roll out over the next four to five years. We need to create a central European office as opposed to the virtual structure that we have today. We need to establish some off shore or near shore back office infrastructure activities and alike, we are in the middle of the process, we are midflight, if you will in identifying and quantifying about the opportunities and expenses to get us there. And that is really we are going to chat about coming September. So the focus of the program largely is harder shift - kind of the org structure, both from is truly a structure perspective and operating perspective from being a last integrated independent country model to a more integrated central model and that is going to require a lot of heavy lifting to do that, but the benefits we believe are quite significant and at the end of the day it will create a better customer experience, which will help drive revenues and alike. As it relates to discretionary versus nondiscretionary the reality is most of the parts that we sell in Europe are parts for day-to-day service on your car and in some cases take if your battery is out and you can\u2019t crank your car over right, that is a nondiscretionary item you need to go get a new battery, so your car will work. but what we find on the margin is when economy gets soft European consumers are no different than American consumers. The first thing you do when things start to get high is you take a hard focus on your household cash flow and you tend to buy down. And so we are still selling a battery to the shop or maybe instead of the harder battery with the seven year warranty that goes out at a pretty high price point the consumer gets the more value line battery that is cheaper for them. We still sell a battery, but it\u2019s a lower revenue battery and it\u2019s a lower margin dollars batteries. And so it\u2019s hard to a put number Brian as to what is absolutely discretionary versus nondiscretionary. You know when your oil light comes on to say it\u2019s time to change oil, you don't have to go do that tomorrow and if you are trying to save some money. You may differ that for few months. You know earlier in the spring I was at a [CAPA] (Ph) conference, CAPA is a big trade organization for the parts manufacturers in Europe, and had an opportunity to meet with the heads of almost all of our major suppliers, a lot of our other peers in the distribution side of the industry and alike. And our suppliers indicated that they saw their aftermarket activity start to trend down late in 2018. And so we are not even a year into it. So I think we have got - and that is why we are a little bit cautious in the expectations for the back half of the year. I think it's going to be another six months before we begin to kind of lap the impact of the of the soft environment. Operator : This ends the time allotted for the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dominick Zarcone for final remarks. Dominick Zarcone : Well we certainly appreciate your time and attention this morning. As I indicated earlier, we are encouraged about the progress that we have made in many regards, particularly the margin structure in North America, the cash flow numbers, which were terrific. We have a lot of work to do in Europe to understand that and we look forward to sharing with you in mid-September, kind of the update on those activities. So again, I appreciate your time and attention and we will talk to you in September. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Carol. And I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the LKQ Corporation's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn the call over to Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Joe Boutross : Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone and welcome to LKQ's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us today are, Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.  For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we're planning to file our 10-Q in the next few days. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the third quarter and then Varun will dive into the segments and related financial details before I come back with a few closing remarks. We believe Q3 was a strong quarter for our company and we are very pleased with the results despite facing some ongoing macroeconomic headwinds particularly in Europe. Each of our three segments showed important improvements in their respective operating metrics, particularly with respect to EBITDA margins which on a consolidated basis, showed a year-over-year improvement for the first time in several quarters. That gives us confidence that our disciplined approach to the market and keen focus on enhancing margins will continue to create positive outcomes.  During the quarter, we repurchased 3.9 million shares of our stock for a total of $101 million, reflecting an average price of about $26 a share. Since we implemented the share repurchase program last October, our total repurchases have aggregated 13.2 million shares for a total of $352 million or an average price of approximately $26.66 a share. I am pleased to report that this week our Board approved an additional $500 million to the repurchase plan and extended the time period to October 2022. With that, we have almost $650 million of capacity under the amended plan. As noted on Slide 5, revenue for the third quarter was $3.15 billion, and eight-tenths of 1% increase over the $3.12 billion recorded in the comparable period of 2018. Parts and services organic growth for the third quarter increased 2.3% on a reported basis, and when adjusting for one more selling day in each of our operating segments, the increase in organic revenue growth for parts and services was positive, nine-tenths of 1%. Acquisitions added eight-tenths of 1% of growth, while currencies had a negative impact of 2.3%.  Net income was $152 million compared to the $134 million for the same period in 2018, an increase of 13% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.49 a share as compared to $0.42 for the same period of 2018, an increase of 17% year-over-year. On an adjusted basis, net income was $189 million, an increase of 6% as compared to the $177 million for the same period last year.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.61, as compared to $0.56 for the same period of 2018, a 9% increase. We are pleased with the level of EPS growth considering the marginal uptick in revenue.  Now let's turn to the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 7 organic revenue growth for parts and services in our North American segment was 2.9% in the quarter, a nice sequential uptick from Q2 and against a tough Q3 comp year-over-year. When adjusting for one more selling day in the quarter, North American organic revenue growth increased 1.4%, which was also a sequential uptick from Q2. We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that collision and liability related auto claims increased just five-tenths of 1% in the quarter. Encouragingly, the CCC data represents the first quarterly year-over-year increase in repairable claims since the third quarter of 2018. The uptick in frequency is related to an increase in miles driven, more severe and frequent weather in certain markets and the ongoing increase in distracted driving.  Consistent with the year-to-date results, during the third quarter, the growth in recycled products was higher than that for aftermarket, though the aftermarket line showed improving trends as we moved through the quarter. Again, our North America's team's focus on profitable growth drove excellent year-over-year margin improvements.  Segment gross margins were 44.2% and EBITDA margins were 12.8% reflecting improvements of 100 basis points, and 50 basis points respectively when compared to the third quarter of 2018. These are among the best third quarter margins our North American team has achieved in five years. Furthermore, when removing the self-service business, which experienced the greatest downward impact on margins from the continued steep decline in scrap prices, gross margins and EBITDA margins for the rest of our North American segment were up 120 basis points and 80 basis points respectively. These strong margins are evidence that our focus on profitable revenue is working.  As just mentioned, scrap metal pricing tumbled during the quarter and placed pressure on Q3 results. As Varun will discuss, this will unfortunately set an even higher hurdle with respect to our fourth quarter results. We also continue to grow our parts offerings with aftermarket collision SKU offerings, and the total number of certified parts available growing 5% and 10.3% respectively year-over-year in the third quarter. As evidenced that we continue to take share, during the quarter, our team successfully negotiated a new three year contract with a top tier customer. Under this new agreement, LKQ will be the primary provider of alternative replacement parts for this customer across the United States with incentives to grow their annual volume with us.  Additionally, during the quarter the team launched a regional pilot program with a top five insurance carrier to be their preferred supplier for all recycled parts. As part of this program, we are highlighted within CCC's estimating platform to show our parts first in the search function and are specifically designated as the approved supplier for this carrier. While we don't anticipate this pilot program to have a material impact on our results, if eventually rolled out on a national basis, it could provide an uptick to our salvage volumes. Lastly on North America, during the quarter our glass business PGW and FCA Mopar, mutually agreed to end the agreement related to the distribution of batteries to the FCA dealer network. Similar to rationalizing our asset base, we are continuously looking at our product portfolio to assure we are focusing on profitable revenue. While ending this agreement will negatively impact our organic revenue growth in Q4 and throughout 2020, it will have a nominal impact on earnings in both periods and will improve the future operating margins of our PGW business.  Moving to our European segment, organic revenue growth for parts and services in the third quarter increased 2.1% on a reported basis, and seven-tenths of 1% on a same day basis. Acquisitions added 1.3% of revenue growth to the European results, while the strong dollar resulted in a negative impact of 4.6%. As noted by other public companies with European exposure, the soft economic backdrop continues to create an industry headwind.  That said, our performance on a relative basis appears to be strong, which gives us confidence that we are gaining share. While we don't disclose country-by-country detail, on a same day basis, we witnessed positive organic revenue growth for each of the markets in which we operate, except for Germany, which was essentially flat, and Italy, which was down. The Italian market continues to face significant macroeconomic headwinds. Across the continent, we expect trade disputes with the U.S. along with Brexit related uncertainty to continue to weigh on the European economies. With respect to Brexit, as most of you know, on October 28, European leaders agreed in principle to extend the Brexit deadline until January 31, 2020. We continue to closely monitor the Brexit situation to ensure our UK business is positioned accordingly with appropriate inventory levels.  As most of you on the call are aware, on September 10, we provided the investment community with an overview of our European strategy. The call focused on our transformation into a sleeker, more agile organization, which internally we refer to as 1 LKQ Europe.  As I stated on the September call, going forward, we will begin to operate more as a single business as opposed to a collection of independent businesses. Today, we are by a wide margin, the largest most profitable distributor of automotive parts in Europe, with metrics that are unparalleled in the industry with respect to the number of countries and customers served, the number of locations operated, SKUs offered and total revenue generated. Our goal now is to optimize all aspects of 1 LKQ Europe.  Importantly, during Q3, we experienced a 90 basis points sequential improvement in EBITDA margins compared to only 20 basis points of sequential growth in 2018. The margin improvement is entirely consistent with the expectations we set forth during our call last month. And as Varun will discuss, the improvement is after covering approximately 10 basis points of transformation expenses. As Europe has become a larger portion of our global revenue and as part of our Board\u2019s ongoing director refreshment process, on October 3, we announced the addition of Patrick Berard to our Board of Directors. As CEO of Rexel Group, Patrick has a successful track record of leading global B2B distribution networks. His operational knowledge and experience of the European markets will provide tremendous value to the Board and the organization as we continue to execute our 1 LKQ Europe strategy, and we welcome his addition to our Board. Alongside Robert Hanser who joined our Board in 2016, Patrick represents the second addition to the Board with extensive experience in the European markets and distribution.  Now let's move on to our specialty segment. During Q3, organic revenue growth for parts and services for our specialty segment increased 1.5% on a reported basis and was generally flat when adjusting for one more selling day as we continued to face unfavorable market conditions in Canada. On the plus side, the rollout of our RV OEM warranty programs continues to yield positive results and were well received at the RV Open House event in Elkhart, Indiana in September. Additionally, the team finalized a designated supplier agreement to be the aftermarket parts and services provider to Cap-IT Genuine Truck Ware stores. Moving on to corporate development. The third quarter was quiet with no acquisitions closing during Q3. On the first day of Q4, we closed on the acquisition of another diagnostics and calibration business in North America. This represents our second transaction in the services sector, and is consistent with our strategy to become a leader in the diagnostics and calibration market. During the third quarter, our development team continued to make solid progress with our assets held for sale efforts, and ongoing rationalization of our asset base and the divestiture of non-core businesses. On August 8, we announced the divestiture of our recycled aviation parts business AeroVision International. Additionally, on October 1, we announced that we merged our subsidiary Auto Kelly Bulgaria with Elit Kar creating one of Bulgaria's leading distributors of automotive spare parts. LKQ now owns a 20% equity interest in the combined business.  Finally, during Q3, we continued our efforts in rationalizing our branch network in Europe by closing six underperforming branches in Western Europe and two in Eastern Europe.  And with that, I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who\u2019ll run through the details of the segment results and discuss our updated 2019 guidance. Varun Laroyia : Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. Overall, we are pleased with our third quarter performance, especially related to improvement in segment EBITDA margin, and strong free cash flow generation. These are exciting times for us as the field teams have embraced our key financial priorities of profitable revenue growth, margin expansion and free cash flow generation. The results speak for themselves.  Seeing the positive momentum carrying through the third quarter enhances our confidence about LKQ's strategic priorities and our ability to deliver on them. Before diving into the results, let's start with the key financial highlights.  Operating cash flows in the third quarter were $327 million, the second highest quarterly amount in the company's history, trailing only the most recent previous quarter, that being the second quarter of 2019. Our segment teams are doing a tremendous job managing trade working capital to deliver strong operating cash flows. After two historically high quarters of cash flow generation, we do expect to see a softer fourth quarter in terms of operating cash flows. I'll cover the full year outlook in the guidance discussion. Free cash flow for the quarter totaled $262 million or $126 million higher than the same period in 2018 and $800 million on a September year-to-date basis. While the absolute number of free cash flow is important, we are also actively analyzing the efficiency of our cash flows and what level of our earnings we can convert to cash on a sustainable basis.  Looking at slide number 25, you can see a positive trend in the free cash flow to EBITDA conversion ratio this year on the programs we put in place in the second half of 2018. This year's growth trajectory is well above our initial expectations. And while that ratio will moderate in the fourth quarter, I am very encouraged about the improvement relative to the last five years. The strong cash flows enabled us to buy back 3.9 million shares of LKQ\u2019s stock for approximately $101 million in the third quarter.  Looking at slide number 26, for the program to-date we have purchased 13.2 million shares at an average price of $26.66, a healthy discount to recent trading levels. Additionally, we paid down debt by $109 million in the quarter and $391 million in the nine months through September 30. By doing so, we were able to decrease our net leverage ratio to 2.6 times, which is the same level as the first quarter of 2018, the last quarter before we acquired Stahlgruber. Getting back to the pre-acquisition leverage ratio, following the company's largest ever transaction, within five quarters is a terrific accomplishment. And this of course does not reflect the active share repurchase program I referenced earlier. Returning cash to our shareholders while reducing our net leverage ratio speaks to the strength of our business to generate strong cash flows. Nick mentioned the $500 million expansion to the share repurchase authorization, which is supported by our expectation of sustained strong cash flows, and the success of our share repurchase program to-date.  Now I will cover our consolidated and segment results, similar to last quarter, to save myself some words and also as the accompanying earnings deck is largely self explanatory, when I refer to net income and diluted EPS, please note that I will be referring to the amounts from continuing operations attributable to LKQ shareholders. In addition, Nick covered the details on net income and earnings per share, so I will not repeat. Please turn to slides 12 and 13 of the presentation for a few points on the consolidated third quarter results. The consolidated gross margin percentage decreased 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 38.1%, though please note that the reported margin includes $17 million in restructuring related costs classified in cost of goods sold, which represents a 50 basis point negative impact on gross margin. Setting aside the restructuring, we saw improvement in the quarter driven by 100 basis point improvement in North America.  Restructuring and acquisition related costs in operating expenses were $9 million as a result of ongoing expenses related primarily to the restructuring initiative we announced last quarter. Interest expense was favorable by $9 million or lower by 21% compared to the third quarter of 2018, owing to low interest rates and average debt balances and some favorable translation effects. Moving to income taxes, our effective tax rate was 28.1% for the quarter, which reflects the incremental expense for the year-to-date catch up, caused by a change in our estimate of the annual effective tax rate. We increased the estimated rate to 27.5%, up from 27% this quarter, primarily due to a shift in our projected geographic allocation of income. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries, which relates mostly to our investment in Mekonomen reflected income of $4 million versus expense of $20 million in the third quarter of 2018. You will recall that we recorded a $23 million impairment charge on our Mekonomen investment last year.  Now please turn to Slide 16 for highlights on segment performance starting with North America. Gross margin was 44.2% or 100 basis points higher than last year. For the most part, the margin expansion reflects the continued benefits of initiatives in both of our aftermarket and salvage operations, as well as efforts in our glass business to be recognized for our quality of service and breadth and depth of inventory, and also the ability and successfully to renegotiate underperforming contracts.  While the self-service operation was a drag on segment gross margin, with a quarter-over-quarter decrease due to scrap pricing, the impact was not material on a year-over-year basis. Sequential changes in scrap prices had an unfavorable impact of $8 million for the quarter, compared to a negative impact of $7 million in the third quarter of 2018, creating a $1 million year-over-year negative swing. With scrap trading at even lower levels in October, we are anticipating a further hit in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses increased by 50 basis points relative to the prior year to 32% for the third quarter of 2019. We picked up a selling day this year, which had a positive leverage effect, but there were several offsetting factors that pushed expenses higher than a year ago.  First, incentive compensation contributed to a 50 basis points increase year-over-year. Last year, the segment fell behind in its bonus targets, causing downward revisions of the bonus accrual, whereas this year's strong performance generated upward revisions in the third quarter.  Second, as mentioned previously, facilities expenses continued to trend higher this year due to expansions and rate increases related to renewals. Facilities expenses increased by 40 basis points relative to a year ago. Our North America team is actively working on monitoring underperforming locations for potential rationalization.  On the positive side, North America showed positive leverage in other personnel costs through lower insurance claim costs as well as disciplined hiring, and implementation of the cost reduction plan I described last quarter. In total, segment EBITDA for North America in the third quarter was $166 million, up $12 million or 60 basis points higher than the prior year.  Closing out on North America, I'd like to recognize the team for following through on the pursuit of the profitable revenue growth objectives. A year ago, we disclosed a 70 basis points decrease in segment EBITDA margin in a period with 5.2% organic parts and services revenue growth. This year, North America has recovered almost the full variance in margin with organic parts and services revenue growth of 1.4% on a per day basis. A disciplined approach of focusing on profitable revenue growth has been a significant enabler of the year-over-year margin improvement.  Moving on to the European segment on Slide 19, gross margin in Europe was 35.3%, down 130 basis points relative to the comparable period of 2018. As Nick previously noted, we recognized restructuring expenses in the United Kingdom for branch and brand rationalization related to the Andrew Page operation. These expenses represented a negative 120 basis point impact for the quarter. Outside of these charges, the segment gross margin was roughly flat, with lower margins in our Central European operations due to pricing and mix mostly offset by benefits of 30 basis points from centralized procurement and improving margins in the United Kingdom.  With respect to operating expenses, we experienced a 30 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis versus the comparable quarter from a year ago. Personnel expenses represented the largest portion of the increase, primarily related to the tightening of bonus accrual adjustments, wage inflation and the negative leverage effect caused by lower sales growth.  For the third quarter of 2019, there was a 10 basis point headwind associated with the ongoing transformation efforts related to the 1 LKQ Europe program. The relatively low amount in the quarter reflects that many projects are in the early stages, and all the costs are currently being capitalized, for example, in the ERP program. We expect the operating expense portion of these costs to increase in the fourth quarter and going forward into 2020.  European segment EBITDA totaled $125 million, a 3.6% decrease over last year. As shown on slide number 21, relative to the third quarter of 2018, both the sterling and the euro weakened by 5% and 4% respectively against the dollar causing a negative effect from translation. The net effect on GAAP EPS this quarter was not material, but represented about a penny headwind on adjusted EPS. Segment EBITDA was 8.6% for the quarter, down 20 basis points compared to the same period last year, with about half of the decrease attributable to transformation costs.  We remain confident in our ability to deliver the outcomes detailed in our September 10 1 LKQ Europe goal and expect to finish the full year within the previously disclosed segment EBITDA margin range of 7.8% to 8.3%.  Turning to the specialty segment on Slide 22, the gross margin percentage declined 80 basis points in Q3 relative to the comparable period of 2018. Of this amount, 40 basis points related to unfavorable product mix, while 20 basis points resulted from higher net product costs, as our supplier discounts were lower than realized in the prior year.  On the other hand, operating expenses improved by 130 basis points with reductions in personnel and freight costs, more than offsetting higher selling expenses. The improvement is partially attributable to the leverage benefit from an additional selling day in the third quarter in 2019. Segment EBITDA for specialty was $45 million, up about 6% from Q3 of 2018 and as a percentage of revenue was up 50 basis points to 11.5%. With a backdrop of low revenue growth, the specialty team has taken decisive action, as evidenced by the year-over-year decrease in operating expense dollars and continues to evaluate the cost structure to protect the segment margin.  Let's move on to liquidity and the balance sheet. As presented on Slide 24, you will note that our operating cash flow for Q3 was $327 million or 70% higher than a year ago. Our key working capital accounts that is trade receivables, inventory and payables generated a cash inflow of $58 million in the quarter compared to an outflow of $64 million a year ago. The purchasing teams continue to take a disciplined approach to inventory, given soft trading conditions, which has contributed to a year-over-year improvement in working capital.  That said, we anticipate inventory to represent a use of cash in the fourth quarter as we take advantage of buying opportunities and build inventory for the expected seasonal revenue increase going into Q1. Do note that while we are making solid progress on the vendor financing program in Europe, we do not expect meaningful benefits till we get into the new year.  CapEx for the quarter was $64 million, resulting in free cash flow for the quarter of $262 million and $800 million on a year-to-date basis. Finally, moving to Slide number 27, as of September 30, we had $433 million of unrestricted cash, resulting in net debt of about $3.5 billion.  Now, I would like to provide an update on our annual guidance. Please note the guidance assumes that scrap prices and foreign exchange rates hold at current levels. As Nick noted earlier, we are pleased with the third quarter results. North America continues to perform well despite the ongoing challenges in scrap metal prices. Our specialty segment is continuing to create new service offerings that have won industry-wide acclaim and has been decisive on costs given the revenue outlook. We see challenges with European economic conditions, holding for the remainder of the year. And despite the underlying business being resilient, the management team is adapting to the softer market conditions by accelerating the integration and cost efficiency programs in addition to simplifying by thoughtfully evaluating various programs that may not deliver benefit in the near-term.  As you\u2019ll recall, details of the European actions were provided at a comprehensive briefing on September 10. As mentioned earlier, we expect scrap metal prices to continue to negatively impact our results in the fourth quarter. Despite this backdrop, we are holding the adjusted EPS at the midpoint of $2.34, while appreciating some headwind in Q4 from scrap metal prices and FX at the current levels. We are increasing our expected cash flows from operations for the year by $150 million at the low end to $950 million and by $125 million to hit $1 billion at the high end.  I'll run you through the updated guidance figures. Organic parts and services revenue growth revised to 25 basis points to 100 basis points for the full year to take into account the actual for the most recent quarter. Diluted EPS on a GAAP basis is updated to a range of $1.69 to $1.76 accounting for the first half activity primarily related to the non-cash impairment charges as well as restructuring charges incurred through September; Adjusted diluted EPS in a narrower range of $2.31 to $2.37, and so $2.34 at the midpoint. Cash flows from operations has been increased to a range of $950 million to a $1 billion and capital spending range is narrowed to $240 million to $260 million.  In summary, the third quarter has several highlights showing where actions are bearing fruit such as North American margins and generating strong free cash flow that's funded the ongoing share repurchase program and the materially higher debt pay down. While the softer macro conditions in Europe and the ongoing downward pressure in scrap gives us full support, we believe there is resiliency in the model to adjust to the market conditions and deliver on our commitments. Overall, we remain optimistic about our prospects for the future.  Now, I'll turn the call back to Nick for closing remarks. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Varun for that financial overview. In closing, I would like to review a few of the key initiatives discussed on previous calls that will continue to be points of focus during the balance of 2019 and as we begin our 2020 budgeting process.  First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, we will continue to drive higher levels of cash flow, which in turn, give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And fourth, we will continue to invest in our future.  And as you can see from our third quarter results, these programs and targets are gaining momentum throughout the organization. And our teams are diligently working towards achieving their respective goals.  We have well thought out plans, are focused on crisp execution, and we are achieving positive results. I want to thank our over 51,000 team members who daily endeavor to overcome the short-term variables that are out of our control by tackling opportunities to drive organic sales, aggressively pursue market share gains, implement operational efficiencies to enhance the productivity and profitability of our organization, and to provide industry-leading customer service. We believe that when combined, these factors will create long-term value for our stockholders.  And with that operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question this morning comes from Craig Kennison from Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. And apologies for the background noise. Varun, the cash flow is such an impressive piece of the story right now. And I'm curious, to the extent you're drawing down inventory on a per location basis, if you will, have you seen any impact on fulfillment rates or have you been able to sustain those fulfillment rates? Varun Laroyia : Craig, hey, good morning. It's Varun here. I think it's a great question. And as I said in some of the upfront remarks, the teams have just been doing a phenomenal job on the trade working capital program.  Just for the quick memory jogger, trade working capital comprises inventory tables offset by trade receivables. And as we said, we were in a overbought position in several locations as we have optimized our overall distribution, including the level of inventory that we were holding in several sites. We have certainly seen a reduction. The other piece to note is, as we've always talked about, as revenue becomes a little bit softer -- and again, this is in line with the pursuit of profitable revenue, so the quality of revenue, inventories will also get readjusted. And that really is what's happening.  To your specific question with regards to are we seeing any stock out scenarios or any drop in fulfillment rates? Absolutely not. This will be done very, very carefully in terms of where we were holding excess inventory, inventory that was not moving for example. And to kind of give you one specific example, you would have noted that we took a COGS restructuring for our Andrew Page operations in the United Kingdom. Again, as part of the branch and brand rationalization, there was inventory that frankly did not fit with the future plans for that business. And that's really how it's taking place. But no, we're seeing no drop off in any fulfillment rates. Operator : Our next question comes from Bret Jordan from Jeffries. Please go ahead. Bret Jordon : Hey, could you talk about the impact from this Fiat Chrysler battery distribution shift? I mean, I guess what was it? What would be the revenue comparison with it exiting the business? What's the margin benefit? I think those were sort of profitable sales. And then what's the timing on it? Does it impact the fourth quarter or is that 2020 shift? Nick Zarcone : Thanks, Brett. We started the FCA agreement in January of 2018. As we ran through last year, clearly the impact on organic growth was about 1% in a positive fashion. So that's basically what we're going to be giving up over the next 12 months. It will start a bit here in Q4. It won't be a full impact, probably 70 to 80 basis points of pressure on organic. And then we'll -- obviously the full revenue give back, if you will, will occur in 2020. But again, the reason for not renewing that contract is it wasn't meeting our internal kind of hurdles as it relates to margins and returns. And I think the folks at FCA appreciated that. So it was a amicable kind of separation, if you will. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, while it will have an impact on our organic growth, the impact on earnings will be nominal. And so margins will be going up by getting rid of that low margin business. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephanie Benjamin from SunTrust. Please go ahead. Stephanie Benjamin : I wanted to touch on what you're seeing in the North America aftermarket business. I think you pointed to salvage really outperforming but you were seeing some acceleration on the aftermarket side as we moved throughout the quarter. Is that more function of just seeing some easier comps or how should we kind of think about the performance of really the strength in the salvage and then what's going on in the aftermarket? Thanks. Nick Zarcone : Sure. On the salvage side, obviously we have a leading position. We've been able to buy cars, total losses at a reasonable price. And so our margins in that business are strong and we believe they will continue to be strong. On the aftermarket side of the business, again, the growth early in the quarter was a little bit slower. We showed progress during the quarter. The early returns here in October look very good as it relates to aftermarket product. We think some of it, again, has to do with the pitch towards higher APU by the insurance companies and obviously aftermarket products are a largest share of the alternative marketplace. We've seen a little bit of positive movement out of the folks down in Bloomington at State Farm. Nothing to write home about, but again, the movement in the positive direction, if you will.  And then actually the GM strike has helped us a little bit as well. So there's a number of things that are kind of gentle tailwinds in the aftermarket business, and we're anticipating that they will continue in Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Hi, thank you very much for questions. Happy Diwali, Varun. Varun Laroyia : Last weekend. Michael Hoffman : Yes, it was. Cash flow from operations, is that, one of its best percent of revenues ever. Where can that go and how do I think about that progressing into next year? Varun Laroyia : Great question, Michael and really appreciate the kind wishes for Diwali also. It is a big event in the Hindu calendar. And again for those of you that celebrate Halloween and my family celebrates all of it, Happy Halloween to everyone, we\u2019re certainly enjoying great LKQ weather here in Chicago, needless to say. Yes, and with regards to cash flow generation, this is something that we've talked to the markets for quite some time. This is a case of operating our businesses with a tremendous amount of focus. Again, as I kind of said in some of my upfront comments, the pace at which our field teams have taken over this initiative has been phenomenal. We are thrilled about it, and it really gives us various options. If you think about it the way we have deployed the capital over the last year, last four quarters, it's been a balanced capital allocation strategy. Not only have we bought back $352 million worth of LKQ stock, in addition to that last 12 months, we've paid down close to $426 million on our debt that we've been carrying also.  In addition to that, as we think about going into 2020, there will be the seasonal uptick with regards to revenue. And so, we are seeing at this point of time certain buying opportunities in all three of our segments, North America wholesale, Europe and also specialty, and we will judiciously deploy that cash.  And with regards to the share repurchase program, given the success of that program, as we announced earlier this morning, the Board has re-upped for further $500 million. So at this point of time, we have close to $650 million of capacity. And then again the debt pay down will continue. We don't talk about corp dev transactions in any case, but we have made a commitment that there were no large platform transactions that were in the pipeline and it really will be kind of going back towards our debt pay down, share repurchases and things along those lines.  I think the one piece that I'm not sure very many people have noticed that at the high end of our operating cash flows in the upgraded guidance, we\u2019re calling out $1 billion of operating cash flows in the current fiscal year. And we think that is tremendous. It doesn't happen overnight. And again, just really a massive thanks to our field teams for really getting back in terms of the focus on this initiative. As we think going forward, various options to move forward in terms of how we deploy the cash. There are plenty of alternatives and I'm happy to report that there are a number of very exciting opportunities of what we can do. We will certainly give further guidance when we give guidance for 2020 in terms of more robustness in terms of how we plan to deploy that capital. But as of now, we do have several levers that we could deploy that cash. Nick Zarcone : And Michael, one of the things going forward that has had almost no impact thus far is the vendor financing program, as Varun indicated in his prepared remarks, that will really begin to kick in next fiscal year. And so that will be in an incremental lever that we will have on a going forward basis. Operator : Our next question comes from Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : I wanted to follow up on the revenue rationalization. You guys have done a great job kind of rationalizing unprofitable business in both the U.S. and Europe. You mentioned the FCA contract, but how far along are we in that process? Is there still further business that you think you can rationalize in Europe and then same question for the U.S. as well? Nick Zarcone : Yes, so in the U.S., we think we're largely done. Again, we spent a lot of time last year, early this year really focusing on profitable revenue growth and margins, gross margins in our North American business. Clearly, the FCA contract didn't fit within that, those parameters. So again, we decided to exit. In Europe it\u2019s less of a product line review and more of a kind of a country-by-country review. I mean part of the reason for exiting Bulgaria was, it was an incredibly low margin opportunity. We still have some other businesses that are being held for sale in Europe and they are lower margin businesses as well.  We continue to monitor and will continue to monitor both on a product line basis and kind of a legal entity basis to find opportunities we\u2019re looking forward. It's just -- those activities or businesses just are not going to return on the level of margins and return on capital that we believe our shareholders desire. And we will continue to be aggressive in kind of pruning opportunities, but there's no one big material item out there, Daniel. It's kind of pruning some smaller businesses and/or lines of business. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Chris Bottiglieri : So yes, first off a great job on the free cash flow and North America margins really impressive. I did want to focus on Europe with that said. Relative to the guidance that you gave on 9/10, just wanted to get a sense where it looks like kind of a steep implied ramp in Q4, did something change at all at the margin when you gave that guidance or was this always meant to be Q4 weighted? And then -- nothing that\u2019s out of the way. And then this is a related thought. I don't speak Dutch, but it seems like you've made some branding efforts in the Netherlands and Belgium with rebranding Fource. I was hoping you can kind of comment on what you're doing there and kind of what that means for the overall portfolio. If you see a broader rebranding taking place? Thank you. Nick Zarcone : Yes, so I'll start and Varun can fill in. The results for the third quarter for Europe were exactly in line with our expectations when we set forth the guidance back on September 10th. And yes, we anticipate that Q4 will be a decent quarter for us in Europe. And so there's no change if you will in the kind of the quarterly progression from what we anticipated back on September 10th.  As it relates to your comment in the Netherlands and Fource, the reality is, while we refer to Sator as the broader organization in the Benelux region, and that's the name of the holding company, our go-to-market brand has always been Fource. And that's been the case for many, many years. I think what you may have seen is, some programs where that -- kind of has bubbled up to the surface. But there's no change there. That's always been our trade name in the Benelux region. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan Merkel : I want to follow-up on EBITDA for Europe in the fourth quarter if I could. I'm just curious, do you think you can expand margins year-over-year or is the macro still too much to overcome? Varun Laroyia : Ryan, it\u2019s Varun. Yes, we do believe we can expand it. I\u2019ll give you a couple of data points to think through. First of all from the investor discussion we had seven weeks ago, on the 10th of September with regards to Europe, we were very careful in terms how we were putting forward the cadence of the margin progression, not only for 2019 but the next few years also. Nothing has changed on that front, even including the macroeconomic piece, it has been playing out exactly the way we thought it to be.  You will probably recall in the second quarter we had called out a restructuring plan. And the restructuring plan essentially was to contemplate across all three of our reporting segments, optimizing the infrastructure costs, given the macroeconomic outlook with regards to revenue, we know that there was a certain level of revenue that we needed, given the relatively high fixed costs nature of the European business. And with regards to that, we have been taking action. And you would have noted in addition to the $17 million of COGS restructuring we took another $9 million was taken in the third quarter. We will see some of those benefits come through also.  So overall, it was planned along those lines, and we do fundamentally believe that our European business will be within the range of the 7.8 to be 8.3 that we had called out seven weeks ago, so nothing has changed from that perspective. Nick Zarcone : And on a year-to-date basis, we're at 7.8 in Europe, so the fourth quarter does not need to be hard if you will to hit the guidance that we set forth on September 10. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We have no one in queue at this time. I'll turn the call over to you. Nick Zarcone : Okay. Thank you, operator. Well to everybody on the other ends of the call, we greatly appreciate your time and attention. We understand this is a very busy reporting season and we appreciate you spending this past hour with us. Again, we look forward to chatting with everybody again in late February, as we announce our 2019 year-end results, which I believe is going to be on February 20. And we're looking forward to a good conversation then as well. So thank you and we'll talk to you soon. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the LKQ Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Joe Boutross : Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone and welcome to LKQ's fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call. With us today are, Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.  For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, as well as the slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-K in the next few days. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter and then Varun will dive into the financial details and 2020 guidance before I come back with a few closing remarks. Q4 was a strong quarter for our company, and we are very pleased with the results. As we mentioned at the outset of 2019, we were focused on a few key initiatives, and I am proud to say our segment teams have embraced and executed on each. There is more opportunity ahead, and we will continue to work hard to move the company forward. Let me reiterate the key initiatives, which continue to be central to our culture and objectives as we've entered 2020. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. For example, in 2019, we launched our 1 LKQ Europe program and provided a clear road map to drive the business to double-digit EBITDA margins. Additionally, in 2019, we divested our airplane recycling business and merged auto Kelly Bulgaria with a competitor, thereby removing a couple of low-margin non-core businesses from our lineup and freeing up management time. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. In 2019, we were able to grow margins despite facing low revenue growth and macro headwinds in Europe, with our teams doing an exceptional job of addressing costs with their productivity efforts. North America, in particular, witnessed year-over-year improvement in segment EBITDA margins of 100 basis points in 2019. Third, we will continue to drive higher levels of cash flow which, in turn, will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. In 2019, we generated record cash flow from operations of over $1 billion and free cash flow of nearly $800 million, reflecting year-over-year increases of 50% and 73%, respectively. Last year, we paid off $301 million worth of debt and repurchased 10.9 million shares of our stock for over $290 million. And fourth, we have and will continue to invest in our future. In 2019, we made two strategic acquisitions in the automotive diagnostic space, which positions our North American business to be at the forefront of this rapidly growing market opportunity and will allow us to continue expanding our customer offerings. As noted on Slide 5, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $3 billion, reflecting growth of 0.2%, a slight increase from what was recorded in the comparable period of 2018. Parts and Services organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter was 0.9%. Acquisitions added 20 basis points of growth, while currencies had a negative impact of 1%, for total parts and services revenue growth of 0.1%. Net income during Q4 was $140 million compared to $40 million for the same period of last year, an increase of 247% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.46 compared to $0.13 for the same period of 2018, an increase of 254% year-over-year. On an adjusted basis, net income was $167 million, an increase of 10% compared to the $151 million for the same period of last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.54 compared to $0.48 for the same period of 2018, a 13% increase. We are again pleased with the level of EPS growth considering the marginal uptick in revenue. Let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 7, organic revenue growth for parts and services in our North American segment was 2.5% in the quarter. This organic performance includes a benefit from the GM strike, which was partially offset by declines in our glass and heavy-duty truck businesses. Excluding these dynamics, organic growth would have been 1.3%. We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that, according to CCC, collision and liability-related auto claims decreased 1% in the fourth quarter. Also, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, our performance in Q4 was achieved while miles driven in the U.S. were down 0.1% year-over-year in November. Related to our recycling businesses, I am proud of the impressive environmental efforts of our North American team in 2019. Between our full service and self-service salvage businesses, during the year, we processed over 887,000 vehicles, resulting in, among other things, the recycling of 4.2 million gallons of fuel, 2.6 million gallons of waste oil, 2.5 million tires and 630,000 batteries, all reflecting solid increases over 2018. This effort is a key pillar of our mission of being a responsible steward of the environment and a true partner with the communities in which we operate. We also continue to grow our parts offerings with aftermarket collision SKU offerings and the total number of certified parts available growing 4.9% and 10.0%, respectively, in 2019. Lastly, on North America, during the quarter, we continued the development of our mobile app-based delivery manifest management system, which we call InTouch Mobile. InTouch Mobile is a proprietary, internally developed platform that will automate delivery management and route accounting procedures that we are converting from a manual to paperless process. InTouch Mobile will also enhance the customer service experience, improve route and driver efficiencies and simplify various accounting functions. We are excited about this implementation and optimistic about the potential productivity it will generate. At the end of Q4, 85% of our full service and aftermarket locations were live on the system. Moving to our European segment. Organic growth for parts and services in the fourth quarter was 1.2%. Acquisitions in Europe added 0.7% of revenue growth, while the strong dollar resulted in a negative impact of 2%. As noted by other public companies with European exposure, the soft economic backdrop continues to create an industry headwind. Indeed, our performance on a relative basis appears to be strong, which gives us confidence that we continue to take market share. While we don't disclose country-by-country detail in the fourth quarter, we witnessed positive organic revenue growth in each of our markets in which we operate, except for Germany and Italy. As it relates to the 1 LKQ Europe program, we continue to gain operational momentum on multiple fronts, and the segment is performing in line with the metrics and multi-year plan we set forth last September. As I've stated in the past, talent acquisition and to build out our organizational structure is a key component to implementing our 1 LKQ Europe program. And in Q4, we made very good progress on the talent front. Going forward, we are implementing a recently announced European organizational structure of key functional departments, including private label, which we are now calling components, product management and procurement, supply chain and information technology. On the operational side, we have announced both a new CEO for Rhiag, Italy, who came from the outside, and the promotion of an internal person to lead the Stahlgruber organization. On the corporate side, we have announced the recruitment of a human resources leader for all of Europe and also appointed leaders for information technology, product management, procurement and components. The implementation of these strategies will promote the harmonization of processes and infrastructure, the implementation of best practices and the establishment of common standards in each of the functions. We believe this will position the business to achieve better results, make faster and better decisions and work more efficiently. Supporting the organizational structure, in Q4, we identified Zug, Switzerland as the future home of our European segment corporate office. We expect to officially open the office in mid-2020. With a key initiative of investing in our future, we began the construction of our new central distribution center for our Fource business in the Benelux region. Located in the Netherlands, this new facility will enable us to consolidate the activities of five small existing distribution centers into a single location, which will have automation similar to that found at T2 in the U.K. and Sulzbach-Rosenberg, in Germany, albeit on a slightly smaller scale. Regarding Brexit, our U.K. operations have taken necessary precautions to protect the interest of our customers for every milestone of this exit process. We have a sufficiently deep inventory from European and Asian suppliers, strong supply processes and significant measures in place to provide our customers with the service they expect from us even in the face of Britain's recent departure announcement from the common market. In fact, we believe the size of our business and its industry-leading processes will enable us to continue to expand our market share in the U. K. and the Republic of Ireland, acting as a key partner for our customers even in the face of what could be a momentous change. As Europe has become a larger portion of our global revenue and is a part of our board's ongoing director refreshment process, on December 6, we announced the addition of Xavier Urbain to our Board of Directors. As the former Group Chief Executive Officer of Netherlands based CEVA Logistics, Xavier's experience with building a global business across both developed and emerging market will add tremendous value at the board level into our operating teams as we continue to execute on the 1 LKQ Europe program. Lastly, in Q4, we opened three new branches in Eastern Europe and two new branches in Western Europe. Now let's move on to our Specialty segment. During the fourth quarter, Specialty reported a total revenue decrease of 6%, a performance well below our expectations. The primary drivers for this decline were twofold. First, two major suppliers altered their go-to-market strategies, which essentially bypassed wholesale distributors for a portion of their volumes. We believe these are isolated cases and not reflective of a broader trend. Second, in the fourth quarter, a few companies who use our specialty unit to fulfill orders they received through online marketplaces witnessed impactful interruptions during the critical selling period of late November and December. These interruptions were related to these companies having their sales halted temporarily due to intellectual property complaints submitted to the marketplace facilitators. Today, these companies have had varying degrees of success, countering those claims in getting back online. Confronted with these headwinds, our specialty team is aggressively seeking new business by expanding our product line and targeting new and relevant customers. Additionally, specialty continues to focus on measures to right-size their cost structure given the top line challenges, hoping to offset some of the reduction in EBITDA margin. At the 2019 SEMA Show, Warn announced that Ford Motor Company is offering a Warn winch for it's 2020 F-250 and F-350 Super Duty trucks. These new winches will be available as a factory- orderable option or a dealer-installed after sale accessory on properly equipped Super Duty models beginning in mid-2020. Additionally, at the Chicago Auto Show this month Jeep announced that the new limited addition 2020 Jeep Wrangler JPP 20 is equipped with a Warn Rubicon Zeon Winch along with Warn's proprietary Spydura Rope. As was announced at Specialties RV Expo last month, we continue to expand our RV OEM warranty program with the addition of Winnebago, a rapid adoption of our OE warranty program offerings to top tier manufacturers is a clear validation of our unrivaled distribution network in customer service capabilities. There was a relatively quiet quarter from a corporate development perspective, we closed on two transactions in the US, a diagnostic and repair service provider in a niche business that manufacturers and distributes replacements and labels, with a total net consideration of $13 million. In addition, we announced the execution of a definitive agreement to sell the company's equity interest in two Czech Republic wholesale automotive parts distributors, and that's pending regulatory approval. Finally, as you are aware, the coronavirus has generated significant headlines, which has led to many questions regarding our supply chain. First, I'd like to say that, on behalf of LKQ, our thoughts go out to all those impacted by the virus. Clearly, with this outbreak, everyone is in uncharted waters, and it is simply too early to say what interruption companies could face across the business world. The coronavirus outbreak occurred just prior to the Chinese New Year. As a normal course of business and anticipating the annual shutdown related to the Chinese holiday, we had already procured and received most of the Chinese manufactured products needed for the first quarter. Importantly, our segment teams are proactively monitoring the situation and are in constant dialogue with our supply chain partners to help assure we maintain continuity in our operations and effectively manage the inventory levels we need to service our customers. And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run you through the details of the segment results and discuss our 2020 guidance. Varun Laroyia : Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. Overall, we are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year performance, as it relates to progress in our key financial priorities of profitable revenue growth, margin expansion and free cash flow generation. Resetting the team's focus to these priorities, while implementing large-scale changes to our compensation plans was a formidable task, and we are incredibly pleased with how quickly the organization adapted to these progressive changes to deliver solid results in 2019. With North America in a strong position and the 1 LKQ Europe program picking up momentum, we are excited about our prospects for 2020 and beyond. Before diving into the results, let's start with the key financial highlights. The consolidated segment EBITDA margin for Q4 improved 80 basis points relative to the prior year. This was led by the North America segment, which not only generated the highest fourth quarter margin in the previous 5 years, but the highest by 120 basis points. Europe and Specialty were roughly flat, although Europe faced a 30 basis point headwind from transformation expenses. Q4 was a relatively low revenue growth quarter, so the ability to maintain or grow margins speaks to the improved resilience of the business. The restructuring programs we implemented earlier in the year have certainly helped in this regard and helped kick start the focus on costs and productivity. As we guided last quarter, after a couple of historically high quarters of cash flow generation, the expected moderation of operating cash flows occurred in the fourth quarter. That said, we were still able to add approximately $100 million in operating cash flows for the quarter to finish the year well over $1 billion, a record high for the company. We are cautiously optimistic going into the year, as reflected in our original guidance of $775 million to $850 million, but to finish over $1 billion is a tremendous accomplishment. I want to thank our team members across the enterprise for their efforts in making this a reality. What was anticipated to be a 3 year journey has taken us a little over a year. This is the LKQ culture that I am immensely proud of. I'll now cover our consolidated and segment results. Similar to last quarter, to save myself some words and the accompanying earnings deck being largely self-explanatory, when I refer to net income and diluted EPS, please note that I will be referring to the amounts from continuing operations attributable to LKQ shareholders. In addition, Nick covered the details of net income and earnings per share, so I will not repeat. Please turn to Slides 12 and 13 of the presentation for highlights on the consolidated fourth quarter results. The consolidated gross margin percentage increased 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 39.7%, with the improvement primarily coming from North America. Please note that the reported margin includes $4 million in restructuring-related costs classified in COGS, which represents a 10 basis point negative impact on gross margin. There's a little bit of rounding impact on the components, though adjusted gross margin, which excludes restructuring, is up 120 basis points. Overhead expenses increased 40 basis points to 29.7, primarily driven by North America and higher transformation costs in Europe. Restructuring and acquisition-related costs were $16 million as a result of ongoing expenses for the initiatives we announced in the second quarter of 2019 and acquisition integration. Interest expense was favorable by $4 million, a decrease of 11% compared to the fourth quarter of '18, owing to lower interest rates and lower average debt balances. Other income was favorable by $18 million, of which nearly all the variance relates to changes in miscellaneous gains and losses from acquisitions and divestitures, as well as impairment charges. Please note that these items are excluded from our calculation of adjusted EPS. Moving to income taxes. Our effective tax rate was 26.5%, which reflects a reduction in expense for the year to date catch-up caused by the finalization of the annual effective tax rate. Equity and earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries, which relates mostly to our investment in Mekonomen, reflected income of $1 million versus expense of $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. You will recall that we recorded a $48 million impairment charge on the Mekonomen investment a year ago. Please now turn to Slide 16 for highlights on segment performance, starting with North America. Gross margin was 46.1% or 260 basis points higher than the prior year. The margin expansion reflects the continued benefits of initiatives in both our aftermarket and salvage operations, as well as efforts in our glass business. Two additional items in the quarter took these to new highs. One, the positive revenue impact from the GM strike drove a favorable mix impact on gross margin. And two, precious metal prices had reached record levels, providing a boost to revenue per vehicle in our salvage operations. Falling scrap prices remained a drag on segment gross margin. Sequential changes in scrap prices had a unfavorable impact of $9 million for the quarter compared to a negative impact of $5 million a year ago, creating a $4 million year-over-year negative swing. However, self-service was able to show a quarter-over-quarter margin improvement due to the positive impact from sales of precious metals I referenced earlier. Operating expenses increased 90 basis points to 32.5% in the fourth quarter. As previously referenced, the North America segment produced 2.5% organic growth in parts and services revenue, which had a positive leverage effect, but there were several offsetting factors that pushed expenses higher than a year ago. First, incentive compensation contributed a 50 basis point year-over-year increase. Strong operating performance required upward revisions in bonus accruals, pushing expense higher than a year ago. Second, bad debt expense had an unfavorable impact of 30 basis points. Though to be perfectly clear, this wasn't a deterioration in collections this year as the variance is largely attributable to a high level of recoveries in Q4 of 2018 and saw a negative year-over-year comp. Third, a gain on the sale of a former Nashville facility a year ago drove a 30 basis point increase in overhead expenses as we did not have a similar gain this past quarter. Finally, as mentioned in the last few quarters, facility expenses continued to trend higher this year due to expansions and rate increases related to renewals, creating a further 20 basis point impact. Favorably, North America showed positive leverage of 30 basis points in other personnel costs through lower insurance claim costs, disciplined hiring and the implementation of the cost reduction plan described in the second quarter. In total, segment EBITDA for North America in the fourth quarter was $180 million, up $27 million or 180 basis points higher from the prior year. Closing out on North America. We know that we can't count on events like the GM strike or record high precious metal prices to be present every quarter. We undeniably saw a margin benefit from both these items, though I don't want to discount the margin achievement as pure good fortune. As the old saying goes, sometimes, you have to make your own luck. And the North America team deserves credit for being ready to serve the market when the GM strike disrupted supply. Being disciplined operators and seizing available opportunities, the North America team was able to deliver a fantastic quarter. Moving on to the European segment on Slide 19. Gross margin in Europe was 36.6%, down 10 basis points relative to the comparable period of 2018. Restructuring expenses in the U.K. represented a negative 20 basis point impact for the quarter. Outside of these charges, the segment gross margin was up 10 basis points, with benefits from higher purchasing rebates, mostly offset by lower margins in our Benelux, Eastern European and Italian operations due to lower prices and product mix. With respect to operating expenses, we experienced a 10 basis point decrease on a consolidated European basis versus the comparable quarter a year ago. For Q4 2019, there was a 30 basis point headwind associated with the ongoing transformation efforts related to the 1 LKQ Europe program. Personnel expenses were favorable in 2019 by 40 basis points due to restructuring program savings and the benefits of a hiring freeze across the segment. European segment EBITDA totaled $108 million or 90 basis points increase over last year. As shown on Slide number 21, relative to the fourth quarter of '18, the pound sterling was roughly flat, though the euro weakened by 3% against the dollar, causing a negative effect from translation. Overall, there was a $0.02 headwind on adjusted EPS for the quarter, with roughly equal parts coming from the impact of transaction gains losses and translation. Segment EBITDA was 7. 6% for the quarter, up 10 basis points compared to the same period last year and includes a 30 basis point headwind owing to transformation expenses I referenced earlier. On a full year basis, segment EBITDA was 7. 8%, within the range we communicated on September 10, the 1 LKQ Europe call. And to be clear, this figure includes 20 basis points of transformation costs for the year. Turning to the specialty segment on Slide 22. The gross margin percentage declined by 100 basis points in Q4 due to equal impacts from sales mix, including a decrease in revenue from drop shipment sales, and timing of adjustments for customer rebate accruals. On the other hand, operating expenses improved by 50 basis points with reductions in personnel and freight costs more than offsetting higher vehicle expenses. Segment EBITDA for specialty was $25 million, and as a percentage of revenue was down 10 basis points to 8.4%. With the backdrop of a revenue decline in the fourth quarter, the specialty team continues to take action to control costs, as was evidenced by the year-over-year decrease in operating expense dollars. Let's move on to liquidity and the balance sheet. As presented on Slide 24, you'll note that our operating cash flow for 2019 was roughly $1.1 billion or 50% higher than 2018. The key working capital accounts, that is trade receivables, inventory and payables, generated a cash inflow of $46 million for the year compared to an outflow of $205 million a year ago. Our purchasing teams did great work in driving this improvement by applying a disciplined approach to inventory and soft trading conditions and working with our vendor partners to improve payment terms. CapEx for the year was $266 million, resulting in free cash flow of $798 million, a 73% increase over the prior year. To put this into perspective, our 2019 free cash flow was higher than our 2018 operating cash flow despite a $16 million year-over-year increase in CapEx. As discussed the last time, we analyzing the efficiency of our cash flows and what [ph] level of earnings we can convert to cash on a sustainable basis. Looking at slide 25, you can see a positive trend in the free cash flow to EBITDA conversion ratio this year based on the programs we put in place in the second half of 2018. We made significant strides this year to move this ratio closer to where we believe we can operate over the long term. There is further opportunity to improve our conversion, though we do not expect 2019 growth percentages to repeat at the same rate in 2020. In line with our ongoing judiciousness on capital allocation and capital structure, we concluded that redeeming our $600 million four and three quarters US dollar bonds due in 2023 using cash on hand and lower cost revolver debt was the best use of our liquidity. The cash generated during the fourth quarter was used to pay approximately $200 million of the bond redemption costs with the remaining funds provided by our credit facility. Additionally, we took the opportunity to exercise a purchase option on our North America headquarters in line with our long term commitment to the national area. We continue to believe that our balance sheet is in good position to support our business objectives. And finally, moving to Slide number 27, as of the 31st of December, we had $523 million of cash on hand, resulting in net debt of about $3.5 billion. Our net debt. leverage ratio remained level with the third quarter at 2.6 times, but still represents good progress from the 2.9 times rate as of December of 2018. We believe we\u2019ll be able to decrease the stat again in 2020. Now, I would like to detail our annual guidance for 2020. Please note that the guidance assumes that scrap prices and foreign exchange rates hold at current levels, and the annual effective tax rate is 27.5%. Additionally, the guidance assumes no material disruptions associated with the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, the coronavirus outbreak or any escalation in trade wars or tariffs. We believe North America is poised to carry its strong performance into 2020. We expect that Europe will continue to face some challenging economic conditions, though with the 1 LKQ Europe program and the various restructuring initiatives should take hold and produce further benefits. Specialty is actively seeking new revenue streams to combat the recent weakness and in the interim will remain focused on right sizing its cost structure for the revenue expectation. We have set organic parts and services revenue growth at 50 basis points to 250 basis points. Please note that with the leap here we'll have an extra selling day in the first quarter, and we'll hold that for the full year. Also, please note that exiting the low margin FCA battery contract will be a headwind of approximately 30 basis points on global organic and approximately 90 basis points on North America organic growth in 2020. Diluted EPS on a GAAP basis is a range of $2.20 to $2.32 while adjusted diluted EPS is a range of $2.46 to $2.58 cents. We are projecting solid business growth from a margin improvement efforts, especially in Europe. As discussed last September, we expect to take a step forward in our drive to double digit margins by producing a segment EBITDA margin for Europe in the range of 8.5% to 9.2%. Starting from a 7.8% base in 2019, the high end of the range will be a stretch, but we remain confident in our ability to finish within the range. Additionally, we should benefit with lower full year interest expense owing to the ongoing debt pay down. Cash flows from operations reflect a range of 1,150 billion. The midpoint of our guidance is roughly on par with our 2019 actual figure. Keep in mind that our 2019 cash flow growth was approximately 50%. We reached the $1 billion mark in operating cash flows a few years ahead of my expectations, meaning we benefited from significant working capital enhancements that we can't count on to repeat each year at the same level. We believe we can sustain the new elevated level of operating cash flows with continued focus on trade working capital management and the implementation of the vendor finance program in Europe. And finally, capital spending is set at a range of $250 million to $300 million, a modest increase from the current year level. And so finally, in summary, the fourth quarter was a solid overall result, with strong performance by North America, offsetting some softness in Europe and Specialty. The fourth quarter reinforced that we need to be disciplined in cost control to manage through low growth periods. We believe that our restructuring programs focused on productivity and the l LKQ Europe project has increased the resiliency of the model and positioned us for future success. Overall, we remain optimistic about our prospects for the future. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Nick for closing remarks. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Varun for that financial overview. In closing, 2019 turned out to be a solid year of our company. Our North American operations extended its record of improving operating margins. The European team designed and began the implementation of 1 LKQ Europe, a multi year program that we believe will lead to enhanced levels of productivity and profitability. The specially team broadened its industry leading efforts in supporting the warranty programs of the RV OEMs and was diligent in honing its cost structure. And all the businesses made significant progress on what counts most, generating cash. Indeed, over $1 billion of cash from operations which we used in equal measure to reduce our leverage and repurchase our shares. None of this progress would have been possible without the collective efforts of the 51,000 people I am proud to call my colleagues and co-workers. To the men and women of LKQ I offer my sincere thanks and appreciation for all you did to both serve our customers and work in the best interest of our shareholders. And with that operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Daniel. Varun Laroyia : Good morning. Daniel Imbro : Wondering on the North American gross margins, obviously really strong in the fourth quarter, you noted some of the tailwinds more transitory, record metal prices, GM strike, but things that the freight backdrop do seem to be getting better heading into 2020. So can you help us think about the gross margin trajectory for the company as we head into 2020 as we weigh those put and takes? Varun Laroyia : Absolutely, Daniel, and good morning to you, but also to everyone else joining us on the call this morning. I know it's fairly early, specifically out on the west coast. Listen with regards to North America as Nick and I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re really happy with the way our North America business has continued to perform and execute against its margin enhancement initiatives. You'll recall, we started this entire program way back in 2018. And ready for the third quarter of \u201818 onwards, we slowly but surely continued to execute and move the needle up. The fourth quarter of 2019, as I was very clear about was it was significantly better than even our expectations. Clearly the GM strike was not planned. It was not in the budget, for example, but the agility and the nimbleness of our aftermarket team to be able to capitalize on that opportunity gives us a great amount of satisfaction that we have the right operators at the helm. In addition to that, if you think of it from a salvage perspective, that's another business of us that has really continued to perform very strongly across North America, across the entire year. And then with the record high, precious metal prices coming through, yet again, our salvage business both on the full service but also on self service, they essentially changed certain processes in terms of being able to harvest those precious metals. Again, capitalizing and the agility coming through of being able to capitalize on that opportunity. And that really is key for us. As we move forward into 2020, we are certainly not banking on those record high prices of precious metals continuing, as you know, the GM strike has ended. And so yes, the overall 14 points of segment EBITDA margin is significantly richer than what we would expect to be the usual cadence associated with that. If you were to try and bracket in terms of what the precious metals and say the GM strike benefited in the quarter, I probably give you roughly about 120 basis points of that - the uptick that we had, you know, we certainly \u2013 a large part of it was due to precious metals, but also due to the GM strikes. So if you kind of think of it year-over-year, the 180 basis points move up, I'd say about 120 of that 180 was related to precious metals and also GM strike. So think about from that perspective, the business without those two elements probably would have still been up at least 60 bps, you know, on a year-over-year basis. So again, continuing to execute on its margin enhancement initiatives. So just want to put that piece in terms of the 14 points is not the new normal. So please do not include that into your 2020 model going forward. There were some elements in the market that we were able to capitalize on. Daniel Imbro : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Stephanie Benjamin with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Stephanie Benjamin : Hi, good morning, I wanted to touch a little bit on some of the weakness that you\u2019ve been seeing really last couple quarters in Italy \u2013 Italy and Germany, also announced some new leadership changes there as well. So maybe if you could kind of discuss what's driving some of the - the slow down, you know, is it macro, a little bit more company specific transitional issues, and, you know, just kind of some of the plans in place where we might expect to see some improvement there and some timing would be helpful? Thank you. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Stephanie. This is Nick. The macro economic conditions in Italy, I think is no surprise to anybody. It's very poor. The country has been in recession now for several quarters and that is absolutely flowing through the overall market dynamics. We are seeing and all of our competitors as we talked to people at trade shows and just in the business in general, there's been a downdraft in overall activity. That said, we did believe that we needed a leadership change. And so we have brought somebody on board from the outside to head up the Italian operation. Actually, it's an individual that worked with Arnd Franz at Molly [ph] and he worked under Arnd for about a dozen years. We're very confident in his abilities and believe that we will be able to, you know, move that business forward as we migrate through 2020. The German marketplace obviously a big market, again, experienced some overall softness The leadership change there is not necessarily related to the performance of the Stahlgruber business, which overall was good during 2019, but more of a recognition that we needed a single leader within the Stahlgruber business there. The structure when we acquired the business was there three kind of leaders who shared responsibilities, and we just needed a single head of that business. And so we made that change early this year. You know, we're not expecting the budget, if you will. This is not assuming that there's going to be a market uptick in either the Italian or the German markets that we do anticipate that we will be able to get better organic growth in both those countries and than we did in 2019. Stephanie Benjamin : Great. Thank you for the color. I'll leave it at that. Nick Zarcone : Okay, great. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : Good morning. And thank you for taking my questions. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Craig. Craig Kennison : Yeah. Good morning. We do appreciate the comprehensive slide deck in 7 a.m. call. So thank you for that. Just want to touch on this Specialty business, you've got so much good news. But there was unexpected weakness in that category. Guess I want to understand should we expect weakness for at least the next three quarters as you kind of anniversary the impact of a relationship that - that has exited? And then two, what gives you confidence that there's that - that change is not part of a broader trend where you could get disintermediated more broadly? Thank you. Nick Zarcone : Sure, Craig. Yeah. Built into the plan is an assumption that the Specialty business is going to be relatively flat during 2020. Maybe even down just a touch based on as you indicated, the need to anniversary some of these changes. We highlighted kind of two key customers, one of which is the result of an acquisition, where one of our customers was the acquired entity and the acquirer or always went through act. And so when they - when they bought our customer, they just put their volume through their direct distribution system. We don't think - we think that's a one-off. The other entity has a very unique market position with an incredible brand name. And they had the ability to take some, not all their value, but some of their volume back internally. And again, we think it's unique related to their brand identity as opposed to anything else. So we're not - we don't see it as an ongoing - as a ongoing trend. Craig Kennison : Thank you. Nick Zarcone : No problem. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Thank you very much. Nick, Varun and Joe. On the cash flow, if I follow the math of what's in the guidance, make an assumption about D&A. So the midpoint of net income 695 gets a 324 D&A approximately, I'm at 10, 15 [ph] on cash flow from ops. So that says you're going to get another positive incremental, not as great as 2019 I get it. But working capital still helping, are we looking at that correctly? Varun Laroyia : Yeah, I think. Michael, good morning. Its Varun out here. Listen, you kind of followed us, you know, from a cash perspective for the past few years and stuff. And all I can say is thank you yet again to a broader colleagues across all of LKQ for just a tremendous result coming on from a cash perspective. To kind of give you a little bit more and kind of get to your specific answer in any case, you know, when we put in place working capital metrics, and really what we call internally for our field folks is trade working capital, this is inventory, plus the receivables offset by payables, the underlying quality and I think you can kind of work the math out through the public tables that we've put out there in any cases. The company has made progress on all three fronts. It wasn't just a case of pushing up tables. It wasn't just a case of throttling back or being more judicious on the inventory. We picked up days inventory on hand in terms of lower on these inventory on hand. We push DPO [ph] up a little bit. And we've also gotten some DSO down, albeit very little, because we haven't changed any terms on our customers. All we really focused on is collecting past due receivables, right. But the sheer scale at which our business has been able to deliver on this is, as I said, I'm just tremendously pleased with that. And so if you think of it from a EBITDA conversion level to OCF, yeah, I mean, that's a high percentage versus where we've historically been. In 2018 we moved up. In 2019 we moved up significantly. And to kind of give you a rough math, just on trade working capital, it was down $250 million across inventory, receivables and tables, despite the fact that reported revenues were up $630 million. If you kind of go back to our Investor Day in May of 2018, you can recall, I kind of shown a trend to everybody in terms of how trade working capital as a percentage of revenue had been steadily increasing for the previous five years, up to kind of north of $0.24 in the revenue dollar. That is the one that we focused on. And by focusing on those very specific items, not confusing everyone in terms of what we were trying to do, we've made a tremendous amount of progress. And so, as you think about it, yes, we do expect to grow some, but as I said, it's at this point of time we are now in a sustainability mode, okay. How do we continue to hit the conversion levels that we were able to achieve in 2019? I do not expect this level of trade working capital decline in 2020. But again, there were certain elements that we had to get reset, which we've been able to do and that's a case of continuing to deliver on the sustainability of EBITDA conversion. So that's really where we are. But I think your math roughly holds. Michael Hoffman : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Bret Jordan : Good morning, guys. Nick Zarcone : Good morning. Bret Jordan : On the working capital conversation Varun, can you give us an update as to where we are on payables? I guess specifically on the European side of the business? I think your accounts payable were a little bit higher than they were in the prior year. But you know, clearly versus the O'Reilly's of the world much lower. So, I guess what's the thought there? Varun Laroyia : Yeah. So I'll give you - I'll give you two key points out that Bret. Number one, as I said in my previous response, we made progress both - actually across all three elements of trade working capitals, so day's inventory on hand has come down. DPO has moved up and then DSO is marginally down by about a day. But DPO is up by about four days for the entire enterprise. Now think of it from that perspective and as we think of the cash conversion cycle, we picked up the better part of seven to eight days in terms of where we were even say a year ago, right. So great progress on that front, and from two years ago that much more. Specifically to your question about how is the European payables program coming along. Listen it is coming along right at expectations. There were two key elements that I talked about. The end outcome really is to ensure that we have better payment terms across our European business. No different to say some of the big box folks enjoy out here in the North America business. Clearly they've been at it for the better part of a decade and a half, almost kind of two decades. We were just kind of getting started a year ago and really where we've come through is, we focus on the largest markets with regards to the vendor financing program and really there's two kind of alternatives for our suppliers. The end result being we need better payment terms. And a number of our suppliers have either signed up to the vendor financing program, which is great news. And there are others who say listen, if you're kind of go through that entire process of getting invoices, going through an EDI link, connecting to financial situation, it's too complicated, we will give you the terms that you're looking for. The end result is we are seeing you know, with contracts that are essentially kicking in for 2020, we are seeing that payment terms being extended in line with what our expectations are and then to kind of close the loop for you, if you kind of go back to the September 10th 1 LKQ Europe call that we had, we were very specific in terms of what level of cash we anticipated generating, which is about $200 million, by the end of 2021 we are right on track. We\u2019re very confident that 2020 will play out exactly the way we planned. The team has made tremendous progress out there and yeah, happy with how things are progressing. Bret Jordan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Chris Bottiglieri : Nice, she got it. Quick question on Europe margin targets, you guys gave the analyst day back in September, it kind of gave some annual targets for the next couple of years. Obviously, macro remains really challenging. You've added some leadership changes, just kind of curious what your latest thinking is, those are still the right targets and kind of like what you've learned as you delve deeper to those plans? Thank you. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Chris. As we indicated in our prepared remarks, the 1 LKQ Europe program is on track and on plan. The expectation is that - kind the guidance, if you will, that we provided on September 10, related to the margin accretion over the next couple years, that those ranges are still valid. As Varun indicated in his comments, 2020 getting to the top, top end of the range is going to be a bit of a stretch. But within the range, we are comfortable. And so really, there's been no change. I mean, it's, it's only been, you know, the better part of a little bit more than a quarter that we're into the program. We're affecting the changes that we believe were necessary to get us to the promised land, if you will. We are making progress. You know, there are going to be some things that are not going to go according to plan, and they're going to be some other things that actually do better than, than we expect. And so we're taking it on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but by enlarge we are comfortable with the guidance provided back in September. Chris Bottiglieri : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Stember with C.L. King. Please go ahead. Scott Stember : Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Scott. Scott Stember : Just going back to Specialty, you outlined the issues that happened in the quarter. We expect that to continue, I guess, at least for the next couple of quarters. But you then said that you would expect organic sales to be flat. So I'm assuming you're expecting some of these like the additional RV OEM warranty program that some of the positive developments at SEMA. So maybe just talk about how that will progress to actually offset which seems to be a pretty sizable losses in sales that you had this past year. Thanks. Nick Zarcone : Yeah. So you know, during 2019 the Speciality group started supplying the OE manufacturers actually they're dealing that work with warranty parts, because we can do it for efficiently than the OEs can do themselves. Again, that was a slow ramp. But now we're at the point where we have every major OE manufacturer in the barn if you will, where we are the leading and the supplier of their, of their warranty parts. And so we will get a positive benefit of that through 2020, as each of those programs ramp up and anniversary. We've got some other key elements, we\u2019ve talked about Warn, which is our Winch, business, with several new programs that we think are going to provide positive benefits. And then you know, the historical legacy of the Specialty group, which is the kind of the automotive accessories, you know, that businesses is doing okay. And so we do believe that there's going to be some gives and some takes, which is taken as a whole will largely offset each other. Scott Stember : Got it. Thank you. Nick Zarcone : No problem. Varun Laroyia : Thank you. Operator : There no further question at this time, I will turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks. Nick Zarcone : Well as always we greatly appreciate your time and attention. We know that this reporting season is incredibly busy for all of you and the time you spent with us is greatly appreciated. We are looking forward to a very good and productive 2020. We will come back together in about 60 days to report our first quarter results. And again, I just want to reiterate to all the men and women of LKQ, we really appreciate everything they have done and will continue to do to make our company perform well and serve our customers and our shareholders. So with that, we bring the call to a close. And thank you for your time and attention today. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the next few days. And with that, I\u2019m happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will provide some high level comments related to our performance in the first quarter, discuss the revenue headwinds we are facing in each of our segments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, provide an overview of the actions we are taking during this very challenging time, and finally describe some of the fallouts our industry is experiencing. Varun will dive into the financials with a key focus on the leverage we are pulling across the entire organization to right size the cost structure and maximize cash flow. He will also discuss our liquidity and the strength of our balance sheet before I come back with a few closing comments. Clearly a lot has changed in the last 60 days as we face this humanitarian tragedy. Our hearts go out to all those impacted by the virus both at LKQ and the population at large. The global effort to combat the virus would not be possible without those on the frontline; doctors, nurses, first responders, and all those putting themselves at risk to serve their communities and the communities where LKQ operates across the globe. For that, I extend a big thank you and offer sincere appreciation from the LKQ family to those individuals for their heroic services. Taken as a whole, we got off to a great start in 2020 and are pleased with our first quarter results. In order to understand the first quarter activity, one needs to separate the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period of January and February from the month of March. Through February, each of our segments were in line or ahead of our revenue and profit expectations. The efforts by governments around the world have flattened the infection curve and slow the spread of the virus through social distancing, self-isolation, shelter-at-home orders and the like have had a profound negative impact on mobility and miles driven. While auto repairs and related parts supply has generally been deemed an essential service, and we have continued to serve the needs of our customers, activity levels at the repair shops in North America and Europe has dropped precipitously. The speed at which the economic fallout from the virus prevention measures has impacted all industries, reflects a rate never seen before. It was like operating within two completely separate economies during a single quarter. We clearly lost operating leverage in March with the speed of the revenue decline outpacing our ability to reduce costs. I\u2019m going to use adjusted earnings per share as the proxy. The February year-to-date adjusted earnings per share was up over 20% relative to the same period in 2019, while the month of March was down by more than 27% despite having an additional selling day. I will quickly address the Q1 results and then provide some detail on the revenue trends for each of our reporting segments during the first few weeks of April. As noted on Slide 11, total revenue for the first quarter was $3 billion, reflecting a 3.2% decrease from the level recorded in the comparable period of 2019. Global parts and services organic revenue declined 3.5% in the first quarter and 4.7% on a per day basis. The primary driver for this decrease was a 13.9% per day organic revenue decline in the month of March when all the stay at home mandates began to take effect. From an earnings per share perspective, the first quarter results were solid with diluted EPS on a GAAP basis of $0.48 compared to $0.31 last year. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS was $0.57 compared to $0.56 or a 2% increase. With the negative impact of COVID-19 on the March 2020 monthly result, we believe showing any year-over-year growth is an achievement and it\u2019s a testament to the strength of our business coming into 2020. Now on to the segments. As witnessed during the financial crisis from 2007 to 2009, the automotive aftermarket is fairly recession resistant, exhibiting a decline of only 1% during a period that saw new car sales fall by 42%. Miles driven during that period declined less than 3%, but what we are witnessing today is entirely different. As you will note from Slide 10, organic revenue growth for parts and services for our North American segment in the first quarter declined 4.2% or 5.6% on a per day basis. Looking solely at January and February, North America organic revenue was down 1.1%, but the majority of that negative movement reflecting our decision to terminate the FCA battery contract in the fourth quarter of last year and to a lesser amount due to a very warm winter season. CCC estimates that collision and liability-related repairable claims in the first two months of 2020 were down about 4%, so we continued to outperform the market as a whole. During March, we experienced organic revenue declines of 13.9% on a per day basis, with most of that coming in the back half of the month compared to a CCC estimate for repairable claims in the month of March being down by approximately 20%. For the entire quarter, the 4.2% organic decline was significantly less than the 9.9% decrease in collision and liability-related auto claims reported by CCC for the first quarter as a whole. I\u2019d like to highlight that over the last 44 quarters through the full year 2019, our North American segment has only witnessed two quarters of negative growth, a track record we are very proud of. I would also like to highlight that despite the revenue decline, EBITDA margins in North America hit a high of 16% in Q1. The organic revenue decline for parts and services for our European segment in the first quarter was 3.4% or 4.5% on a per day basis. Again, this was mostly related to a 10.3% or 13.7% per day decline in the month of March. Importantly, not all regions were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, at the same time creating a different growth profile for each of our European businesses in the quarter. Italy was the first country to report a significant number of COVID-19 cases and the first to lockdown the mobility of its citizens, particularly in the heavily industrialized areas in the northern part of the country. We saw an immediate impact on our Italian sourced revenue in the last week of February and the first week of March. The UK on the other hand, did not issue stay at home orders until later in the month and revenue was in line with budget until the week of March 23, when it began a steep decline. Lastly, during the first quarter, our Specialty segment had an organic revenue decline for parts and services of 1.4% or 2.9% on a per day basis. Importantly, when looking at January and February combined, specialty witnessed a 4.3% organic revenue growth rate with March declining 11%. It\u2019s important to look at the January and February performance in isolation given many were concerned that the weakness \u2013 specialty witnessed in the fourth quarter would persist and clearly that was not the case as we started 2020 very strong. I\u2019d also like to acknowledge and congratulate our specialty team being ranked the number one national RV parts distributor to do business with. And number one for having the fastest delivery in the industry, both according to RV Pro\u2019s annual dealer survey. While Q1 results were reasonably strong, our industry certainly left the quarter on a very soft note and the first few weeks of April were even weaker. So where is the activity level in our industry and for our company? According to a report published by McKinsey & Company, during the week of March 17, the headwinds from social distancing reduced miles driven in the United States by 40% to 50% and accident frequency was down by up to 60% in certain key markets. Also consumer surveys conducted by McKinsey show that U.S. households are trying to reduce their trips by roughly 50% with 45% of the respondents expecting to delay any auto repair servicing. INRIX, which provides vehicle traffic and parking data and analytics, reported that across the 98 metropolitan areas it is currently tracking total travel during the week of April 4 was down 51% from what it was in the corresponding week in February. In addition, the U.S. Energy Information Administration has indicated gasoline conception declined 50% from mid March to April 3. Further evidence of low volumes in the last month alone, the top five U.S. auto insurance carriers have given over $6 billion in rebates to their policy holders because of the dramatic drop in accident frequency from lower miles driven, which are pushing insurance loss costs lower. Snapsheet an automatic insurance claims processor that works with 85 different insurance carriers reported that collusion-related claims in late March were down 40% to 50%, which could possibly be the bottom of the business in the last 50 years. The 40% to 50% drop in claims and repair volume was echoed in a March 27 press release by The Boyd Group, which was one of the largest MSOs in the collision repair industry. While Service King, another large MSO issued a release on April 15, indicating they had closed 40 of their repair facilities due to low demand. Europe is also witnessing similar headwinds. According to an Apple Mobility trends report during the first three weeks of April, driving declined over 50% in our top five European markets. With that as a backdrop, it should be no surprise that during the month of April, our daily revenue has been trending about 40% below 2019 levels. In North America, salvage revenue has been closer to the 35% down mark with recycled engines and transmissions performing better than collision parts. Aftermarket collision parts is down more than 40%, while glass and paint are down about 42% and 36% respectively. In Europe, the revenue declines in April vary by region with our operations in Germany and Central and Eastern Europe reflecting declines of approximately 25%, the Benelux region being down about 40%, the UK being down 50% and Italy being down over 60%. When taken together for the month of April, we are trending about 40% below last year. Our specialty unit started the month down 40% compared to last year, the last week saw an uptick in activity and April will likely come down 30%. The main question all businesses are facing is how long these conditions will process. And frankly, the answer is impossible to predict. What we can focus on is to hear and now and address the dynamics that we can effectively control. Governments around the globe are trying to figure out both when and how to reopen their economies. When the lockdown measures are lifted, we do believe vehicles will start getting back on the road, but we don\u2019t anticipate miles driven will snap back to pre-COVID-19 levels immediately. Over the past week, we have seen slight increases in activity in most of our businesses relative to earlier in April, but those upticks are relative to the recent lows and it\u2019s too early to determine whether they are sustainable. There is significant uncertainty in the market, but we are working under the assumption that these depressed levels will persist through a good part of Q2 with demand beginning to see a modest rebound in Q3 and heading towards more normalized levels in Q4, but likely not back to 100% until sometime in 2021. As the pandemic began to accelerate and governments began to implement public safety measures, it was apparent that our mode of operation also needed to change because of the health and safety of our teams, our customers and suppliers. Almost immediately across our global footprint every major operation developed a COVID-19 response team to share ideas and stay informed. Each of our segments has a group responsible for pushing valuable information throughout the tranche and for helping to ensure we are maintaining a safe workplace. Our efforts related to enhanced hygiene and sanitation, social distancing and the use of PPE all has an impact on productivity, but it\u2019s the right thing to do. Simultaneous with these enhanced safety efforts and as soon as revenue began to fall, we started to aggressively attack our cost structure. We have initiated a variety of headcounts actions, including the elimination of our overtime and temporary workers, extensive employee furloughs, permanent reductions in our workforce, decreased hours for many still on the payroll and participating in some of the social programs offered to employers in several European countries. Through these various efforts, as of last Friday, we hit effectively neutralize the cost of over 16,750 employees. Said another way, in a matter of few short weeks, we have largely removed the cost of approximately one-third of our global workforce. The numbers are both staggering and incredibly painful, particularly for a company that believes our biggest asset is our people. The payroll related items in aggregate represent our single largest SG&A expense category. So these very difficult decisions were necessary to protect the long-term health of our company. In addition to the head count adjustments, we have also instituted salary reductions effective in April, eliminate most all discretionary non-mission critical spending, instituted a ban on business travel, accelerated the pace of branch closures both temporary and permanent and focused on the overall efficiency of our distribution networks and routes structures across each segment. When viewed on a company wide basis, over the past few weeks between our concerted actions and normal variable elements, the cost footprint of our company has been temporarily reduced by $80 million to $90 million per month, reflecting an annualized run rate of approximately $1 billion. While we don\u2019t anticipate actually saving $1 billion as we will need to bring our people back onto the payroll and add cost back into the business as volumes begin to return to pre-COVID-19 levels, it highlights the magnitude of the cost adjustments we\u2019ve made. With respect to the 1 LKQ effort in Europe, the new revenue environment has required us to hit the pause button on some elements of the program, like the new ERP deployment, which was going to require a large team of people to be in Italy, the location of our next deployment. We have also delayed some of the other organizational changes. We have however, accelerated some other programs such as the rationalization of some of our branches, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. With revenue running at just 60%, our pre-COVID-19 levels, it\u2019s virtually impossible to gauge the near-term benefits of the 1 LKQ Europe program, but we remain convinced it is the right long-term strategy for our business. Varun will provide more detail on the cost saving initiatives in a few minutes. When COVID-19 first surfaced in China back in January, the immediate concern was the potential impact on the world supply chain. I am happy to report that our supply chain is intact. We have not experienced any major disruptions in terms of inventory shortages or stock outs. Indeed, we started 2020 with a high level of inventory as we headed into the seasonally strong selling period. We have been working with our suppliers to secure full availability of our aftermarkets product range during the crisis. While some aftermarket parts suppliers, furnishing our various businesses has experienced some reductions in capacity. We have reduced replenishment orders as our revenue has declined. On balance, we believe, we will not have material issues with our aftermarket supply chain going forward. On the salvage side as miles driven and the number of total losses have both decreased dramatically. The number of cars available at the auctions has declined as well. It will take some time for this particular supply chain to gear back up as it can often take up to 60 to 70 days for a totaled car to reach the auction. But we\u2019re confident that we can manage our purchasing and utilize existing inventory to meet customer demand for recycled products. I\u2019d like to extend a sincere thank you to all of our supply partners as they also confront this pandemic and are working hard to help us to continue to service our customers. Like any economic downturn, some businesses will suffer more than others and given the absolute violent nature of this contraction, we believe it will be true even in the historically resistant auto parts sector. The speed and magnitude of the demand shift will be too much for some of the less well capitalized distributors to endure. Already, there have been some smaller distributors in the U.S. they have shut their door at least on a temporary basis while waiting for federal funding to arrive. In Europe, one of the largest online parts distributors, ATP declared insolvency. Loren, a large distributor in France is in bankruptcy and HART, a large Polish distributor closed it stores for several weeks before just reopening this past Monday. There will be more. While, it does little in the near term, longer term, it means that there will be a natural consolidation of industry demand amongst a fewer number of market participants. With the leading positions in most all of our respective markets, I believe, LKQ is well positioned to take advantage of these subtle shifts in the competitive landscape. To be sure the downturn will also impact the repair shops and we would expect a similar reallocation of demand to the larger, better capitalized organization. We have a close watch in our receivables to ensure we get paid for the parts are already delivered and installed. And not unlike during the great recession, we have seen a total collapse of new vehicle SAAR across the globe. In the United States, new car sales fell about 13% in the first quarter and 38% in the month of March. In the European Union, new car sales were even softer, dropping 25% in the first quarter compared to last year with a 55% decline in March. We anticipate the April and May resolves on a global basis for what more like March than January, so the second quarter will likely be very soft as well. These massive declines in new car sales will ultimately lead to an older car park which favors the aftermarket parts industry and will ultimately be good for LKQ. At this point, I will turn the call over to Varun. Varun Laroyia : Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. What difference 60 days can make? We ended February feeling really good about the start of the year and our prospects for 2020, and now we are working through a global pandemic that has impacted lives and economies in ways that have not been seen in generations. In these unusual circumstances, I will deviate from the usual commentary and focus on forward-looking matters as opposed to our latest quarterly results. Nick has already commented on the revenue trends. So I will handle the cost actions. We have taken as well as our liquidity position. However, to start, I am going to briefly discuss the financial highlights from our first quarter. North America reported segment EBITDA margin of 16.4%, a 280 basis point improvement relative to the prior year. The improvement is driven by gross margin expansion, while a portion of the benefit is attributable to the several ongoing margin initiatives, increased revenue from precious metals and better pricing realized sequentially on scrap metal represented the largest incremental growth driver. Continuing a trend discussed on last quarter\u2019s call, precious metals prices surged to record levels in early 2020 providing significant upside in both our wholesale and self service businesses. In April trading, we\u2019ve seen moderating prices of precious metals going to lower new car sales and do not expect the same level of upside in the near term. Overall gross margins and wholesale operations and self service increased by 210 and 90 basis points respectively, with a further 20 basis point improvement for the mix effect resulting from the disposal of our aviation business in the third quarter of 2019. Europe segment EBITDA margin of 5.7% represented a 160 basis points decrease relative to 2019. Do note that this includes approximately 30 basis points of incremental transformation expenses incurred in the quarter. On a positive note, gross margin for the segment increased by 40 basis points. The negative leverage effect from the sales decline in March as the stay in shelter programs began. The incremental transformation expenses and certain unfavorable reserve adjustments pushed overhead expenses up 220 basis points compared to 2019. Specialty reported a segment EBITDA margin of 9.2%, a 150 basis point decrease relative to the prior year. Gross margin declined by 110 basis points due to unfavorable mixed effects and an increase in inventory reserves. At a consolidated level, net interest expense decreased by $10 million going to the lower average debt level and it lower average interest rate. This variance is the direct result of the excellent work our teams have done over the past 18 plus months. To focus on cash flow, allowing us to pay down debt in the trailing 12 months. We have also benefited from the redemption of our four and three quarters U.S. senior notes in January of this year, financing it with cash and borrowings from lower cost facilities. Our effective tax rate was 29.2% for the quarter, which included a 250 basis points increase over the annual effective rate assumed in our guidance, resulting in a $0.02 per share negative effect on adjusted diluted EPS, again, relative to prior guidance. The rate increase is primarily attributable to the impact of lower projected full year pretax income, which results in higher suspended interest deductions in certain foreign jurisdictions. We expect volatility in the tax rate, this year given the potential for varying outcomes in our full year results. Operating cash flows in the quarter were $195 million, which represented a 10% increase over the same period in 2019. Free cash flow of $150 million was a 21% improvement over the prior year leading to a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times, based on our credit facility definitions. We use our free cash flow along with cash on hand to rebate $230 million of debt and return $88 million to our stockholders in the quarter. We were happy to see the momentum of 2019 cash flow generation carry through into the first quarter. Now I\u2019ll move into our plans for the remainder of 2020. As Nick referenced earlier, the growth in revenue during March took place very quickly as governments\u2019 implemented measures to contain the outbreak. With restrictions and movement puts in place across multiple countries. We understood that demand would decline for reasons that were outside of our control. And so we shifted our attention to what we could control. That is, one, reducing costs to reflect the new level of market demand, and two, continuing the focus on cash flow generation. Each of our segments took immediate action to develop an implemented plan to rationalize their respective cost structure. Nick described the key aspects of our cost reductions, which essentially fall into three categories. One, personnel-related actions, two, variable cost decreases that follow the lower projected revenue, including route consolidations and brand rationalizations, and three, the elimination of discussed of discretionary and non-mission critical spending. Our current estimates indicate run rate savings of roughly $80 million to $90 million per month. More than half that production is attributable to headcount related actions as it is the largest line item in our operating costs. We won\u2019t reach the full run rate savings during April, as we will continue to incur employee costs related to paid time off until those hours are exhausted and the continuation of healthcare benefits for a further period. Our plans are dynamic and we will be adjusting them based on developments with the outlook on the COVID-19 virus. We will be diligent in not bringing the expense back early and intend to wait for a sustained revenue improvement before adding costs back into the business. To reinforce a point Nick made earlier, the cost actions include the deferral of certain elements of our 1 LKQ Europe program also. The decision to delay portions of the project including the establishment of our head office in Switzerland was it difficult one, given the long term benefits anticipated from the program. However, our current focus is to protect our employees and the business during this market disruption. We are committed to fully returning to the program once conditions have stabilized. The deferral along with the impact of COVID-19 on our volume, compromises our ability to deliver on the margin goals that we presented in our September 10, 2019 Investor Presentation. However, as the full lift on the duration and the severity of the COVID-19 induced disruption, we will reassess and communicate the project timeline and our margin expectations. In addition to the COVID-19 cost actions, we have also initiated a restructuring program. These plans reflect a further round of rightsizing and integration in our North America and European operations and focused on closing underperforming operations. We expect to incur costs related to severance facility closures and asset impairment charges, amounting to a range of $50 million to $60 million of which approximately 20% will be non-cash. The benefits of the program are anticipated to begin in the second quarter, but have not projected to reach the full run rate benefit until early next year. We often ask what percentage of our overhead cost of fixed versus variable. And there\u2019s not really a simple answer. We have fixed costs such as facility rent, variable costs such as fuel consumption and sales commissions. And then finally, hybrid costs that can be adjusted at different levels of activity, but do not flex up and down with every revenue dollar change. For example, we may be able to run a warehouse with 10 employees at a certain level of revenue. If the revenue increases or decreases by say 3%, we may not need to add or cut any headcount. However, if the revenue were to decline by 20% we would expect to reduce our warehouse headcount and potentially the number of drivers too. Reacting to the pandemic has highlighted this dynamic as we have had to come deep into a hybrid cost pool in an attempt to align the cost structure with the projected demand. As shown on Slide 6, forecasted reductions in variable and hybrid costs represent approximately 30% of our monthly overhead expenses. While we pleased with the team\u2019s efforts to reduce costs, it will be difficult to only cut our way to profitability. We retain a certain fixed cost base including facility rent and administrative expenses that will be more challenging to decrease. Additionally, we must cover approximately $175 million of annual depreciation and amortization expense, excluding amortization of acquisition related intangibles which we add back in calculating adjusted diluted EPS, and approximately $115 million of annual interest expense that can\u2019t be easily flexed. We are currently projecting the largest negative impact from the COVID-19 virus in Q2 with a gradual revenue and profitability improvement as the year progresses. So as you all know, this could easily change as the pandemic and the global response plays out over time. Moving to liquidity, we feel that we\u2019re in a good position to withstand the COVID-19 disruption. As I referenced earlier, there has been a significant shift in the world in the last couple of months. On February 20 of this year, we reported over $1 billion in operating cash flows for 2019 and set guidance at a similar level for 2020. Our net leverage ratio was 2.6 times compared to the maximum allowed ratio of 4.25 times. As our cash flow generation programs have taken hold since 2018 and continued to increase the absolute level of cash being generated by each of our businesses, liquidity and debt covenants were low on the list of concerns going into 2020. Then the COVID-19 outbreak spread across the globe and folks became interested in everyone\u2019s ability to comply with their respective financial covenants and retain access to the credit markets. I\u2019ll address our liquidity stats in two pieces, first, our current liquidity position and efforts to conserve cash, and second, the compliance requirements for all financing arrangements. We believe that our current liquidity and positive operating cash flow in future periods will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements. To support our liquidity position, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we\u2019re focused on preserving cash during the expected period of reduced demand. Our action plans to strengthen our current position include approximately 40% reduction or more than $100 million deferral of growth driven and non-mission critical capital projects, reductions in inventory replenishment rates to reflect current demand, active monitoring of customer receivables and terms, the continuation of the European vendor financing program, tax payment deferrals were allowable, and hold in our share buyback program, in addition to the cost saving measures previously discussed. With $1.9 billion of total liquidity as of March 31, 2020, and $91 million of current maturities, we have access to funds to meet our near term commitments even if the pandemic effect extends longer than current expectations. We have a surplus of current assets over current liabilities of over $2 billion, which further reduces the risk of short term cash shortfalls. Our total liquidity includes availability on our senior secured credit facility, which includes two financial maintenance covenants, maximum net leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio. The maximum leverage ratio will be four times effective, our compliance certificate to be filed for the second quarter of 2020. We are confident that we will be in compliance with the financial covenants in the second quarter though out of an abundance of caution and as an effective insurance policy, we have commenced discussions with our bank group regarding continued access to borrowings under our credit facility, if the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has a severe and prolonged negative impact on our profitability. Our euro notes do not include financial maintenance covenants and the indentures will not restrict our ability to draw funds on the credit facility, nor will the indentures prohibit our ability to amend the financial covenant under the credit facility as needed. By limiting our capital spending to mission critical projects and the strategic central distribution center in the Netherlands, we will preserve cash to support day-to-day operations, while generating a benefit to a depreciation expense for the year. We will be judicious in balancing the cash generation while continuing to invest thoughtfully into the business and creating a long term sustainable advantage. And we are confident of being cash flow positive for the full year. Interestingly, while April is expected to be the worst month for revenue and profitability, I\u2019m happy to report that the company did not need to drawdown on the credit facility and instead, we were able to pay down further debt in the month. Finally, I\u2019d like to close with a few comments regarding our outlook for the remainder of the year. As you know, we withdrew our full year guidance last month given the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 outbreak. Presently, there are too many unknowns to be able to provide full year guidance on revenue and profitability measures. However, to prepare a March financials, we made a good faith estimate of the full year results based on information currently available and our resumptions include is severe short term impact followed by a gradual return to prior levels by 2021. This projection supports our analysis underlying the March financial statements including our interim goodwill impairment test, other impairment tests of intangible assets, assessments of the recoverability of inventory, calculation of the annual effective tax rate and evaluations of the realizability of deferred tax assets. As the economic impact of the pandemic is dependent on variables that are difficult to project and in many cases outside of our control, it is possible that the estimates underlying our analysis may change in future periods. We are committed to providing investors with care and comprehensive disclosure regarding our results and future prospects, and we will share developments as appropriate going forward. With that, I will turn the call back to Nick for closing remarks. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Varun. In closing, it is clear that our focus on profitable growth, enhanced margin and better free cash flow generation positioned as well as we entered this unexpected turn of events. Our teams have been agile and have done a fantastic job of tackling the cost structure, which is no easy task, especially when confronting the human element of these actions in a culture that is rooted in pride and comradery. Our teams have embraced the idea that not all progress is measured by ground gained, but sometimes progress is measured by losses avoided. And for that, I am tremendously proud and thankful of everyone\u2019s efforts to confront these very difficult times. What I know is one of the pandemic is in the rear view mirror and the economies around the world settle into the new normal, whatever that may be. There will still be more than 275 million vehicles in the United States and over 305 million vehicles in Europe. The average age of these cars will increase and the resulting heightened demand for alternative repair parts and accessories will be serviced by a slightly smaller number of competitors. There inlays the opportunity for LKQ. That is why I have been coaching our leadership teams to focus both on getting this through the near term headwinds and to also keep one eye open for the longer term opportunities to gain market share and create more efficient operating models. I\u2019m confident that I\u2019ll take you will not just survive the pandemic but will thrive in the post-pandemic economy. In my communication with a broader employee base, I have indicated we will get through this together and we\u2019ll come out a stronger, wiser and better positioned organization that continues to be LKQ proud. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephanie Benjamin with SunTrust. Stephanie Benjamin : Hi, good morning. I really appreciate all the extra color that you guys provided, particularly as you broke out, just the performance kind of through the first half of the quarter or more than that and then kind of how it deteriorated in March, including the CCC numbers? I was hoping maybe you could provide a little bit of color. I mean, it was such a strong outperformance versus the industry during those periods, whether it was the January through February and then also in March, so maybe you could provide some color on what you believe was driving that outperformance versus the overall just kind of volume numbers from the CCC numbers? I think that would be helpful. Thanks. Nick Zarcone : I\u2019ll take a shot at that that, Stephanie. Well, we offer to the North American collision repair industry, it is an ability to provide best-in-class service, and that goes to items like delivery times, the number of deliveries, on-time deliveries, the depth and breadth of our inventory, which \u2013 what we have nobody else can match. And we believe that we have always outperformed the marketplace because we offer a different value proposition as in most of our smaller competitors. And particularly when things started to slowdown and a number of businesses were really having to pull-in quickly, our capital base allows us to continue to provide what we believe as world class customer service, and over time that wins. But make no doubt, we always believe that the depth and breadth of our inventory is perhaps our biggest competitive advantage in the North American marketplace and the ability to get those parts to our customers on a reliable basis and on a very quick basis separates us from many in the industry. Stephanie Benjamin : Got it. Well, for the sake of time, I\u2019ll pass it on from there. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Good morning, guys. On the North American gross margin, you called out metal scraps and precious metals driving a big chunk. Could you tell us how many basis points you picked up on metals just so we can get a normal margin run rate? Varun Laroyia : Yes. Bret, it\u2019s Varun here. Great question. Essentially, within our overall salvage operations, we do not break out precious metals on a car by car or an automotive -- on a unit-by-unit basis. What we do know is precious metals alone had close to a $50 million uptick in revenue on a year-over-year basis. As you think about it from that perspective, you can kind of do the math in terms of how much of that can actually flow through. There is a cost associated with getting to the precious metals that are found within the salvage vehicles. But again, as I said previously also, in the last quarter earnings numbers, our operating teams have just done a phenomenal job in positioning themselves to be able to extract and take advantage of what\u2019s happening in the precious market -- in the precious metals market. So again, happy with the way they\u2019ve performed in kind of essentially making their own destiny from that perspective. Nick Zarcone : Yes. And at some point in time, the cost of the vehicle goes up or falls, based on the value of those metals. And what we\u2019ve seen, as Varun indicated in his prepared comments, is those values have come back down. Not all the way back to where they were at the beginning of the year, but they have come back in. Bret Jordan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : Thank you. Good morning. I hope everybody in your family, friends, and colleagues are safe and healthy. Trying to take all of this great data, and the first pass quickly trying to adjust the model on the fly, you\u2019ll still be profitable in 1Q and 2Q, but it\u2019s going to be paper thin. Is that the right way to think about it? Varun Laroyia : Yes. Michael, it\u2019s Varun here. It all depends in terms of how the trend continues. As I \u2013 as Nick mentioned in his comments also, the first half of April was a continuation of March, which was down almost like 40% to 45%. In the last 10 to 12 days, we\u2019ve seen a nice little uptick, but having said that, it is still down on a year-over-year basis. It all depends in terms of what the outlook is for the month of May and June. We also do know that in the month of April, here in the United States for example, with the folks that we\u2019ve put on furlough, we essentially have allowed our folks to be able to run down their PTO balances. Essentially, we are paying them, which we believe will get exhausted by the end of April. In addition, we have continued health benefits for a certain period. This is not the time to be pulling the rug from people\u2019s \u2013 from under people\u2019s feet given what\u2019s happening out in the broader macroeconomic situation in any case. So April, we know from a profitability perspective, we\u2019ll be challenged, but it all depends in terms of how May and June comes through. What we have said is that we have suspended guidance. And again, as and when numbers begin to come through for April month end and again, as we go through the quarter, we will update the markets. We do have a series of virtual NDRs and investor calls setup for later in the quarter. But again, at this point of time, we are not in the position to say, as to where Q2 will be coming through. It all depends in terms of how the next 60 days play out. Michael Hoffman : Okay. All right, I\u2019ll cycle back and ask the next question. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig Kennison : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and the thorough slides and review. You had mentioned competitive disruption. I guess to the extent your competitors are struggling and you are able to take share. Can you serve that opportunity through your existing operations or would you need to expand branches or acquire businesses in some geographies to cover that potential opportunity? Nick Zarcone : Craig, great question. No, we\u2019re convinced that we have the footprint we need in most every market in which we operate to service more customers and with more volume. And actually, I think both Varun and I put in our formal remarks, we\u2019re actually going to be consolidating some of the branch that work across the globe to gain further efficiencies. As these volumes have come in, we will \u2013 there is opportunity to get to even a more efficient footprint and we believe even though some of that is going to be on a permanent basis, that we will still be able to fulfill and even heightened the demand that will ultimately come out of this. Varun Laroyia : And Craig, I\u2019ll just going to add one more to what a data point to what Nick mentioned. In terms of the hypothesis that this will end up potentially being a gain share for LKQ, I understand it\u2019s still early days, but across each of our three operating segments, we are seeing customers that we haven\u2019t seen in quite some time. And I\u2019m talking of a few years. So both in North America and in Europe, and then also in our specialty unit, we are seeing activity from customers that we haven\u2019t seen for some time. And again, data is hard to come by in certain markets, but even where markets are down, what we are picking up from a market intel is that, we are outperforming our competitors in those specific markets. So back to your hypothesis, it is playing out now. And then to the additional point whether we need to expand our footprint, no, we believe our footprint is adequate. And in fact, we actually have an opportunity to essentially fine tune our geographic footprint through this period. Craig Kennison : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Good morning. Just a quick question here, in terms of your customer base on the repair side, I mean, is it more or less the 80%-20% rule that, you\u2019re doing 80% of the business with the 20% largest percent across both North America and Europe? Nick Zarcone : No, it\u2019s not quite that way Gary. The customer base is incredibly fragmented. I mean, there is \u2013 in the United States, for example, somewhere between 35,000 and 40,000 collision repair shops, in Europe, there\u2019s literally hundreds of thousands of mechanical service and repair shops. So there are bigger entities there. We got the MSOs on the collision repair site in North America. You got some large chains over in Europe. But no, it\u2019s not 80%-20%. So this is an industry, our customer base is an industry that\u2019s represented by an incredibly fragmented group of competitors. Gary Prestopino : So is there any worries on a short term basis at least, with some of these smaller players coming \u2013 falling out of bed here, just closing shop, like you were talking about some of the competitive situation of other suppliers in Europe that are declaring bankruptcies? Nick Zarcone : Absolutely. Whenever you have a severe economic contraction, small enterprises, this mom-and-pop enterprises, oftentimes, just don\u2019t have the capital to endure. We actually have sponsored and promoted some educational sessions for our North American customer base to get some tapped into how to best utilize the government programs that are in place to fund small and medium-sized businesses, and so we ran and sponsored seminars that our body shop customers could dial into to understand how to navigate the loan program, for an example, because we want them see profitable segment business. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : We have a follow-up from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Good morning, again guys. You talked about, I guess Service King having shot a number of their branches. I think they also delayed a bond payment recently as well. Do you have any exposure either to them or any other major collision chains which you have to worry about as far as getting paid back at accounts receivable? Varun Laroyia : Hey Bret, it\u2019s Varun here. So let me take that question. Listen, as we closed out the first quarter of 2020, I will share with you, and again, this is the appropriate time to share it with everyone is the company has never been in a better position in terms of managing our past due receivables. Again, these things don\u2019t happen by accident. We started the program, probably, in the better part of almost two years ago, because there was a massive opportunity in terms of the way our customer receivables were being managed. So again, as we closed out, we were in a very fortunate position, thanks to the phenomenal work of all our field operators, both in North America, but also in Europe. To your specific question about one of our larger customers, we enjoy a great relationship with them. And yes, we also heard about the news, but I\u2019m happy to report that as of the end of the first quarter, we were current with them across their receivables balance. And then with regards to, call it other customers and stuff, listen, this is an evolving situation as of now. Nick mentioned the fact that we have a fairly fragmented customer base. The good news is several of our smaller customers do have the ability to drop on the payment protection \u2013 the paycheck protection plan. And we, certainly, are encouraging them to apply through the SBA side of things, in any case. But other than that, happy in terms of how we remain close to our customers. And again, we are confident on their ability to, again, gain share through this period. But again, no specific issues with receivable hits as such. Bret Jordan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is going to be a follow-up from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : Hi. So circling back, I think to get the point of clarity, if I could, on an early question. You shared $15 million of incremental sales in the quarter for metals, did I hear that correctly? So they gave you 100% credit for that? Because it is all price. Forget that you had cost. I pulled that out of the 2011 on the EBITDA. You still are 15% margins. Is that \u2013 am I doing something wrong? Just want to understand. Varun Laroyia : No, Michael. The math is appropriate except for the fact that precious metals was close to $50 million up on a year-over-year basis. Michael Hoffman : $50 million, okay. Varun Laroyia : Yes, absolutely. So I think that\u2019s the piece to kind of think about. The second point is what we are currently seeing in April trading of precious metals, they have come off their record highs that we experienced earlier in the first quarter. So again, we do not anticipate that set of gains to be on an ongoing basis. The other piece to think about is, as we always talked about on the salvage side, scrap metal prices, while they were down on a year-over-year basis, it\u2019s more kind of the sequential pricing, which matters to us. And sequentially, scrap metal was up about 23%. So that also helped the overall North America margin. So that\u2019s how you should think about this. But again, precious metal was by far the biggest piece. But as I said, we don\u2019t anticipate that upside to continue at least not in the near-term. Nick Zarcone : But directionally, it\u2019s correct Michael. Even without the impact of the metals, our margins would have been up. Michael Hoffman : Right. Okay. That\u2019s \u2013 I was trying to get at that. And then back to the $80 million to $90 million. Is there a way to think about how that plays out between the two major regions as far as where it comes \u2013 where you can get savings? And then how much \u2013 if you learn to be leaner, how much of it do you get to keep permanently? I mean I get you can\u2019t keep a whole $1 billion, but how much do you think you might keep? Nick Zarcone : Well, half \u2013 as Varun indicated about half of the $80 million to 90 million is with people-related. And those adjustments have been made in each of the three segments : North America, Specialty and Europe. We have more people in Europe to start with. So you should assume that the majority of the 17,000 person adjustment came out of Europe, North America next and Specialty, obviously, being the smallest. All of our operating heads are working under the orders and the assumption that when we get back to 100% of revenue volume, whenever that is, that we should be able to service that without adding back all 17,000 people. That there has to be some embedded productivity gains coming out of that process. We don\u2019t have at this point in time, the magic answer is to whether that\u2019s adding back 99% of our people or 95% of the people or 90% of the people. But we do anticipate that we will gain productivity from a human capital perspective. And the same with some of the other operating costs. Again, there are things we\u2019re going to have to add back, but importantly as Varun indicated, we kind of do it kind of in arrears, is we\u2019re going to make sure that revenue is there and sustainable and then add some back, and it will be gradual process as we walk back up with the hope that when we get to the \u2013 when we get back to 100%, we will not have added back 100% of the operating expense. Varun Laroyia : And Michael to your specific question of how much of it is between the two geographies. It\u2019s roughly half and half, so the $80 million to 90 million, roughly half in Europe and the other half here in North America. And then with regards to the key categories, just to reiterate, personnel costs is by far the single largest line item in our overall OpEx. And so that clearly is the bulk of it. But in addition to that, we do know that there are certain variable expenses such as the spend that we have on routes and deliveries and fuel. And we certainly are picking up that variability also as revenues have come in. So just to kind of give you that additional color for the sake of comprehensiveness. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And since we\u2019re repeating or turning the thing, could I ask one more, just if I could, for the benefit of everybody. The world recovers. We get \u2013 we start to [indiscernible] again whenever it is, but it recovers. Do we get back to old revenue number in the U.S. from a collision standpoint? I get why we would in Europe on maintenance, if you\u2019re driving your car, you got to do the maintenance. How do I get back to the old revenue number? I felt like I\u2019m going to have a whole bunch more above average accidents. Nick Zarcone : Ultimately, once the miles driven gets back to kind of pre-COVID levels and people are kind of back into their normal routines, the accident rates will \u2013 from a frequency perspective will move back, we believe to where they were, pre-virus, right? Once the roads and the highways are full of cars and other vehicles and that\u2019s really what\u2019s the key, Michael, is the number of accidents because that\u2019s what drives repair volumes and ultimately what drives the demand for the repair parts that we supplied to the body shops. Yes. So we\u2019re comfortable that in time, assuming miles driven gets back that the frequency will be return, and that will be a strong driver of our revenue. The $64 question is when does that all occur, right? There\u2019s anecdotal data out there now it\u2019s from China, so it\u2019s a very different economy. But what the Chinese have reported is that about 2.5 to three months after them hitting peak from a virus infection perspective, miles driven in individual vehicles was at 80% of pre-crisis levels. Contrast that to their public transportation volumes, which were only back to 40% of pre-crisis levels. So folks, at least in China, we clearly view their personal vehicle as being a safer mode of transportation than jumping on public transport. And that\u2019s a good sign, right. What I suggest is that the same could happen here in the U.S. But just because \u2013 either on a federal basis or on a state basis, some of the restrictions get lifted, nobody should assume that miles driven is going to snap back to pre-virus levels. I mean, I sit here in the state of Texas and our Governor on Tuesday, indicated that he was going to open up \u2013 start to open up the Texas economy this coming Friday. And that\u2019s great because there\u2019s all sorts of businesses that have been shut down. On the same day, one of the local news stations did a survey of 3,500 residents of Austin and 86% of them said, it was too much, too soon. So even though some of the restrictions may be lifted, it remains to be seen as to whether residents around the world are going to have the courage to actually venture out immediately and get back into their normal routines. We think it\u2019s going to be a much more of a gradual return. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens, Inc. Varun Laroyia : Hey, good morning, Daniel. Daniel Imbro : Thanks for squeezing me in. I think I dropped off for a second. So sorry if you touched on this, but Varun wanted to touch back on Europe in the 1Q. Something that stood out is just the gross margin leverage, just like pretty soft sales there. We talked a lot about North America and the metals pricing, but can you shed some more light on what drove that gross margin improvement in Europe? And then how you think about the sustainability of those drivers, obviously as near-term demand trends are pressured. Varun Laroyia : Yes. I think Daniel, it\u2019s far out here, just for the sake of everyone understanding, I think your question was there was a 40 basis point improvement in gross margin across our European segment and the sustainability of that. So yes, very happy with the way that has come through. The level of discipline that our teams have been putting out in Europe in the pursuit of profitable revenue growth and accretive margins that has continued to kind of come through. In the past where we may have been kind of chasing the last time down the rabbit hole. That discipline that the team has picked up has been tremendous. And in these circumstances, chasing, chasing any and all revenue could become a fool\u2019s errand and so essentially the teams have been focusing on only pursuing profitable revenue. In addition to that, as you know, we\u2019ve been doing well from a centralized procurement perspective and those benefits have also accrued. But just think about the fact that, we\u2019ve just been very disciplined from a pricing perspective. And that was something that was much needed over in Europe in addition to everything that the team has been doing from a centralized procurement perspective. Daniel Imbro : Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Nick Zarcone : We\u2019re going to need to bring the call to a close. So just one last question and then we\u2019ll wrap up. We\u2019re a bit over. Did you have one last question, Daniel? Varun Laroyia : Nick, I think we\u2019re all done. We\u2019re not showing anyone on the screen. So I think we\u2019re all good to close off. So back to you. Nick Zarcone : Okay, great. We greatly appreciate your time and attention here this morning. We\u2019ve obviously shared a fair amount of information that normally we would not provide. But we thought it was important to provide additional clarity and transparency in this great time of uncertainty. So now we do appreciate you participating in our call. And we\u2019ll be back together again in about 90 days with our second quarter results. Thanks everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in our Form 10-Q and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. As normal, we are planning to file our 10-K in the next few days. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the second quarter, before discussing some of the key industry metrics that are impacting the revenue trends in each of our segments. Varun will then dive into the financials with the key focus on the impact of the measures we initiated in late March across the entire organization to right size the cost structure and maximize cash flow. He'll also discuss our liquidity and the strength of our balance sheet, before I come back with a few closing remarks. So much has happened since the pandemic began sweeping across the globe. And while some of you may sense the worst is over, others likely feel we're still in the center of the storm. It all depends on where you live. But one thing is universal. We all owe an incredible debt of gratitude to those on the frontlines. The doctors, nurses, first responders, and all those bring themselves at risk to serve their communities and the communities where LKQ operates across the globe. To them, I send a great big thank you and offer sincere appreciation from the LKQ family for their heroic services. In light of the environment, our second quarter results were very strong, and materially ahead of our expectations when we chatted 90 days ago on our first quarter call. Our ability to quickly and successfully navigate through incredible decreases in demand to report strong margins and earnings and even better cash flow is a testament to the courage of our global leadership team to make the hard decisions to protect our company. As you all know by now, the efforts by governments around the world to flatten the infection curve had a profound negative impact on mobility. With the material drop in miles driven, activity levels at repair shops in North America and Europe dropped precipitously, as did the demand for repair parts. As economies around the globe began to open up and mobilities of all types increased, so did the demand for the parts we supply and we ended the quarter on a much sweeter note than how it began. As noted on Slide 8, total revenue for the second quarter was $2.6 billion, reflecting a 19% decrease from the level recorded in the comparable period of 2019. Global parts and services organic revenue declined 16.8% in the second quarter, while currencies and the net impact of divestitures and acquisitions accounted for a 2.1% decrease. Importantly, the low point in demand was the first half of April. While we're still below 2019 levels on a consolidated basis, we have seen continuous improvement with each passing month, with April same day revenue being down approximately 30% compared to 2019, May down 13%, and June down less than 8%. From an EPS perspective, the second quarter diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis of $0.39 compared to $0.48 last year. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS was $0.53 compared to $0.65, or an 18.5% decrease. Like revenue, EPS improved in each successive month of the quarter, with May and June, clearly reflecting the benefits of the cost reduction programs implemented in each of our segments. As you will note from Slide 12, organic revenue growth for parts and services for our North American segment in the second quarter declined 22.5%. According to CCC, collision and liability-related repairable claims in the second quarter were down 42%. The continued outperformance of our North American organic growth relative to repairable claims growth, combined with the OE supply chain disruptions in dealer closures during the quarter, give us confidence that APU is increasing and we're gaining market share. Additionally, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, miles driven in the U.S. were down 40% year-over-year in April and 26% in May. The June results are not yet available. But we expect they will be better than May, but still down about 10% compared to last year. To put our performance, and the miles driven decline into perspective, the softness period during the Great Recession came in mid-2008, when miles driven declined just 3.9% relative to the prior-year. I would also highlight that despite the revenue decline, the segment EBITDA margin in North America was 14.8%, the highest second quarter level achieved in the last five years. North America operational efficiency efforts have resulted in permanent cost reductions of approximately $80 million annually, which includes headcount reductions, closure of over 30 locations, and the elimination of redundant or end-of-life fleet assets no longer needed. Our North America team has done an outstanding job of managing their cost structure and being very disciplined on operational matters. Lastly, on North America, during the second quarter, our recycling businesses processed over 169,000 vehicles, resulting in, among other things, the recycling of 780,000 gallons of fuel, 425,000 gallons of waste oil, 340,000 tires, and 158,000 batteries. Importantly, every ton of new steel made from scrap steel feedstock conserves about 2,500 pounds of iron ore, 1,400 pounds of coal, and 120 pounds of limestone. As the global leader of recycled vehicles, during the second quarter we processed about 260,000 tons of scrap steel, which preserved significant levels of natural resources, reduced the demand for scarce landfill space, and played an important role in reducing air and water pollution. Now let's turn to Europe. As you're aware, when COVID initially hit Europe, many countries within the European Union closed their borders to non-essential travel and implemented severe lockdown measures to combat the virus. As a direct result, travel demand fell across Europe, resulting in fewer cars on the road, almost no traffic congestion, and a corresponding decline in the demand for service and repair parts. According to INRIX, a leading traffic analytics data provider, since the lowest point, every European country continued to increase the rate of miles driven throughout Q2, with 10 out of the 19 countries analyzed, getting back to pre-COVID levels of travel by mid-June. The pre-COVID levels of January and February reflect seasonal low points. So while up, on a pre-COVID basis, we are still below 2019 levels on a seasonally adjusted basis. That said it's good to be headed in the right direction. Organic revenue for parts and services for our European segment in the second quarter decreased 16.6%. As I stated on our Q1 call, not all regions were impacted by the COVID pandemic at the same time, or to the same degree, creating different growth profiles for each of our European businesses. This difference in growth continued in the second quarter as drivers began to get back on the road. Importantly, all of our European businesses experienced a recovery in May and June from the April lows, with Germany and the Netherlands recovering the fastest, and the UK, and Italy lagging. In Western Europe, early on Italy was the hardest hit by COVID. Looking at miles driven, Italy reached a low the week of March 23, with miles driven being down 76% relative to pre-COVID levels. Since its low, miles driven in Italy has grown at an average weekly growth rate of 14%, but slowed in the back half of June to just 8% weekly growth. Despite that growth and the recovery relative to pre-COVID levels in certain large markets, like Rome and Milan, miles driven are still down over 20% relative to their seasonally adjusted 2019 levels. In the UK miles driven reached below the week of April 6, with miles driven being down 74% relative to the pre-COVID levels. According to INRIX, the UK has the slowest recovery of miles driven out of the 19 countries studied and at the end of June was just at 67% of its pre-COVID level. Germany saw less of a reduction than Italy and the UK. Travel in Germany dropped to 40% of its pre-COVID level the week of March 30th and by the end of June, rebounded to 98% of pre-COVID levels. In light of the major economic crisis facing the auto industry due to the COVID pandemic, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association has radically revised its 2020 forecast for new passenger car registrations, expecting it to decrease by 25%. This effectively means that the industry association expects new car sales in the European Union to tumble by more than 3 million vehicles from 12.8 million units in 2019 to some 9.6 million units this year. These massive declines in new car sales will eventually lead to an older car park, which favors the aftermarket parts industry and will ultimately be good for LKQ. Lastly, on Europe, on May 31, STAHLGRUBER Holdings sold 100% of the shares of its telecommunications business called STAHLGRUBER Communication Center. While this was a small transaction, it again reinforces our ongoing commitment to rationalizing our European asset base in the divestiture of non-core businesses. Let's move on to Specialty. During the second quarter our Specialty segment had an organic revenue decline for parts and services of just 1.4%, performance well above our expectations. Importantly, when looking at April and May combined, Specialty witnessed a 10.4% organic revenue decline on a per day basis, with June exhibiting organic growth of 14.1% on a per day basis, a clear sign that April was the bottom. SEMA estimates that the impact of COVID, industry sales will likely be down 12% for the full-year 2020. But clearly, our Specialty segment is tracking far better when compared to this industry expectation. The RV side of the Specialty business showed particular strength during the back half of the quarter. We believe the surge in demand for RV-related parts and accessories is due to customers looking for safer and alternative forms of outdoor and leisure travel. According to Ipsos Research, 46 million Americans plan to take an RV trip within the next 12 months. In light of the COVID crisis, it's clear that RV travel and campaigns provides an appealing vacation option for families and their travel choices. The performance of our Specialty segment in the second quarter underscores the fact that the segment is far less cyclical than we believe the market appreciates. This quarter also highlights the point that even when many consumers scale back or delay non-essential purchases, vehicle and RV enthusiasts will always find a way to keep pursuing their passion. On the supply chain front, we are generally in a good position. The salvage options are a little thin and prices were up a bit. But overall, there were no major issues. Our self-service business was having some difficulty finding an adequate level of vehicles at reasonable prices earlier in the quarter, as some of the city impounds were closed and open street purchase volumes were down. But over the last few weeks, purchase volumes have rebounded. And our remanufacturing business has experienced some tightness in the supply chain with respect to some domestically sourced parts that are needed to rebuild engines and transmissions. In Europe, we have seen a few warning signs with respect to the availability of certain products from select suppliers. But we're leveraging our pan-European network to move inventory to where it's needed. And in the Specialty segment, the combination of certain suppliers being closed early in the quarter because of the pandemic, and the surprisingly strong industry demand, has created a bit of a backlog situation. Our strong inventory position coming into the pandemic has been an advantage for Specialty and we're working to rebuild our inventories to avoid any potential stockouts. So where do we go from here? We have clearly benefited from a solid rebound in demand during the quarter. As noted by the detail on Page 5 of our presentation, revenue of our North American and European businesses were down just 14% and 8% respectively on a year-over-year basis in the month of June compared to being down 34% and 29% respectively in April. That said, the pace of improvement has slowed materially, and progress in the first few weeks of July has stalled, as we have experienced slight revenue declines on a week-over-week basis, with the year-over-year declines widening. Specialty is still up a bit in July compared to last year, but not at the same level of June. Hopefully this is just a temporary setback, but with the wave of outbreaks occurring around the globe, the range of outcomes for the back half of the year is still wide and uncertain. Here in the United States, the uptick in positive test results in many states, including Florida, Texas, and California has prompted reversals of several economic reopening plans, and even cities that have managed to suppress the virus are taking precautions. Those reversals, including widespread decisions to move forward with virtual schooling, could negatively impact mobility and put pressure on our ability to attract adequate labor. In the second quarter, the recovery benefited from the CARES Act which injected trillions of dollars into households and businesses somewhat offsetting the economic impact of widespread closures. As key components of that law begin to phase out, we may start to truly see the potential impacts of the rapid uptick in unemployment making the view for the balance of the year even foggier. While it is difficult to predict, we do not anticipate getting back to 2019 revenue levels in our North American and European segments until sometime in 2021, meaning continued negative revenue comparisons to 2019 levels over the back half of the year. The Specialty business should track prior-year revenue levels in the third and fourth quarters. As to our profits and cash flow, we exited the second quarter at levels that are not sustainable. As reported, we leaned on our people hard at the start of Q2, placing thousands on furlough and having most all salaried personnel taking a 10% to 20% reduction in pay. We have reversed those downward adjustments and moved forward with normal merit increases beginning in Q3, albeit on a delayed basis. In addition the majority of those furloughed are now back on the payroll, so we can serve the current level of demand. On the cash flow front, we have been very effective in turning our inventory into cash and taken advantage of tax payment holidays. But we will ultimately need to replenish our inventory levels to sustain this renewed level of revenue and pay our taxes. That said we do anticipate achieving permanent productivity improvements in terms of margins and working capital across our businesses. And at this point, I will turn the call over to Varun. Varun Laroyia : Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. When we reported our first quarter results in April, we were facing a great deal of uncertainty about how the pandemic would play out across the globe. We spent the last few months operating in a very volatile environment, making plans and adapting those plans for the rapidly changing conditions. While the detailed actions shifted over time, we did not waver in our key objective to protect our employees, the communities in which we operate and the business. In my remarks, I'll discuss the actions we took to manage the business during the second quarter, and to position the company for ongoing success to eventually emerge even stronger. So before I get into this topic, I will cover the financial highlights from our second quarter. As Nick described, the negative impact of COVID-19 on revenue was not as severe as our internal forecasts suggested as we entered the quarter. The favorable revenue outcome combined with the benefits of aggressive cost reductions produced a solid profitability and cash flow result for the quarter. It takes a special set of circumstances for me to describe roughly 20% decreases in segment EBITDA dollars and adjusted diluted EPS as a solid result. We know that quarter-over-quarter comparisons are difficult as a result of the COVID-19 impact on 2020. When revenue declined by $622 million, a decrease in profitability in dollar terms is inevitable. Since growth didn't make sense as a benchmark, we had to think differently about what defines success in this environment. We challenged our field teams to drive margin improvement and be as efficient as possible in operating their businesses. And when we look to the segment EBITDA percentage as an indication of their abilities to scale the business model and achieve leverage when revenue declined. With the level of fixed and hybrid costs in the business, maintaining the segment EBITDA margin in a period of falling revenue is a significant accomplishment. Our segments rose to the challenge and the second quarter with North America and Specialty reporting quarter-over-quarter improvements and Europe finishing within 30 basis points of 2019. A large portion of the favorable result is attributable to an earlier revenue recovery than anticipated, though our segment teams deserve a lot of credit for delivering on the cost savings initiatives by taking swift and decisive action. As you'll see on Slide 17, North America achieved a segment EBITDA margin of 14.8% or 40 basis points better than a year-ago. This improvement is driven by a 110 basis point growth in adjusted gross margin attributable to the positive impact of cost reductions in COGS from right sizing actions, higher precious metals prices, as well as other margin improvement actions. Other income produced an incremental 50 basis points from business interruption proceeds received in the quarter related to a prior fire loss. Overhead expenses were 120 basis points higher than the prior-year primarily due to the leverage impact from the quarter-over- quarter revenue decline. Higher bad debt expense of $5 million contributed to a 40 basis points uptick to the higher overhead percentage. In dollar terms, overhead expenses were down $81 million year-on-year. On Slide 20, you'll note Europe's segment EBITDA margin of 7.4% represented a 30 basis point decrease relative to 2019. Adjusted gross margin improved by 100 basis points, going to margin improvement initiatives, including cost offsets in COGS and reduced inventory write-downs. Overhead expenses were unfavorable by 110 basis points primarily due to higher bad debt expense of $10 million or 80 basis points, and the negative leverage effect on fixed costs from lower revenue. Specialty on Slide 23 reported a segment EBITDA margin of 12.9%, a 20 basis point increase relative to the prior-year. Gross margin declined by 120 basis points due to primarily unfavorable mix effects related to both channel and product. Overhead expenses were favorable by 150 basis points attributable to personnel cost actions taken over the prior 12 months. Unlike the other segments, the leverage impact was nominal, as organic revenue declined by just 1.4%. At a consolidated level, restructuring expenses totaled $31 million with $6 million of inventory write-downs recorded in cost of goods sold. The restructuring charges relates to our ongoing programs to eliminate underperforming assets and cost inefficiencies. Benefits of the programs are already being realized and are projected to reach the full-year run rate benefit early next year. Net interest expense decreased by $10 million due to lower average debt level and a lower average interest rate. This variance continues to reflect the excellent work our global teams are doing to generate cash, which has been used to pay down debt in the trailing 12 months of approximately $800 million. We also benefited from the redemption of a 4.75% U.S. senior note in January of 2020 financing it with cash and borrowings from lower cost facilities. With the year-to-date debt pay down, the early reduction of the U.S. senior notes has been fully neutralized. Last quarter, we stated that we expected volatility in the tax rate this year, given the potential for varying outcomes in our full-year results. We certainly saw that volatility in the second quarter. Our effective tax rate was 25.7% for the quarter, which included a 200 basis point decrease compared to the annual effective rate used in the first quarter. The rate change resulted in a $0.02 per share pickup positive effect on adjusted diluted EPS for the year-to-date adjustment to the provision. The rate decrease is primarily attributable to the impact of higher projected full-year pre-tax income and geographic mix benefits. We expect the tax rate on the full-year basis to be approximately 28%, a little bit higher than our original guidance of 27.5%. Operating cash flows was $718 million, a 56% increase over the same period in 2019. Free cash flow of $686 million was a 66% improvement over the prior-year leading to a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.2 times based on our credit facility definitions. We used our free cash flow to repay $552 million of debt in the quarter. Listen, under normal circumstances, these would be exceptional numbers. Under the present circumstances, I believe these are amazing numbers. The second quarter operating cash flow figure is higher than every annual figure in the company's history, with the exception of last year. Granted, there were non-recurring benefits in the second quarter numbers, such as the tax deferrals that will largely unwind in the second half of the year. So to generate this level of cash during a period of lower productivity and higher degree of uncertainty is truly remarkable. These results were made possible by the decisive actions that we took since mid-March to protect the business from the COVID-19 disruption. I'm now going to expand on what we've done to-date to protect our business and our plans for the remainder of the year. In my remarks last quarter, I stated that our focus would be on what we could control. That is, one, reducing costs to reflect the new level of market demand; and two, continuing the focus on generating cash flow and ensuring adequate liquidity. I believe the numbers we've reported for Q2 support that we were successful in both objectives. Regarding the cost actions, we focused on three areas : personnel-related actions, variable cost decreases that follow from lower projected revenue, and third, other cost takeouts including route consolidations, branch rationalizations, and elimination of non-mission critical spending. We had estimated that the cost reductions would be $80 million to $90 million if revenues were down 40% to 45%. Looking at Slide 6, you can see that we reduced our quarterly SG&A expenses by 18% or $162 million, sequentially, while revenue declined 12% sequentially from Q1, thus creating a leveraged benefit from our overhead expenses. As expected, the majority of the benefits came from personnel costs actions, including furloughs, reductions in force and salary cuts. We generated roughly a further $10 million in cost savings in COGS, again largely related to personnel expenses. The total savings for the quarter of approximately $175 million was lower than the quarterly run rate savings we mentioned last quarter as a result of a couple of factors. First, we paid out vacation balances and medical benefits for our furloughed employees in April and thus did not realize the full benefit of the cost actions that month. This was anticipated and communicated 90-days ago. Second, and more importantly, the projected revenue decreases of 40% to 45% did not materialize. So our variable cost decline was lower than expected, as we brought back some of our workforce earlier than anticipated due to the revenue recovery. We were happy to put our people back to work as revenue increased and we still managed through quick and decisive actions to drive SG&A expenses to 28.1% of revenue compared to 30% in Q1 of 2020. This type of leverage was significantly better than what we have modeled at the start of the quarter, and is a testament to the strength of our team, and the resilience of the business model. Outside of a significant year-over-year increase in bad debt expenses of $14 million caused by the economic conditions facing our customers, we are pleased with the trend in our overhead expense management, and believe that we are delivering on our plan as evidenced by the results achieved in the second quarter. To be clear, not all these cost benefits are sustainable as we transition into the second half of the year. Some of the cost actions, as Nick mentioned, including temporary salary reductions, bypassed merit awards, and government reimbursements will begin to fall-off in July. We do not expect to go back to the pre-COVID cost structure as our teams have done terrific work during the pandemic to identify productivity opportunities that can be sustained going forward and we'll be very judicious in how we return costs to the business so we do not get ahead of the revenue recovery. Switching over to liquidity. While we felt comfortable with our position in April, we decided that strengthening our balance sheet would be a critical element of riding out the COVID-19 disruption and positioning the company for long-term success, as the duration of the health crisis was and remains broken ended. As a result, we focused on preserving cash by implementing an action plan that included reductions in inventory replenishment rates to reflect demand projections, active monitoring of customer receivables and terms, continuation of the European vendor financing program, and approximate 40% reduction or more than $100 million deferral on growth driven and non-mission critical capital projects, tax payment deferrals were allowable, and a hold in our share repurchase program, in addition to the cost savings measures. Each of these items generated benefits in the quarter. We scaled back inventory purchases and produced an operating cash inflow from this element of $453 million in the quarter. Our focus on collecting receivables led to a net inflow for the quarter of $59 million. The vendor financing program over in Europe had a minor impact for the quarter, but saw an increase of supplier participation, which will yield future benefits. Capital spending decreased approximately 30% compared to Q2 of the prior-year, and income tax payments and other tax deferrals such as VAT created approximately $175 million to $185 million in cash savings in the quarter. We didn't repurchase any LKQ stock and the resulting free cash flow was used to repay debt, which will yield ongoing interest expense savings apart from increasing our overall liquidity. During the second half, we get back some of the timing-related benefits. Most importantly, we plan to increase our inventory levels to support the service and fill rate requirements of our businesses based on the better revenue projection in the balance of year. While we expect to be able to operate effectively at a lower inventory balance than we exited 2019, the June figure is not sustainable for us to maintain our service levels based on what we've seen currently and coming off the low points in late March and early April. The income and other tax deferrals have already started to reverse in July, as we made our estimated U.S. federal tax payments and will largely unwind in Q3 and Q4. We expect to generate positive free cash flow in the second half though not at a level close to what we've achieved in the first half of the year. Relative to March 31, our liquidity position is significantly stronger to the cash generation in the second quarter, and the amendment to our credit facility executed in the quarter. Total liquidity defined as cash plus availability on our credit facilities was $2.5 billion as of the end of June, an increase of almost $700 million compared to 90-days ago. You recall that we amended our credit facility out of an abundance of caution to reduce the risk of reaching the net leverage covenant if the pandemic had a severe and extended effect on profitability. Our internal models had suggested that we would be able to meet our payment obligations through the pandemic, though there was a risk that we might exceed the maximum four times net leverage ratio in a severe downside case. However, the debt repayments during the quarter drove a reduction in the net leverage ratio to 2.2 times compared to a maximum net leverage requirement currently in force of almost five times. With the amendment, and the better than forecasted performance in the second quarter, we believe, we have significantly reduced the risk of a covenant breach on the net leverage. From a capital allocation perspective, our focus remains unchanged, especially as the fog owing to the pandemic is yet to lift. Apart from continuing to invest in our business by continuing to deliver industry-leading fill rates, service reliability, geographic footprint, and warranty on our products, to extend our leadership position in the markets we serve, we plan to continue to pay down debt and the share repurchase plan remains suspended. Finally, when we withdrew full-year guidance in March, we cited the uncertainty regarding the impact that COVID would have on the world. Four months later that uncertainty is still present, especially with respect to the duration and long-term effects of the pandemic, and the range of potential outcomes is wide. While our solid Q2 results are behind us with several learnings for our teams on what is possible, there is a risk to the second half with a spike in cases and the lingering possibility for a stall or a rollback in the reopening of economies across North America and Europe. As a result, we're not providing financial outlook for fiscal 2020 at this time. However, we expect the following elements for 2020 on a full-year basis. One, effective tax rate for the year in a range of 27.5% to 28.5%, interest expense of $95 million to $105 million, depreciation and amortization of approximately $265 million to $275 million on a GAAP basis and $165 million to $175 million on an adjusted basis, which excludes amortization of acquired intangibles. And finally, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and flexibility to meet the needs of our business, and will deliver yet another excellent performance in free cash flow for the full-year of a minimum of $700 million. This recognizes the fact as I mentioned a few minutes ago that income tax payments and other tax deferrals such as VAT created approximately $175 million to $185 million in cash savings in Q2, and will largely unwind in the second half. With that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Varun. In closing it is clear that our focus on profitable growth, enhanced margins, and better free cash flow generation positioned us well as we entered this unexpected turn of events. Our teams have been agile and have done a fantastic job of tackling the cost structure and delivered with tenacious focus this quarter generating solid margin and free cash flow in the midst of a negative growth environment. What we can focus on is to hear and now and address the dynamics that we can effectively control. And that focus was validated by our second quarter results. In my continued communication with our broader employee base, I have indicated we will get through this together and come out a stronger, wiser, and better positioned organization that continues to be LKQ proud. Clearly, our teams across the globe have embraced this message, and for that, I am thankful and proud of each and everyone's efforts to carry our mission forward, regardless of the hurdles presented. The global teams have done a terrific job of responding to the conditions created by the pandemic, and I'm highly confident in their ability to continue to create successful outcomes. Lastly, I want to announce that we will be hosting our third Investor Day, the morning of September 10, and we look forward to your participation. Given the pandemic, this will be a virtual event, and we will issue a press release in the coming weeks with details for this session with our broader global leadership team. Operator, we're now ready to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question this morning comes from Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Hi, thank you. So I just want to make sure I understood, Nick, your comment about this June ended at down about an 8% but July is seeing some leveling a little pullback. So the way we should think about this is 3Q is probably not as good as June, but it's clearly better than 2Q? Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Michael, and thanks for the question. Absolutely as I mentioned in June, the organic revenue trends were down 14% for North America, 8% for Europe, and up 14% for Specialty. And indeed based on what we've seen thus far, July has given up a bit in both North America and Europe, and even more so in Specialty. So if the current trends persist, you'd be looking at an environment where North America is probably off 15% or so, Europe off 10%, and Specialty being flat with last year. We would hope, obviously, that the world will make continued progress, both in terms of controlling the virus and opening the economies. But right now, there's little hard evidence that that's going to happen. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephanie Benjamin from SunTrust. Please go ahead. Stephanie Benjamin : Varun, you gave obviously very tremendous cost cutting initiatives that came into place in the second quarter. And you walked through a lot of those are going to kind of reverse some as we get to the 3Q, can you kind of walk us through what we would expect to be sustainable at these new revenue levels as we look to 3Q from the cost cutting initiatives? Varun Laroyia : Yes, absolutely, Stephanie, good morning. And thank you for the question. I think that is a very, very relevant question to ask. And as you kind of go back in terms of 90 days ago, when we were talking about how we were seeing Q2 play out and really what actions we had initiated, it was the key parameter there was what level of demand we would be seeing. So long story short, it really depends on the level of demand recovery though, we are clearly focused on retaining savings through operational efficiencies. And frankly as we all learn to do more with less. So for example, in the second quarter while we had roadmapped a significantly higher cost management set of actions, it was predicated by revenue levels being done 40% to 45%. And that's what the $80 million to $90 million was related to on a monthly basis. We ended up 19% down, so about 50% to 60% better than what we had initially anticipated. Though I think from a cost takeout perspective in the second quarter, we certainly pushed hard and not just on the income statement from a cost management perspective, but also obviously on the balance sheet that you've noted. So as you kind of think through on -- for the remainder of the year, it all depends on the level of demand recovery that we see. And then clearly, as you know, we have a restructuring program that's currently underway. And that really will be permanent cost savings in any case. So later 2019, and then also at the end of Q1, we had called out restructuring charges. Those are proceeding as expected really the full run rate comes towards the back end of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino from Barrington Research. Please go ahead. Nick Zarcone : Gary, good morning. I don't think we can hear you. You may be on mute. Operator : And -- Gary Prestopino : Can you hear me now, right? Operator : Yes. Nick Zarcone : Yes, we can hear you now, Gary, yes. Gary Prestopino : I'm sorry about that. You said you had, I want to just get back to these expense reductions. You said you had about $80 million permanently in North America that you think you're going to keep, I think I jotted that down as you were talking; is that correct? Nick Zarcone : That is correct, Gary. Again, that's a combination of people of France closing some facilities, getting rid of some excess distribution assets, and like. Gary Prestopino : And then just very quickly -- Nick Zarcone : And that's an annual number, Gary. Gary Prestopino : Okay. So that has 80 out of the 162, so far, that's quantifiable because just picking up on the prior question, Varun, you kind of danced around that a little bit. And I think, in this kind of environment, we just -- we're trying to get a handle on what exactly is going to be permanent and what isn't? And then just real secondly, could you just maybe give us an idea of what the situation is in Europe in terms of economy still being locked down or are they at a better stage than we are in the U.S. or still behind us? Nick Zarcone : I'll take the back half of that question. And indeed, the European economies are more open than the United States. And I think you've seen that in some of the miles driven differences, fuel consumption, and the like. That said, I mean, we have seen some spikes in Europe in particular cities or particular countries. So the virus is not gone from the European landscape. Obviously, you're probably well aware of what's happening in this country with incredible spikes, both in positive cases and fatalities in many, many states in the U.S., so there's pretty big regional differences here in the U.S., but taken as a whole Europe is doing better than we are. Operator : Our next question comes from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Bret Jordan : On the U.S. collision business where you seem to be really outperforming the repairable claims number, could you give us any color as to what might be driving that? Is that a share gain against alternative, other alternative parts or increased alternative parts within the repair mix? Nick Zarcone : Yes, there's not one magic bullet there, Bret. The reality is CCC repairable claims down 44% our volumes in North America is down 22%, so obviously good outperformance. We think there are a bunch of different contributing factors. First, the OEs were shut down for several weeks. Both their manufacturing facilities and many of their dealers were also closed for a few weeks as well. So if you can't get an OE parked to the shops, they tended to then go to alternative part usage. So just like the GM strike helped us in the fourth quarter of 2019, we believe, there was some, not a huge but some benefit from the OE disruptions caused by the pandemic here in the second quarter. Obviously, we remained open, and we had high levels of inventory and we're eager to serve all of the customers who are looking for parts. Keep in mind that half of the salvage business is really mechanical parts as opposed to collision parts. And there's no doubt that the mechanical parts performed better during the quarter. And our remanufacturing business which really sells remand engines and transmissions was particularly strong in the second quarter. And then self-service which normally doesn't get a lot of fanfare, actually performed quite well. They had year-over-year increases with admissions, the number of people actually paying to come into our yards, and in the revenue from selling parts, well both those metrics being up on a year-over-year basis. So just want to re-emphasize that negative growth in 2020, if the sector returns to 2019 levels, probably sometime in 2021, we're going to show really solid year-over-year growth but off of a low base in 2020. And probably not going to be sometime until 2022 until we have a true apples-to-apples comparison. While you then ask it longer-term we do not see the pandemic it's causing a fundamental shift in the organic growth in our industry. Again while there will be couple of years of not having good apples-to-apples comparison, we think that the core attractiveness of alternative parts stays firmly in place. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Kennison from Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : Hey Nick, good to hear from you. Obviously the pandemic is the big story on the quarter. But I'd love to hear about your progress on 1 LKQ Europe, whether it comes down to procurement or skew reduction or route optimization, just love to hear what you're doing on that front? Nick Zarcone : Yes, absolutely correct. We believe that the core operational efficiencies identified and communicated to the market last September are still valid and achievable. We obviously did not anticipate the pandemic that was going to have such a profound impact on our demand. So while the longer-term benefits will be achieved, the exact timing and sequencing of all those various initiatives that we set forth back in September will likely shift around a bit. Some of the items are getting pulled forward while other items are getting pushed back. As we talked about, in September right, a number of the items that we had on the drawing boards, and we're working towards really involved the point groups of our existing employees, work-in project teams to come together in a really collaborative fashion and to work on projects in addition to their day jobs. Given the travel restrictions and the need to have 120% of everyone's focus on dealing with the issues caused by the pandemic, some of those project teams quite frankly were put on the sidelines during the second quarter because it was more important to focus on here and now as opposed to margin improvements over the next two to three years. I'm happy to say, effective July 1, all those project teams are back up and running. They're a little bit behind original schedule, but they're back up and running. Some of the items like procurement, which you highlighted we've seen the starting point shift because of the pandemic. When your volume of parts purchased fall by 15% to 20%, because of the pandemic, we have some pretty serious discussions to be had with our suppliers. We think ultimately, it's all going to come back in line, but the timing may be off a little bit. But rest assured we believe there's still 300 basis points of margin improvement in Europe. And that was based on a starting point of around 8% EBITDA margins right. The pandemic has not only compressed the revenue, but obviously there was negative leverage, as a result of the fact that some of our costs are fixed in nature. So we're really driving forward on two fronts. One is to get the starting point back to that 8% level, and then, second, to get the benefits of all the discrete initiatives that we identified as part of the 1 LKQ program. So we're going to be working hard on both fronts. On France, our CEO of Europe is going to be joining us on Investor Day, this coming September 10. And part of his presentation will cover a very detailed update on the 1 LKQ program but hopefully that gives you a little bit of sense as to where we are. Operator : Our next question comes from Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Yes, thanks guys. I appreciate all the color this morning. Nick Zarcone : Good morning. Daniel Imbro : Wanted to follow-up on something I think you mentioned last quarter, Varun, just the competitive backdrop. Obviously, we've seen some smaller bankruptcies across Europe. I'm sure some of your competitors in North America are struggling and you're gaining share there. But how is the competitive landscape shifting, are prices going higher? Are you seeing it easier to push those through? Any kind of update there you can provide? Varun Laroyia : Yes, I think it's a great question. And again -- it again --is -- given the pandemic that's sweeping through; there are a bunch of puts and takes that are coming through. So for example, in North America, when this kind of started off, call it end of March, beginning of April, for example, there were a number of businesses that kind of closed their doors, simply put, because they were kind of stay-in-shelter items or measures, same thing over in Europe also. Then we did see in North America, for example, when the CARES Act, the PPP came out, we saw a number of our competitors reopen their doors, and they were out there open for business and so again that that kind of competitive landscape picked up. But if you think about, where our North America business ended up coming through with revenue declines versus say what the CCC data would state, we've significantly outperformed what the metrics that they should be measured against are. And again, there are a number of different elements. But the one key element that I'll share with you is, as we know that OEMs were closed for a certain period of time in the second quarter, a number of the dealerships were closed also in the second quarter for a certain period of time and hence the parts departments. LKQ have being an essential business was open, and when customers needed parts, guess who they called. And this is really where the resiliency of the LKQ model comes through in terms of having a phenomenal geographic footprint, the service reliability, and an unmatched breadth and depth of inventory. So that kind of played out in the second quarter. And as I said, when we had the GM strike, call it in the back end of last year in many ways you kind of make your own destiny and that's how the North America team has been incredibly agile and nimble. Across the pond in Europe, similar situation. It is a very fragmented market out there. But as you know, we have market leadership positions in several markets. And out there also our team's done outstanding job, both in terms of having the availability and also being open to business where they were allowed to do so. So we believe we did kind of take share over in Europe. But again, it's very difficult to get numbers from a European perspective to be able to direct you in terms of what level of gain share took place out there. And then, finally, for our Specialty business, we know, for example, those of us in the U.S., we love the outdoors, the RV market has been doing incredibly well. A number of our suppliers who kind of reported over the past few days have also kind of reported strong demand coming through. And again, it kind of goes back to saying how is it that what folks thought would be perhaps one of the most in a cyclical business in an economic downturn is performing so well. And it really comes back to folks have a certain level of income that kind of put aside, either going out, watching concerts, going to movies, traveling. And as those activities have been curtailed, folks have really gone forward in kind of living out that passion. And that really is what we've seen. So again, from that perspective that business has done incredibly well and kind of being the market leader in what we do on the Specialty side. We know we've done incredibly well out there also. So I hope that kind of gives you a good overview across each of our segments in terms of what the market landscape is. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Thanks for coming back to me. So in the EU, there's this mandatory requirement to do safety inspections and they kind of have programmatic timing and when that happens, what's your thoughts about how much -- what happened in 2Q with some of that as opposed to we just were driving more? Nick Zarcone : It depends on the timing of the quarter. Clearly, Michael in April, the mandatory inspections were not unilaterally, but many, many countries were put on a temporary hold as each of the governments was trying to figure out how to deal with the pandemic, right. And getting your car inspected wasn't the highest priority at the time. By time you got to the back end of the quarter, many of those temporary delays in the inspection process were removed. And so folks were absolutely having to get their cars and to get inspected to get their registrations renewed and the like. So that was a little bit of it. But there's no doubt that miles driven has come back very significantly in Europe. I mean whether Italy from being down 74% at one point in time to today probably being down 10% to 15%, 20%. That's a huge recovery. Germany going from down 40% at its low to maybe being down 10% today. So, there's no doubt that the recovery miles driven probably the largest factor in driving the revenue, particularly in the back half of the quarter. Operator : This concludes our Q&A session for today. And I will now turn the call back to Nick Zarcone for concluding remarks. Nick Zarcone : Well, as always, we greatly appreciate the time and attention that you've given us here this morning. Hopefully, the information provided gives you a good sense of what's going on here at LKQ. And importantly, we look to continue the discussion, the morning of September 10, when we have our Analyst Day. Again that will be a virtual format. It will run probably the better part of five hours or so. And we'll have all of the operating heads of our businesses from across the globe as part of the lineup for the presentation. So we can go in-depth on each of the three businesses, as well as hit the high points from a corporate perspective, a strategy perspective, and a financial perspective. So we look forward to sharing that with you in September. And again, we thank you for your time and attention here this morning. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Abrupt start\u2026 Joe Boutross : Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today and as normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the next few days. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Dominick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will provide some high-level operating highlights related to the third quarter before discussing some key metrics that are impacting the revenue trends in each of our segments. Varun will then dive into the financials with the key focus on the impact of the measures we initiated in late March across the entire organization to right size the cost structure and maximize cash flow. He will also discuss our liquidity and the strength of our balance sheet, before I come back with a few closing remarks. It's hard to believe that just six months ago, in early April, we were facing revenue declines of 40% to 45% as economies around the world went into lockdown. Today, we are enjoying a material improvement in demand, year-over-year margin improvements in each of our segments, and over $1 billion dollars of free cash flow generated in just the first nine months of this year. In light of the challenging environment, we have confronted throughout the year, our team delivered a terrific outcome in the third quarter. These results clearly highlight the true strength of LKQ. This performance was achieved in the midst of having to make mission-critical decisions to protect the business, while simultaneously maintaining the morale of our most important asset, our people. I could not be prouder of the effort of team LKQ. As noted on Slide 4, total revenue for the third quarter was $3 billion, reflecting a 3.2% decrease from the level recorded in the comparable period of 2019. Global parts and services organic revenue declined 4.5% in the third quarter, while currencies and the net impact of divestitures and acquisitions collectively accounted for a 1.1% increase. Notwithstanding the soft revenue environment, our team reached a monumental milestone by delivering the highest level of quarterly earnings in the company's history. During the third quarter, diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $0.64 compared to $0.49 last year, a 31% year-over-year increase. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS was $0.75 compared to $0.61 or a 23% increase. Now on to the segments. As you will note from Slide 6, parts and services revenue in North America declined 12.1% during the third quarter with organic revenue growth for parts and services declining 11.3%. The lower organic demand is reflective of reduced levels of mobility as evidenced by meaningful year-over-year declines in both vehicle miles driven and fuel consumption. According to CCC, collision and liability related repairable claims in the third quarter were down 24%. So again, we are clearly outperforming the claims data. When looking at products specific data, while both were down, our salvage revenue trends outperformed aftermarket largely due to the demand of our mechanical parts, predominantly engines and transmissions. Still our aftermarket collision based revenue performed materially better than the CCC statistics for repairable claims, suggesting that we continue to experience share gains in the collision marketplace. There was particularly strength in our remanufactured product line as many market participants were disrupted by the component supplier's ability to provide product. Given the depth and breadth of our remanufactured parts inventory, we were able to keep pace with demand and believe we gained share from our direct reman [ph] competitors in the third quarter. I would also highlight that despite the revenue decline, the segment EBITDA margin in North America was 17.6%, our highest quarterly level achieved in the company's history. Also North America operational efficiency efforts continued to capture the $80 million dollars in annualized permanent cost reductions that we have discussed over the past few quarters. At the end of the third quarter, over 90% of those cost actions have been completed, with the balance scheduled to be finalized in the fourth quarter. Varun will dig deeper into the puts and takes of these numbers shortly. Regarding the competitive landscape, as many of you on the call know, in August AutoNation announced that it will be closing its aftermarket collision parts business. This headline is both a commentary on the difficulty of growing a profitable aftermarket parts business and more importantly, a true testament to the strength of LKQ's aftermarket collision parts operations with our market leading fulfillment rates, service reliability, nationwide coverage and unrivaled depth and breadth of inventory. From a supply perspective, we have minimal issues sourcing product for our aftermarket crash parts business and our Taiwanese supply partners are well positioned as we prepare for the winter season. We have seen some tightness getting adequate space on ships for our containers causing some delay on product coming in from Taiwan and an uptick in freight expense. Depending on the supplier and product, we have witnessed delays anywhere from one week to 30 days. Having said that, our overall inventory is in good shape and heading in the right direction. On the salvage front, auction volumes are still depressed, though we've seen a slight increase in activity over the past months. We did experience a rapid uptick pricing during the quarter as used car prices surged and the exporters resurfaced at the auctions. But our team has done a fantastic job at combating these price increases by harvesting more parts per vehicle and executing our price optimization strategy. When combined with the rise in precious metals prices, our efforts have allowed us to recapture a significant portion of the increased pricing at auction. As we enter Q4, we have seen little change in pricing, but we are optimistic that this trend will reverse over the next few quarters as volumes return to historical level. While these pricing dynamics may put some pressure on salvage margins in the near-term, when taken together with our productivity gains, over the longer term we believe North America EBITDA margins will settle out well above 2019 levels. Now let's turn to Europe. Total revenue for our European segment during the third quarter rose 2.2% compared to the prior year. Organic revenue for parts and services in the third quarter decreased 7/10 [ph] 1% while the negative impacts of acquisitions and divestitures was a negative 1.5% and currencies added 4.5%. Throughout the quarter most regions witnessed stronger than anticipated volumes, a very encouraging trend. As I stated in our second quarter call, not all regions were impacted by the COVID pandemic at the same time or to the same degree, creating a different growth profile for each of our European businesses. This difference in growth profile continued in the third quarter, but the variability in growth across the businesses were not as disparate when compared to Q2. Importantly, certain key markets such as the UK, Germany and the Netherlands posted single-digit organic revenue growth on a per day basis with September generally reflecting the best month of the quarter. Italy continued to be the softest region posting the largest year-over-year declines followed by the Central and Eastern European operations, which collectively were also down on a year-over-year basis. In the UK, we have completed the restructuring of the Andrew Page branches with nearly 30 unprofitable branches closed and all remaining branches running on ECP's IT infrastructure. All this branch restructuring will likely cost us a bit in terms of revenue growth and enabled ECP proposed double-digit EBITDA margins for the first time in the last 17 quarters. As the leading aftermarket mechanical parts distributor in the UK, we believe ECP has the best margins in the market given the scale advantages and the operational efficiency as a result of our investments. Local management has done a terrific job of delivering on the key operational initiatives of profitable growth and enhanced margins. Additionally, our Brexit contingency plan is in place and being thoughtfully executed despite the significant uncertainty around the Brexit negotiations. The team continues to effectively manage any safety stock risk in the UK. Our European team continues to right size their inventory levels in the midst of the lower demand. As of late, we have seen softness in sourcing product broadly across our supply chain and daily we actively review, line by line our inventory levels to assure our customer service and fulfillment rates continue to be industry-leading. I am happy to report at this time neither of those has been impacted, largely because of our levels of safety stock. Lastly on Europe, the execution of our 1 LKQ Europe program remains on track. As mentioned, at our September 2020 Investor Day, we have pulled forward some activities relative to the original plan and have seen slight delays in other areas. Again, we\u2019ve accelerated our platform rationalization, innovation and shared services development, talent acquisition efforts and the build out of our digital strategy, while our ERP harmonization projects, procurement and product and yield management activities have been delayed by a quarter or two. In total we remain comfortable with both the magnitude and the cadence of the margin improvements set forth in the comprehensive review that Arnd and Yanik [ph] provided last month during the Investor Day event. Moving on to Specialty. During the third quarter our Specialty segment had total revenue growth of 1.4% composed of organic revenue growth for parts and services of 1.1% and acquisitions and currencies making up the balance. Given some industry-wide inventory challenges, our organic growth rates were clearly hindered by the low availability of product to meet the robust demand and we believe the lost revenue due to significant gaps in the supply chain. That said, we believe that our market-leading position allowed us to fare better than our competitors and as you would expect we are in constant communication with our suppliers to work with them and help wherever we can to get more product out on the road. Over the past few weeks we have seen an increase in product receipts and we have finally started to increase our Specialty inventory levels with sales growth rates increasing as a result. In particular, we are encouraged by the extended RV season with this particular product group continuing to perform well. From a corporate development perspective, during the quarter we acquired a mobile diagnostics business that provides our existing diagnostics business entry into the Virginia market and also add some technicians that will serve key markets throughout North Carolina. Also, during the quarter, Stahlgruber entered into an agreement to divest its 51% ownership stake in two small businesses located in Poland. These transactions represent our ongoing effort to rationalize our asset base through the divesture of noncore lower margin businesses and finding new opportunities to grow our customer offerings. The net consideration related to these transactions was negligible. From an ESP perspective, during the third quarter our recycling businesses processed 209,000 vehicles resulting in, among other things, the recycling of 990,000 gallons of fuel, 581,000 gallons of waste oil, 542,000 tires and 191,000 batteries. During Q3 we also processed approximately 286,000 tons of scrap steel. You can see that our businesses help preserve significant levels of natural resources, reduce the demand for scarce [ph] financial [ph] space and reduce air and water pollution, all of which helps protect the environment. So where can we go from here? Similar to the second quarter we have clearly benefited from a solid rebound in demand during Q3. But as widely publicized, there has been a resurgence in COVID cases across the globe with positive test rates reaching all-time highs. It is impossible to predict how the recent surge may impact our business as it depends on how the governments around the globe react. Some countries are headed back to strict lockdowns, but most appeared to be focused more on curbing certain activities such as attending sporting events and other group functions, limiting in-restaurant dining and utilizing virtual schooling, all of which will continue to dampen mobility. While the horizon of the overall market demand remains foggy, we are hopeful that the industry will not return to the extreme market conditions experienced early in the second quarter. With that as a backdrop, we do not expect any material improvement in mobility or overall industry demand in the fourth quarter as there are no catalysts apparent to drive meaningful increases in miles driven. Until improvement is evident in our business, we remain intensely focused on controlling our costs and generating significant levels of cash flow. And at this point I will turn the call over to Varun. Varun Laroyia : Thank you, Nick and a very good morning from the LKQ offices in Chicago to everyone joining us today. I am very excited to speak with you this morning on our third quarter results. When I joined LKQ in October 2017, I saw a market-leading business with an opportunity to become even stronger by becoming disciplined and more rigorous in the application of key management principles. Since then, following a very successful consolidation phase in the company\u2019s evolution, we shifted or focus to operational excellence with an emphasis on pursuing profitable revenue growth and generating high quality sustainable free cash flow. Our 2020 results and especially the third quarter are an indication of the success of these multi-year efforts. I want to acknowledge the work of all our teams across the business in producing a record quarter of earnings per share and over $1 billion in free cash flow through nine months while navigating a pandemic. That is truly outstanding performance. In my remarks I will cover the progress we\u2019ve made with margin expansion and cash flow generation and a brief recap of the segment results and our thoughts about the fourth quarter. I\u2019ll start with Slide 7, which shows the consolidated margins achieved over the last three years. You can see how prioritizing profitable revenue growth has played out in gross margin in the last couple of years. Each quarter in 2019 and 2020 has shown year-over-year improvement, except perhaps the third quarter of 2019, which was adversely impacted by 60 basis point from restructuring charges. Taking away that impact, it would have been seven consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement. Listen, I can\u2019t guarantee that this streak will continue uninterrupted, as we know there are positive and negative shots that can pop up, such as the effect from fluctuations in precious metal prices. However, I fundamentally believe that we are in a stronger and more resilient position today than a few years ago going through rightsizing and productivity actions and margin initiatives implemented across each of our segments that recognize the world class [indiscernible] service and value that we provide to our customers to help them achieve their goals. Additionally, with the portfolio deep dive that we initiated in line with the operational expense program, an integral part of our ongoing efforts to rationalize our asset base, the divesture of lower margin and non-core businesses is increasing our margin profile and improving returns on invested capital, all of which is a sustainable development. Shifting to segment EBITDA, we recognize that the benefits of our gross margin improvement initiatives were being partially or fully offset by changes in overhead expense leverage. As you will recall, we implemented a global restructuring program in 2019 to drive operating efficiencies, along with the ongoing 1 LKQ Europe program. When the global pandemic struck in early 2020, we took tough and decisive actions to accelerate the cost savings initiatives. We acted immediately to align overhead expenses with revenue changes through actions such as furloughs, salary reductions and bypass discretionary and other non-mission critical spending. Further, and more importantly, we made permanent reductions through another restructuring program that targeted inefficient operations that had built up over years of relentless revenue growth. These cost actions have been critical to the margin success we've seen in the last two quarters during the pandemic, including the 210 basis points year-over-year improvement in the third quarter. Looking at Slide 8, you can see the effects of our cost structure actions with the largest cuts coming in Q2, followed by some increase owing to operational activity in Q3 as revenue recovered. Importantly, we've laid back expenses at a lower rate than the revenue increase. Sequential revenue in the third quarter increased by 16%, while overhead expenses grew only by 10%. We are encouraged by these results and the level of time and cost savings being achieved across the business. On slide 10, you'll see a summary of the consolidated results for the quarter highlighted by impressive profitability increases on the segment EBITDA and EPS lines. Moving to segment performance, we are very pleased with the North America results as shown on slide 11. The segment EBITDA margin of 17.6% is the highest we've seen in the history of the company and merits additional praise for coming in the third quarter, which traditionally runs at a lower margin than the first two. The gross margin remained strong due to pricing and rightsizing actions, and was further enhanced by favorable impacts from scrap steel and precious metal prices. It's difficult to forecast how long the precious metals benefit will last. The current prices supported continuing benefit into the fourth quarter, although at a diminished level as car costs adjust for the increase. We expect some downward pressure on gross margin in the fourth quarter from higher salvage care costs and the team is working to mitigate those effects. North America has done an exemplary job of leveraging operating expenses as evidenced by 5% sequential increase in OpEx in Q3 to deliver a 15% revenue increase. Personnel costs are the biggest driver of improvement reflecting reduced headcount, lower medical claims, improved safety performance, lower overtime and limited travel expenses. With gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage, North America delivered an incredible result. As you've heard at our Virtual Investor Day last month and see in these results, the North American management team has embraced the operational excellence mindset and is delivering outstanding performance. Europe also produced a strong segment EBITDA margin in the third quarter, coming in at 9.2%, which is its highest figure since the second quarter of 2017. As shown on Slide 12, the gross margin remained solid at 37.1% and generated most of the year-over-year improvement in segment EBITDA largely due to margin enhancement initiatives implemented to pursue our profitable revenue growth objective. Overhead expenses are down in local currency versus last year as a result of permanent and temporary headcount reductions, limited travel expenses, and aid from government programs in Europe. We know that there is more work to do in Europe to realize the full benefits of the 1 LKQ Europe program, but we now have the right team in place, and we are confident that they are positioned to meet or exceed the segment EBITDA margin target for the second half of 2020 that was presented during Investor Day. Turning to Slide 13 Specialty continues to perform well through the pandemic, producing a 60 basis point improvement in segment EBITDA. There is some year-over-year mix shift impacting gross margin and freight expenses in offsetting directions, leaving personnel expenses as the primary driver of improvement. Specialty made significant reductions in 2019, but was able to identify additional opportunities to drive efficiency and productivity. We have seen these benefits come through in the operating expense leverage. So in summary, Q3 was an excellent quarter for all three of our segments. Each faced challenging conditions and yet produced year-over-year improvements. Reflecting upon the journey we've taken over the last few years, I vividly recall Q1 2018 when as a newbie to LKQ, the business generated $5 million of incremental segment EBITDA on a revenue increase of $378 million and contrast that against this quarter, with a $52 million increase year-over-year in segment EBITDA, despite $100 million decrease in revenue. There's a lot of hard work and difficult decisions that got us to this position. A massive thank you to all of my LKQ colleagues who have helped made this happen. Now on to cash flow and liquidity. Q3 was another successful quarter for cash flow generation. We added $222 million in operating cash flows, as we continue to benefit from reductions, improved working capital, especially inventory. As expected, and stated on the second quarter earnings call, some of the tax payment deferrals that boosted cash flow in the first half reversed this quarter, as we caught up on income tax, and VAT payments, which partially offset the trade [ph] working capital benefit. The vendor financing program in Europe continues to ramp up with an increase in supply participation, which we expect to yield benefit in 2021. During the fourth quarter, we gave back some of the year-to-date trade working capital related benefits as we plan to increase our inventory levels to support this service, and fill rate requirements of our businesses, based on the revenue trends and expectations for 2021, including normal seasonality as we approach the winter. As previously mentioned, while we expect to be able to operate effectively at a lower inventory balance than we exited 2019, the September figure isn't sustainable in the long run for us to continue our best in class fill rates. As shown on Slide 14, operating cash flows were $1.1 billion through September, and CapEx cash outlays were $110 million. The resulting free cash flow was used to pay down over $1 billion in debt. We're very pleased with the trend in EBITDA to free cash flow conversion as presented on Slide 15, though we know that the 2020 ratio of 108% just isn't sustainable. However, the strong conversion this year demonstrates the ability of the business to generate significant cash during periods of extreme volatility. On Slide 16, you can see the progress we've made this year to strengthen our liquidity position. I want to highlight the net leverage ratio, which has decreased to 2 times from 2.6 times at the end of 2019. We've targeted to maintain our net leverage around the 2 times level as I stated at the Investor Day last month, and reaching this level creates flexibility in our capital allocation decisions, while continuing to pursue investment grade metrics. We will still opportunistically pay down debt when appropriate, and the target net leverage ratio combined with a solid total liquidity position gives us confidence to restart the share repurchase program. As you recall, we voluntarily halted the program in March to preserve cash, as we worked to understand the pandemic's effect on our business. No different than before, we will repurchase shares when we feel market conditions are favorable under our remaining authorization. Finally, I will close with a couple of thoughts on the fourth quarter. As COVID uncertainties remain, we are not providing full financial guidance for 2020. However, our experiences obtained from operating in the pandemic over the last seven months, gives us comfort in making the following statements, which presumes extreme mobility restrictions. I repeat, which is that extreme mobility restrictions are not re-implemented in our major markets. One, we believe that the full organic parts and services revenue recovery will come through sometime in 2021. Though near term, our fourth quarter revenue will be lower than the reported 2019 figure. Two, with the ongoing benefit of our focus on costs and productivity actions and margin improvement efforts, we expect our fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to be above the comparable figure for 2019. And finally, we project that free cash flow for the full year 2020 will be a minimum of $900 million, up double-digit year-over-year, despite the lower revenue. So once again, thank you for your time and attention this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Nick, for his closing comments. Dominick Zarcone : Thank you, Varun for that detailed financial update. In closing, our performance in the quarter clearly illustrates the strength of our business, which is driven by a tremendous team that has focused on our key initiatives of driving profitable revenue growth, enhanced margins, and free cash flow. Regardless of the operating environment, and hurdles confronted, our team once again, delivered on each one of these initiatives in the quarter. No one at LKQ takes for granted how hard we work to create our market leading positions and all levels of the organization are laser focused on maintaining and growing these positions each and every day. The strength of our three reporting segments is based on our geographic, customer, and product diversity, unmatched inventory levels, and the high levels of fulfillment rates across all of our segments, which is all supported by a proud culture of putting the customer at the center of everything we do. With these key initiatives in place, and the best operating teams in the industry, we are confident that we will continue to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Operator, we are now ready to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Daniel Imbro : Hi there, congrats on the quarter. Dominick Zarcone : Hey, thanks Daniel. Varun Laroyia : Hey, thanks Daniel. Daniel Imbro : I wanted to ask one on OpEx, specifically on the personnel. I think in the slide, you mentioned personnel was down 12%, that included some portion of permanent costs, but also some portion of like lack of merit based expenses or merit based increases, which should come back eventually I would think, but what kind of timeframe do you expect that to normalize? Can you help us think about what that 12% looks like by segment, is it more concentrated in North America or Europe, any kind of color there would be helpful? Varun Laroyia : Absolutely. Daniel, good morning to you and everyone else joining us this morning, also. Yes in terms of when you look at the personnel costs, that's really the one area which is a significant portion, in fact, by far the largest key element of our operating expenses. With regards to some of the temporary cost savings that we had implemented in the second quarter, I think as we mentioned, in the third quarter those pretty much came back. So if your question is in terms of what level of the bypassed merit or the salary trends that had taken place, those are currently running on a normal basis as of now. So from that perspective, that's going to come back. But I think more importantly, what we should think about is the permanent cost reductions that we've called out exactly seven weeks ago by segment at our Virtual Investor Day on the 10th of September. North America and Europe, both of them are driving hard on that front. North America is ahead with regards to the execution of that program and we're certainly seeing the benefit come through. So all in all happy with the way we are managing our cost structure, given the extreme volatility there is out there in the market. Operator : Our next question is from Scott Stember of CL King. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning, Scott. Varun Laroyia : Good morning, Scott. Scott Stember : Again, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a great quarter. Dominick Zarcone : Thank you for that. Scott Stember : You talked about, obviously some certain caution regarding the increased infection rates throughout the world, but just trying to get a sense of what we've seen so far in October, have you seen any material difference from the trajectory of recovery in Europe, particularly in the UK, Netherlands and Germany? Dominick Zarcone : So obviously, we had what we think was a pretty good third quarter across the enterprise, given where we are with miles driven and the like. Importantly, in Europe, while we were down 7/10 of a percent organic for the quarter, some of the key markets were up kind of single digits, particularly the UK, Germany and the Netherlands and September was the best month, generally of the quarter, so that was encouraging. We haven't seen a significant move in the first couple of weeks of October, either up or down, quite frankly. But, the spikes in the cases of just, they've just started and the governments are just beginning to think about what their action plans are going to be. Actually, since we've been on this call, I saw a note that France is going into pretty much of a severe lockdown now. We don\u2019t have much business in France, so that won't have an impact on us. The key Scott is, how are the governments around the globe going to react to the current spike in positive cases and we just don\u2019t have any clarity as to how that's going to be. But thus far we're okay. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Butler of Stifel. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning, Brian. Hello. Brian Butler : I just wanted to maybe go in a little bit more on the working capital. And if you could provide a little bit more color. I know, you said that it was going, you're going to give back some of that, but maybe a little bit color on fourth quarter where that comes is that a couple of hundred million dollars in inventory or anything that could help us get that fourth quarter number right? Varun Laroyia : Yes, absolutely. I think it's a great question. And as I called out in the second quarter, and then also at Investor Day last month, and then earlier this morning, the working capital conversion as of now is running significantly higher, essentially proving that the business model that LKQ operates, has the ability to generate significant amounts of free cash has been proven yet again. With regards to the fourth quarter, given as to how revenue trends are coming through, we do see ourselves investing in inventory specifically. And again, it's broad based, but largely within our specialty segments, which essentially has been constrained up to a certain point with regards to inventory availability. It is flowing at this point of time, but that clearly is the one key priority that we are pushing pretty hard on. And certainly it'll be the inventory build for a few reasons, Brian. One, we are significantly lower than where the revenue is currently trending. We do expect the balance sheet to also flex based on revenue. But as you know, revenue is really a little bit better than where the inventory levels are. We do not have any fill rate issues. We do not have any stock outs, but we certainly want to maintain our best in class and class leading fill rates and service levels. So that is something that we are not willing to compromise on. So really, from that perspective, as I called out this morning also, we will be delivering at least a minimum of $900 million of free cash flow for the full year, a year ago, it was roughly about 800 million. So that certainly makes sense with regards to a double-digit conversion. And then the final issue really is, as you think about our key selling season, it is the first and the second quarter. And so, now is the time when we need to rebuild the inventory levels for that seasonal uptick as we head into the winter. So yes, we will see some trade working capital get back and really it will be within the inventory side. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Kennison, R.W. Baird. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning, Craig. Craig Kennison : I wanted to -- hey Nick, good morning. I wanted to ask about just the pandemic here. I mean, it's been particularly hard on small businesses. I'm curious what you see as your competitive change in position here? I'm sure you've got some small competitors that are struggling, but then also you've got some customers here who are also small businesses who also may be struggling and just wondering how all of that dynamic plays out maybe in 2021 as things hopefully normalize? Dominick Zarcone : Yes, I wish I had a crystal ball Craig. The reality is, is all going to depend on what the governments around the globe do, not only as it relates to controlling the pandemic vis-\u00e0-vis restrictions on mobility which obviously as we saw in the second and third quarter have a negative impact. The overall demand in our industry and that hits not only distributors like ourselves, but it also hits our customers. And also what they do from an economic stimulus perspective, the reality is we saw some of our competitors early in the pandemic shut their doors for a couple of weeks and almost as soon as the payroll protection plan money got distributed. They opened back up, but that tells you kind of how much on the line some of those smaller businesses are being able to keep the doors open. If there are significant restrictions on mobility and such a demand for repair services and related parts is down and there is no government support. Well that's going to really put the smaller business at risk. If the governments come along with another big funding if you will, to help businesses stay afloat that will obviously mitigate. What we've seen across the globe is not a rash of people going out of business, but we know for a fact like in the UK, market demand in the third quarter was down. Our organic revenue in the UK was up. So we're taking share and we believe that the larger, well capitalized businesses are doing okay in this environment, and the smaller undercapitalized businesses are going to continue to struggle. So the answer to your question Craig, it all depends on how deep the restrictions are on mobility and what kind of programs are in place, particularly for smaller businesses by the governments to keep them going. Operator : Our next question is from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning guys. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning, Bret. Varun Laroyia : Good morning. Bret Jordan : Hey, with another quarter of accounts payable experience under your belt Varun, I guess could you give us a feeling where you think you might be able to get your payables ratio in Europe and obviously I guess your aggregate AP is like 37%, but what do think your total payables ratio could be companywide as you sort of run this program forward? Varun Laroyia : Yes listen, great question and very happy with the way the payable program is coming along in Europe. Both the formal vendor financing improved but also the ongoing discussions with our supplier community. We keep ramping that piece up. We've seen some benefit in the current physical year, but really where we expect to see a lot of those negotiations come to fruition will be in 2021. And again, it is not everything going to the formal vendor financing program in a number of cases Bret we actually have our supplier basically giving us what we're looking for from an extended event time perspective in any case. Over all things are moving in the right direction. All I'll say is there is still tremendous opportunity within our European segment. Our teams are working hard on that front. We have prioritized the top forty suppliers and those discussions have come though really strongly. There is still a large portion of the remainder of calls in Europe to actually come through. In terms of giving you an absolute number, this is a multiyear program and despite the fact I know who should be clamoring to find to get a target number that we are chasing. Listen, it is one step at a time in many ways this is the first time it has been done across the European continent in our industry and I am glad with we now have a partner that is also pushing account on that front in the two largest protagonist across the European continent. So we know we are not alone on that front. Great progress being made and we keep resetting the bar with regards to where we expect this program to end up. Operator : Our next question is from Stephanie Benjamin of Truist. Stephanie Benjamin : Hi, you guys have noted, first thing analysts say, but again today that you reshuffled some of your margin improvement initiatives in Europe and delayed some by ERP but accelerated others. Is this updated strategy kind of less reliant on the top line improvement? I'm just trying to get a sense of okay you know, worst case scenario, you are -- meaningful walk down, how these initiatives can still be realized even at a tougher top line environment? Thanks. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning, Stephanie and good question. The reality is, it is a combination of both, right. I mean some of the things that we're doing clearly we are going to be moving towards a shared service center, that's really not dependent on revenue flow in any given quarter. That's all about just trying to really get rid of some duplicative costs that are being incurred across the platform currently and pull them all together in a single spot. And again that's one of those items that we mentioned back on September 10, that we're pulling forward in the overall plan. Other items like procurement benefits, there is a relatively direct connection to revenue, because as revenue goes up, our procurement in our inventories need to go up to support that higher level of revenue, which means our supplier rebates and the like go up. If revenue goes down, we're buying a little bit less from the suppliers and our rebates go down. And so that's -- so some of it is not impacted by revenue and the things that are totally under our control we're trying to move forward. Other things have a connection to revenues. So it is a little bit of a mixed bag. As of now like I indicated, we are comfortable with both the magnitude and the cadence of the margin developments and forecast that we provided during the Analyst Day about 50 days ago. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Daniel Imbro : A followup guys. Varun I wanted to touch on the call side of the equation, you mentioned in your segment discussion cost are all increasing. I think in the slide you said you increased your third party freight exposure. Can you talk about what potential offsets you have to really mitigate that risk and maybe can you compare where you are at today versus where we were at in the last freight cycle in 2017, when it was a pretty big headwind to margins for you guys, maybe just compare the two situations? Thanks. Dominick Zarcone : Yes, absolutely. And yes, we are seeing an increase in freight. Freight is actually impacting both our calls. If you think about North America, aftermarket supplies coming in from Taiwan, Daniel, we have seen a spike in the spot rates for ocean freight. So that has spiked. We're still able to get our product service and no issues from inventory availability. We're actually getting it through, but yes, we have seen a spike in spot rates on that front. I think the other piece that probably, I'll point you toward is, you can see how the big freight forwarders and carriers in the United States, but also the same folks in Europe, the UPS and FedEx of this world they are essentially are also doing incredibly well and they have taken their charges up. The final one really is, we are seeing an uptick in e-commerce and online purchases. So from that perspective, there is some tightness in demand out there. The ongoing challenge of finding delivery drivers, it's no different to others within our industry or for that matter, anyone else within the distribution space, per se. And so from that perspective, what we have done from call it the first quarter 2018, where we saw this piece initially, we obviously did become more efficient with regards to the amount of product that was being shuttled around. And where it was being transported on a cross country basis, for example, to kind of keep our fill rates up. The example I gave was, from Q1 '18, where revenue was up like just under $400 million and all it really kind of got us was about $5 million of incremental segment EBITDA. We've obviously put those learning\u2019s into place. And yes, there are certain charges that we do apply as and when those are necessitated. So we're certainly mitigating a lot of it through the learning\u2019s of the past couple of years. But clearly, there is an uptick on that front, and our teams with regards to route optimization, our road net proliferation across the network or for that matter, the number of deliveries that end up taking place, all of that is being worked into the equation. So really happy with the way our segment teams, in fact, all three segment teams are dealing with this spike in inflated delivery costs. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Nick Zarcone for any closing remarks. Dominick Zarcone : Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on this call. Again, we believe we've reported just terrific results here in the third quarter of 2020. We are working hard to make sure that we can do everything under our control to deal with the impact of the pandemic, both obviously what's occurred thus far and what may ever lie ahead for the globe going forward. You can trust that we are going to be extremely focused on our cost structure and continuing to generate cash. On that I want to give a huge thank you to everybody on the LKQ team because it has absolutely been a huge team effort to get us where we are at today. And lastly, we started off right before this call was a piece of birthday cake for none other than Joe Boutross, whose birthday is today. So Joe, Happy Birthday to you. I know most of the folks on the call know you well, and I'm sure they send their best wishes. So we will talk again after the fourth quarter results, and we appreciate your attention. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Chris and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the LKQ Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations for LKQ Corporation. You may begin your conference. Joe Boutross : Thank you, Operator. Good morning everyone, and welcome to LKQ's fourth quarter and full-year 2020 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today, and as normal, we're planning to file our 10-K in the next few days. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe, and welcome to everybody on the call. This morning I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter, and then, Varun, will dive into the financial details and discuss our 2021 outlook before I come back with a few closing remarks. A year-ago on this call, we mentioned the Coronavirus a couple of times, mostly related to supply chain considerations. With a year of hindsight, I can safely say that we, like the rest of the world, vastly underestimated the impact that COVID-19 would have on our way of life. I want to express my condolences to all those who have suffered a personal loss of this unfortunate pandemic. And my sincere thanks to all those on the frontline, the doctors, nurses, first responders, teachers, and all those putting themselves at risk to serve their community. We simply cannot thank you enough. During the fourth quarter, we faced the second wave of the pandemic and related restrictions on mobility. Yet, we still produced very strong results, which were materially ahead of our expectations when we chatted with you on our third quarter call. As we mentioned at the outset of 2020, and reiterated throughout the pandemic, we were focused on a few key initiatives. And I'm proud to say our segment teams again embraced and executed on many of these initiatives, not only in the fourth quarter, but for all of 2020. And let me restate our key initiatives, which continue to be central to our culture and our objectives as we've entered 2021. First, we'll continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model; second, we'll continue to focus on profitable revenue and sustainable margin expansion; third, we'll continue to drive high-levels of cash flow, which in turn will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy; and fourth, we'll continue to invest in our future. We have three market-leading businesses and the benefit of the structure shined brightly during 2020. Each business made significant progress on its goal and the diversity of markets and customers helps to balance out some of the ebbs and flows impacting any individual business. Alongside these operating initiatives the continued build-out of a comprehensive ESG program is a key focus for the organization on a go-forward basis. We've made tremendous progress and I'm pleased to announce that we will be releasing our inaugural Corporate Sustainability Report in the second quarter of this year. While this will be our first formal report, we have been an environmental leader since the day we were founded in 1998, as a salvage dispenser and recycler of passenger vehicles. Today, we're the largest global recycler of vehicles having processed over 810,000 cars and trucks in 2020. While we're widely known for our recycling, and environmental stewardship, we also have a long history of responsible and thoughtful social and governance practices, which we look forward to highlighting in the upcoming months. Now on to the quarter. As noted on Slide 4, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $3 billion, a decline of 1.9% from the comparable period of 2019. Parts and services organic revenue declined 5.2% in the quarter, and 6.1% on a per day basis. Net income during the fourth quarter was $180 million, an increase of 29% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.59, an increase of 28% year-over-year. On an adjusted basis, net income was $212 million, an increase of 27% over 2019. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.69, an increase of 28% year-over-year. So let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. Slide 5 sets forth the monthly revenue trends from October through January and it's quite clear that we didn't witness any change to the upside either in North America or in Europe. There were simply no meaningful catalyst to reverse the ongoing constraints on mobility. We're encouraged by the initial rollout of the vaccine in the U.S. and certain parts of Europe. But there still remains uncertainty about virus resurgence that same distribution, fiscal stimulus and geopolitical risk. As we come through and further relief from the stay-at-home mandates, we should see some positive movement in mobility. We're cautiously optimistic that we may see a slight recovery in demand towards the second half of this year. As you'll know from Slide 6, organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment declined 13.7% in the quarter. While still down on a year-over-year basis, we continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC, collision and liability related auto claims declined 27% in the fourth quarter. Faced with year-over-year organic declines in parts and services revenue in each quarter of 2020, the North American team used its agility and decisiveness to protect the business by focusing on profitability, embracing various KPIs to drive efficiency, and aggressively rightsizing the cost structure to be aligned with the revenue trends. These actions contributed North America having its highest annual EBITDA margins in the history of the company. Moving to our European segment, organic revenue for parts and services in the fourth quarter declined 3.1%. Demand trends softened sequentially in the fourth quarter as a second wave of lockdown provisions were enacted across all of our European regions with larger impacts in November and December. Most of our regional operations experienced similar revenue declines in the quarter, except for Italy, which struggled. As we articulated at our Investor Day in September of last year, we continue to execute on our 1 LKQ Europe program. Of note during 2020 we added significant talent to the European team including new operating leaders in Italy, the Benelux region, and Central and Eastern Europe. We recruited a new CFO and added new positions of Controller, Head of HR, VP of Strategy and several other positions. Our shared services effort is progressing well with a new center located in Poland that should become operational in the second half of 2021, and we're also currently leveraging our Bangalore campus. Our pan-European ERP initial implementation was successfully completed at Rhiag, Switzerland and we expect to go live with Rhiag Italy in mid-2021. Our team is actively focused on driving permanent reductions in SG&A as available government support diminishes. Our vendor financing program is coming along really well and our LKQ Europe head office in Zurich, Switzerland, was occupied beginning of January 2021. Lastly on Europe, this time last year, I mentioned that we began construction on our new Central Distribution Center or CDC for our Fource business in the Benelux region. Today, I'm happy to report that the keys have just been turned over and our team is starting logistical and operational phases of the build-out. So logistical layout is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021, after which LKQ Fource will enter the testing phase. At the end of this year, we will begin using the shuttle system and the new software. During 2022, we'll begin to migrate the activities in the four existing distribution centers over to the new CDC. As part of LKQ's sustainability agenda, the roof of this new building is fully equipped with solar panels, making the building completely energy self-sufficient. The building is also completely gas free, and will provide sufficient charging infrastructure for plenty of electric vehicles. Additionally, the large number of windows in the building provides plenty of natural light, creating an attractive work environment for our team. Now let's move on to the Specialty segment. During Q4, Specialty reported organic revenue growth of 16.6%, performance well above our expectations and represents the highest quarterly organic revenue growth since the closing of our acquisition of Keystone Automotive operations back in 2014. A primary factor driving this tremendous performance is the ongoing demand for RV Parts, a trend we anticipate will continue as the growth in new unit RV sales will result in a larger RV part and that will inevitably need more replacement parts as those vehicles work through their lifecycle. No one is better positioned to take advantage of that opportunity than LKQ. Also driving the performance with demand of our dropship business and consistent with the industry strong demand for our worn products. From a corporate development perspective, in 2020, our team did a fantastic job of focusing their efforts on rationalizing our asset base in divesting non-core assets. In 2020, we completed four divestiture transactions, all of which related to European assets that came along with the 2018 Stahlgruber acquisition. As you all know, vehicle technology continues to lead to more complex repairs and to be positioned at the forefront of this trend, we have made strategic acquisitions in the diagnostic space. Since acquiring Elite Electronics and VeTech Automotive Electronics in 2019, we have grown to become the largest U.S. provider of mobile on-site vehicle services to the automotive collision repairs, mechanical repairs, and the national fleets. This past January, we combined the two mobile automotive services together under a single brand known as Elitek Vehicle Services. We remain confident that we'll continue to increase our market share and brand awareness within this unique and rapidly growing market. And yes, we're just scratching the surface on the opportunities ahead during these exciting times for passenger and commercial vehicle design. As the car park evolves, we have a tremendous opportunity to leverage our distribution network to increase our product and service offerings to capture the growth in hybrids and EVs. Our strategy and development teams continue to identify new markets and products to pursue some of which we touched on during our Investor Day back in September.  No one in my opinion is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than LKQ as we have the people, the network, the scale and the capital to be successful. And I'll now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run you through the details of the segment results. Varun Laroyia : Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. While there is a lot to share from our fourth quarter results, full-year 2020, and outlook for 2021, I'll keep my prepared comments brief, as there is a lot more detail in the accompanying earnings presentation. While 2020 proved to be an extremely challenging year for a variety of reasons, LKQ's resilience shone through in tough times, as evidenced by the following highlights : one, record high annual earnings per share, including the two highest quarterly results in the company's history, those being the third and the fourth quarter; two, record high annual segment EBITDA margin for North America and for the company since 2015; three, record free cash flow at well over $1 billion, the first time we've exceeded $1 billion, and now the third in a row, record free cash flow year in the company's history; and finally, net leverage dropped to 1.9 times, the first time it's been below two times since 2015, which was well before the Rhiag, PGW, Stahlgruber and several other acquisitions. To put these results in perspective, consider we beat the mid-point of our pre-COVID adjusted EPS and cash flow guidance despite falling well short of our organic revenue growth range of 0.5% to 2.5%. In dollar terms, that's over $1 billion shortfall on revenue relative to our original guidance at the mid-point. Our profitability and cash flow results are a testament to the ongoing margin and cash programs that we accelerated and actions we prioritized at the onset of the lockdown measures last March. Now we all know such outcomes don't happen by accident. And so a massive thank you to all my LKQ colleagues for their tireless efforts over the last year to deliver a truly outstanding outcome for our company, customers, suppliers, and several other stakeholders, while persevering through the ongoing pandemic. I'll now cover the fourth quarter financial highlights and liquidity before sharing our thoughts on the outlook for 2021. As you can see on Slide 11, North America continued to deliver in the fourth quarter with segment EBITDA margin up 420 basis points over the prior-year, and 60 basis points sequentially. Permanent cost savings in overhead expenses was the primary driver of the improvement and precious metal prices remain and gave us a healthy tailwind for the quarter, with an estimated $18 million year-over-year benefit on gross margins. Moving over to Slide 12, Europe produced another solid quarter with an 8.6% segment EBITDA margin, up 100 basis points relative to a year-ago, largely due to operating expense reductions. Importantly, Europe generated an 8.9% segment EBITDA margin for the second half, which is solidly above the 8% to 8.5% range provided at last September's Investor Day and represents good progress towards delivering on the 1 LKQ program. And these results include higher year-over-year transmission expenses. Despite the negative effects of the second wave of COVID, at this time, we remain comfortable with our 2021 projection of segment EBITDA margin of 9.2% to 10.3% for the segment. With Specialty on Slide 13, Nick highlighted the impressive 16.6% organic growth in the fourth quarter. Gross margin was down 40 basis points owing to unfavorable movements in vendor and customer rebates, though some of the fluctuation is timing, as we had positive true-ups from the fourth quarter activity a year-ago and negative impact this year with the volume increase. Overhead expenses were favorable by 50 basis points and would have been more without the negative effects of about 80 basis points from incentive compensation adjustments. Now onto cash flow and liquidity. Q4 was yet another successful quarter for cash flow generation. We added a further $309 million in operating cash flows, as we continued to benefit from the trade working capital programs we've been driving since 2018. Benefits from receivables and payables offset the expected growth in inventory, although the inventory rebuild wasn't as high, as previously anticipated, due to supplier delivery challenges. As shown on Slide 14, operating cash flows were $1.4 billion for the year and CapEx cash outlays were $173 million. The resulting free cash flow and cash on hand was used to pay down almost $1.4 billion in debt for the year. We're very pleased with the trend in EBITDA to free cash conversion, as presented on Slide 15. Though as I previously highlighted, the 2020 ratio of 98% just isn't sustainable as reflects inventory levels by over $400 million to align with demand forecasts. As growth returns, we plan to invest in inventory levels, though largely offset by the ongoing vendor financing program to ensure we maintain our best in class service levels and fill rates. On Slide 16, you can see the progress we've made this year to strengthen our liquidity position. I want to specifically highlight the net leverage ratio, which has decreased to 1.9 times from 2.6 times at the end of 2019, and is in line with our target net leverage of approximately two times. We're very comfortable with our liquidity position, including the availability and cost of funds and believe we're very well positioned in our pursuit of investment grade metrics. As mentioned last October, we restarted our share repurchase program after the third quarter earnings call. During the quarter, we repurchased roughly $30 million of LKQ shares for a total investment of $117 million for the year. We had $531 million available on our authorization as of the year-end. So now I'll close with our thoughts on 2021. As COVID uncertainties remain, we're not providing full financial guidance for the year at this time. We'll revisit this position as the year progresses and we have greater clarity on the vaccine rollout and its impact on the duration and severity of the pandemic. We're comfortable providing the following statements, all of which are based on the assumption that one, extreme mobility restrictions beyond what are currently in place are not re-implemented in our major markets; and two, scrapping precious metal prices and foreign exchange rates continue near their recent levels. So a few points to highlight. First, we believe that parts and services revenue will be higher on a full-year basis in 2021, though down in the first quarter relative to 2020. We anticipate that the revenue recovery will accelerate as vaccines are distributed more broadly and mobility restrictions falloff. So, we do not expect to return to our 2019 annual revenue figure until sometime in 2022. Please note that we have two fewer selling days in North America in 2021, one fewer in Q1 and the second in Q4. While Europe is flat with one fewer day in Q1 though that catches-up in the second quarter. The second point I'd like to highlight is with revenue growth and the ongoing benefits of a margin and operating expense programs, we expect our 2021 adjusted diluted earnings per share will be above the comparable figure for 2020. With that in mind, we're projecting an adjusted diluted EPS range of $2.65 to $2.85 with the mid-point of $2.75. On a GAAP EPS basis, this would be $2.40 to $2.60. Given the momentum of our European business in the second half of 2020 exceeding the upper end of the range provided last September, we're reaffirming the outlook for the European 2021 segment EBITDA margin range of 9.2% to 10.3%. Four, we project that free cash flow for the full-year 2021 will be a minimum of $800 million. While the absolute number is lower than the 2020 figure, we've been very clear throughout this past year that 2020 was a strange year for cash generation as a result of the pandemic. As we aligned inventory levels to forecast the demand, our stock levels declined by well over $400 million, which in turn produced a significant cash inflow. However, we're going to get some of the inflow back in 2021, as we replenish our inventory levels to support the anticipated revenue growth. Some of the investment in inventory will be offset by improvements engaged payables resulting from vendor financing program, which we expect to yield more significant benefits in 2021, and in line with the target we had set out in September of 2019, when we launched the 1 LKQ program. And finally, on capital expenditures, we plan to get back to our normal level of 2% to 2.25% of revenue. All of these factors will produce a lower free cash demand in 2020. But importantly, will still put us within our target conversion range of 55% to 60% for free cash flow to EBITDA, widely considered to be best in class for industrial distribution companies. Thank you once again for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Varun for that financial overview. In closing, if you asked me in late March 2020, after the onset of the pandemic, predict the financial results that we would achieve in 2020, and how we end-up the year, I would likely have not even come close to guessing at such a remarkable outcome. But the one thing I never question are the capabilities of my team. These results are a clear testament of the pride, dedication, resiliency and capabilities of the LKQ team members across the globe. One famous college football coach said ability is what you're capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. But it's the attitude that determines how well you do it. Despite the challenges and unknowns we face, it is the positive, nothing will stop us attitude that our 44,000 dedicated team members bring to work each day. And that carried us through the headwinds of 2020 that simultaneously generated favorable outcomes that allowed us to reach certain key milestones. We right sized the North American segment and generated record margins. We made solid progress on our 1 LKQ Europe program and generated higher second half margins than projected at our September 2020 Investor Day. The uniqueness of our diversified portfolio of businesses allowed us to benefit from the rising demand for RV replacement parts. We effectively managed our working capital and generated almost $1.3 billion in free cash flow, an annual record for the company. And the excellent free cash flow allowed us to pay down a record $1.4 billion of debt, reducing our leverage ratio below two times. We continued our Talent Acquisition initiatives by adding individuals to key roles across our broad and diversified portfolio of businesses. We made good progress on our global sustainability programs and we continue to provide the best-in-class customer service, in spite of the pandemic and importantly, all while focusing on the health and safety of our team. As I've said both internally and externally, we'll come out of this pandemic period, a stronger, better organization, further solidifying our market leading position. And with that operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Craig Kennison of Baird. Your line is open. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on navigating a tough year. My question is on inflation here, just curious how your business is set-up to absorb inflation and where you see your most important sensitivities, whether it's gas prices, metals or other factors? Varun Laroyia : Good Morning, Craig. It's Varun out here. Absolutely, I think it's a great question. And I'd say over the past couple of months, we've especially seen inflation move up, whether it be ocean freight, which we know is running at record high for the moment, we know wages, here in the U.S., it's difficult to find delivery drivers. So I think you kind of get the message in terms of the inflationary pressures that are building up, and also with oil prices now moving up in the higher 50s, close to $60 a barrel in any case. We have navigated, as you know, not just this past quarter, but I'd say starting 2018, when we put in place our margin programs, and obviously kind of accelerated our OpEx program, in conjunction with a cash program, our teams have navigated those inflationary pressures pretty darn well. We're proud of what they do. And, we believe we have the ability to continue to drive a number of the permanent cost reductions that our North America business has taken the lead on, but I do know that our European team is also following up with. So long story short, yes, are there inflationary pressures, absolutely. Are we well set up to undertake those inflationary pressures? Yes, up to a certain point. It really depends in terms of what kind of comes through the next call it, several weeks such but we do expect a number of these inflationary pressures to begin to ease-up for example, a notion phrase, as the MTs get back to the appropriate positions, back up in Asia, and things along those lines. Nick, anything to add from your end? Nick Zarcone : No, I think that was great, Varun. Varun Laroyia : And, Craig, if there's any follow-up question, we're happy to kind of take it now. Or if you'd like to get back in the queue, we can certainly take it there also. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Stember of CL King. Your line is open. Scott Stember : Good morning, guys. And I echo to Craig's comments on a great job navigating the very tough year. Nick Zarcone : Thank you. Varun Laroyia : Thank you. Scott Stember : Let me talk about the North American business, I know that much of this is based on mileage driven and people getting out in mobility. But we look out the window, the weather has been quite awful the last six weeks, I'm trying to figure out whether you guys have seen any change in demand there. And if you think that maybe this could be a tail, a potential tail to that, as we go from the first and then to the second quarter? Nick Zarcone : Great question, Scott. And again on the weather has been nasty particularly the last couple of weeks. I'm actually sitting in Austin, because I got iced-in going back the Sunday. The reality is our business is very much driven by total miles driven. And as you saw in the chart, we included in the earnings deck, kind of the revenue trends, not just for fourth quarter, but also for January. And you could see that January kind of picked-off where September left-off or picked-up where December left-off, right. So until there's a really meaningful movement in mobility, we think we're going to be kind of in this level of activity. Ultimately, we've gotten a number of questions in the past about what's going to drive an increase in mobility and clearly getting through the pandemic, and people getting out of their homes and returning to their daily lives, this will be the biggest impact. We don't believe that everyone is going to work-from-home forever. We don't think everybody on this call to permanently be working from home. And while we've all become fairly efficient and be productive in the working from home, there's clearly a lack of community that is hard on organizations. And we may not get back to 100% of folks being back in the office. But we do think a number of folks will get back into the office. We think kids are going to get back into school. And when all that happens, we think the use of public transportation will remain depressed for a longer period of time, just because of the safety issues related to the virus and the life. So as some of those workers begin to head into the office or back into their workplaces, those who took public transportation may opt to take private transportation, which means instead of hopping on a train or a bus, they're going to hop in a car. So, we're cautiously optimistic that miles driven will move back north and that will help our business. Clearly with the ice storms in the like have hit the last couple of weeks throughout the United States that should ultimately create demand for our business. I'll tell you here in Texas and based on the new stories of the pile-ups in Dallas and Austin and Houston, that is probably going to create a bigger opportunity from a salvage buying perspective and a parts perspective because lot of those salvages are anticipated when they sent an ice storm 40 miles an hour. But again we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that we'll get back to more normal levels of miles driven which will lead to a more the normal level of demand. It's going to take some time, we don't think it\u2019s going to just pop back in the second or third quarter but hopefully by 2022, we'll be back at historical levels of miles driven. Scott Stember : Got it. And then last question on the Specialty side, you talked about RVs really leading the way I guess that's more retail driven. But you also last year like expanded your warranty program, could you talk about how that contributed and how that probably will contribute even more as we move through the next year or two more RVs on the road, many of which will potentially be easily built and just more, just opportunities on that side? Nick Zarcone : Yes, absolutely. I mean, there was an enhancement, I think we noticed a massive shift in discretionary spending, away from things like restaurants and lodging and air travel, theaters, sporting events, all those group events right. And outdoor recreation camping has absolutely been a huge beneficiary of that shift in discretionary spending. Our RV business historically has not been tied to the RV SAR in any particular year. It has been very highly correlated to campground spending. In 2020, the OEMs produced about 425,000 RV units which was a great year; the expectation for 2021 is over a half a million units will be all-time record high. The key there is that the size of a part, the number of RVs in the part is expanding. And that's great for the Specialty business, as all those incremental units that will be on the road for years and years to come will create demand for the parts that we sell. So even if the SAR ultimately settles down over the next two or three years, the units are still going to be on the road, in that larger base is going to provide a great opportunity for us to sell profitably parts for many years to come. So the growth may ultimately slow down. We don't think we're going to continue to grow at 16% year-over-year like we did in the fourth quarter. But we don't anticipate substantial declines in the overall revenue base. Operator : Your next question comes from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Your line is open. Bret Jordan : Sort of big picture question here around parts demand for EVs. And obviously Europe's got a jump on it; you did a lot of business in Norway. But could you talk a little bit about how you see the different parts that versus internal combustion and what this does to demand down the road long-term? Nick Zarcone : Sure. And it's a great question, obviously, one that's been kind of floating around the industry now for the better part of the year. The reality is we believe that the supply chain, really the manufacturers of the EV parts will ultimately look alike -- look pretty much the same as the supply chain for internal combustion engine. Now, there's going to be a lot of overlap in suppliers, and we fully anticipate that some of the bigger vendors like Bosch, or Continental or Shutter will absolutely develop parts for electric vehicles. And while we're going to start with the OEMs as their focus, what they know today is that their current aftermarket business makes better profit margins than their OE parts business. And so it won't be long before they take that OE manufacturing capacity and start making parts for the aftermarket. We'd have very strong relationships with all those vendors. We got the leading distribution capabilities as related to Europe and it's a natural fit for us to do business together. Secondly, a lot of the conversion over the next 10 years or so, Bret, on electrification is going to come through hybrids. And hybrid, as you know, is a combination of an internal combustion engine and electric motor. And the opportunity for LKQ there is two-fold. First, there's all sorts of new part types that we would be able to sell, things like Stanley [ph] coolant -- coolant fans, electric air conditioning compressors, electric driven motor inverter coolers, I mean just a whole new set of products that we can ultimately distribute. And then what we also know is that hybrid parts related to the internal combustion engine side of the power train are more expensive than similar parts on a non-hybrid car. So like an AC compressor for a hybrid vehicle, and we talked about this during our Investor Day back in September, can be three times as expensive as an AC compressor for a normal just internal combustion engine car, a coolant pump could be five or six times more expensive. So we think there's a good opportunity for us to distribute those parts as well, and they're higher value parts. And then, lastly, we think the big opportunity ultimately as it relates to EVs is the battery, just like the engine is the most valuable part of a car that has an internal combustion engine, the battery is the most valuable part on an EV. And batteries have an expiring life; they're not going to go on forever, the car's going to be around a lot longer than that initial battery. And so there will be opportunities, we believe for us to remanufacture EV batteries, because generally it's not the whole battery that goes bad at once. But it's just a couple of cells. And it's going to be too expensive to replace the whole battery. So we think there is just a bundle of good opportunities for us in the future, as it relates to the electrification of the car part. Bret Jordan : Thanks. Thanks for that. And a question on the technology as well. So you're standing in diagnostics program that you just talked about? Could you sort of talk about the revenue expectations and maybe the margin structure of a more service-based business like Elitek? Nick Zarcone : Yes. So this industry is nascent. It's pretty small. The typical competitor is somewhere between 6 and 12 technicians that have banded together to provide services to the marketplace. Okay. Our business is just shy of the $50 million mark today, and it's growing. The great thing about the services business, it has better EBITDA margins than our North American parts business. And so that should help as that business continues to grow. Now, we're not going to be able to grow that business by necessarily through acquisition to gain significant scale, because like I said, most of these operators are tiny, they're tiny. So we'll buy and look to buy perhaps some of the larger groups, even though they're still pretty small, and rollout on a Greenfield basis by really educating technicians and then putting them out in the field as part of our Elitek service offering. So we're excited about the business. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephanie Benjamin with Truist. Your line is open. Stephanie Benjamin : Congratulations again, in a really nice year. I wanted to touch on, you kind of brought up in the beginning of your prepared remarks that really the fourth quarter exceeded your expectations, and even kind of how you outlined things, the last time we spoke. We'd love to hear some color about what moved in your direction during the quarter and kind of how you're seeing things turned out in beginning of 2021? Thanks. Nick Zarcone : Sure, great question. The revenue didn't help us. And if you go back to that page, when we laid out the last four months, you can see that say for the Specialty Group, which just rocked during the fourth quarter, the revenue in both North America and Europe were down pretty consistently from the prior-year levels. So Europe is doing better than North America because of our collision focus here. So really wasn't revenue that lead to the outperformance, Stephanie, it was our operating margin. We've had good improvement on the gross margin line. And while on a consolidated basis, it looks like gross margins came in a couple basis points. That's just a mix shift, because the North American business has margins north of 46%, the Specialty business has margins around 28% and the high margin business kind of falling 13% and the low margin, gross margin business dropping 16%. So you shouldn't take anything from that at all. The key is the operating leverage that we got out of that. Each of our segments worked hard to get the cost structure to reflect the current state of demand. And we're very proud of what our folks have done. Unfortunately, a lot of that has come on the back of labor. We're down substantially from a total number of employees today versus what we were a year-ago. But that's what just what attract to right size the business. And those are permanent reductions, we're going to be very cautious to add people and/or expense back to the SG&A line until we see the revenue rebound. And then we'll need to add some people back just to keep our customer service levels where they need to be. So think about the intense focus on controlling our costs, because we're in an environment where we don't necessarily control our revenue. Stephanie Benjamin : Absolutely, that's really helpful. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Gary Prestopino of Barrington Research. Your line is open. Gary Prestopino : Good morning, everyone. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Garry. Gary Prestopino : Couple of questions here. Varun, what is your priority for your free cash flow? I assume you would be paying down debt this year? Varun Laroyia : Yes, I think it's a great question, Gary. Simply put, if you kind of go back to our Investor Day presentation from September. So probably about four, five, six months ago, we were very clear in terms of; we expected our free cash flow generation on a sustainable basis to kind of continue. We kind of reset the overall business model. So that kind of starting off is a great option to have as a business. We've always said that the key priority is investing in our own business. So capital expenditures will be kind of priority number one. Following that, we've set high synergy tuck-ins and building up critical capabilities. There was a question earlier on the call about scanning and diagnostics. That is a business that we\u2019re investing heavily into. Again, as Nick said they are very small transactions, 6 to 12 technicians, on a market-by-market basis. So certainly wherever we have the ability we certainly acquiring those but really also supplementing it with capital expenditures to kind of expand that specific service. We do not have any large platform transactions on the horizon. We do not see we need those at this point of time, which essentially leads us to a point where the excess free cash flow really would go towards either debt pay down, although, as you've seen, we've certainly made a tremendous amount of progress being at $1.04 billion in 2020, we're well within our target leverage at this stage of time. So really, it becomes the highest return on capital opportunities, and we still believe that our shares are undervalued. And we certainly see no reason given the authorization we have from the board to be able to repurchase our stock. Gary Prestopino : Okay, thank you. And then just, just, lastly in terms of, what you've done with the cost structure and what you can do obviously, in the future, as you move from an acquisition growth strategy to more of just integrating and bettering your operations, do you every year, I would assume you're really pushing your divisional heads to get the costs down. And I just wondered, where is the biggest component of costs going to come out in the future for the company, and I assume you're going through a program every year, we need to get our costs better in line on an annual basis? Varun Laroyia : Absolutely, Gary, it's Varun out here. Two years ago, as you rightly pointed out, we pivoted to an operational excellence mode. And ever since that, we've essentially been driving productivity through integration. And these programs you really see in terms of how our North American business has taken the lead on that front. Just look at the fourth quarter operating expenses, that business, yes, we certainly had challenges in terms of what the VMT has been in, so collision rates have come down. But as we think about how our collision business has performed relative to the data we're getting in from CCC, we're performing much better than what the repairable claims are out there. So that's kind of good. But really, it is the productivity piece of it that our North American leadership team has just did an outstanding job. You then kind of move over to say for example, the next large component of our overall business, and that's in Europe. And Europe also has kind of begun to make some progress, they'll be setting so some operating expenses come down in the fourth quarter, there's a lot more productivity to go get out there. And that really is the overall 1 LKQ program. We need to make investments out there, for example in the European ERP program, setting up a back office for example, that really the longer-term productivity really is from our European business. And that is something that we know our European team has a laser like focus in making sure that they certainly follow from, within the portfolio companies, as we shared best practices between our businesses and our divisions, I know our North American leadership team has spent time with our European team also. It's just one thing Nick and I kind of pushing and pulling certain levers. But as the peers speak with one another, largely, it's the base similar business, it's the distribution business, and that certainly has helped a lot also. But yes, you're right, overall productivity programs, every business of ours, every function of ours has productivity programs to essentially offset the inflationary pressures that typically come around in any case, but it's the nimbleness and the agility that we're tremendously proud of, and that really came through in spades, with the onset of the pandemic. I hope that response to your question. Gary Prestopino : Sure, it does. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Your line is open. Daniel Imbro : Yes, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Nick Zarcone : Good morning. Daniel Imbro : I wanted to start on a broader supply chain question. Obviously, you mentioned varying time rates are much higher, there's a problem getting things over from overseas, how has that impacted your aftermarket supply here in North America. And related to that with limited supply at auction and potentially disruptions in the aftermarket side, do you think your supply chain can support the anticipated return to growth in North America? Or could that be a pinch point this year as you look forward? Varun Laroyia : Yes, listen Daniel, good morning to you, it's Varun out here. I think it's a great question. We've got tremendous vendor partners on the aftermarket side of the business, they have been tremendously supportive, not just now, but ever since we got into the business. So that's just kind of one thing. With regards to kind of ocean freight and the challenges associated with it, whether it be the number of carriers that are more outside of the Port of LA, Long Beach for example, or for that matter, getting those empty cans back to Asia to kind of get refilled and come over. We have long-term contracts with vessel providers, but also with certain brokers. So we're still being able to get space without -- while we're having to pay up for it, we still being able to get space for it on those carriers. And then the other one, as you probably know is LKQ has always had a class-leading inventory and fill rates. And so we've made sure that we always have the product. Yet, there are certain areas where we're having to run local or shuttles between within the region, for example, so we want to ship something from say New England to California. But say within the region, we're kind of making sure that our fill rates remain. So we do have the inventory, it may not always be in the right part. But we certainly learned a lot over the past few years in terms of making sure our fill rates remain. But at the same time, we're not kind of taking on excessive costs associated with it. Over time, we know that the Chinese New Year had kind of cost us certain splurge in terms of the amount of ocean freight that was coming over. We expect that to abate level in the coming weeks and months. But clearly that is a risk. But as I said previously, we had product, we have more product on the way in any case, we think this will even itself out as we return to a growth mode starting Q2, which is largely kind of easy comps but really getting back to growth in the second half of the year. Daniel Imbro : Okay, that's helpful. And then -- Nick Zarcone : Daniel, we just think we're better positioned than the typical competitor out there, given the size and scale, depth and breadth of the inventory coming into this. This time we're shipping is an issue. We'll be able to work our inventory to be a competitive advantage. Daniel Imbro : That's helpful. Thanks Nick. And then the related follow-up would be a follow-up on an earlier question on inflation. Obviously, cost inflation is coming and we just talked about it happening. Are you seeing any signs of being able to pass that through on like-for-like pricing amidst cost inflation? And if not, what do you think is going to take to see that revenue tailwind return considering the cost pressures right now feel pretty broad? Thanks. Nick Zarcone : Yes, listen again just to kind of add to what I had answered earlier in the call, Daniel, we are -- we have a dynamic pricing model. And we certainly make sure that, while we have a certain threshold, or at least a ceiling associated where OEM parts are, clearly if those kind of begin to move, that would certainly help. But we do know that our teams are doing a fantastic job on the pricing side. As I said previously, also our salvage business has been doing really well. From an aftermarket perspective, there is limited supply in the market. We do have the product. And listen, we want to help everybody, specifically the carriers and our customers to making sure we get the right parts at the right time. So associated with kind of having the product, the second one clearly is making sure that we're that much more productive in the cost that we've been able to take out initially what was temporarily in the second quarter, and kind of then switching that independent cost reductions. That is certainly working out well for the entire enterprise. But obviously, we can't wait for kind of growth to return. It certainly helps us get more of our folks back in the field. But as of now, we're happy with the way our teams are navigating the various puts and takes that are out there. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Butler of Stifel. Your line is open. Brian Butler : Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Nick Zarcone : No problem. Brian Butler : Just first one on the cash flow and outlook of the minimum kind of $800 million coming from the $1.3 billion that you saw in 2020, can you maybe break out the buckets that go from the $1.3 billion to $800 million? Obviously, inventory is a piece of it, you talked about DSOs is a little bit of an offset in CapEx. But could you give a little bit more color on that? Varun Laroyia : Yes, listen, it's actually very simple and it was in my prepared comments. During 2020, we essentially realigned our inventory base with what demand projections were. Our inventory balances came down by over $400 million. And that really is the kind of delta between call it the $1.3 billion and the minimum $800 million that we're talking about. Brian Butler : So it's all inventory. It's really, I'm guessing little bit of CapEx? Varun Laroyia : CapEx is about $100 million. Nick Zarcone : Yes. Varun Laroyia : It's basically inventory about over $400 million and CapEx is about $100 million. I mean that basically kind of $500 million right there from the $1.3 billion to the $800 million. Brian Butler : Okay, that's good. And then follow-up just on the kind of the pace of the growth kind of going into or through 2021, I expect first quarter remains kind of weak, based on the January revenue that we -- you showed, but how should we think about that kind of pace of growth for second quarter and then into the second half? Nick Zarcone : Yes, great question. So as you indicated, we're anticipating Q1 is going to be down year-over-year, largely because we started-off last January and February of 2020 very strong. And obviously, you can see the January numbers are down, February will be down and then March is an easier comparison. Second quarter will obviously be up because even if we just stay at these levels of revenue, the revenue came off so dramatically in Q4 last year, second quarter will be up. And then the third and fourth quarters, those are obviously hard to predict they're further away. We're anticipating a little bit of upward movement on a year-over-year basis. But again, not back fully to 2019 kinds of levels. Brian Butler : Great, thank you. Varun Laroyia : And just one additional piece to kind of highlight, we do have one less selling day in Q1 across the entire enterprise. So in North America, there's one fewer selling day in Q1, a second fewer selling day in the fourth quarter. And in Europe, we have one fewer selling day in Q1 but we make up that day in Q2 for the European business. So just to kind of think about, this is something we've talked about previously and just wanted to make sure that you had that into your models. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call to Mr. Zarcone. Nick Zarcone : Well, as always we greatly appreciate your time and attention. We know this is very busy for everybody on the call earnings season, lot going on. We appreciate your listening to our story. We're incredibly proud of what we've been able to deliver in 2020, particularly given all the challenges that companies around the globe have had to deal with and we had our fair share of challenges as well. The team I could not be more proud of, they came through beyond any expectations and I could not be more proud to be -- to work alongside all them. We look forward to sharing with everybody at the end of April when we will announce our first quarter results and again it's going to be more of the same, we're going to keep our head down, we're going to drive as much revenue out of the market that we can, but it's really going to be more focus on keeping our cost under control and generating cash. And with that, we'll bring the call to a close and hope you all have a good day and we'll speak again in April. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Chris, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the LKQ Corporation First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Joe Boutross : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ Web site at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today, and as normal, we're planning to file our 10-Q in the next few days. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning I will provide some high level comments related to our performance in the quarter, and then Varun will dive into the financial details, including our banner margin and free cash flow performance, as well as our improved 2021 outlook before I come back with a few closing remarks.  Wow, we've come a long way over the past 12 months. A year ago at this time, the threat of the pandemic had become a tremendous and painful reality. Immediately, our teams got into action with a key focus across the entire organization to right-size the cost structure and maximize cash flow.  In order to adjust to this new paradigm, our teams had to make some very difficult decisions to protect the long-term health of our company, and in the past three quarters have proven our ability to reset the cost structure of LKQ.  Our global leadership team firmly believed we would come out of the pandemic period stronger and a better organization, and our performance this past quarter absolutely confirms that belief.  Let me restate our key initiatives, which continue to be central to our culture and our objectives. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion.  Third, we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And finally, we will continue to invest in our future. As you can see from our results, our segment teams executed on each of these initiatives in the first quarter. Alongside these operating initiatives, the continued build out of a comprehensive ESG program is a key focus for the organization. As promised during our last earnings call, on April 6, we released our inaugural Corporate Sustainability Report. This report validates our long-term commitment to enhancing our ESG practices and will serve as a guidepost for the further embedding of ESG principles throughout our global operations.  Slide 16 of today's earnings deck provides a brief one page overview of the CSR report. If you have not already done so, I would highly encourage you to visit our Web site and download a copy of the full CSR. Now onto the quarter. Revenue for the first quarter was $3.17 billion, an increase of 5.7%, that\u2019s compared to $3 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Parts and services organic revenue in the first quarter of 2021 increased six-tenths of 1% on a reported basis and 2.2% on a per day basis.  While the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures decreased revenue by six-tenths of 1%, then foreign exchange rates increased revenue by 4.2%. Total parts and services revenue increased 4.2% in the quarter. The organic revenue growth for the quarter reflects the annualization of the initial pandemic impact last March. Through February, organic parts and services revenue was 4.4% lower on a per day basis. In March, organic parts and services revenue grew by 15.7% on a per day basis, recognizing we were coming off a lower comparable period. Other revenue grew 27% in the first quarter of 2021, driven by higher scrap steel and precious metal prices. While consolidated revenue is still running below pre-COVID levels, net income for the first quarter was $266 million as compared to $146 million last year, an increase of 83% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share for Q1 was $0.88, an increase of 83%. On an adjusted basis, net income in the first quarter was $286 million, a 62% increase year-over-year, while adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.94, a 65% increase.  Each of our segments achieved EBITDA margins well ahead of our expectations due to excellent execution, a continued focus on our cost structure, and with respect to North America, tailwinds from scrap and precious metals pricing.  When taken collectively, these strong performances allowed LKQ to record, record consolidated segment EBITDA margins of 14.2% in the first quarter. This was a 350 basis point increase relative to the first quarter of last year. Let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. Slide 5 sets forth the monthly revenue trends for the quarter. And as you can see, all segments were positive in March on a per day basis. Obviously, during the tail end of February and the entire month of March, we were working from an easier comp. But we also benefited as mobility began to gain ground in certain markets. Additionally, the penetration rate of the vaccine in the United States is encouraging. And as these trends gained ground in other key markets, we should begin to see a loosening of the stay-at-home mandates, and we would expect a gradual improvement in vehicle miles traveled, or VMT.  According to the U.S. Department of Energy, at the end of the second week of April, fuel consumption was 71% above the prior year and just 3% below that same week of 2019. According to the Apple Mobility Index, the trend in driving trips in our European markets was down early in the year relative to the third and fourth quarter levels of 2020. But as we progress through Q1, the index rebounded, and by the third week of April, the index had increased 33% from the first week of January. So, there are clearly some green shoots of momentum in VMT around the globe, albeit we're still below pre-COVID levels. Turning to North America. From Slide 6, you will note that organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment declined 8.4% in the quarter on a reported basis and 7.0% on a per day basis. While still down on a year-over-year basis, it is an improvement relative to Q4 of last year. We continue to outpace the market in North America, especially when you consider that industry data suggests that collision and liability related repairable auto claims declined approximately 14% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the prior period.  Relative to the competitive landscape, we are confident that we are gaining market share from small salvage and aftermarket operators that are typically capital constrained and facing lower inventory levels due to product availability and cost inflation.  Our strong balance sheet gives us the ability to continue to invest in our North American business, including inventory replenishment and also in various technologies and programs to further enhance the efficiency of our operations and the service experience for our customers. With capital constraints, many smaller competitors lack the flexibility to stay relevant and competitive.  During the first quarter, our North American operations benefited from the disruption to the OE component supply chain, which impacted the OE\u2019s ability to build major mechanical inventory. This lack of major mechanical inventory for the OEs combined with our robust levels of recycled and remanufactured engines and transmission products provided the opportunity for our North American business to gain share in the quarter. Our salvage operations have been extremely judicious in their procurement efforts and selling more parts from the vehicles we procure, enabling us to have stronger fulfillment rates than the industry average.  In North America during the first quarter, we continued our environmental stewardship efforts by processing 190,000 vehicles, resulting in, among other things, the recycling of 900,000 gallons of fuel, 491,000 gallons of waste oil, 482,000 tires and 176,000 batteries. During the first quarter, we also processed approximately 282,000 tons of scrap steel. Moving on to our European segment. Organic revenue for parts and services in the first quarter increased 30 basis points. As the largest pure-play distributor of aftermarket automotive parts in Europe, this is a solid start to 2021 even in the face of continuing COVID lockdowns in several regions of Europe.  Our regional operations experienced varying revenue performance in the quarter with positive year-over-year performance in Germany, Benelux and Eastern Europe with some softness in the UK, and Italy continuing to drag on the overall performance of this segment. Specific to the UK, in addition to our two-step distribution business of mechanical service parts, we operate a few other businesses, including our collision parts and coatings businesses, which registered materially lower growth than our two-step mechanical parts distribution business in the first quarter.  Importantly, with our corporate wide focus on profitable revenue, we spent the past year rationalizing the footprint of our UK business, which eliminated over 40 unprofitable branches, resulting in a small negative impact on revenue, but a significant improvement in EBITDA margins. Revenue growth from our ongoing mechanical service parts operations was positive in the quarter, while our data indicates the overall UK market was down on a year-over-year basis. In total, we are delighted with the performance of our UK operations.  Other items of note in Europe include the fact that we continue to add talent and expect the organization design elements of the 1 LKQ Europe program will be largely completed by the end of Q2. The Fource Central Distribution Center project remains right on track.  Our ERP implementation at Rhiag, Italy also remains on track for a Q2 go live, which will make it the first large platform company on our new European ERP system. And we continue to expand our payables optimization initiatives, which includes the vendor financing program.  Lastly on Europe, and consistent with our ESP programs, we recently launched an electric delivery vehicle trial for our UK and Republic of Ireland operations. The pilot will run for about six months, and will take into account the charging point infrastructure to identify branches with vans whose typical mileage is suited to the range and capability of an electric vehicle. LKQ is also considering pilot projects with fuel cell powered heavy trucks once those vehicles and filling stations become available.  Now let's move on to our specialty segment, which absolutely knocked the cover off the ball during the first quarter by reporting organic revenue growth of 30.9%. This represents the highest quarterly organic revenue growth since we bought this business in 2014, with Q4 of last year being the second highest quarter.  The primary factor driving this tremendous performance is the ongoing demand for RVs and RV parts. The RV industry association's February 2021 survey of manufacturers determined that total RV shipments increased 30%, making it the best February RV unit shipment total on record. This is good for LKQ on a longer term basis as a larger RV part should lead to more RV part sales in the future.  Also driving the specialty performance was the demand for light truck parts we offer, which during the first quarter increased 17% year-over-year, with strong demand for products installed on jeeps and pickup trucks. We believe that the third round of stimulus checks benefited our specialty business in the quarter. Across all of our segments, and like many others in vehicle parts distribution, we are witnessing some supply chain disruptions, which have led to incremental cost in freight, labor and cost of goods sold.  Related to ocean freight, the container capacity constraints that we first experienced last fall continues to be a challenge. Our supply chain teams across the globe are in constant communication with our suppliers, working to procure the products we need to maintain and grow our market share in each of our segments.  Importantly, we have witnessed minimal impact to our fulfillment and customer service levels and believe the inventory challenges are subsiding. As it relates to inflationary risk, we remain cautious near term. But as we progress through the year, we are expecting a continuing pandemic recovery, which should benefit each of our operating segments. Again, we expect to see continued inflation related to freight, labor and cost of goods sold. That said, as witnessed throughout 2020 and in the first quarter of this year, we have a number of levers that we can pull to help offset these inflationary risk, including price. From a corporate development perspective, in the first quarter, we acquired a diagnostics business that provides various mobile diagnostic and programming services to professional collision and mechanical repair shops in Nebraska. By year end, this business will be fully integrated into our Elitek Vehicle Services brand. We have a couple of other diagnostic transactions in the pipeline.  Finally, I previously noted several senior level additions to the European team in the quarter, which will lead our efforts in the areas of strategy, sales, logistics and supply chain, product pricing, and ecommerce. LKQ Europe is viewed by candidates as being a unique and extremely well positioned enterprise with an exciting future. And we've been able to attract great talent from across the European automotive industry and digital channels. At the corporate level during the first quarter, we brought on a new Senior Vice President of Human Resources to the executive team. Genevieve brings a wealth of experience in managing a large, hourly-based workforce and she has on-point experience in building programs focused on employee engagement and diversity and inclusion, key elements of our ESG initiatives.  And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run through the details of the strong first quarter financial performance. Varun Laroyia : Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. We entered 2021 with strong momentum coming off the two highest quarterly results in the company's history, the third and fourth quarter of 2020. This morning, I'm pleased to report that we were able to build on that momentum in the first quarter and take advantage of some tailwinds to produce yet another record quarter.  As we've said repeatedly over the last year, we can't control when revenue growth will return to pre-COVID levels. However, we are able to manage our costs and have focused on right-sizing the cost structure and emphasizing efficiencies so that we can generate operating leverage when revenue growth returns.  The permanent cost reductions that we enacted in 2020 continue to drive year-over-year profitability growth and encouragingly, we got an additional boost in the first quarter as we were able to support the sequential revenue growth across all our segments without adding back costs at the same rate.  Our SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue showed this operating leverage, dropping to 26.8% in the quarter or 320 basis points better than Q1 of 2020. We were also able to improve our gross margin by being disciplined on pricing to ensure that our strong inventory availability and service levels were recognized in the industry. We believe that these operational strengths are sustainable going forward and will drive our results as the recovery picks up pace, as expected in the second half of the year.  We saw this transpire in the month of March as rebounding economic activity generated healthy revenue growth and cost controls limited the amount of incremental expenses which resulted in the highest monthly profitability in the company's history. I mentioned the benefits of tailwinds in the quarter and commodity prices were most certainly significant.  As you can see on Slide 20, scrap steel and precious metal prices, which have been mostly favorable over the last year, provided additional benefits in the quarter. We estimate that scrap steel and precious metal prices added roughly $34 million in segment EBITDA, which will translate into about $0.08 in adjusted diluted EPS relative to the prior year.  We expect that commodities will be a net benefit in the short term, although likely at a lower level than Q1 as cost continue to rise, owing to the commodity price changes and further moderate in the second half of the year. Even with the tailwinds related to commodity prices, the larger share of the year-over-year increase in adjusted diluted EPS related to pure operating performance.  I'll now turn to that operating performance with our segment highlights. Starting on Slide 10, North America produced its highest segment EBITDA margin in the company's history at 19.9%. Q1 is the third consecutive quarter that we've been able to make the statement, and is truly a testament to the resilience of the business and the management teams\u2019 swift and decisive actions during the early days of the pandemic.  This segment continued to benefit from ongoing gross margin initiatives and the specific permanent cost reductions executed in 2020. Additionally, the commodity pricing benefits I mentioned are seen here, helping to drive North America margins above our long-term expectation.  As seen on Slide 11, Europe reported a 9.6% segment EBITDA margin, which represented a 390 basis point improvement over last year. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on the margin goal communicated last September at our Investor Day and reaffirmed in February following fourth quarter earnings. Europe is benefiting from the revenue recovery and cost containment actions taken last year, with more anticipated on both fronts.  Moving to Slide 12, as Nick described, the specialty results are truly outstanding. We are super excited about the spectacular revenue growth and we're really pleased with the way the segment team has delivered the growth without adding back significant operating costs or sacrificing gross margin.  The segment EBITDA margin of 13.4% is the highest Q1 results in the segment's history by approximately 150 basis points, and reflects the leverage benefit achieved in a period of rapid growth and the discipline to pursue profitable revenue growth.  We talked last year about the shift to an emphasis on operational excellence. And our first quarter results provide further evidence of this mindset taking hold. Each segment\u2019s disciplined execution of our strategic priorities has been excellent.  We are also delivering meaningful savings from our focus on the capital structure, deploying free cash flow to debt paydowns and share repurchases, generated interest expense savings and an EPS benefit from a reduced share count. We estimate that these two factors added $0.02 per share to our Q1 '21 results.  Additionally, Mekonomen's solid performance and other investment income generated another $0.03 of year-over-year growth. Given the improved expectation for full year profitability, we decreased our projected effective tax rate in our outlook from 28% to 26.5%. The reduced rate relative to 30% rate used in Q1 of last year contributed approximately $0.025 of the year-over-year EPS growth.  So to recap, our adjusted EPS of $0.94 is a $0.37 increase over Q1 of 2020. The commodity benefit along with the increases attributable to investments, the tax rate, our capital deployment and a slight tailwind from foreign exchange produced approximately $0.16 of that improvement. The remaining $0.21 comes from our operating performance, focusing on profitable revenue growth, enhancing gross margins and controlling our overheads. And that should be the key takeaway when considering our Q1 profitability. Now onto cash flow and liquidity. Q1 was yet another successful quarter for cash flow generation. As shown on Slide 13, we delivered 523 million in operating cash flows as we continue to benefit from the trade working capital programs we've been driving since 2018, as benefits from payables more than offset the seasonal growth in receivables.  We expected inventory to be a larger outflow in Q1, though ongoing supply and delivery challenges exacerbated by ocean freight challenges have pushed the build to later in the year. Despite the lower than anticipated inventory level, our teams with the support of our vendor partners skillfully ensured that the right parts with the right places and thereby minimize stock out issues so that our class leading full rate were maintained.  CapEx cash outlays were 42 million, resulting in free cash flow of $481 million. We used this cash to repay 83 million in debt and repurchased 57 million in LKQ stock. We also built our cash balance mostly in Europe in advance of the early redemption on April 1, which was the earliest possible redemption date of our \u20ac0.75 billion Euro Notes due in 2026.  We used a portion of the cash on hand to fund the redemption and grew the remaining amount on our revolving credit facility. The redemption replaces the Eurobond with a coupon of three and five-eighths with credit facility borrowings approximately 250 basis points of lower cost. Do note that we had already anticipated the redemption and the resulting interest savings in our original earnings outlook provided in February.  On Slide 15, you can see the further progress we have made to strengthen our liquidity position. Our net leverage ratio has decreased to 1.4x from 1.9x at the end of 2020, owing to a strong profitability and cash flow in the first quarter. We believe that we are very well positioned in our stated pursuit of an investment grade profile. We're also pleased with the positive developments on this objective, with both S&P and Moody's upgrading our credit rating in the first quarter.  I will close with our updated thoughts on 2021. With the ongoing COVID uncertainties, especially concerning revenue trends, we are providing an abbreviated outlook. We are comfortable making the following statements, all of which presume that one, additional mobility restrictions beyond what are currently in place are not re-implemented or exacerbated in our major markets; two, foreign exchange rates hold near recent levels. And finally, three, scrap and precious metal prices trend lower in the second half of the year. With that on revenue, we reaffirm our belief that parts and services revenue will be higher on a full year basis in 2021 versus 2020, with the most significant growth coming in the second quarter, albeit of a low base. We anticipate that the revenue recovery will continue in the second half of the year, as vaccines are distributed more broadly and mobility restrictions decrease, but we do not currently expect to return to our 2019 annual revenue until 2022.  As discussed previously, we have two fewer selling days in North America in 2021, with one already completed in Q1 and the second one in the fourth quarter, while Europe is flat with one fewer selling day in the first quarter, but made up in the second quarter with the additional day.  The other piece I want to talk about was earnings per share. And with our strong first quarter performance, projected revenue growth and the ongoing benefit of our margin and operating expense programs, we expect our 2021 adjusted diluted earnings per share will be significantly above the comparable figure for 2020. We are projecting an adjusted diluted EPS range of $3.00 to $3.20 with a midpoint of $3.10. On a GAAP EPS basis, this would be $2.68 to $2.88. The $0.35 or 13% increase at the midpoint reflects the Q1 outperformance and upside in the projected results for the last nine months compared to our prior outlook.  We expect to achieve this upside while covering the effects of inflationary pressures being faced across the industry related to labor costs, ocean and domestic freight expenses and higher input costs, raising inventory prices.  And finally, on cash flow, we are indeed off to a terrific start on cash flow generation in Q1, which gives us the confidence to raise our minimum free cash flow expectation. We now project that free cash flow for the full year 2021 will be within the range of $850 million to $950 million, with a midpoint of $900 million.  We expect inventory purchases to represent an outflow over the remainder of the year, as we replenish our inventory levels to support the anticipated growth. Essentially, it is just going to happen later in the year than we had previously anticipated.  Some of the investments in inventory will be offset by continued improvements in days payables resulting from the European payables optimization program, which is producing benefits and tracking well in line with the target we've set out in September 2019, when we initially launched the 1 LKQ Europe program.  So with that, thank you once again for your time this morning. And I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Varun. As a company, we are always focused on financial performance. But we are equally focused on facing change head-on and rapidly adapting in order to continuously deliver positive results for our stockholders, employees, and most importantly, our customers.  In the first quarter, our team of nearly 44,000 employees globally maintained that focus, which again allowed us to deliver positive results above expectations. I am very proud of our team and the outstanding results we posted in the first quarter of 2021.  And with that operator, we are now ready to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Stephanie Benjamin of Truist. Your line is open. Stephanie Benjamin : Hi. Good morning. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Stephanie. Varun Laroyia : Good morning, Stephanie. Stephanie Benjamin : My first question is just on, as you pointed out, both Nick and Varun, just the impact from this inflationary environment. I think you called out some levers that you can pull, including pricing. I'd love to get an update on any pricing actions that may have been implemented in the first quarter and just overall customer response, and as well as maybe hearing a little bit more on some of those other levers that you can pull just given the environment. And then I just have a quick follow up. Nick Zarcone : Thanks, Stephanie. And the reality is, we're operating in an unusual environment. And volumes in our North American and European businesses are okay, they're not great, but they're okay, and they're still constrained relative to 2019. But as Varun indicated, we've been very disciplined on the pricing front, and there's no need to give away products at discounted prices, particularly in those cases where we're the only supplier that may have the product. So we've been very disciplined in our pricing. We have seen some creep in the cost of goods sold just because of the inflationary pressures at some of our suppliers, and we're doing our best to recover that and maintain gross margins, and we're comfortable with our approach. We have not seen significant pushback from our customers. The reality is we're not alone. The entire industry is facing the same sedated conditions. On the specialty side, the growth there was largely due to volumes just going through the row [ph], which was terrific. And again, our specialty team is paying particular attention to be really disciplined on the pricing front. Stephanie Benjamin : Got it. Thank you. And then just as a follow up, specifically on the salvage side of the business, have you seen -- you called out benefiting from the ability to procure OEM parts and remanufactured parts just given the OEM shortage. Have you seen any inflation in the quarter or inability to procure some of those parts at auction, just given collusion accidents are down or higher demand for maybe other buyers, would ? Would love just to hear how you've been able to procure those salvage parts. Nick Zarcone : Yes. So we're really proud of our remanufacturing operations. They've done a terrific job over the last several quarters, not just in the first quarter. The salvage markets are tight. And the prices we're paying for the cars are higher today than they were a year ago or even two years ago, and part of it reflects the fact that the number of cars just going through the auctions are down just given the overall level of driving and overall level of accidents and total losses. But again, we're working hard to make sure that we keep our margins at really healthy levels. And the fact that we've got a great team on the remanufacturing side that's able to produce a product that customers are needing has really helped. Stephanie Benjamin : Great. Thank you so much for the time. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Butler with Stifel. Your line is open. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Brian. Brian Butler : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you guys hear me? Nick Zarcone : Yes, we hear you fine. Brian Butler : Great. Perfect. I guess just a high level, maybe we could talk a little bit about the trends that you've seen to date on the driving side in the U.S. and Europe? And then just kind of thoughts on how that plays out and the impact it could have in the rest of 2021? Nick Zarcone : Sure. I'll take that. It's been an interesting year. A year ago, at this time, April through June, vehicle miles traveled were down significantly in the United States and in Europe, the U.S. hit a low point really in the second, third week of April 2020 being down better part of 55% or so. If you look at really from kind of mid-to-late June through the November timeframe, VMT in the United States was down in and around anywhere from 9% to 12% kind of week-in, week-out. So, the last part of 2020 was down about 15%, really from -- through Thanksgiving into the end of the year. And then more recently, though, it's picked up. And in the last few weeks, VMT in the U.S. was down, say, 5%. And I'm talking about passenger cars. Truck miles has actually been positive really since last summer, but almost our revenue relates to passenger vehicles and that's what we focus on. As I mentioned in some of my prepared remarks, the European activity in mobility, again, in the first quarter started off really slow. It did rebound. And here in April, we're still below 2019 levels. But only down kind of low -- we believe low-single digits from a VMT perspective in Europe, but there are some variations country by country. So when you look at \u2013 the question behind your question I believe is when do we get back to 2019 kind of revenue levels and VMT levels, right? And we think in the United States, it's going to take us a bit longer. We think it's going to take until 2022 to get back to 2019 levels. In Europe, which is a little bit closer from a starting point perspective, we can see getting back to 2019 levels in the third or fourth quarter of this year. It all depends on how the vaccine gets rolled out and whether people truly get back on the road. And then the Specialty business has been running above 2019 levels for several quarters now, so that's a little bit different. Brian Butler : Okay. And then I guess as a follow up, just to be clear, that's kind of what's built into the current -- the updated guidance that you gave? And then second would be what part of the commodity metals upside is built into, or the expectations built into the revised guidance that you gave? Thank you. Varun Laroyia : Hi, Brian. It\u2019s Varun out here. So yes. As part of my prepared comments, I did mention the fact that as of now we do see some moderation on the metals pricing, both scrap and precious metals in the second half of the year. And so that is the piece that has been built into the outlook at this point of time. We've talked previously also commodity prices are incredibly volatile. We\u2019re certainly benefiting from the upswing at this point of time with the sequential rise. But again, make no mistake. There are others in the industry also that are faced with a similar set of commodity price increases. The question really is we believe our salvage teams, self service and full service, are by far the best in the industry and essentially are doing an incredible job in operationally taking advantage of the upswing of that. Clearly, we are keeping a lookout when these moderate, but as of now the outlook contemplates a second half moderation. Brian Butler : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Stember of CL King. Your line is open. Scott Stember : Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Scott. Scott Stember : I'm just trying to break out March a little bit better. I think you partially answered my question with commentary about reaching '19 levels again. But in March, we saw some nice increases, specialty up 61%. Could you maybe go through the three businesses and just how much of it is easy comps? If you were to flush everything out, did you see inherent improvements in March sequentially, month-over-month from the January-February timeline into March? Thanks. Nick Zarcone : Sure. The reality is, March was a good month for us. Specialty was off the charts. We're not going to begin to imply we're going to be able to continue to grow at 60% year-over-year every month for the rest of the year. The growth rate is going to come down. But the absolute dollar should be strong. The comparison for Europe and North America, obviously, we're happy that it's up on a year-over-year basis, but it's somewhat off easy comps. But the March levels were better than the February and January levels. Again, not at the 2019 levels but they were better sequentially and that\u2019s what gives us a little bit of confidence going forward that we will slowly creep back to those 2019 levels a little bit faster in Europe, a little bit slower in the U.S., but we\u2019re headed in the right direction. Scott Stember : Okay. I guess last question on supply chain, I think you touched on some of this already, but a couple of quarters ago, specialty was meaningfully impacted. It appears that you\u2019ve been able to work through that. Can you just talk about some of the countermeasures that you have in place which are helping you get through this? Nick Zarcone : Well, we have a lot of orders out there for inventory. We have product that\u2019s coming into our receiving bay and [indiscernible] shipping bays almost in the same day. We\u2019ve got product that\u2019s not even touching the shelves because the velocity of the business and the demand is just so significant, we\u2019re doing the best we can. We\u2019re working hand-in-hand with our vendor partners. The reality is, the industry as a whole, the vendors are running hard to keep pace. And we're working very closely with our vendor partners to make sure that we can get the product we need when we need it. We anticipated not just in specialty, but in all of our businesses, that we would have added more to our inventory levels in the first quarter. But the supply constraints are what they are. And we think we'll get back to slightly higher inventory levels in the second half of the year. Scott Stember : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Kennison of Baird. Your line is open. Craig Kennison : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions as well. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Craig. Craig Kennison : It sounds like your competitive advantage, especially as it relates to inventory availability, has really strengthened during the pandemic. And I'm wondering to what extent you think that is sustainable? What does the competitive landscape look like? Do you think maybe you've seen any of those competitors exit permanently? Nick Zarcone : I wouldn't say that we've seen a rash of competitors exit, Craig. But as most people know, ocean freight is a significant consideration for all industries, anybody importing products, particularly from the Far East, the lack of containers, the backlog at the ports, it all creates a bit of a bottleneck. The difference is, is we're not importing a few dozen or a few 100 containers a year in North America. We import over 16,000 containers a year. And so we use that position to our advantage. The orders to the vendors are big orders. We are a very important customer and I think we've got great relationships with our vendor partners and they're working hard to help us be successful. And if you're a smaller business, you don't have that same flexibility to have power with the vendors and/or with the shipping lines. We use our size and scale to our advantage. Craig Kennison : Thank you. And then sort of related, but the other impact of the pandemic is really you forced yourselves to look at your operating performance and you made some tough decisions, unfortunately, in terms of headcount. As you look to add staff to meet the new resurging demand, to what extent do you need to add back staff and can you get by with a leaner footprint going forward? Nick Zarcone : Well, we clearly leaned out the organization globally as we went through the depths of the pandemic, right. And my marching orders to all of my operating heads down the field is we need to keep that leanness going forward. Yes, we will need to bring back people and add people as revenue improves. But we're not going to bring the people back until the revenue is up and we know it's sustainable. And the goal is, this is the new cost structure, Craig. This is how we're going to operate the business going forward. Craig Kennison : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Gary Prestopino of Barrington. Your line is open. Gary Prestopino : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Gary. Varun Laroyia : Hi, Gary. Gary Prestopino : I got a question here that\u2019s maybe a little bit different than what you were expecting in terms of questions for the call on the quarter\u2019s numbers, but can you give us an idea on the mechanical side for EVs? What kind of parts demand you're seeing initially? I just want to get to that, because obviously we're going to start seeing more EVs come into the car park. Nick Zarcone : Very little demand for electric vehicle parts, almost -- I won't say none, but almost none. And you have to keep in mind our sweet spots, Gary, is -- the aftermarket products from a collision perspective and salvage parts from a collision perspective, sweet spot being kind of 3 to 10 years \u2013 vehicles 3 to 10 years old. On the mechanical parts, the sweet spot is even older, generally kind of in that four to five to kind of 15 years. And so there's a pretty big lag between kind of when the cars come off the showroom floor and when there's real demand for the types of parts that we and others in the industry sell. So you're not going to see an impact of EV-related parts for quite some time. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Your line is open. Bret Jordan : Hi. Good morning, guys. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Bret. Varun Laroyia : Good morning. Bret Jordan : Pretty good sequential improvement in the payables ratio. How high do you think you can get accounts payables percentage of inventory without getting to investment grade? Varun Laroyia : So as of now, in the first quarter, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, Bret, we certainly saw the payables continue to deliver the overall payables program, deliver. It again was not only the European payables program, our North America team also did an outstanding job. But really, it was a case of not being able to get the inventory built to take place. So in Q1, while the number for the conversion is above 100% in terms of free cash flow to EBITDA, as I mentioned previously also, that is not a sustainable number. Our conversion factor on an annual basis is 55% to 60%. But again, we're really happy with how the payables program is going across the board, but clearly the largest opportunity being over in Europe. As of now, the first quarter with the lack of the inventory build, it\u2019s basically timing. And from the second quarter onwards, we expect that inventory builds to take place to get us back into that 55% to 60% conversion ratio. With regards to what the long-term hypotheses is or what long-term plan is with regards to payables as a percentage of inventory, we clearly know for our European business there are some North American comps that we are targeting. It certainly takes time, but we're really happy with the progress our team is making. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then a question on UK mechanical, I think you've called out a spread between your mechanical business and the collision business. I think one of your peers had called out the UK as particularly strong. Are you seeing any market share shifts on the mechanical side of that market, or is your regional softness more tied to that product mix? Nick Zarcone : Look, Brian, it's tied to product mix. As I indicated, the collision and coatings activities in our UK operations, we're down double digits. And the environment there is not too different from the collision environment here in the United States; fewer miles travel, less collisions, all the rest, right? Our core continuing operations on the mechanical part side was up in the first quarter. The market was down. We took some share. And that's our goal is to continue to take share. And most importantly, though, in our UK business, we're highly focused on the profitability and the cash flow of the business. Because it's \u2013 it\u2019s not how much you take in, it's how much you keep, right? And our focus is to keep as much of that revenue in the form of profits and cash flow, and we're happy with the growth of our business. Bret Jordan : And you said you'd rationalize the footprint in the UK. Is that done now? Is your store base pretty static? Nick Zarcone : Yes, it\u2019s all done. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Your line is open. Daniel Imbro : Hi. Good morning, guys, and congrats on a good start to the year. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Daniel. Daniel Imbro : I want to start on the diagnostics piece. Could you talk a little bit more about Greenlight and maybe what they bring to the table? And then taking a step back, you mentioned in your prepared remarks there were some more diagnostics deals in the pipeline. Can you expand on what you're looking for in these targets? Is it just scale? Is it new capabilities? Kind of how that fits into the North American outlook? Nick Zarcone : Thanks, Daniel. The acquisition was similar to the other small acquisitions we've made in the diagnostics space. Again, this is very much of a local business, not unlike the rest of our North American operations where you're really selling in the local markets. We're going to continue to do acquisitions that give us geographic coverage across the United States. Because you can't service body shops and/or mechanical shops in California with a diagnostics team that is in Texas or Colorado, it just doesn't work. And so we're going to continue to build out the footprint from a diagnostics perspective. All of our activities thus far are what we would call mobile related, where we actually have feet on the ground, people inside our customer shops, doing the calibration work and/or the diagnostic work. We're going to continue to build that out. And we're looking for other ways, quite frankly, to service our body shop and mechanical shop customers, perhaps using technology. Daniel Imbro : That\u2019s really helpful. And then, Varun, just one on the balance sheet. Obviously leverage is down to 1.4x and you mentioned you reduced further on April 1 with the Eurobonds. Can you talk about the usage of free cash here? Obviously, inventory will build but you're still guiding to, call it, 900 million in free cash. Do you think about the primary use of that being buyback now that leverage is comfortable, or how are you planning on deploying that capital? Varun Laroyia : Yes, so a great question and thank you for raising it, Daniel. Yes, the first priority has been and remains to reinvest into our business. Apart from CapEx, which we are very comfortable with and what we've called out for quite some time in the 2% to 2.25% of revenue, that remains stable. In addition to that, as Nick mentioned a few minutes ago, our ability to do high synergy transactions, small tuck-in, building up critical capabilities remains the primary use in terms of priority of the free cash. As you rightly pointed out, leverage is well within our target corridor. We don't expect to see further deleveraging taking place from a debt perspective. And arguably, as profitability grows, that delevering will take place in any case, so not really looking to pay down further debt, which obviously, as you can make out, doesn't leave too many avenues left for the free cash flow with share repurchases, which obviously we resumed the program in the fourth quarter of last year would end up being the primary deployment for that capital that we're building up. Daniel Imbro : Great. Congrats again and best of luck. Varun Laroyia : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now return the call to Mr. Zarcone for closing remarks. Nick Zarcone : Well, we certainly thank you for your time and attention this morning and we look forward to providing another update in late July when we report our second quarter results. Again, in summary, we are thrilled with our first quarter. I thank all of the 44,000 people of LKQ for working so hard to bring such terrific results to bear. And we are very optimistic about the future of LKQ. And so thanks for your time, and we will chat again in three months. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations for LKQ Corporation. Sir, please go ahead. Joe Boutross : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today, and as normal, we're planning to file our 10-Q in the next few days. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning I will provide some high level comments related to our performance in the quarter, and then Varun will dive into the financial details, as well as our improved outlook for 2021 before I come back with a few closing remarks. This was another quarter of significant operating progress, driven by excellent execution and improved business conditions. I could not be prouder of the LKQ team. A few years ago when we pivoted to operational excellence, we knew that there would be a transition period during which we would need to invest in our people and processes to improve the operating model. We also recognize that there would be difficult decisions needed to right size the cost structure and drive efficiencies. We undertook this shift with the expectation that we would come out the other side as a leaner, more nimble and stronger organization, one that could succeed in difficult conditions like we have seen with the pandemic over the past year, as well as thrive during the good times. Those expectations are being realized. While I'm not ready to proclaim mission accomplished, I believe we have made tremendous progress in our operational expense transition as evidenced by the continued outstanding results that we've delivered over the past year. Record outcomes don't happen by accident and the team has driven strong profitability and cash flow by among other actions applying a disciplined pricing approach, implementing permanent cost saving actions, including closing underperforming locations, consolidating delivery routes and reducing headcount. Timing our operating policies to reduce waste and increase yield, such as harvesting more catalytic converters per car, actively engaging with our vendor partners to ensure that we are receiving attractive pricing and market payment terms, and monitoring our receivables so that we minimize passed due balances. Now onto the quarter, we were able to produce yet another record quarter. Indeed each of the last four quarters results represent the highest earnings per share reported in the respective quarters with Q2 of 2021 reflecting the first quarter with over $1 of earnings per share and the highest segment EBITDA margins in over a decade. Varun will dig into the market details shortly. Revenue for the second quarter 2021 was $3.4 billion, an increase of 31% as compared to the $2.6 billion in the second quarter of 2020. In the second quarter, parts and services organic revenue increased 22%, while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures decreased revenue by 3/10 of 1% and foreign exchange rates increased revenue 5.4%. This creates a total parts and services revenue increase of 27%. The organic revenue growth for the quarter reflects the annualization of the pandemic impact during Q2 2020. Net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $305 million as compared to $119 million for the same period in 2020 an increase of 157%. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.01 as compared to $0.39 for the same period last year, an increase of 159%. On an adjusted basis net income in the second quarter was $340 million compared to $161 million in the same period of 2020, a 111% increase. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.13 as compared to $0.53 for the same period of 2020 a 113% increase. Now let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. Slide 5 of our presentation sets forth the monthly revenue trends for the quarter, and as you can see coming off a low base of the second quarter of 2020, the growth rates improved significantly year-over-year for each of the segments with April and may being the most notable. The vaccination rates in our key geographic markets is encouraging. Europe in particular, witnessed a solid increase in vaccinations throughout the second quarter, although it still lags the United States. We like many, are closely monitoring the Delta variant and the risk of policy actions potentially slowing economic growth if the variant were to rapidly spread. Turning to North America, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, fuel consumption for the second quarter was 28% above the prior year and 5% below the second quarter of 2019. From Slide 6, you will note that organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment increased 19.7% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. When looking at our performance relative to collision and liability repairable claims data in the quarter, given the aberrations associated with the significant swings in 2020, we believe the most relevant comparison is to the second quarter of 2019. During Q2 organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment declined about 9% on a per day basis relative to 2019, while repairable claims decline 15%, so another period of outperformance for our North American operations. I want to highlight a couple of examples of how the North American team continues to push the operational excellence initiatives. In 2019 our North American team initiated a lean operating strategy based on the principle of doing more with less. During the first step of this strategy the team asked the simple question, what does winning look like? The answers to that question allowed the team to unify and develop several key performance indicators that were deployed in early 2020 prior to the pandemic, and we immediately generated positive results. We are now in the second phase of this strategy which is systematically implementing a lean roadmap to optimize those KPIs. We are transitioning the team to a daily management system which addresses safety, quality, delivery, and our customers. This system is improving our communication and accountability while driving root cause and corrective actions along with sustainable sharing of best practices. In Q2 our salvage procurement team began utilizing artificial intelligence to optimize the procurement of the salvage vehicles we bid on at auction. This artificial intelligence uses computer vision, a technology that allows algorithms to reason based on images to assess the specific damage on each vehicle and to determine which parts can be recycled and reused. This technology enhances the human element of our procurement processes to further improve our part yield per vehicle and to advance the quality standards of each part. Additionally, during the quarter, our Letech [ph] business expanded its services beyond on-site mobile diagnostics and repair to also include remote automotive diagnostics and remote programming. Moving on to our European segment, organic revenue for parts and services in the second quarter increased 20.7% on a reported basis a 19.2% on a same day basis. When compared to 2019, our European revenue was down about 2% on a per day basis. Our regional operations continued to experience [indiscernible] and revenue performance in the quarter, but each market was positive on a year-over-year basis. Our UK business had the strongest recovery, largely due to our favorable inventory availability relative to the competition and we are confident we are gaining share in the UK market. I'm also pleased to say that we are witnessing some modest market recovery in Italy, a market that was dramatically impacted by the pandemic, but it continues to remain a drag on the revenue growth and margins for the overall segment. As you can see from the significant expansion in the European margins, we are making excellent progress on our 1 LKQ Europe program. Since September 2019, when we first announced the program, the European EBITDA margins have increased about 300 basis points from 7.7% in the second quarter of 2019 to 10.7%in the second quarter of 2021. In reality, there have been two distinct components to this effort. One is organizational and relates to creating a fully centralized pan European leadership team and functional structure. The other is execution related, which focuses on the key initiatives outlined in prior communications, such as procurement, logistics and local projects. Over the past two years we have been working both components simultaneously. And I am happy to announce that we have completed the organizational transformation. We now have all the right people in the right seats in a streamlined structure that reflects a single business as opposed to a collection of independent businesses. The execution element will be with us forever and will be the driving factor behind the continued productivity improvements in the years to come. A few other items to note in Europe would include that during the first week of July we began on-boarding the few group of about 25 employees for our Innovation and Service Centre in Katowice, Poland. The Fource CDC project in the Netherlands remains on track and the start of that major warehouse operation is planned for March 2022. And our ERP implementation at Rhiag in Italy went live on July 5. Some of you may have known that on July 14, the European commission came forward with the Fit for 55 proposal, which accelerates and details plans for a greener economy and reducing net emissions in Europe by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990. As a leader in the circular [ph] economy and the largest vehicle and parts recycler worldwide, LKQ embraces the global effort to reduce CO2 emissions. Our European segment and also Mekonomen, where we have a 26% stake, are first movers in supporting our customers for service and repair of hybrid and electrical vehicles. According to ACEA the manufacturing -- Automobile Manufacturing Association of Europe, banning a specific technology is not the sole and rational way forward and internal combustion engines including hybrids need to play a role in the transition to zero emissions. Now let\u2019s move on to our specialty segment, which again knocked the cover off the ball during the second quarter by reporting organic revenue growth of 30.1%. Specialty had a record-breaking quarter in terms of revenue, EBITDA dollars and EBITDA percentages. As witnessed in Q1, the drivers of this tremendous performance continued to be the strong ongoing demand for parts related to RVs and light trucks, combined with a very disciplined approach to controlling cost. We also believe that the stimulus checks benefited the specialty business in the quarter. Across all of our segments we are experiencing some level of supply chain shortages and disruptions. These disruptions are creating product scarcity and freight delays that are resulting in meaningful availability pressures in certain product lines. The supply chain challenges are also driving product inflation which in turn is generating the most robust pricing environment we've seen in years. Across all of our segments, we have been very effective in passing along these costs as witnessed by out margin performance. Alongside supply chain inflationary pressures, like many businesses across the globe, we are facing wage inflation and increased competition for labor. We are constantly looking at our wage structure and turnover rates across all of our segments to assure we stay ahead of any competitive pressures and help backfill the open positions with the best candidates we can attract. From my corporate development perspective, in the second quarter, we acquired the business and assets of Green Bean Battery, a hybrid battery reconditioner and installer. Also in Q2, Warn acquired Fabtech Industries, a leading manufacturer of aftermarket suspensions for light trucks and SUVs. Fabtech brands, which include Dirt Logic, and Stealth shocks are widely recognized premium offerings in the off road racing and performance segments and are a tremendous compliment to our line of Warn products. Both of these small tuck-in acquisitions represent our ongoing effort to evolve our product offerings to match the changes taking place in the car part and to leverage our robust networks across all segments to sell deeper into existing and prospective customers. Lastly, I am proud to announce that during the second quarter, MSCI increased LKQ's ESG rating from A to AA, which is the second increase in the past two years. This new AA rating places us in the top 19% of our index group. Also, earlier this month, ISS, significantly increased our social and governance QuickScore ratings. Please refer to Slide 18, which highlights our environmental stewardship in the quarter. And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run you through the details of the strong second quarter performance. Varun Laroyia : Thank you, Nick and good morning to everyone joining us today. Before I cover the financial results, I want to highlight a number of significant events and accomplishments related to our capital allocation over the recent past. With the pivot to operational excellence in 2018, our approach to balance sheet and capital allocation moved towards targeting investment grade credit metrics. This strategy placed an emphasis on generating strong, sustainable free cash flow, maintaining a conservative leverage position and deploying capital to the highest return opportunities. I'm very pleased to report that we've made remarkable progress on all measures and getting the validation of an investment grade rating from Fitch this past May is a tremendous achievement for the organization. Looking back at the last 36 months, starting just after we completed the Stahlgruber acquisition, we have produced $3.8 billion in operating cash flow, which supports a nearly 80% conversion rate of free cash flow relative to EBITDA As shown on Slide 14 of the presentation we've used these funds to repay $2.1 billion of debt, which resulted in delevering the balance sheet from a 3.1 times net leverage as of June 2018 to 1.2 times as of June of 2021. Additionally, we have repurchased over $800 million of LKQ stock at an average price of approximately $33 per share or roughly 35% below the current share price. We have not sacrificed investment in the business during this period, with roughly $660 million of capital expenditures invested to support our growth and operate more efficiently. Transitioning from the consolidation phase of the company's evolution, acquisitions have been a relatively small part of the capital allocation, though we remain committed to targeted tuck-in acquisitions that deliver high synergies or critical capabilities. Our actions over the last three years have put the company in a very strong liquidity position, which has allowed us to complete the following during the second quarter. First, we've delivered a further $411 million in operating cash flows as we converted 79% of our EBITDA into cash. We redeemed the three quarters of $1 billion euros, 2026 euro notes on April 1, the earliest available redemption date with funds from our lower cost revolver, as well as cash on hand. We repaid the full amount of the remaining term loan of approximately $320 million ahead of schedule, again using funds from the revolver and cash on hand, and we repurchased $304 million of LKQ stock, our highest level of quarterly purchases to date. With our debt transactions, we reduced overall liquidity by utilizing available capacity on the revolver. We believe future cash flow needs can be supported by a smaller facility, so we eliminated the term loan and moved more funds to the revolver, which in turn will lower borrowing costs even further. We continue to believe that LKQ shares represent good value and our repurchases reflect that belief. As shown on Slide 17, we have continued to repurchase shares under our 10b5-1 plan in July, with an additional $100 million invested through last Friday. Since we were nearing a $1 billion authorization, we went to our Board of Directors for an increase in the total authorization to $2 billion. The Board approved the expansion, and we now have the ability to repurchase a further $1 billion through October 2024. Now I'll move to the financial results. As Nick described, Q2 was a very successful quarter with positive contributions coming from revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and operating expense leverage. Gross margin was a highlight for the quarter, increasing 270 basis points relative to the prior year or 250 basis points on an adjusted basis. The margin improvement is more noteworthy, as it came in a period in which input costs rose across each of our segments. We remain disciplined in our pricing, and as a distributor, we have been able to pass through the higher input costs coming from the supply chain. Gross margin also benefited from the tailwinds of commodity prices. As you can see on Slide 28, scrap steel and precious metal prices, which have been mostly favorable over last year, provided additional benefits this quarter. We estimate that scrap steel and precious metal prices added roughly $57 million in segment EBITDA, and approximately $0.14 per share in adjusted diluted EPS relative to last year. While we started to analyze some of our permanent cost reductions that we enacted in 2020, there was still an incremental benefit in the second quarter. Our SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue showed the favorable leverage effects of the cost actions and the other revenue growth, dropping to 26.2% in the quarter or 190 basis points better than Q2 of 2020. Even with the tailwinds related to commodity prices, the largest share of the year-over-year increase in adjusted diluted EPS related to operating performance. I'll now turn to that operating performance with our segment highlights. Starting on Slide 10, North America produced its highest segment EBITDA margin in the company's history at 20.8%. Q2 is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've been able to make this statement. The primary factors behind the improvement are similar to the last few quarters as the segment continued to benefit from ongoing gross margin initiatives and permanent cost reductions. We are still driving costs out of the business, and we currently estimate the permanent cost savings to be $105 million, a $25 million increase relative to the figure shared in last September's Investor Day presentation. Additionally, the commodity pricing benefits on gross margin and operating leverage, I mentioned earlier, are seen here, helping to drive the North American margins above our long-term expectation. As seen on Slide 11, Europe reported a 10.7% segment EBITDA margin, which represented a 330 basis point improvement over last year. With a year-to-date margin of 10.2%, we are on track to deliver on our margin goals. Europe is benefiting from the revenue recovery, improved net pricing, and cost containment actions taken in the last year. Moving to Slide 12, Specialty continues to execute its operating plan extremely well. Similar to Q1, Specialty generated significant revenue growth in the quarter, without sacrificing margin and continued to effectively manage operating expenses. The segment EBITDA margin of 14.9% is the highest quarterly figure since the business was acquired in 2014. We are also delivering meaningful savings from our focus on the capital structure. The early redemption of the 2026 euro notes created interest expense savings additionally deploying free cash flow to debt pay downs and share repurchase generated interest experience savings and an EPS benefit from our reduced share count. We estimate that these factors added approximately $0.03 per share to our second quarter results. Additionally, Mekonomen's solid performance and other investment income improvement generated another $0.02 of year-over-year growth. Given the improved expectation of full-year profitability, we decreased our projected effective tax rate in our outlook from 26.5% to 26.25% which had a nominal benefit on the quarter. So to recap, our adjusted EPS of $1.13 is a $0.60 increase from Q2 of 2020 which was a low comparable given the pronounced COVID impact last year. The commodity benefits, along with the increases attributable to investments, the tax rate, our capital deployment, and a slight tailwind from foreign exchange, produced about $0.20 of the improvement. The remaining $0.40 comes from our operating performance focusing on profitable revenue growth, enhancing gross margins and controlling our overhead costs. And this should be the key takeaway when considering the second quarter results. I will wrap up my prepared comments with our updated talks on 2021. Consistent with the level of detail we have provided in recent quarters, we are comfortable making the following statements, all of which assume that additional mobility restrictions beyond what are currently in place are not implemented in our major markets. Foreign exchange rates hold near recent level and scrap and precious metal prices trend lower in the second half of the year. Number one, we believe that our parts and services revenue will be higher than 2020 on a full-year basis and we will continue to recover in our core North America and European segments in the second half of the year as mobility trends benefit from further progress on vaccination rates. We expect the second half growth rates to decline relative to what we reported in the most recent quarter as the pandemic effects were not as severe in the second half of 2020 for our business. While we expect demand for our specialty products, we remain strong. We anticipated the growth rates to be lower than the first half of the year due to the second half seasonality and the expected end of the stimulus program. As discussed previously, we will have two fewer selling days in North America in 2021 with one having occurred in Q1 and the second to occur in the fourth quarter while Europe is flat for the year overall with one day shifting from Q1 into Q2. Second, with another excellent quarter in Q2, we are projecting full-year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.55 to $3.75 with the midpoint of $3.65. This is an increase of $0.55 or 18% at the midpoint over our most recent prior guidance. This increase reflects the outperformance in Q2 in addition to higher anticipated results in the second half of the year as we expect the benefits from our ongoing margin and operating expense programs, and our strategic cash deployment to outweighed strong inflationary headwinds related to labor, freight, fuel and inventory costs being experienced throughout the industry. And third, I began my comments by noting the significant progress we made on our capital allocation strategy, including outstanding cash flow generation in the second quarter. With this in mind, along with the higher projected net income for the year, we are raising our free cash flow guidance to a range of $950 million to $1 billion and $50 million with $1 billion at the midpoint. We still anticipate an inventory build in the back half of the year ahead of the traditionally strong Q1 and Q2 seasonal demand. In the interim, our teams, with the active support of our vendor partners continue to expertly navigate the situation to ensure that we have the right parts in the right places to best serve our customers. And finally, the European payables optimization program remains on track and will help to partially offset the impact of the inventory build on cash flow. Thank you once again for your time this morning, and with that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Varun for the financial overview. Let me restate our key initiatives, which continue to be central to our culture and our objectives. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify the operating model. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy; and fourth, we will continue to invest in our future. As you can see from our results, our company executed on each of these initiatives in the second quarter and for that I offer a tremendous thank you to each of our 43,000 plus team members across the globe that make it happen each and every day, really define what it means to be LKQ proud.  And with that operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from the line of Craig Kennison from Baird. Your lines are open. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Lots of goodness to work with you, but I'll focus on your credit profile and the implications for cash flow, Varun what are the implications of an investment grade rating from Fitch on your vendor terms? I guess, I'm wondering will the Fitch decision cause any immediate change to your payable terms of key vendors which would be a positive for cash flow? Varun Laroyia : Good morning, Craig. Great question and great to hear from you. Yes, incredibly pleased with the company early firing on all cylinders, you know across revenue margin the goals of free cash flow conversion coming through and then also the way we have deployed it. With last year's specific question about the recent investment grade rating initiation by Fitch, in itself it makes no change to either our credit facility or for that matter vendor terms. But if you go back, and this is a public document, and go through our credit facility agreement, within that piece we have a prewired clause which essentially states that if one of the two currently named rating agencies were to make LKQ and award them -- award us a investment grade rating, the means of our senior secured facility drop off and that as you can imagine is a significant number which of course is the standard fee in our $1 billion credit facility, so that's one piece where the links drop off and it becomes unsecured. The second piece is, within the credit facility we have a current feeling that our indebtedness through for grade payables cannot exceed 180 days. So again, just to recap, the Fitch decision in itself does not change anything today, but clearly being one of the three key rating agencies out there, one of them has this view of us, I have no doubt that given the ongoing discussions with the other two rating agencies, they too will come around. I don\u2019t believe it's a question of if, it's more a question of when. Craig Kennison : Got it, so just so I'm clear, you need one of the other two to make a change in order to trigger some of those changes in your contracts? Varun Laroyia : That is correct. Craig Kennison : Awesome, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next one is from the line of Daniel Imbro from Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Yes, good morning guys. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Daniel. Daniel Imbro : I want to start on North America Varun, obviously, the gross margin was really strong and part of it that is driven by metal. But can you talk about how the team handled that strong revenue growth with the lower headcount? Have you been able to keep out as many of the expenses that you anticipated? And have there been any hiccups in hiring when you need to give him the employment backdrop? Varun Laroyia : Daniel, good morning. Yes, it is Varun Laroyia and listen, it's an excellent question. Before I get to the specifics of answering your question, I just want to make sure that all of our 43 plus 1000 associates globally are given a big shout out, what our field teams have done globally, from branch to a warehouse to a dismantling yard, has just been nothing short of phenomenal. Our success, LKQ's success is directly attributable to our field teams. And the last 17, 18 months have not been easy. But they are the ones that have kept this company humming along. And really exceeding everyone's expectations and putting up yet another record quarter. Yes, you're right, with regards to North America margins at 20.8% in the current quarter, or 19.9% in Q1, this is higher than what our long-term expectation has been, has been very clear, both in the first quarter and now most recently, in my prepared comments. Precious metals have been a benefit. And we estimate and if you go to see Slide 28 in the earnings deck, we've actually given transparency in terms of how scrap metal and precious metal prices have been trading. And really what level of benefit has come through, we estimate roughly 350 basis points of that 20.8% margin that North America has put is directly attributable to scrap and precious metal prices. Even if you were to get these out, the business is still delivered well north of 17 points. And so that really is what gives us a lot of comfort, could we have done better, perhaps, but there are inflationary pressures, I'd say the single biggest challenge at this point of time, not just for LKQ, but I'd say across the entire industry here in the United States has been labor, and labor, essentially, whether it be availability, or whether it'd be the cost to get that labor. It is leading to congestion at ports, it's leading to higher freight costs, because delivery drivers are incredibly difficult to find. But that has been the key piece. And that's why I come back full circle. In terms of giving a massive shout out to our field teams, we have been running short with regards to labor availability. We have taken wages up also, just to make sure that we are market competitive. But we have got branch managers, plant managers, DNs going and making deliveries because we want to make sure that while we have the right part of the right place, we continue to serve our customers. Without customers, we really don't have a business and just want to make sure that that is heard loud and clear our fee procedures and outstanding. Daniel Imbro : That\u2019s great. Really helpful color and then just a follow up on the North American margin, obviously your right, metal prices, you called out the $51 million I think an EBITDA. But is that part of what's also raising your COGS in North America? If I looked at this via the thing, self service cost was up 53%, salvage vehicle drove 36%. So if metal prices roll over, should there be some natural offset in that as your cost to acquire vehicles at auction would go down as well? Varun Laroyia : Yes, absolutely, yes. I think that's what we've kind of said in the earnings call so that salvage prices have been running pretty high for quite some time. But again, it's partly to do with where the dollar has been creating. So lots of export trade has been taking place. As we know there's been a shortage of chips and so OEM sales have come down. As a result, huge cut prices in our precious metals around that is certainly flowing through our COGS also. There is no doubt about it. Daniel Imbro : Great. Thanks so much guys and best of luck going forward. Varun Laroyia : Thank you, Daniel. Operator : Thank you. The next one, we have Brian Butler from Stifel. Your line is now open. Brian Butler : Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Nick Zarcone : Good morning Brian. Brian Butler : First one just kind of on that point of the labor and kind of inflation, could you maybe just kind of rank where you see it? I mean, looks like labor is at the top, but we're on and kind of put in perspective on magnitude, where does freight and fuel fall below that on the inflation pressures? Nick Zarcone : Yes, I would put that in probably that order labor first. Because you have to remember that over 60% of our operating expenses, ultimately come back to people, it's the biggest portion of the, on the P&L the biggest expense. And so, and we have 43,000 plus people around the globe, so that's number one. The second would be freight. And that not only relates to ocean freight, which is up significantly, but also, the domestic freight, whether it be in the U.S. or in Europe, and then, some people put fuel as part of freight, we try and separate it out, obviously, if you can track oil prices, they've been up as well. I'd point to you Page 7 of our deck, which kind of sorts out where we have saved money over the past year or so. And you know, most of the savings has been on the people side and then secondly on the delivery side and then finally kind of facilities and the like. So, again, I would put it in that order; think about people, freight, and then fuel. Brian Butler : Okay, that's helpful. And then just my follow up. When you think about the M&A pipeline, and your focus has been recently on kind of the operational excellence, can you give a little color on where that M&A pipeline stand and what might be targeted in the next year or two or what assets you're still looking at? Nick Zarcone : Absolutely. So I mean, we are always looking for ways to add to our strength as our organization and whether that comes in acquiring in new geographies where we don't have a presence, whether it comes from acquiring new product lines or new skill sets. Obviously, the focus currently is on kind of newer technologies. Right? So we've made a number of acquisitions over the last year in the whole diagnostics and calibration space. And we're building up a very nice business there. As you know, and we've mentioned in the call, the Green Bean acquisition in Q2, that relates to battery technologies. And, again, we all know that ultimately battery being able to service and deal with EV batteries, whether it's hybrids or battery electric vehicle batteries is going to become important, so you should expect additional investment in that area. So anything we can do to evolve our product and service set and the services is a key component there, relative to the evolution of the car park, that's what we're going to do. And so, you should expect that you will see additional acquisitions, probably smaller, because particularly in these newer technologies, there are no big companies out there to buy. So we can, again, make sure that we are on the cutting edge as it relates to what we can provide our customers. Varun Laroyia : Yes, and Brian this is very consistent with what we've been talking about for quite some time, including at our Investor Day that, M&A, while it may seem that the pace of M&A has slowed down, not really, really the focus has been different, rather than going whale hunting. As the European segment was built up, the focus has really been as Nick said, the focus has been on high synergy tuck-ins and building critical capabilities and that focus remains. Brian Butler : Great, thank you. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. The next one is from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : Hey, on the payables if you do get a second rating agency to tip your way, what would be sort of a shorter term impact? I think you're close to 50% accounts payable to inventory, but what kind of step up would you see if you got to investment grade? Varun Laroyia : Great question, Bret. The biggest uplift really will be from our European business. And just given the nature of the European business and how we compare that from April's optimization program relative to say the Big Four here on car parc site in North America. Our North American business per se, we have some opportunity. But if you think of the salvage business, whether self serve, or full serve, is just a different business model. Right? So if you think about the size and scale of a European business, which at this point of time is roughly half the company, that really is where the opportunity is, and we certainly see that there's further upside down there, not just with the fact that we would get the investment grade rating at some point of time. And so the 180 day, ceiling obviously gets lifted, that's more of a tactical piece, but more on an ongoing basis as the team how that continues. It's active discussions with a number of our vendor partners. The focus really had been let's get to the top 40 and then the team continues to go further down the chain, as part of the overall supplier rationalization discussions, making sure that we continue to get our calls at attractive prices, but also had what we believe to be market convention terms. Bret Jordan : Okay, thanks. And I guess quick question on supply chain. Is the disruption and sort of inventory availability actually a positive for you in the sense that you're gaining share as others are maybe always or less available, and I guess give anything anecdotal on what percentage of repairs are now alternative parks in North America? Nick Zarcone : Yes. Great question. Obviously, the supply chain not just in our industry, but in most industries is under duress at the moment. For us, it really depends. Actually, the business and the product line, because there's significant differences across the, LKQ platform. Like in salvage, there's no impact, because all that products is here. And it's easy for us to get at the options. Our aftermarket business here however, most of the aftermarket collision products for the whole industry, not just us ours comes out of Taiwan and it's not an issue related to our ability to procure the product. The manufacturers have the ability to stamp out the parts. The issue is getting it from the warehouses in Taiwan to the warehouses in Tampa or Toledo or Topeka, or wherever we need them here in the US. And everyone knows what's going on the issues related to container capacity; Port congestion is a major issue. I mean, we've got ships sitting on the water, just waiting to be unloaded. There's a lack of capacity to unload the ships. There's a shortage of drivers to do the dredge within the ports that meaning moving the cans around. And then there's a shortage of trucking capacity to actually get the containers from the ports to our locations. So what's that doing, it's extending the timeframe of how long it takes us to get product. And it's costing a little bit more money. The good news is the vast majority of our ocean freight is under contract, at least for quite some time now and going into the future. Spot rates, as you know, are up anywhere from six to eight fold. The good news is, again we're under contract. We're bring in 15,000 containers a year, that's 300 containers a week. And I wouldn't want to be a company that's importing 300 containers a year, or 50 containers a year, which many of our smaller competitors are dealing with. So we don't have the inventory that we want, but we can -- we're making it work. And clearly, we think we're in a better position than most of the small players out in the marketplace. Now you move over the specialty, and it's different. Yes, they bring some products in from the Far East and we're dealing with the exact same issues as in the aftermarket in North America. But they also source the majority of their product domestically or at least within North America. And there are the real issues, the capacity or the manufacturers who simply cannot keep up with demand. We would like to have more inventory in our specialty group. We've said in the past quarters, and this quarter was true as well, we've probably lost some revenue because we then have products on the shelves. But again, as the largest distributor and what we do, we are doing much better than the smaller competitors. And Europe is somewhere in between Bret. I mean, the reality is, they import less product from Asia than we do in our North American collision business. But they are also experiencing some tight supplies on certain products that are produced within the EU. So it's creating issues, but we think we're doing a pretty good job of managing through. Bret Jordan : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next one, we have Stephanie Moore from Truist. Your line is open. Stephanie Moore : Hi, good morning. Hi, Nick, hi Varun, hi Joe. Nick Zarcone : Good morning. Good morning. Stephanie Moore : I wanted to touch on the European margin performance and expectations kind of implied in the second half of the year, obviously as the record and [indiscernible] tremendous 2Q results. But if you just kind of back into even your updated guidance, it does account for a bit of a slowdown the back half off of the 2Q levels, but admittedly, nice improvement year-over-year. So I'd love to get some color just as you kind of updated your guidance, what your thoughts are for the back half in terms of the margin performance. And why there should be some kind of slowdown from the second quarter, just any puts and takes there would be helpful? Thank you. Varun Laroyia : Good morning, Stephanie. It's Varun out here, and let me take that question. So first of all, really pleased with how our European business continues to perform. If you go back when we initiated the one LKQ Europe program and formally gave margin targets. We basically call for exiting sustainable double digit margins at the end of 2021 backwards in September of 2019. Amazing how fast time goes by, but we are now in the last six months of that three-year journey. And the way the team has navigated these incredibly choppy and turbulent times, with a pandemic thrown in for good measure has been nothing short of phenomenal, really pleased with the team out there, as you obviously have made out, we do have a number of relatively new leaders out there also. But really, the point being in terms of the talent that we needed, we have out there this point of time, very optimistic about the future also, more to the point about your specific question about a slowdown in the second half. Not really, if you actually go back and see the European business historically, and obviously take our 2020 because that was the pandemic here, or at least and it's still continuing. But if you drill back historically, Q1 and Q2, typically are strong Q3 is also relatively strong. But then Q4 is typically, seasonally the weakest for our European business. So it's really it's kind of seasonal is what we are thinking about in terms of how we are forecasting that European business more than anything else, as of now. There obviously are, a lot of flip flop measures taking place as the country opens, as the country, not open yesterday morning, the United Kingdom said that EU and U.S. travelers that have had the double jab would be welcomed without a quarantine, one never knows, you know whether that continues or not. About four weeks ago, we held our European leadership conference that was held virtually, all of our platform leaders that were on the continent did make it into our European headquarters in Switzerland, with the exception of our UK leadership team. And again, that just tells you in terms of what's happening out there. But overall, the way the program is coming along, how the team \u2013 is executing, we feel good about it. And that is essentially, what gives us the confidence to be able to lift the floor on the 9.2 to up to 10/3 up by about 30 basis points to a 9/5 to a 10.3% full year segment EBITDA margin for the European business. And let me kind of just one final piece, also say these numbers include roughly about 20 to 30 basis points of transformation expenses. And at times, it is easy to overlook those pieces, but that is also a drag. But that is the way we have been reporting it. So that number that I just quoted, includes at least in the first half of 20 basis points drag, you can obviously take that away. And, clearly we do expect to accelerate the transformation efforts in the second half. Stephanie Moore : Great. Nick Zarcone : And Stephanie some of the seasonality just goes along with holiday patterns. Obviously, August tend to be a very soft month in this industry as people are on vacation in Europe. And then once you get to the holidays, things really shut down, really after the pretty close to the second half of December. Stephanie Moore : Great and that makes sense. Thank you so much for your time. Varun Laroyia : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next one is Gary Prestopino from Barrington Research. Please go ahead. Gary Prestopino : Hey, good morning, everyone. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Gary. Varun Laroyia : Gary. Gary Prestopino : Nick, could you give me those statistics on the collision claims in the quarter from CCC? I couldn't write it down fast enough, do you have that? Nick Zarcone : Absolutely. So we think that the best way to look at it given the I mean, the total disruption in 2020 is to compare our organic growth because collision claims actually in the second quarter of 2019, which was a normal year for CCC when comparing 2021 to 2019 was down 15%, 15% and LKQ organic was down 9%. Gary Prestopino : Okay, 9%. Thank you. Then, just in terms of you guys have done a lot of great work on getting the OpEx down a little, can you run the business starts growing again, when things do return in normal. I mean, can you run the business in a somewhat more of a growth mode, like say 4% to 7% while holding the personnel expenses as a percent of sales at that 15.6% or as you grow, you've got to add more people? Nick Zarcone : Well, there's no doubt, but as we grow from a overall dollar perspective than that means, more deliveries, more trucks on the road, more people in the warehouse. We can't just grow revenue and not add back any headcount. But I've been pretty straightforward with all of my direct reports that we need to see the revenue rebound prior to bringing and adding personnel or any really, any real expense back onto the P&L. And so, we think that on -- take North America, set our ongoing basis, we've reset sustainable margins in the high 16s. And if you recall, 2018, we are 12, 7 2019. We are 13, 7 at our Analysts Day in 2020. We -- addressing people to be north of 15. Last quarter, we told people in the low 16s and here what's on people on a permanent basis. Long term when you take out all the ancillary ups and downs related to them that [indiscernible] like high 16s is a good target. And so and we anticipate that we're going to have to bring some level of expense back to allow us to have the capacity to grow our revenue base. Gary Prestopino : Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Nick Zarcone, please continue. Nick Zarcone : Well, we certainly appreciate your time and attention here this morning. Your interest in LKQ means a lot to us. We'd look forward to having another conversation with you in about 90 days when we report our third quarter results at the end of October. So we'll talk to everybody at that point in time, but again, we appreciate your interest and once again, a big shout out to the 43,000 folks who come to work every day at LKQ. You really make the magic happen. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Lisa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to LKQ Corporation's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations for LKQ Corporation. Joseph Boutross : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.  During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we're planning to file our 10-Q in the next few days. And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Dominick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter, and then Varun will dive into the financial details as well as our outlook for the balance of 2021, before I come back with a few closing remarks.  This was another quarter of significant operating progress at LKQ, driven by excellent execution in delivering solid financial performance, all while navigating the challenges with the supply chain and the current cost environment. We were able to produce yet another record quarter, and this represents the fifth consecutive quarter with the highest EPS reported in their respective quarters. The third quarter also reflects the second time we've been able to achieve more than $1 of earnings per share on an adjusted basis and reflects the highest third quarter segment EBITDA margin in the history of the company.  We are particularly pleased that our European business delivered its highest segment EBITDA level in over 9 years, exceeding the 11% level. Varun will dig into the margin details shortly.  While I recognize the listeners are primarily focused on the financial results, I know our performance is a reflection of the dedication and effort of our 45,000 team members around the globe who are working hard to serve our customers. I hope you can appreciate that I am more excited about the performance of my team than the quarterly results as they are the key to continued excellence. With respect to capital allocation, as you hopefully read from our press release issued this morning, I am very pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has declared the company's first-ever quarterly cash dividend. This dividend declaration and our existing stock repurchase program are key components of our strategic plan to drive total long-term returns for our stockholders. Our solid balance sheet and sustainable cash flow generation, coupled with our leading market positions across our operating segments, provide us with the opportunity to execute on that plan. The quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share will be paid on December 2, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 11.  Now on to the quarter. Revenue for the third quarter of 2021 was $3.3 billion, an increase of 8.2% as compared to the $3.0 billion in the third quarter of 2020. During the third quarter, total parts and services revenue increased 6%, comprising organic growth of 4%, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increasing revenue by 0.5% and foreign exchange rates increasing revenue by 1.5%. Net income for the third quarter of 2021 was $284 million as compared to $194 million for the same period last year, an increase of 46.4%. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.96 a share as compared to $0.64 a share for the same period of 2020, an increase of 50%.  On an adjusted basis, net income in the third quarter was $300 million compared to $228 million in the same period of 2020, a 31.6% increase. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $1.02 as compared to $0.75 for the same period of 2020, a 36% increase.  Now let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. Slide 5 sets forth the revenue trends for the quarter, and you can see growth rates improved year-over-year for all segments. The vaccination rates in our key geographic markets continued to improve; but as we progressed throughout the quarter, we started to face headwinds related to the rise in the Delta variant and also challenges with the aftermarket supply chain, both of which impacted organic growth across each of the segments.  Turning to North America. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, fuel consumption for the third quarter was 8.6% above the prior year and 1.3% below the third quarter of 2019. From Slide 6, you will note that organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment increased 5.9% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. When looking at our performance relative to collision and liability repairable claims this quarter, given the aberrations associated with the significant swings in 2020, we believe the most relevant comparison is to the third quarter of 2019.  During Q3, organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment declined about 7% on a per day basis relative to 2019 levels, while repairable claims declined 10.6%, so it was another period of outperformance for our North American operations. During the third quarter, our salvage business and the growth of our major mechanical product groups had solid performance. Although fill rates have been challenged, we are witnessing a positive offset from our quote conversion rates on salvage parts. Importantly, as we progressed through the third quarter and entered Q4, we've witnessed an increase in availability of the auctions, and prices are moderating versus what we experienced earlier in the year.  Also, Elitek, our diagnostic and calibration services business, continued to exceed our expectations, with September being the highest monthly level of diagnostic scans since building out this business, a clear sign that shops and carriers are embracing this unique service offering. For those on the call that will be attending the SEMA event next week, Elitek will have a presence at the show. So please come visit, and you can see why we are excited about this growth opportunity.  Moving on to our European segment. Organic revenue for parts and services in the third quarter increased 0.1% on a reported basis and 0.3% on a per day basis. When compared to the third quarter of 2019, our European revenue was down just 1% on a per day basis. So we have made progress on getting back to pre-pandemic levels and are optimistic we will move ahead of the 2019 levels in the next quarter or 2. From an overall mobility perspective, virtually every European market experienced flat growth in the quarter, which we believe is a sign that the spike we witnessed in the second quarter due to the reopening of the economy subsided sequentially in Q3. Our regional operations continued to experience varying revenue performance in the quarter. Our Eastern European business had the strongest recovery despite a very competitive pricing environment. Germany and the Benelux markets also delivered well above total segment growth. The drag in growth was primarily driven by negative growth in Italy, a market that continues to face very difficult conditions. Other items to note in Europe would include the fact that on September 6, we celebrated the grand opening of our new Innovation and Service Center in Katowice, Poland that began operations earlier in the quarter. Also, on October 1, just after the close of the third quarter, we acquired a company named Hamu, which operates 9 locations in the Central Netherlands region. With over 100 employees, Hamu is one of the largest independent automotive parts wholesalers in the Netherlands.  Now let's move on to our Specialty segment, which again delivered solid performance during the third quarter by reporting organic revenue growth on a same-day basis of 13.7%. As witnessed in the first half of the year, the drivers of this ongoing performance continued to be strong demand for parts related to RVs and light trucks as well as our drop-ship business. On October 1, we finalized the acquisition of SeaWide Marine Distribution, a nationwide electronics wholesale distributor that supplies electrical and electronic products for the marine, outdoor and personal navigation markets. This acquisition is consistent with the strategy of entering adjacent markets that Bill Rogers highlighted during our 2020 Investor Day.  Marine products overlapped nicely with our RV and towing product portfolio. Importantly, SeaWide now has the benefit of leveraging our network of 8 specialty distribution centers in over 40 cross-docks that are strategically located to provide next-day service throughout North America. According to the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the total addressable market for the wholesale product SeaWide offers is over $3 billion. Lastly, I want to acknowledge and congratulate the Specialty team for being recognized as the RV Industry Association Distributor of the Year at the recent 2021 RV Aftermarket Conference in Atlanta, a tremendous accomplishment.  In addition to the Hamu and Seawide Marine acquisitions, other corporate development transactions included divesting all of our equity interest in a very small joint venture in the U.K. And acquiring a business in the United States that remanufactures torque converters, a product used in the remanufacturing of automatic transmissions.  The global supply chain continues to be under duress. It is widely known that, today, a record number of ships are anchored off the coast of California waiting for port lanes to unload containers, some of which hold our aftermarket inventory and are eventually headed to LKQ facilities. High demand for overseas products, congestions within the ports and at the rail hubs and a severe shortage of truck drivers, has led to delays and increased cost for ocean and land freight, both in North America and in Europe. The recent initiatives across the globe to begin tackling components of these route issues, such as the measures implemented by the Port of Los Angeles on October 12, are encouraging. But we expect overarching supply chain issues to persist in the near to midterm. We are doing our best to effectively navigate the difficult environment, and we are hopeful that we won't be talking about the supply chain challenges and reading draconian headlines on a daily basis at this time next year.  Alongside supply chain inflationary pressures, like many businesses across the globe, we are facing wage inflation and increased competition for labor. We are constantly looking at our wage structure and turnover rates across all of our segments to ensure we stay ahead of any competitive pressures and to help backfill the open positions with the best candidates we can attract.  Now a brief update on some of our ongoing ESG efforts. During the quarter, we established the LKQ Cares ESG Advisory Committee, which is comprised of key leaders across our company. The purpose of the committee is to support and provide advice regarding LKQ Corporation's ongoing commitment to environmental matters, social responsibility, corporate governance and many other public policies relevant to our company.  Additionally, with inclusion being a core value at LKQ, I am excited to announce that LKQ has joined the Second Chance Business Coalition, a nationwide effort to create economic opportunity for approximately 78 million Americans trying to get back on their feet and contribute to society. We are proud to be alongside 35 other large public and private companies that also believe that supporting those seeking a second chance in life not only provides opportunities for the individual but also for their families and for their communities. It's simply the right thing to do.  Lastly, as you may have read, we are both humbled and honored that LKQ North America has been recognized by WorkBuzz, an independent global employee engagement firm as a 5-Star Employer after receiving positive feedback from our first-ever employee engagement survey. Part of our mission statement is to build strong partnerships with our employees and the communities in which we operate. And this award validates that our inclusive and engaged teams are proudly carrying this mission forward. And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run through the details of the strong third quarter financial performance. Varun Laroyia : Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. Our third quarter results reflect continued evidence of the benefits of the operational excellence initiatives we instituted a few years ago. Record profitability and continued robust free cash flow just don't happen by accident. The team's focus on getting the fundamentals right, continuous improvement and winning each day has driven these strong results under what are incredibly challenging conditions, with a congested supply chain and strong inflationary pressures. I'd like to start with a few highlights before getting into the details. As you heard from Nick, Europe achieved segment EBITDA of 11.5% for the quarter. This gives us the confidence to narrow the full year segment EBITDA range for 2021 further to 9.8% up to 10.3%, effectively lifting the floor by a further 30 basis points. Specialty delivered yet another excellent organic revenue quarter at 13.7% despite the ongoing supply chain challenges. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of robust double-digit organic revenue growth for the segment. Cash flow generation remains strong. And the conversion ratio relative to earnings continues to be above our long-term expectation despite a challenging environment.  The share repurchase program carried on with a further 4.3 million shares purchased in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 12 million shares and the program to date of 29.3 million shares repurchased. And finally, the initiation of a regular quarterly dividend reflects the confidence in our strategy and the strength of our business, underscoring our commitment to deliver long-term value to our stockholders.  Now I'll move to the consolidated financial results. As Nick described, Q3 was another successful quarter with growth in revenue, EBITDA margin, cash flow and earnings per share. Gross margin was again a highlight for the quarter, increasing 150 basis points relative to the prior year. We continue to feel pressure on input costs across each of our segments, but we have been able to mitigate the effects by being nimble to adjust to the new reality of higher input costs by adjusting pricing. Gross margin also benefited from the tailwinds of commodity prices, although at a much lower level than we've seen in prior quarters.  Car costs remain relatively high. And with the moderation of precious metal prices in the quarter as seen on Slide 27, the benefit dipped relative to the first half of the year. We estimate that scrap steel and precious metal prices added roughly $12 million in segment EBITDA and $0.03 in adjusted EPS relative to last year. As a reminder, this benefit is well below the $57 million in segment EBITDA and $0.14 in adjusted EPS from metal prices experienced in the second quarter of 2021.  Overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 50 basis points year-over-year, largely driven by personnel costs. The tight labor market has pushed wages higher in many of our markets. Additionally, strong performance across all 3 segments is contributing to increased levels of incentive compensation in 2021, which represents 30 basis points of higher expense. Other overhead expenses are slightly favorable, as we're offsetting inflation in freight and fuel through operating efficiencies and leverage from higher scrap and core revenue.  I'll now turn to the segment operating results. Starting on Slide 10, North America produced an EBITDA margin of 17.3% for the quarter, down 30 basis points from a year ago. Gross margin was favorable by 60 basis points, primarily coming out of the ongoing margin initiatives in the wholesale business and improved pricing. Self-service increased gross margin dollars compared to 2020 but generated a lower margin percentage due to an increase in car cost and moderating metal prices. Segment overhead expenses increased by 100 basis points, with the largest change owing to personnel expenses. Roughly half of the increase is attributable to wages and temporary labor, with the remainder in higher incentive compensation. At the segment EBITDA line, the metals prices benefit noted previously generated 20 basis points of improvement relative to last year.  I previously mentioned Europe's strong margin for the quarter, and Slide 11 shows the details. Adjusted gross margin increased by 240 basis points to the highest level in recent years, primarily owing to better net pricing while overhead expenses grew by 30 basis points, driven by higher wages and incentive compensation.  Moving to Slide 12. Specialty grew EBITDA dollars though experienced 100 basis points of dilution in margin. The primary factors contributing to the decrease are : one, higher incentive compensation; inflationary pressures in the segment's 1 operations, which are behind the 30 basis point decrease in gross margin; and finally, duplicative costs associated with acquisitions done in the current fiscal year, which we expect to be transitory as the team integrates the acquired businesses over the remainder of the year and into early 2022.  Similar to the first half of 2021, we are also delivering benefits from our focus on the capital structure. The early redemption of the 2026 euro notes in April of this year created interest expense savings. Additionally, deploying free cash flow to debt paydowns and share repurchases generated interest expense savings and an EPS benefit from a reduced share count. We estimate that these factors added roughly $0.06 per share to our third quarter results. and based on the characteristics of these initiatives, are expected to continue to deliver over multiple periods. Additionally, income from our equity method and other investments generated a further $0.02 of year-over-year growth. Given the improved expectation for full year profitability, we decreased our projected effective tax rate in our outlook from 26.25% to 25.75%, which contributed to a $0.04 per share year-over-year benefit in the third quarter.  So to recap, our adjusted EPS of $1.02 is a $0.27 increase over the third quarter of 2020; the commodity benefits, as previously stated, were $0.03; investments generated a further $0.02; the tax rate, our capital deployment and a slight tailwind from foreign exchange produced about $0.10 of the improvement; the remaining $0.12 comes from our operating performance, by far the single largest contributor to the results.  Shifting to liquidity and capital allocation. We continued the trend of robust cash flow generation in the third quarter with $429 million of operating cash flow and $384 million of free cash flow. Our conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow was a very strong 84%, roughly in line with our year-to-date ratio, as seen on Slide 14. Our operating cash flows were driven by cash earnings and favorable movement in trade working capital balances. Payables represented an inflow for the quarter as we benefit from extended payment terms, including our European vendor financing initiative.  Inventory was an outflow of $60 million for the quarter. But similar to the second quarter, we were unable to increase our purchasing to the designed level owing to the supply chain issues that are affecting many sectors of the economy. We are actively working to rebuild inventory levels, and we believe that our excellent relationships with suppliers and liquidity on hand puts us in a good position to acquire the needed inventory when supply chain congestion finally eases. We deployed the free cash flow to repurchase 4.3 million shares in the quarter for $219 million, acquired 2 tuck-in businesses for $37 million and repaid $23 million in outstanding borrowings. Our net leverage ratio dropped to 1.1x EBITDA, and interest coverage now exceeds 24x compared to the credit facility requirements of 4.25x and 3x, respectively. Or said differently, at this point in time, we do not need to devote further capital towards paying debt, and as you saw in the third quarter results also.  With $1.6 billion in availability on our credit facility and approximately $400 million in cash, we have over $2 billion in liquidity to fund our strategic objectives. The liquidity amount is roughly $800 million below our December 31, 2020 figure, reflecting the use of liquidity to redeem the 2026 EUR 0.75 billion euro notes, prepay our outstanding term loan balance of $319 million as well as the termination of the $110 million receivable securitization program earlier this year in July. We felt comfortable reducing the overall capacity owing to our ability to sustainably generate robust free cash flow.  As you can imagine, we have carefully considered our liquidity position and future cash flow generation prospects in reaching the decision to initiate the quarterly cash dividend. We are confident in the company's ability to convert earnings to free cash flow in a ratio of 55% to 60% on a long-term basis, which provides us with sufficient cash to fund a dividend while continuing to repurchase shares, reinvest in the business and make accretive acquisitions.  Initiating a dividend is an important milestone in the company's history and reflects the Board and the management team's confidence in our near- and long-term prospects. The decision to pay a dividend is consistent with, and does not change, our approach to capital allocation, which prioritizes growth investments and return excess cash to shareholders to enhance their returns. Our share repurchase program will run in tandem with the dividend program as part of our balanced approach to capital allocation.  I will wrap up my prepared comments with our updated thoughts on the full year 2021. Consistent with the level of detail we have provided in recent quarters, we are comfortable making the following statements, all of which that assume that there are no significant negative developments related to the COVID-19 in our major markets or foreign exchange rates and scrap and precious metal prices hold near recent levels in the remainder of the year.  The first statement being, with yet another excellent quarter in Q3, we are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.78 to $3.88 with a midpoint of $3.83. This is an increase of $0.18 or 5% at the midpoint over our prior quarter guidance and an increase of $1.08 or 39% relative to our original 2021 full year guidance. The increases reflect the benefits of our ongoing margin and operating expense programs and our strategic cash deployment, which have allowed us to mitigate strong inflationary headwinds related to labor, freight, fuel and inventory costs prevalent throughout the industry.  While we expect our operational performance in Q4 to play out roughly in line with prior guidance, we are projecting a negative impact of roughly $0.02 a share, resulting from metal prices as these move lower going into the fourth quarter. As you think about the comparison to the fourth quarter of 2020, we are forecasting a $0.07 per share negative year-over-year effect related to sequential movements in metal prices. Additionally, having 1 fewer selling day in the North America and Specialty segments in the fourth quarter of 2021 creates a further $0.02 headwind. A lower share count and tax rate in 2021 should mitigate some of the year-over-year headwinds. The second statement I would like to share with everyone is we are narrowing the range for full year European segment EBITDA margin to 9.8% up to 10.3%, effectively raising the floor by a further 30 basis points, similar to what we did roughly 90 days ago following the second quarter earnings.  And finally, we continue to generate outstanding free cash flow through strong profitability and judicious use of trade working capital. With this in mind, along with higher projected net income for the year, we are raising our free cash flow guidance to a range of $1.15 billion to $1.3 billion, with $1.225 billion at the midpoint.  Despite the supply chain challenges, we still anticipate an inventory increase in the fourth quarter, ahead of the traditionally strong Q1 and Q2 seasonal demand, although not to the level assumed in prior guidance, as a portion of the build would likely be deferred into 2022.  With that, thank you for your time this morning. And I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments. Dominick Zarcone : Thank you, Varun. Let me restate our key initiatives, which continue to be central to our culture and our objectives. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And fourth, as always, we will continue to invest in our future.  As Henry Ford once said, obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off of your goal. 2021 continues to be a year where our global teams have never lost sight of our shared goal of driving long-term value for our stockholders. And for that, I offer a heartfelt thank you to each of our 45,000-plus team members that make it happen each and every day. And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : When you think about the Elitek or Elitek business and I guess the incremental margin that you own the hardware. I guess scans would have a fairly high incremental margin. How do you see that business sort of shaping out from a longer-term contribution? I guess what sort of size and maybe what the margin profile might be if you think out a year or 2 or 3? Dominick Zarcone : Yes. Great question, Bret. When we first started thinking about services as a nice adjacency to our parts distribution business, and that came back in 2017, part of the reason it was so attractive is because services businesses have significantly higher margins. And I will tell you that our Elitek margins are well ahead of our parts distribution margins, and it requires relatively little capital. So the return on invested capital is very attractive, very attractive. Again, this is still a relatively small business for us, kind of in and around that $50 million range. But our goal is to grow it very, very rapidly, not by orders of 5% or 10% a year, but our goal would be to multiply the size of the business over the next several years.  It will probably never be a $1 billion or $2 billion business for us, but it's a great adjacency at really attractive margins and, probably most importantly, a really good return on invested capital. Bret Jordan : Okay. And a quick question. One of your peers in Europe was commenting about share shifts and maybe share gains, particularly around the U.K. market. Do you see anything changing over there from a competitive landscape? Are smaller players giving up share at a higher rate? Or maybe give us some color there. Dominick Zarcone : Sure. Overall, Bret, I will tell you, we are incredibly pleased, incredibly pleased with how our U.K. business performed in the quarter. There's no great data with respect to share on a quarterly basis, but we are absolutely sensing, and this goes across pretty much all of our businesses, not just the U.K., that small distributors are getting squeezed right now. And the larger, more well-capitalized market participants are doing much better.  Our revenue was not overly robust in the third quarter in the U.K., but our margins hit an all-time high since we acquired ECP back in 2011. And we continue to be the market share leader in the U.K. by a wide margin. We think we're going to continue to keep that position into perpetuity. And we are very happy with our third quarter performance and long-term outlook for the business over there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Truist. Stephanie Moore : Congrats on a nice quarter. I wanted to touch a little bit, I know in your prepared remarks, and Varun specifically stated that a lot of the margin improvement in Europe was pricing-driven. But also I know that there's a lot of moving pieces at the current moment as you kind of work through your 1 LKQ. So maybe if you could just give us an update on where we stand today, if anything was accelerated versus prior plans and how we should think about progression as we go into the fourth quarter in terms of some of these initiatives. And if COVID has kind of gotten in the way of any of those. Dominick Zarcone : Yes, great question. We would probably characterize, since the World Series is going on, use a baseball analogy, we're probably in the fourth inning in the 1 LKQ Europe Program. We stated back in 2019 and then again at our Investor Day in 2020 that our midterm goal was to get annual margins, not quarterly margins, but annual margins, in and around that 11% range. We think we can do better than that on a longer-term basis. We've gone from effectively 8% when we announced the whole program margins in Europe to what we think is going to be, as Varun indicated, pretty close to 10% this year. And so yes, we would think we're in about the fourth inning. COVID clearly has thrown everybody some curveballs, it has thrown out some curveballs. Some things just got delayed a little bit. Other things got accelerated. Originally, the Innovation and Service Center in Katowice, Poland was later in our plan, and we actually pulled that forward. Really think about that as a shared service center, where we're moving some administrative activities to a much lower cost marketplace. And so that's gotten pulled forward.  The ERP implementation got pushed back effectively by a quarter or two. But we still have a lot of runway to go on our program. There's a lot of initiatives that are still in the forefront that we need to execute on. But overall, we are extremely pleased with our progress thus far and confident in our ability to get to the longer-term goals. Stephanie Moore : Great. And then talking about the supply chain disruption, and I agree there's always a new headline every day. I think you made the point, particularly with the free cash flow, is unable to purchase some of the inventory to meet desired demand levels that you would like in the quarter, but you're working with your partners now. I mean is this a function of it just taking longer and it's just being more the ability to kind of have that flexibility, that it's just not arriving as quickly? Or are you having to use other modes of transportation? I would love just to get more color as you manage just the current situation. Dominick Zarcone : Yes. The big issue with the supply chain, and this is not unique to LKQ, it's not unique to our industry, right? The fact of the matter is out in California, there's 80 ships anchored, waiting for a berth in the ports. If you did that on a national basis, I think you're somewhere around 100 ships. Many of those ships have our product -- our containers sitting on it, right?  And it's not just an issue with the ports. The reality is there's a lot of data out there that's showing that there's just not enough truckers turning up to get the containers out of the ports. There's a severe shortage of drivers. Most folks estimate this country is down about 80,000 truck drivers. The warehouses where the containers ultimately need to go are clogged. And importantly, containers get put on a chassis, which is then connected to the tractor of the semi-tractor combination, there's a severe shortage of chassis available.  So the supply chain is a bit of a mess completely. And so yes, it's taking much longer for us to get our product, say from Taiwan into the United States. It's costing us some more money. It's important to recognize that the inventory is ours when it hits the port in Taiwan. So that's our inventory, not the supplier's inventory, sitting out on the water. And so we're being very thoughtful as to putting in advance orders, making sure we can do whatever we can to get the inventory that we need.  The bad news is we're not -- we don't have the inventory levels that we prefer. The good news is we think we're doing significantly better than our small competitors. I mean think about it, we bring in 16,000 containers a year, that's about 300 a week, from the Far East for our North American aftermarket parts business. Our small competitors, they'd be lucky if they bring in 300 a year or even 50 a year. So we feel we're -- from a fulfillment rate basis, we're doing much better than the small competitors. And we know that because there have been a few smaller folks basically waving the white flag and asking if we'd be interested in buying their business. So again, it's going to be a challenge going forward. We think we're doing a pretty effective job of managing our way through that challenge. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig Kennison : Just a follow-up, Nick, on your last point with respect to looking at small businesses to acquire. Would there be any case to make that you could buy them for something close to the value of their inventory just to help with your own fulfillment rates? Dominick Zarcone : Well, in many of the cases, the only thing of value to us would be their inventory. We don't need additional warehouses in the United States. We don't need more fleet. Clearly, we all share the same customers, so inventory would be particularly attractive. Craig Kennison : Okay. And then I guess I wanted to ask a question about the innovation center in Poland, which we watched the video on that earlier this quarter. But could you just give us a feel for the kind of tools or applications that you would expect to develop? And how those tools kind of improve your moat in Europe? Varun Laroyia : Craig, it's Varun out here. Let me take this one. So essentially, the innovation center is effectively what we had talked about as part of the 1 LKQ Europe Program of setting up a lower-cost shared service center, no different to global business services at other companies.  Within the industry but also among broader companies, having a lower-cost back office to do commoditized transaction processing, but also, in the case of Poland, we believe there is some good digital and technology talent. And that really is the background to what we're trying to do from a Katowice perspective. As you know, we obviously have Bangalore. And now putting up another center certainly gives us the geographic breadth, language capabilities, not just to do some of the more, I'd say, regularly expected back-office activities, but also to invest in things such as digital. We clearly know that while B2B and the different market, the do-it-for-me market, is clearly the biggest piece serving Europe, but there is some adjacency associated with B2C. And being able to do some of that back-office work and the technology work out of Katowice in Poland, which does have talent, we believe there is some goodness associated with it. That really is the backdrop to the Katowice, Poland innovation center. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Butler with Stifel. Brian Butler : Just can you circle back on the metals, and both scrap and precious. When you think about what's kind of -- maybe what's embedded in the full year guidance and how that compares to, I guess, historical levels that typically have been a little bit lower? Varun Laroyia : Brian, it's Varun. Actually, let me take that one. So yes, within -- in the third quarter, as I called out, the total metals benefit, both scrap and catalytic inverter, so precious metals, was about $12 million or roughly about $0.03 within the $1.02 of adjusted EPS. Relative to what we experienced in the first half of the year, if you recall, in Q1, it was a $34 million upside; in Q2 was roughly $57 million, so significant upside.  But really, what we saw come through was starting in September, we saw scrap metal prices, but also more to the point, precious metal prices began to drop pretty significantly. And so that piece, despite the fact that those metal prices were dropping, car costs remained relatively high. And so the overall metals benefit was muted.  And really what we've seen exiting September, as we've shown on Slide #27 also for the benefit of everybody, you see that bigger slide begin to take place in September. And so from a Q4 forecast perspective, we are actually, as of now, anticipating that to be a negative impact from metals pricing rather than an ongoing benefit.  So if you think about the first half versus the second half, in the first half, we said we pretty much got close to, I'd say, $90 million of EBITDA from metals, be it precious or scrap. In the third quarter, it was about $12 million, which kind of gives you a year-to-date of about $103 million. And in the fourth quarter, we see an unwind of anything up to $30 million taking place. So that's how you should think about it. Clearly, it's a volatile market as of now. Things are changing on a daily, weekly basis, but that's how we think about the metals pricing, which underpins our forecast that we've provided. Brian Butler : All right. That's very helpful. And then shifting gears, can we talk about collision repair? And with the supply chain disruption that you're seeing, has there been a greater demand for recycled parts? And just kind of what trends you're seeing there maybe on price in that -- the attractiveness of those items? Dominick Zarcone : Yes. Brian, this is Nick. You've hit the nail on the head. Obviously, the aftermarket part availability is constrained a bit because of all the supply chain challenges we've already talked about. Salvage parts come from the local markets, right? We buy total loss vehicles locally, we dismantle them locally and then we can distribute on a local basis. And there absolutely has been a bit of a shift. And I would say this primarily benefits us relative to anybody else because we are the only company that can offer both salvaged and recycled product and the aftermarket collision parts. And so we have absolutely are seeing our -- the growth in our salvage business in the quarter and actually for the last few quarters has been well above the growth and the revenue trends in the aftermarket product.  And part of that is due to the strong mechanical business, engines and transmissions, that we talked about in our formal comments. And part of it is this ability to, in certain times, shift the customer from an aftermarket product that we may not have an inventory to a salvage product that we can get to them same day or next day. So the salvage business has been very good. And again, we're the only company in this country that offers both product lines. Brian Butler : Perfect. And then if I could maybe just ask one last one. When you look at the replacement parts cost for EV vehicles versus internal combustion, what trends are you still seeing there? I mean is it still EV parts continue to be more expensive? Or as we're seeing more EVs out there, are those prices coming down for the replacement parts? Dominick Zarcone : Yes. No, broadly, we are, we're maybe in the top of the first in the whole EV marketplace and the transition and the like. So there are no big trends. There are no shifts.  What we will tell you is that when you look at hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles, technical service parts command anywhere from a 2x to 6x premium relative to their comparable internal combustion engine counterparts. And there's a number of reasons for that. One is the technical complexity, not just with batteries, but also with the electrification of components previously belt-driven such as air conditioning, compressors and water pumps. For an example, this is just one example. A 2013 Prius with an electric water pump, that water pump sells for 3x the value of a 2013 Corolla that has a belt-driven water pump. In the U.K., for example, a 2017 Golf with an internal combustion engine, that water pump sells for about \u00a377. The Lexus hybrid EV, the water pump is \u00a3278.  And so yes, the EV parts are much more expensive. We think that's going to continue to be the case for a long, long time. And that's why we are doing what we can, and we're at the initial stages of gearing up our ability to distribute those EV-related parts. The reality is the aftermarket for EV vehicle parts is nascent, but there's nobody in a better position to distribute those parts than LKQ. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Daniel Imbro : Congratulations on the good quarter. I've got a couple of quick questions. One on the follow-up on pricing. I don't think you just mentioned it there. But obviously, pricing at the OEMs took it up during the quarter. Can you quantify maybe how much same fuel inflation you saw in North America here? And then longer term related to price, now that the OEMs took a price and I saw that you guys followed very rationally, is there maybe a backdrop for the OEMs become more rational taking up price going forward, knowing that you're going to follow and maybe the whole market can be more rational passing through some of these costs in North America? Varun Laroyia : Daniel, let me answer that one. With regards to inflationary pressures, let's be clear about it, no one is immune to them at this point of time, okay? It's not just us, it's not just the OEMs, it's across every pretty much sector across the economy. So that's kind of point number one. It's just a fact of life at this point of time.  The second one is, yes, folks that are acting on a rational basis, they're trying to protect margins. You've obviously seen 2 of the 3 big OEMs report in the last 48 hours, and as to what they've been talking about with regards to chip shortages and as to what's happening to new car sales and stuff. But yes, there's less discounting taking place within their markets also. And obviously, I think you follow some of the auto retailers also in terms of what's happening out there.  So at this point of time, given the scarcity of being able to get product in, given the supply chain challenges, we expect folks are acting on a rational basis because no one really knows, as of now, how long the supply chain congestion is expected to last. So if someone does want to not act on a rational basis for a week, 2 weeks, a month, a quarter, at some point of time, it will come back and bite him.  It's no different to what we at LKQ did when the pandemic initially struck in Q1 of 2020, moved incredibly fast to kind of take care of what we could control, which was our cost structure. And that obviously has now morphed into inflation and also supply chain congestion. So we expect folks will be acting on a rational basis because no one really knows how long this is going to continue to last.  And so what the OEMs may or may not do, listen, I can't speculate sitting out here, that is their call. We do know that what we at LKQ do and what we plan to do, given the market conditions, the key in all of this is to be nimble, is to be agile and to be dynamic and be able to react as an organization at relatively short notice. And just really happy with the way our teams continue to do that. Daniel Imbro : Yes. That makes sense. And then a follow-up on personnel expenses, Varun. I think in your prepared comments, you noted that North America and Europe saw some pressure from temporary labor. Obviously, you take what you just said, over the last 18 months, you guys took out a bunch of costs, a bunch of duplicative positions. Can you maybe talk about how transitory you view these labor headwinds, how you're navigating the backdrop and whether you're having to add back any of those costs? Or is this just something to do with the demand you're seeing today? Varun Laroyia : Yes. No, absolutely. And great question out there, Daniel. Yes, listen, 18 months ago, when the pandemic initially struck, it was a case of ensuring that our balance sheet and our cost structure was aligned to what the new demand forecast realities were, okay? And so as a distribution business, we were able to move quick. And as that dragged on, I think before the end of the second quarter of 2020, we actually moved those temporary reductions into permanent reductions. And I think folks appreciated what we did.  At this point of time, it is all demand-related, whether it be in Europe, whether it be in North America or for that matter, in our Specialty segment. And that piece is being exacerbated by the fact that there's just a real shortage of talent.  Nick talked about, say, for example, on the delivery side. It's the same thing across the business. Because as of now, folks have kind of moved on to online in a pretty big way, and so warehouse demand, warehouse folk demand has been strong. And so from that perspective and the talent and the labor shortages, we're having to pay up. And we will do so because that is the kind of core of our business.  So with regards to it being transitory or not, this is where the reality is. Unlike commodity prices, fuel or metals or whatever it is, there could be certain spikes and drops within their cycle, wages are notoriously sticky. Once you've been paying at a certain rate, you can't go back 3 months or 6 months later and say, \"Oh, actually, you know what, now there's a different situation and now this is what we will be doing.\" That is just not the way to drive trust in what we call our single most valuable asset. So that is not what we do.  Yes, what we do, do is here at LKQ, we have a very strong value proposition for being part of the LKQ family, whether it be our retirement plan offerings, whether it be our health care benefits, the tuition reimbursements, the scholarships and many of those kind of pieces. And yes, we are also doing certain one-off items, all in all, to try and ensure that the entire overall base doesn't move into the future literally dollar for dollar. So there are certain elements which we believe are going to drive talent retention, rather than someone wanting to move just for the next extra dollar or 2 as such. But that's really how we're thinking about it. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Nick Zarcone for closing remarks. Dominick Zarcone : Well, thank you, everyone. We certainly appreciate your time and attention here this morning. We look forward to chatting with you on the 17th of February when we announce our fourth quarter results.  And importantly, I'd like to just highlight and have you circle your calendars. We are going to be having an Analyst and Investor Day in late February or early March, probably the last week in February or the first week of March in 2022. And so we look forward to having an opportunity to more broadly share our thoughts as to the future of our company at that point in time.  So again, we appreciate your time and attention, and we hope you have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-K in the coming days. 02:15 And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Dominick Zarcone : 02:20 Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will provide some high level comments related to our performance in the quarter and full year 2021 and then, Varun will dive into the financial details and discuss our 2022 outlook, before I come back with a few closing remarks. 02:40 Before I begin, on behalf of everyone at LKQ, I again want to express our sincere thanks to all those on the front lines who are working hard to keep our communities and our citizens safe and healthy. I also extend condolences to all those who have suffered a personal loss during this unfortunate pandemic. It seems like everyone know someone who has been seriously impacted by COVID. While we've made great strides across the globe combating the pandemic, it is still a harsh reality that we all have to confront in our daily lives. 03:20 As most of you know, LKQ spent two decades consolidating fragmented markets into centralized businesses. And in the process, we created the largest and best-in-class operators in each of our major markets. Then, in 2019 we pivoted our strategy to focus on operational excellence. Some folks may have been skeptical about this pivot, but they may not have had a true understanding of our culture, a culture that is centered on outcomes not obstacles, a culture that is agile and nimble and a culture that is LKQ proud. It is with great pride that I can say our teams across all of our segments embraced and delivered on our operational excellence initiatives throughout all of 2021. 04:12 Before I move on to the fourth quarter results, let me highlight just a few of the milestones we achieved in 2021. We had record corporate-wide revenue and profitability. North America EBITDA and EBITDA margins reached their highest full year level in the history of the company. Europe had full-year double-digit EBITDA margins for the first time in over 5 years and reached the upper end of the expectations we set forth a year ago. And there is more runway ahead. 04:49 Especially, we realized record full year revenue and EBITDA margins. We generated our second year of free cash flow of over $1 billion. We maintained net leverage well below our target of 2 times. We achieved an investment grade rating from Fitch. Repurchased 17.2 million shares of stock for a total of $877 million. We issued the first dividend in the industry of the company and we issued our inaugural corporate sustainability report and received an ESG rating of AA from MSCI, which puts LKQ in the top 19% of our index group. These achievements are the result of the combined effort of each individual at LKQ. And for that, I extend a great big thank you to my entire organization. 05:48 Now onto the quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 was $3.2 billion, an increase of 7.9% as compared to the $3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. For the fourth quarter, parts and services organic revenue increased 6.6% on a reported basis and 7.3% on a per day basis. While the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased revenue 1.7% and foreign exchange rates decreased revenue 0.8%, for total parts and services revenue increase of 7.5%. 06:33 Net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $236 million as compared to $180 million for the same period of last year, an increase of 30.6%. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.81 compared to $0.59 for the same period of 2020, an increase of 37.3%. On an adjusted basis, net income in the fourth quarter was $254 million compared to $212 million in the same period of last year, a 20% increase. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.87 as compared to $0.69 for the same period of 2020, a 26.1% increase. 07:25 Net income for the full year of 2021 was $1.1 billion as compared to $639 million for 2020, an increase of 70.7%. Diluted earnings per share for the full year of 2021 was $3.66 as compared to $2.09 for 2020, an increase of 75.1%. On an adjusted basis, net income for the full year of 2021 was $1.2 billion compared to $777 million last year, a 51.8% increase. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year 2021 was $3.96 as compared to $2.55 for 2020, a 55.3% increase. These net income numbers represent a tremendous achievement for the company as we achieved net income in excess of $1 billion in 2021 for the first time in our history. 08:30 Let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 6, organic revenue for parts and services in the quarter for our North American segment increased 8.3% on a reported basis and 9.9% on a per day basis, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. When comparing to pre-pandemic levels, organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment in Q4 of 2021 declined around 5% on a per day basis relative to 2019 levels. Industry data indicates repairable claims declined mid-teens relative to 2019, so it was another quarter of outperformance for our North American operations. 09:23 Our salvage business and the growth in our major mechanical product groups continued its solid performance during the quarter. Although fill rates for aftermarket collision parts have been challenged, we are again witnessing a positive offset from our quote conversion rates on salvage parts. Given the supply chain disruptions, it's no surprise that our aftermarket parts business lagged the results of our recycling and remanufacturing businesses. 09:54 In 2021, our North America salvage operations continued its leadership as the largest recycler of vehicles, by processing over 783,000 vehicles, resulting in, among other things, the recycling of 3.9 million gallons of fuel, 2.2 million gallons of waste oil, 2.1 million tires, 740,000 batteries, and 1.2 million tons of scrap metal. 10:26 Moving to our European segment, organic revenue for parts and services increased 5.7% on a reported basis and 5.4% on a per day basis in the quarter. Demand trends strengthened sequentially in the fourth quarter across all of our European regions. Most of our regional operations experienced similar levels of revenue growth, with standout performance from our parts business in the Benelux region and solid contributions from Germany, the UK and Central and Eastern Europe. On a full year basis, these businesses performed quite well, both on revenue and profitability. Italy again lags relative to our other markets. 11:15 Now let's move on to our specialty segment. During Q4, specialty reported organic revenue growth of 5.7% on a reported basis and 7.3% on a per day basis. Considering the tough comparison to an exceptionally strong 2020, this organic growth exceeded our expectations and reflected a tremendous effort by our specialty team. 11:42 A few specialty operational highlights would include the fact that, due to the specialty segment's Department of Transportation safety scores and positive inspection history, the team is now eligible to participate in the department's pre-pass program. This program allows our drivers to bypass weigh stations and certain ports of entry. The benefits of this program will include faster travel time to the docks, less idling time and higher driver retention. Importantly, this program highlights that health and safety of our employees and our other stakeholders is paramount within our organization. 12:25 Secondly, during the quarter, our specialty segment moved their industry leading product catalog to a digital format. At the peak, specialty printed over 300,000 copies of these catalogs, each consisting of over 1,000 pages. So this represent a savings of 300 million printed pages. This green focus and shift to a digital catalog is another example of how our teams across all segments are driving our environmental leadership into all facets of the business. 13:02 Looking ahead, we expect solid revenue growth across all 3 of our segments in 2022 as we creep back to pre-pandemic volumes, get some relief from the aftermarket supply chain in the back half of the year, and utilize strategic pricing initiatives. Specifically, we are still running behind 2019 revenue in North America, but we are closing the gap and expect to approach pre-pandemic revenue levels as we exit 2022. Europe is back to pre-pandemic revenue levels and we look forward to continuing the positive momentum from Q4 as we move forward in 2022. And specialty is obviously already running well ahead of pre-pandemic revenue levels. 13:53 On the corporate development front, as mentioned in our last call, in the first week of October, we completed the acquisition of [indiscernible] one of the leading independent car parts wholesalers in the Netherlands and Seawide Marine Distribution, a nationwide electronics wholesale distributor that supplies electrical and electronic products for the marine outdoor and personal navigation markets. 14:20 During the fourth quarter, we continued the build-out of our ESG program by implementing various social initiatives. In December, the company launched our LKQ Cares Holiday Vote, a unique program in which all employees had a voice determining how LKQ's donations are allocated. With this program LKQ donated funds to 10 separate non-profit organizations across the globe during the holiday period. Also in December, the LKQ Community Foundation donated monies to assist various non-profits with relief and recovery efforts from the long-track tornado that produced severe catastrophic damage in several states and numerous communities. 15:12 Let's now turn to the inflationary environment, a key item of interest for most listeners on this call. Inflation was a harsh reality across each of our segments, especially during the fourth quarter when inflation climbed to a 39-year high in December. The rise in prices is fairly straightforward, a combination of unprecedented supply chain and labor disruptions which choked the output and monetary and fiscal stimulus, which accelerated demand. Global disruptions of this size and philosophy do not reset overnight and we suspect it will continue to be a headwind throughout 2022, but make no mistake, we are not resting and waiting for this to reset. 16:02 Our segment teams have implemented processes with our supplier and customer partners to deal with price changes in a more planned and structured way, ultimately staying ahead of the inflationary trends. Of course, the success of these ongoing processes will depend on the timing of the recovery in the supply chain, including some relief in ocean freight cost. 16:26 Related to labor, by the end of December 2021, there were 11 million job openings in the United States. Simply stated, there is a battle to hire and retain talent at all levels of the organization and prospective hires clearly have leveraged and that comes at a cost. Our North American operations have over 1,000 open positions, which represents roughly a 6% vacancy rate . In 2021, we witnessed 5% to 7% net increase in wages for our business in North America. 17:04 We are working diligently to develop creative ways to recruit potential candidates beyond just compensation. To expand the recruiting efforts, we are building partnerships that focus on the skills needed for the open positions and exploring how we can attract talent. In 2021, we invested in the benefit plans provided to our employees, including but not limited to, enhancements to our core behavioral health and paid parental leave programs. Our European operations are facing the same challenges and are currently running at a 3.5% vacancy rate, with wages increasing between 3% and 5% in 2021. 17:48 Focusing on retention and recruiting as well, at the end of the fourth quarter our Europe team launched a comprehensive employee engagement survey with WorkBuzz to further understand the employee experience and how we can be their Employer of Choice. The team invested in development for their leadership team and mental wellbeing training for all colleagues across Europe. 18:13 The labor impact is an industry-wide issue. In the fourth quarter, the national average scheduling backlog for collision repair shops were 3.4 weeks versus pre-pandemic levels of just 1.7 weeks. The doubling of the backlog is predominantly due to technician shortages and to a lesser extent parts availability. Based on the milestones we achieved throughout 2021, clearly, our teams have been judicious with quickly driving change and I am confident, we will operate with the same level of vigor to combat the headwinds we face with the supply chain and labor and freight cost, all against the backdrop of the ongoing pandemic. 19:02 Lastly, before I turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our outlook for 2022, I am pleased to announce that on February 15, 2022, our Board of Directors approved our second quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 a share, payable on March 24, 2022 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2022. 19:32 And with that, I will turn it over to Varun. Varun Laroyia : 19:36 Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. Before I go into details on the fourth quarter, I'd like to spend a moment to reflect on the last two years operating in the pandemic. Since the world was turned upside down in March of 2020, we leveraged LKQ's core strengths, namely our best-in-class inventory availability and service reliability, extensive distribution network, rock solid balance sheet, and most importantly, our people to be successful in adverse conditions. We accelerated our operational excellence program to make the business more resilient and have delivered record annual results yet again, while creating a strong position for the company to participate in the demand recovery. 20:26 The performance over the past 3 years since the pivot to operational excellence and in 2021 in particular, highlights the benefits of our operating initiatives. By many measures, 2021 was an outstanding year. In terms of profitability, we generated record full year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.96, an increase of 55% compared to 2020, our previous high watermark. During the September 2020 Investor Day I set the expectation that LKQ aims to be a double-digit EPS compounder with about half coming from organic growth and productivity and the rest from judicious capital allocation. With our 2021 results, we surpassed this expectation and picked up about 3 years of EPS growth in a single year. 21:22 We have sustained the momentum built in recent years around cash flow generation, with free cash flow of $1.1 billion in 2021 and successfully reset the business model to operate at this higher level going forward. At the conversion ratio of 60% of EBITDA, we are delivering free cash flow in line with our long-term expectation, generating significant and sustainable free cash flow has accelerated various capital allocation options, including our share repurchase program, maintaining investment grade credit metrics, and initiating a regular quarterly dividend. 22:02 With the focus on operational excellence, including integrating our acquisitions and converting profits to cash, we have made significant progress in improving our return on invested capital. By our internal measure of ROIC, which essentially ignores the amortization of intangibles, we exceeded 15% in 2021 after running at approximately 10% just a few years ago. All of this reflects our commitment to delivering long-term value to our various stakeholders. 22:34 I'd also like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere thanks to the entire LKQ team for their dedication and hard work. It takes all 45,000 of us rowing in the same direction to deliver such outcomes. We have raised the bar on what LKQ can be and we have more to come. 22:55 Now shifting to the fourth quarter, our fourth quarter results reflect a solid finish to the year, with improving revenue, net income, and earnings per share year-over-year, despite, as expected, the negative impact of metals, challenges to inflation, the global supply chain and the Omicron variant. Gross margin remained a year-over-year benefit with improvement in Europe, offsetting metals-driven softness in North American margins. Unlike the first 3 quarters of 2021, commodity prices had a negative effect on margins in the fourth quarter. 23:34 We estimate that scrap steel and precious metal prices produced year-over-year decreases of approximately $16 million in segment EBITDA and $0.04 in adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter. In 2020, we benefited from significant sequential increases in scrap steel, and precious metal prices during the fourth quarter, while 2021 showed roughly flat to declining sequential changes. 24:03 Overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 130 basis points year-over-year with over half driven by personnel costs. The tight labor market has pushed wages higher in many of our markets. Additionally, strong performance across all 3 segments contributed to increased levels of incentive compensation in 2021, which of course resets with new targets for 2022. 24:28 I'll now turn to segment operating results. Starting on slide number 10, North America produced an EBITDA margin of 15.1% for the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin was unfavorable by 50 basis points, primarily related to the metals effect, which had a negative 210 basis point effect on gross margin in the fourth quarter. The benefits from ongoing margin initiatives in the wholesale business and improved pricing partially offset the metals impact. 25:01 Segment overhead expenses increased by 230 basis points, with the largest change owing to personnel expenses. Roughly half of the 140 basis point increase in personnel expenses is attributable to higher incentive compensation, with the remainder related to wages, temporary labor, and medical costs. Higher freight and fuel cost drove a further 80 basis point increase in overhead expenses. 25:30 With some of the overhead leverage benefit from higher revenue dollars offsetting a portion of the gross margin impact, metals had a negative 170 basis points effect on the reported 15.1% segment EBITDA margin. This result is consistent with our expectations for a mid to high 16% baseline without the metals impact. For the full year, the reported North America segment EBITDA margin of 18.3% benefited by roughly 100 basis points from metals prices, mostly in the first half of the year. 26:10 Moving to Europe, Europe continued its strong performance with an 8.9% EBITDA margin, the highest fourth quarter figure since 2015 and finished the full year with 10.2%. As you can see on Slide 11, gross margin was the primary driver of the fourth quarter improvement with better net pricing. We are pleased with Europe's progress in delivering a double digit full year segment EBITDA margin and we are confident that there is further opportunity ahead. 26:41 Moving to Slide 12, specialty held gross margin roughly flat despite inflationary pressures in the segment's 1 operations and a negative mix effect from the SeaWide acquisition with offsetting benefits in net pricing. Operating expenses increased by 80 basis points, driven mostly by personnel expenses, higher wages, medical costs, and incentive compensation, which of course, some of it will be reset to reflect 2022 targets. The specialty team made great progress on the SeaWide integration plan during the fourth quarter by moving all inventory into existing facilities in December and subsequently has exited 3 of the 4 acquired facilities in January, which of course will create cost savings going forward. 27:31 Income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2021 included discrete benefits of $0.07, primarily related to the reversal of certain valuation allowances and true-ups related to prior-year tax return filings. There was a benefit of $0.25 reflecting the change in estimate of our effective tax rate as we closed out our 2021 financials. While the discrete benefits in the 2021 rate are non-recurring, we expect to benefit from a lower effective tax rate going forward and have included 25.1% in our 2022 guidance assumptions. 28:12 Shifting to liquidity and capital allocation, we have been foreshadowing a cash outflow for inventory all year as we've looked to rebuild our inventory levels in anticipation of demand recovering. The outflow has been delayed by supply chain issues, though we began to see some real progress in the fourth quarter. As you can see on Slide 31, we were able to grow our inventory balances in all 3 segments in the fourth quarter, an opportunity which drove a higher than expected cash outflow of $182 million. While there are still some challenges getting aftermarket products to our locations, given the challenges with ocean freight and ongoing congestion at the ports here in North America, we saw robust activity at the auctions and grew our salvage inventory to support the strong growth in this category. 29:05 We were also successful in increasing the inventory for our specialty segment ahead of the key selling season, with a number of shows that take place in the first quarter. We are confident that our inventory positions will enable each segment to continue to offer best-in-class availability and service relative to our competitors, despite the ongoing supply chain challenges. 29:30 Our capital spending for the quarter was higher than what we've seen in recent years. With a backdrop of inflation continuing for the foreseeable future, the increase was driven by strategic capital deployment during the quarter as we identified a series of opportunities, mostly related to our salvage business in North America to invest in real estate. These investments, which include site expansions and the purchase of a new facility for our Denver operation will provide room for growth in our salvage business. 30:02 Additionally, we identified other high return investments related to vehicles, equipment, and systems to undertake in the fourth quarter, given the long lead times with the ongoing supply chain disruptions. In total, the real estate and other strategic purchases totaled about $90 million for the quarter, which accounts for much of the growth in capital spending. 30:26 Full year free cash flow, as I mentioned previously, was $1.1 billion, our second year in a row being above the $1 billion mark. At a 60% conversion ratio for free cash flow to EBITDA for the year, this was roughly $275 million above our original guidance floor of $800 million when we gave guidance for 2021 last February. Following our balanced capital allocation philosophy, we repurchased 5.3 million shares in the quarter for $297 million and issued our first quarterly dividend with a $73 million payment in December. 31:09 We also acquired businesses in the fourth quarter. SeaWide in our specialty segment and a tuck-in business in the Benelux market for a total consideration of $57 million. Our net leverage ratio came in at 1.4 times EBITDA and interest coverage now exceeds 28 times compared to the credit facility requirements of 4 times and 3 times, respectively. We are well positioned with our credit metrics, which are consistent with an investment grade profile and we remain committed to achieving an investment-grade rating. As our earnings release of this morning indicated, the Board has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, which will be paid to stockholders on record as of March 3. 31:59 I will wrap up my prepared comments with our thoughts on 2022. Over the past two years of living with the once in 100 year health crisis, what has become clear is the resiliency of our end markets and our team's ability to deliver solid results utilizing the operational excellence toolkit. This in effect gives us the confidence to reinstate full year guidance, including organic revenue growth for the coming year. Our guidance assumes that; one, there are no significant negative developments related to the COVID-19 in our major markets; two, foreign exchange rates hold near recent level for the remainder of the year; three, scrap and precious metal prices trend lower than what we're currently seeing in the month of February and an effective tax rate of 25.1%. So with that, we expect organic parts and services revenue growth of between 3% and 5%, with higher growth rates in the second half of the year than the first half. 33:04 With ongoing inflationary pressures exacerbated by the supply chain challenges, we remain confident in our ability to positively work through pricing changes as needed. Second, we are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.72 to $4.02, with a midpoint of $3.87. This is a decrease of $0.09 or 2% at the midpoint, relative to the 2021 actual figure. 33:38 Looking at slide number 19, you can see how we get from the 2021 actual EPS to our 2022 expectation. We've been transparent about the commodities benefit on our 2021 results. And with lower prices anticipated for 2022, we will face a headwind of roughly $0.27 related to scrap steel and precious metal prices, predominantly in the self-service operating unit. The favorable discrete tax adjustments in 2021 will not reoccur, which will lower EPS by a further $0.06. Additionally, lower average foreign exchange rates will have a $0.04 negative effect year-over-year and we had a $0.03 pickup of fair value adjustments related to certain equity investments that we are not projecting to reoccur in 2022. 34:36 Taking these factors into account, we are looking at a baseline EPS figure of $3.56. On a 2 year stack, we remain well above our long-term growth expectations in 2022 and we expect annual growth rates to normalize in 2023. The operational excellence initiatives have created a significantly stronger and more resilient business, which we believe will support our ability to improve operating results, despite the current inflationary environment and supply chain challenges. 35:10 And finally, our balance sheet is solid. We continue to generate outstanding free cash flow through strong profitability and judicious use of trade working capital. We are projecting to generate free cash flow of at least $1 billion in 2022 as we sustain a healthy conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow. 35:33 Before I turn it back to Nick, I want to inform everyone that we are contemplating breaking out the self-service operating unit as a separate reportable segment in 2022. While we are not planning any changes in how self-service is operated or how it interacts with the wholesale business, we'd like to provide investors even greater transparency into the North America business, especially as it relates to the metals impact. We will provide further information on the decision ahead of our first quarter earnings call in late April. 36:12 Thanks for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments. Dominick Zarcone : 36:19 Thank you, Varun. In closing, 2021 was a banner year for LKQ and I could not be prouder of the collective efforts of my global teams. Let me restate our key strategic pillars, which continue to be central to our culture and objectives as we've entered 2022. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And last but not least, we will continue to invest in our future. 37:13 With these pillars in place, coupled with our industry-leading teams, we are well positioned to face the challenges in the first half of the year and we'll continue to deliver positive year-over-year operating results for our shareholders. As always, I want to thank the over 45,000 people who work at LKQ for all they do to advance our business each and every day. They are truly our greatest asset. 37:44 And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : 37:50 Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore of Truist. Stephanie Moore : 38:03 Hi, good morning and congrats on a great year. Dominick Zarcone : 38:07 Good morning, Stephanie. Stephanie Moore : 38:10 My first question is really a clarification question. As you look to your 2022 EPS guidance, does that -- does the guide EPS range include incremental share repurchases? Varun Laroyia : 38:21 Good morning, Stephanie. It's Varun. No, it does not. Really, what you see on Slide 19 of the earnings deck reflects the annualized benefit of all the share repurchases that we did in 2021. And obviously, that flows through into 2022. So, no, the guidance does not include anything incremental that we may do in 2022. Stephanie Moore : 38:44 Great. No, that's helpful. Switching to the North America business, obviously there has been across all segments a tremendous work over the last 2 years to just improve operating performance, reduce costs, whether it'd be around labor, et cetera. So maybe if you wanted to kind of bridge what you expect would be incremental expenses in North America. I think you noted and we're all aware of labor, wage pressure, towing and then also kind of what will be done to offset that from this overall efficiency gain? Thank you. As well as pricing? Thanks. Dominick Zarcone : 39:20 Thank you, Stephanie. Let me answer that one. So I think your question is specifically regarding North American margins in the fourth quarter. And again, if you kind of go back to the earnings deck on slide number 10, where we actually break that piece out, First of all, I think just to be cognizant of it that we have a seasonal trend within our business. And so, Q4 typically is lighter in many case, but as you rightly point out, yes, some of the inflationary pressures have certainly been picking up. 39:49 In my prepared comments, I did call out where the single biggest piece was, which was within the personnel cost. I think everyone understands that there is a tremendous amount of labor shortage here in North America, and arguably the other one is that how much of that is our higher incentive compensation also. Clearly from an incentive compensation perspective that does get reset with new targets in 2022, so that entire number that you see, that really is not the true exit run rate. So that's kind of an important piece to think through, but with regards to medical costs for that matter what we are paying from a talent perspective, that is real. And we do expect our ability to get positive price associated with that. 40:37 I think the other piece really which maybe is kind of more fundamental is, at the gross margin level, while it seems that gross margins were down by about 40 basis points to 50 basis points year-on-year, really they were down by 210 basis points owing to the metal space. So the metal is the single biggest piece in our North American margins. And if you go back to the October earnings call, we were aware that metals would impact our North America segment margins. So that really is where it shows up. 41:09 The work that the team has done on positive pricing has been able to offset some of that. And then the final point really I'd like to highlight is the 15.1% that North America reported for Q4 is impacted by about 170 basis points associated with metals. You add those 2 pieces together and it is right where our expectations are, which is the mid to high 16% without the metals impact. 41:35 So I hope that helps answer. We are happy with the way the Europe -- the North American business is performing. We are aware of the supply chain challenges and also the inflationary pressures, but the team is doing an outstanding job and really hitting its marks excluding the metals volatility. Stephanie Moore : 41:56 Absolutely. Thank you so much for the color. Operator : 42:00 Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Daniel Imbro : 42:05 Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Dominick Zarcone : 42:07 Good morning, Daniel. Daniel Imbro : 42:09 I wanted to follow up on the thoughts around long term efficiencies. Varun, you kind of mentioned I think the word productivity improvement could offset some of these inflationary headwinds this year to drive that improvement. Could you add some more color around what specifically you see an opportunity to improve? I think you mentioned freight and supply chain. Can you kind of quantify any of those savings buckets? 42:30 And then taking a step back, as we look out 2023, 2024 and beyond, I know you're not giving long-term targets now, but how should we think about the pace or the cadence of margin expansion in out years given what you see on the productivity opportunity. Varun Laroyia : 42:44 Yeah. Thank you, Daniel. So let me just try and summarize your question. And that really is in terms of where we see margin expansion and then really further productivity gains. So let me start with the margin side first. 42:59 As you saw in our quarterly earnings, in the earnings deck, Europe has been doing an outstanding job on the pricing side. And you certainly see that gross margin expanding for our European business. That accounts for close to half of our business. And as part of the One LKQ program that we had called out in September of 2019, that business has hit every single mark that it had suggested. 43:25 As Nick has previously also called out, we are not done with the One LKQ Europe program. We're making tremendous progress, but there is a lot further opportunity yet to come. So when you see the full year 10.2% segment EBITDA margin, we expect 2022 to continue to improve from there on. So that's kind of one piece I certainly wanted to highlight. 43:47 The second one is, I think from a North America margin perspective, I think folks get a little bit confused about the metals piece and really with that, as I mentioned in the fourth quarter, gross margin owing to metals was impacted by 210 basis points in the quarter, which we had largely anticipated and excluding the metals benefit -- rather the metals impact in the fourth quarter, that would have been a mid to high 16s. The metals impact was 170 basis points. 44:17 So that may seem to kind of color some of the views, but that business is hitting its marks and whether it'd be the permanent cost savings that had been called out at the September 2020 Investor Day, that business is exceeding those at this point in time. And as we've talked about whether it'd be route optimization, overall network setup that we have across our North America business, each of those pieces continues to deliver. Those are multi-year goals and the business continues to find further opportunity. 44:52 So without belaboring the point further, we are excited about where our North America and our European business is and the same for our specialty business, [indiscernible] forget it at times, but that business has just been outstanding from its execution perspective. They are not immune like other businesses in other industries with regards to inflationary pressures, but really that specific segment, while our smallest segment has did an outstanding job, really picking up the strong demand that continues to come through and then executing flawlessly on that front. 45:28 The final point I should kind of highlight is that, when you talked about multi-year views, we are contemplating our biannual Investor Day setup and that is currently expected to be late spring, early summer, but certainly after the first quarter earnings. So we are thinking of a May timeframe at this point in time. Daniel Imbro : 45:51 Varun, thanks for that color. Nick, I wanted to follow up with a bit of a longer-term question. You mentioned some of the ESG initiatives and clearly that's a focus for the company with the recycling. But as EVs grow across the country and just over the next decade, how is the infrastructure in your opinion on EV battery recycling? Is that something you could be a larger player in since there is a demand for it and you're already ingrained in the auto recycling ecosystem? Just kind of curious how LKQ can capitalize on that opportunity given where you sit today. Dominick Zarcone : 46:25 Yes, Daniel. Great question. As we announced last quarter, we've made an acquisition probably 4 or 5 months ago of a company called Green Bean that got us into the entire battery remanufacturing, not recycling, but remanufacturing business. We are looking to make further investments in battery technology just so we can make sure that we are able to address the opportunities that are going to come along with the very slow shift of the car park to EVs. Within there, there'll be plenty of opportunities for LKQ. Just like the engine is the most expensive and most valuable part of our car today, the battery is the most valuable part on an EV and that provides a number of different opportunities for a company like LKQ. 47:21 As the EV population grows in the United States, we fully anticipate that the cars that we buy at auction coming out of the whole total loss process that there will be a higher percentage of electric vehicles in that population of cars that we buy and that will provide a number of opportunities for us on the remanufacturing and potentially recycling side of the EV battery business. So we view it as a big opportunity. It's going to take some time to develop because the impact of EVs on the car park is going to be very slow and very evolutionary, but we are thinking ahead and trying to get ahead of the curve. Daniel Imbro : 48:07 Thanks, guys. Operator : 48:08 Your next question comes from the line of Brian Butler of Stifel. Brian Butler : 48:13 Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Dominick Zarcone : 48:16 Good morning, Brian. Brian Butler : 48:19 Just the first one, can you kind of maybe summarize the segment margins that are kind of built into the 2022 outlook? And also kind of how that might flow seasonally through the year? Dominick Zarcone : 48:33 Yeah. So we generally don't provide segment by segment margins, but as we've talked about in this call already, right? Long-term sustainable margins for the North American business will be in the mid to high 16% range. And that's where we were in Q4 in North America, if you exclude the impact of the metals. So we're very comfortable in the mid to high 16s in North America. Again we posted up 10.2% in Europe for the year in 2021. We do anticipate another 30 basis point to 50 basis point improvement in Europe during the next year. And specialty has been a very strong and we don't expect a tremendous amount of upside in specialty margins, but they're going to more than hold their own. 49:29 So when you put it all together on a corporate level, you're going to be shaking out probably somewhere in that 13% range from a EBITDA margin perspective. Again, that all assumes no significant movements in metals pricing and the like. Brian Butler : 49:47 Okay, great. That's helpful. And then a follow-up question on the cash flow side. Can you talk a little bit about maybe capital spending in 2022 and how that should trend? What's keeping that at a higher level? As well as how should we think about working capital in the year? How much of that $1.3 billion of cash from operations is benefiting or being impacted by the working capital side? Varun Laroyia : 50:15 Brian, it's Varun. So, let me take those 2 questions. So, firstly, with regards to capital spending, we are back to our normal cadence, which is between 2% and 2.25% of revenue, right? So between 2% and 2.25% on a revenue perspective, and this really is a bounce back from what took place in 2020. Our ability to quickly act and pull down that CapEx number is what we delivered during the height of the pandemic a couple of years ago. You saw 2021 coming at the 2.2% and we expect a similar number in 2022 also. So roughly, call it, between the $285 million to $300 million is what we are expecting from a capital expenditure and that then fits into our top line revenue guidance also. So that's kind of point number one. 51:09 With regards to the overall free cash flow number, we are essentially targeting a 55% to 60% EBITDA conversion. This is what we've been talking about for the past couple of years and really through 2020 where you saw a significantly higher conversion rate as the business was essentially finding as to where the demand was, we certainly flexed the balance sheet and really on a go-forward basis we are stabilizing the free cash flow at that higher level. So the 55% to 60% EBITDA conversion piece and really, if anyone is looking for the math associated with that as to why, that is a strong conversion factor for a distribution business. 51:50 Let me start from an EBITDA perspective. There are cash taxes to be paid. So in our case, call it, roughly about $350 million of cash taxes. Capital expenditure, as I just mentioned, roughly 2.2%, so the $285 million to $300 million. Interest expense, which was about $72 million in 2021, call it, marginally down in 2022. And then finally restructuring and restructuring will be at a similar number to what we did in 2021, so roughly about $20 million. That really is your conversion from a cash basis, EBITDA down to what we see coming through from a free cash flow perspective. 52:30 I hope that gives you the math. I certainly hope that -- it makes sense. And it's been very consistent to what we've been talking about now for the past couple of years. Brian Butler : 52:41 Okay, great. And if I could slip in maybe one last one. Just on the metal side when you talk about metals coming down, are we really talking about kind of what's built into the 2022 guidance is metal prices getting back to the 2020 levels. I mean, when you take out the full $0.27 impact, I'm just trying to understand the magnitude of how much pricing has -- how much metal prices have to come down to show that impact? Varun Laroyia : 53:10 Yeah. So if you think about where we \u2013 where the metals benefit came through in 2021, that's the starting point, right? And from that perspective, if you think about where catalytic converters and that really is where the precious metals group really sits, that was at an all-time high. I think it touched an all-time high of close to about $285, $290 per cat converter on an average quarterly basis. So that number has come down significantly. 53:39 And really, if you think about -- we called this piece out in September, because we've seen it at the end of August and September of last year, and then again, we saw that these -- from a volatility perspective in December and also in early January. So we're looking at numbers which are significantly lower than the full year average of about $255 on a cat converter, call it, about 20% lower than that. 54:04 And then really, I think over the past couple of weeks, really with the geopolitical tensions there has been a slight uptick associated with that. But really, when we are purchasing salvage vehicles and as to how we're processing them, there's always a lag associated with it. So that really is how you should think about it more than anything else. And that's the underlying assumption of what we have in our overall full year guidance on. So I hope that gives you a sense in terms of how we're thinking about the volatility associated with metals. Operator : 54:36 Your next question comes from the line of Jordan -- from the line of Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Bret Jordan : 54:42 Hey, good morning, guys. Dominick Zarcone : 54:44 Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : 54:46 On the 2022 outlook for growth, could you sort of carve out what is price versus units in that, particularly in the parts and service, the 3% to 5%? Dominick Zarcone : 54:57 Yeah. Bret, great question. It's -- the answer is, it depends. It's really different business by business and product line by product line. But I assure you that all of our segments are expecting an increase in demand, increase in volume, if you will. A portion of the 3% to 5% is anticipation that we're going to be able to move prices up, but certainly not all of it. It's a good balance between volume and price. The reality is, we look at prices on our products literally daily across the globe. And we are always adjusting something up or down. It's a balance. 55:43 On the one hand, we want to make sure we're driving the price to make sure we're doing whatever we can do to protect our gross margins to cover the cost, the incremental cost associated with labor and freight and all the rest. On the other hand, you don't want to take your prices up so much that you start impacting our ability to sell product and impact volumes. So it's a balance. We think we have a -- strike a good balance. Again, we're working with our suppliers, we're working with our customers and embedded in that 3% to 5% is a volume growth for all 3 of the segments and some pricing improvements as well. Bret Jordan : 56:31 Okay, great. And then one question on [indiscernible]. I think you called out that supply chain is still an issue. Could you talk about both Europe and North America, sort of where your fill rates are versus where you'd hope they'd be? And maybe the cadence of the supply chain, are you seeing improvement in those fill rates? Dominick Zarcone : 56:48 Yeah. So the real challenge that we have is the aftermarket collision parts in North America, because that's where we pull the better part of 16,000 containers a year over from the Far East, Taiwan, specifically. And that's been the most impacted by the supply chain disruption. And again, we were able to build inventories in each of the segments. We're feeling reasonably good with our current positions in Europe, though, it's not perfect. It's better than it was, the same with specialty. It's not perfect, but it's better than it was. Again, we've gotten great conversion on the salvage side. And so the sticky wicket, if you will, is in the North American aftermarket business where normally we would be in fulfillment rates well north of 90% and we're below the 90% level right now. Our goal is to get back to our historical levels and that's all tied to having product on the shelf in order to sell. It's not necessarily a demand issue. It's truly a supply issue. 58:01 We saw a little bit of relief towards the end of the year in getting product over. Now, everyone needs to understand that while on the balance sheet the value of the inventory even in North America was up, it's basically our inventory. It's on our books when it hits the ports in Taiwan. And with the extended shipping time, it doesn't mean that our salable inventory sitting in our warehouses was up by the full amount of the increase in North American inventory. It's still a challenge. 58:37 I mean, what used to take 4 to 6 weeks to get product into our warehouses is taking months. And we did everything we could to pull product in before the Chinese New Year, which has an impact on the shipping times and we are able to get a bit of product in and now it's slowing back down a little bit. Overall, we think the supply chain challenges are going to be with us basically through most of the year. We're working hard to do what we can to make sure we've got the product that we need where we need it, so we can sell it and deliver it to our customers. Bret Jordan : 59:15 Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : 59:18 Your next question comes from the line of Scott Stember of CL King. Scott Stember : 59:24 Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been answered. But maybe, Nick, you could talk about on the specialty side, again, maybe give a little more granularity on this pass that the drivers get, the level of benefit you can see in 2022 and also why is this just limited to the specialty delivery side? Dominick Zarcone : 59:48 Yeah. So the -- you're talking about the Department of Transportation -- Scott Stember : 59:54 Yes. Dominick Zarcone : 59:55 So every year every organization has to submit information to the DOT and the like. Our specialty business, which executes incredibly well has an incredible focus on safety as their number 1 priority and goal. And it's coming through because their results were quite good. We don't anticipate it to have a huge impact on specialties margins, our ability to -- certainly, it has nothing to do with sales. But on the fringe, on the margin, it means that a little bit less waiting time for the drivers, which makes them a little bit more productive, the ability to save some time and money on labor. 60:49 Again, you probably won't be able to see it because it's not a big item, but we wanted to highlight it just to demonstrate the focus that we have on the health and safety of our employees and the other constituents that are important to us. And it's a little bit of a blue ribbon issued by the government saying that we're doing a good job. Scott Stember : 61:15 Got it. That's all I have. Thanks. Operator : 61:19 This concludes today's Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Nick Zarcone. Dominick Zarcone : 61:25 Well, we certainly like to thank everybody for their time and attention here this morning. We know that this earnings season is always -- like always is a busy one. We appreciate your focus on LKQ. Again, we are incredibly proud of what we delivered in 2021. We are incredibly excited about what lays in front of us in 2022. We believe we're going to be able to deliver and execute on our plan and create value for all of our shareholders and all the other constituents. So we look forward to chatting with you again in late April after Q1. And then as Varun indicated, we'll get everyone together for our longer-term strategic view of the business in the late spring, early summer at our Investor Day. And we'll be coming out with an exact date in the near term here. So thank you and have a great day. Operator *: 62:19 Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Rob and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the LKQ Corporation\u2019s First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations for LKQ Corporation, you may begin your conference. Joe Boutross : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to LKQ\u2019s first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today maybe considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the coming days. And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe and good morning to everyone. I will provide some high level comments on what was a robust quarter for LKQ from many different perspectives before Varun walks you through some of the financial details and our increased financial guidance. I will then close with a few observations before opening the call to your questions. As we entered 2022, who would have thought the world would experience events more traumatic than the pandemic we all have been living through? Just when everyone thought we had turned the corner and we\u2019re headed towards the new normal, in late February, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, and everything changed overnight. In retrospect, issues related to tight labor markets, supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures pale in comparison to the needless loss of human lives. Yet out of the ashes, we are all able to watch the evening news and see true leadership and courage in action and incredible solidarity in a time of crisis. Yes, I\u2019m talking about the Ukrainian people. But the same is true for the 950 people in Ukraine who are LKQ associates. These employees are truly remarkable. So too are their colleagues in Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania who welcomed hundreds of family members of our Ukrainian employees at the border to provide food, housing, medical assistance and schooling to those fleeing the country. They are all defining what it means to be LKQ proud. As to the business, we exceeded our expectations for Q1 in terms of both revenue and profitability. And this gives us confidence to increase our financial guidance for the year. The key word in the economy in the past several quarters has been inflation. During periods like this, companies have a choice, wait and see the impact and play defense or anticipate the impact and play offense. LKQ chose to play offense, and the benefits of doing so can be found in our results. This is particularly true with respect to the exceptional organic revenue growth achieved in our North American wholesale and European segments. Both of which benefited from strong demand for automotive products as mobility and claims volumes increased, while pushing prices in an attempt to offset most of the inflationary pressures. Managing through this environment is hard. And I am extremely thankful for the efforts of the global LKQ leadership team, which is doing a terrific job of balancing the best interest of our customers, suppliers, employees and shareholders. Now on to the quarter. Revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was $3.3 billion, an increase of 5.6% as compared to $3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2021. Total parts and services revenue increased 5.9% in Q1, comprised of organic revenue increases of 6.9%, plus the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of 1.7%, offset by foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenue by 2.7%. Net income for the first quarter of 2022 was $269 million as compared to $266 million for the same period of 2021, an increase of 1.1%. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter, was $0.94 as compared to $0.88 for the same period last year, an increase of 6.8%. On an adjusted basis, net income in the first quarter of 2022 was $287 million compared to $286 million in the same period of 2021. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter, was $1 as compared to $0.94 for the same period of 2021, a 6.4% increase, driven by a reduction in the average share count. Let\u2019s turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. And please note, this is the first quarter of separating the self-service business from the core North American wholesale business. Turning to North America, from Slide 6, you will note that organic revenue for parts and services in our North American wholesale segment increased 13.6% in the quarter on a reported basis and 11.8% on a per day basis. During the first quarter, industry-wide overall claim counts increased 12.2% versus Q1 of 2021. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, during the first quarter of 2022, U.S. weekly supplied motor gasoline volume was approximately 4.9% above last year, but still 4.7% below the first quarter of 2019 pre-pandemic. And according to the Department of Transportation, highway miles driven during Q1 increased 4.9% above last year, but lagged 2019 levels by approximately 2.2%. From a product line perspective, recycled and remanufactured parts demonstrated higher growth, including gains in both volumes and price relative to last year. On the aftermarket front, we have been successful in passing through inflationary cost increases despite the supply chain challenges, which are causing volumes to be down relative both to last year and 2019. April has started off on a positive note, following the pattern established in Q1. We don\u2019t anticipate achieving double-digit revenue growth in our North America wholesale operation for the rest of the year, but we expect it to be in the mid- to high single-digits. In part due to headwinds from parts availability and more so due to labor constraints, during Q1, the national average scheduling backlog at collision repair shops reached 4.5 weeks, 2.5x the length of the typical first quarter backlog. Additionally, since 2016, average vehicle repair costs have risen steadily every year, with the largest increases occurring in the past 2 years, reaching an all-time high in 2021. Our parts provide a strong solution for shops and insurance carriers to manage costs. As we inevitably begin to witness some relief in the supply chain and a steadier flow of aftermarket product, the value proposition of our parts becomes even more attractive as shops continue to face headwinds related to labor costs and overall inflation. As we indicated in our last call, this quarter, we began reporting self-service as a separate segment. This new segment provides investors with greater transparency into the commodities dynamic of our business. Given the majority of our other revenue category, which primarily consists of scrap and precious metals, comes from our self-service operations. Varun will cover more details on the margins of this segment shortly. During the first quarter, total revenue for self-service was flat compared to last year, reflecting the relative softness in metals pricing. Organic revenue for parts and services for this segment increased 14.6%, largely driven by price. Also, the average revenue per admission, a key productivity metric, rose during the first quarter of 2022 relative to 2021. Moving to our European segment, organic revenue for parts and services in the first quarter increased 6.9% on a reported basis and 6% on a per day basis. As the largest pure-play distributor of automotive aftermarket parts in Europe, this is a tremendous start to 2022, even in the face of an extremely challenging geopolitical environment on the continent. So we are quite pleased with the organic growth in Europe. While different by market, overall consolidated organic growth was split evenly between volume and price. According to the Apple Mobility Index, the trends in driving trips in our European markets was down earlier in the year due to normal seasonal patterns. As we progress through Q1, the index rebounded. Encouragingly, despite all the fear of a dramatic drop-off in demand due to global macro headlines, at this point, we have not seen any notable shift in European mobility as we have entered the second quarter. Our regional operations experienced varying revenue performance in the quarter, but all posted positive growth, with very solid year-over-year performance. The UK and Benelux operations were particularly strong with high single-digit organic growth, while Germany and Central Europe, excluding Ukraine, posted mid-single-digit organic growth. Italy also demonstrated progress, posting positive organic growth for the first time in several quarters. The Russian invasion of Ukraine had a direct impact on our revenue in late February and all of March due to having to close certain branches that we operate in Ukraine. And those that have remained open, as you would assume, saw a significant drop in demand. Also, immediately following the invasion, we ceased all sales to Russian-based parts distributors. We estimate the impact of the war on European organic revenue growth during the quarter was approximately 60 basis points. And as these conditions continue, we anticipate the impact on our full year European growth to be about 120 basis points. We continue to pay our Ukrainian employees regardless of whether they are working. And we are supporting their families who have fled to neighboring countries. As I\u2019ve always said, our people are our most important assets. And in Ukraine, the well-being of our people is our primary focus today. Varun will provide some additional financial related details to this unfortunate situation shortly. Now let\u2019s move on to our Specialty segment. Organic revenue for parts and services for our Specialty segment declined 8.3% in the quarter on a reported basis and 9.8% on a per day basis, largely due to a very tough year-over-year comp. You may recall, this segment reported 33% organic growth in Q1 of last year. So on a 2-year stack, the annual revenue growth is still well into double-digits. We anticipate another tough comparison in Q2 against the 30% growth reported in the second quarter of last year, with a positive recovery and a return to year-over-year organic growth in the back half of this year. A few other key highlights for Specialty during the quarter. In the first quarter, Specialty hosted our annual Big Show, a customer event, which is focused on SMA-related parts, and also hosted our annual RV Expo for our RV-focused customers. Both events booked solid year-over-year increases in attendance and sales, suggesting good demand in the future. Also, in March, our Specialty team opened a 210,000 square foot distribution center in Orlando, Florida. While it will create a very slight drag on near-term margins while it ramps up, this new distribution facility will help create higher revenue as it will service Florida and Georgia. Both of which are very attractive markets for our RV and marine-related product lines. The supply chain continues to provide challenges. And we\u2019re doing our best to get the inventory needed to service customer demand. During the quarter, key port cities in China were shut down for a while. This shifted container capacity to other countries like Taiwan, giving our North American team an opportunity to get some incremental inventory on the water. March was the second best container volume that we\u2019ve witnessed in 24 months. We expect some of this benefit to continue into April and likely May. And this inventory should be at our warehouses by mid to late summer. Once the China lockdowns reopen, we will likely see a regression back to the lane bottlenecks that we\u2019ve endured over the past 12 months as the pent-up demand from China comes through. In Europe, product availability remained challenging through Q1, with back orders still running high, but we are witnessing some signs of improvement as we enter Q2. Turning to ESG. During the first quarter, we continued our environmental stewardship efforts by processing 193,000 vehicles, resulting in, among other things, the recycling of approximately 970,000 gallons of fuel, 562,000 gallons of waste oil, 501,000 tires and 178,000 batteries. During Q1, we also processed approximately 260,000 tons of scrap steel. On the social front, during the quarter, we focused on some key initiatives around the financial and mental health well-being of our employees. As an example, in North America, we implemented a profit-sharing plan, where we made a special contribution of $1,000 to the 401(k) accounts of all eligible team members. Alongside this contribution, we provided services to educate our team on how to think about and plan for retirement. From this initiative alone, we witnessed over 4,000 new 401(k) account openings. We want all employees to benefit from our success. And this plan allows us to reward and thank them for their relentless focus on results, which made a huge impact on our 2021 performance. In Europe, we launched a program called Inspire to Thrive that lets our team know that their mental well-being matters. The goal of this program is multifaceted, including creating a supportive culture, addressing factors that may negatively affect mental well-being, addressing negative perceptions of mental well-being issues, providing support to colleagues suffering from mental health issues and developing management skills to address issues when they arise. Operationally, we believe this program will have many benefits, such as higher retention, reductions in sick leave and enhanced productivity. More importantly, however, it\u2019s simply the right thing to do for our team and helping them maximize their overall well-being. Lastly, from a corporate development perspective, during the quarter, we entered into a transaction to sell our PGW glass business. While a fundamentally solid operation, we had come to the conclusion that LKQ was not the best owner of this business and the margins were always going to be dilutive to the overall North American segment margins. This transaction closed last week, and we are extremely pleased with the outcome. As we enter Q2, we are witnessing a healthy pipeline of potential tuck-in acquisitions. And since April 1, we have closed on two small European transactions. And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run you through the details of the strong first quarter financial performance and our increased guidance. Varun Laroyia : Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. While I\u2019m excited to be able to present another strong set of financial results and I will cover the details on the quarter shortly, I want to begin with comments on a very eventful start to 2022. As you know, LKQ entered the year with momentum coming off record revenue and profitability in 2021, but also anticipating challenges from the Omicron surge, supply chain constraints, inflationary pressures and volatile commodity prices. These factors created headwinds in the quarter, and we\u2019ve had to react quickly to counteract the effects. While there is more work to be done to improve our inventory availability and manage the cost pressures, we are comfortable with the direction we\u2019re headed, and importantly, our position relative to the competition. The Ukraine-Russia conflict has been a further source of volatility, both with its direct impact on our business and the indirect effects on currencies and commodity prices. As Nick mentioned, our revenue at risk owing to the conflict isn\u2019t material. But we experienced a negative effect of about $0.01 in Q1 and expect a further $0.05 headwind relative to our original EPS guidance over the balance of the year due to the ongoing conflict. Please note that the impacts associated with lost revenue and other indirect effects of the conflict are not being considered for adjustment in our calculations of segment EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. Direct impacts related to asset write-downs and/or reserves are being excluded from the calculations of these metrics. The Q1 exclusion totaled roughly $6 million. As expected, scrap steel and precious metal prices were a drag on results year-over-year. The prices were better than projected in the quarter, and thus, the negative impact was less severe than anticipated. Compared to Q1 of 2021, metals prices generated a $32 million negative effect on segment EBITDA and a $0.08 impact on adjusted EPS. As discussed on the fourth quarter call, we are now presenting the self-service operating unit as a reportable segment to provide investors with greater visibility into our operating results. I hope that you have had an opportunity to review our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on Monday, the April 25, which shows the segment financial information recast under the new presentation. As noted on prior calls, self-service generates a large portion of its revenue from scrap steel and the precious metals and catalytic converters, which makes its results more volatile than the wholesale North America segment. Of the $0.08 negative year-over-year impact from metals, approximately two-thirds is derived from the self-service segment. Last week, we completed the sale of our PGW aftermarket glass distribution business for gross proceeds of $362 million. PGW generated almost $400 million of revenue, and its EBITDA margin was approximately 10% in 2021. By divesting PGW, we will see an improvement in EBITDA margin as the business generated a lower margin than the wholesale North America segment. We intend to use excess cash to repurchase shares in the coming months, though given the timing of the transaction, will be dilutive to full year 2022 EPS by approximately $0.04, which is built into our updated guidance. The full year share count reduction benefit in 2023 will further mitigate the lost PGW earnings. While we expect to report a gain on sale, our U.S. GAAP EPS outlook does not include a gain as the amount has not been finalized. Any gain would be deducted from U.S. GAAP EPS in the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS. Finally, S&P upgraded LKQ to BBB- with a stable outlook last week. Achieving an investment-grade rating from S&P, in addition to the same from Fitch ratings a year ago, is a tremendous accomplishment for the organization and is a testament to our operational excellence program launched in 2019. This program has supported the consistent operating performance, robust cash flows and a resilient business model that S&P cited as reasons for the upgrade. The immediate implication of the upgrade is that collateral requirements fall off our senior secured revolving credit facility. And over time, we expect the added flexibility to allow the company to drive even higher levels of free cash flow to invest in growing our business and returning capital to stockholders. Specifically, there will be opportunities to extend vendor payment terms and increase payables. And we expect this benefit to come through over the next few years. I\u2019ll now shift to the quarterly results. Our first quarter results reflect a solid start to the year, with improving revenue, net income and EPS year-on-year, despite the negative impact of metals, challenges related to inflation and the global supply chain, the Omicron variant, the ongoing conflict in the Ukraine and foreign exchange volatility owing to a stronger U.S. dollar. Gross margin decreased by 30 basis points compared to the first quarter from 2021, with 40 basis points negative effect coming from the self-service margin, which declined owing to metals. Overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue rose 80 basis points year-over-year, with higher bad debt expense and inflationary increases in vehicle, freight and fuel expenses. Income taxes in the first quarter of 2022 were booked at 25.1%, consistent with our prior guidance. And finally, as Nick mentioned, diluted EPS was $0.94 for the quarter and adjusted diluted EPS was $1 even. I\u2019ll now turn to the segment operating results. Starting on Slide 9, wholesale North America produced an EBITDA margin of 18.1% for the quarter, down 30 basis points from the prior year period. Gross margin was roughly flat as pricing improvements were offset by unfavorable impacts from metals, which had a negative 70 basis point effect in the first quarter. Segment overhead expenses increased by 50 basis points, with the negative effects from inflation on personnel and freight costs. We\u2019ve previously communicated our expectation for the North America margin to run in the mid to high 16 without the metal effects. With the new segment breakout and the sale of the glass business, we now believe that Wholesale North America EBITDA margin should run approximately 70 basis points higher after normalizing for metals effects. Europe reported an 8.8% EBITDA margin for the quarter, down 80 basis points from the prior year period. As you can see on Slide 10, the margin decrease was attributable to movements in both gross margin and overhead expenses, with negative effects from inflation, higher bad debt expense and effects from the Ukraine-Russia conflict. As mentioned, we anticipate a negative impact on Europe from lost revenue related to the conflict, though the team believes they can deliver a double-digit margin for the full year. Moving to Slide 11, Specialty gross margin grew 110 basis points, with benefits from net pricing and mix more than offsetting a 90 basis point negative effect from acquisitions, primarily SeaWide. Overhead expenses increased by 190 basis points, driven by personnel cost inflation and higher vehicle, fuel and freight costs. The overhead expense increases were partially offset by 60 basis points of benefits from operating expense synergies and leverage mostly generated from the SeaWide acquisition. While the specialty EBITDA margin of 12.6% is down relative to the prior year, it\u2019s important to acknowledge the progress the business has made over the last 3 years. Pre-pandemic, in Q1 2019, Specialty reported a segment EBITDA margin of 10.7%. The team has done a fine job rationalizing the cost structure and protecting its product margin, resulting in a 190 basis point improvement from Q1 of \u201819 through to Q1 of 2022. Self-service reported an EBITDA margin of 20% for Q1 2022, a strong result for the segment, but below the record margin achieved last year. As you saw in the Form 8-K, with the recast historical segment results, self-services margins can be \u2013 can vary significantly depending on metals prices. Since the beginning of 2019, we\u2019ve seen a low point for the margin at 6.3% in the third quarter of 2019 and a high point of 27.9% in Q1 of 2021. While there are performance elements that we control, for example, carbine, product pricing and labor efficiency, the self-service business results are driven by trends in scrap steel and precious metals prices. When prices are moving higher, especially when it occurs rapidly with the strong margins in this business, and we will see the downside when prices go the other direction. We believe that breaking up self-service will provide greater clarity to investors. With that background, the decrease in self-services margins in Q1 of 2022 is driven by movements in metals prices and car costs, estimated at an 1,100 basis points negative effect, partially offset by improved pricing. Shifting to liquidity and capital allocation. We sustained the positive momentum we\u2019ve built in recent years around cash flow generation, with free cash flow of approximately $350 million in the first quarter. At a conversion ratio of almost 80% of EBITDA, we are delivering free cash flow above our long-term expectation. For sure, there are some timing elements that will reverse over the course of the year. And we are confident in our ability to generate significant and sustainable free cash flow in line with expectations of converting EBITDA to free cash flow in the 55% to 60% range for the full year. We are cautiously optimistic about the progress we have made with inventory procurement. Access to aftermarket products and cars at auction improved relative to the same period in 2021. And we were able to deploy more cash to build inventory. As shown on Slide 24, we increased our inventory spend and purchased more salvage vehicles than we did in the first quarter of 2021. And as you can see on Slides 25 and 26, our inventory levels have increased in all four segments relative to December, excluding the impacts of the held-for-sale reclassification and foreign currency translation. As of the 31st of March, the Wholesale North America inventory excludes approximately $100 million of glass inventory, which is presented in the held-for-sale asset line on the balance sheet. We remain confident that our inventory position will enable each segment to continue to offer best-in-class availability and service relative to our competitors despite the ongoing supply chain challenges. Our capital spending for the quarter of $59 million was in line with our expectation. And following our balanced capital allocation philosophy, we repurchased 2.7 million shares in the quarter for $144 million and issued our quarterly dividend with a $71 million payment in the month of March. We also paid down our debt balance by approximately $53 million in the quarter. Our net leverage ratio came in at 1.3x EBITDA. And interest coverage exceeds 30x compared to the credit facility requirements of 4x and 3x, respectively. In short, we are very comfortable with our credit metrics, which support our investment-grade rating. As our earnings release of this morning indicated, the Board has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, which will be paid in June to stockholders on record as of the 19th of May. And finally, I will wrap up my prepared comments with our updated thoughts on 2022. Our guidance assumes that there are no significant negative developments related to COVID-19 in our major markets. Scrap and precious metal prices hold near the average for the first quarter. And the Ukraine-Russia conflict continues without further escalation. On foreign exchange, rates have been moving rapidly in recent days, with the euro hitting a 5-year low on Wednesday. Our guidance includes weakening European rates in the second quarter, followed by a recovery in the second half of the year. We\u2019ve dialed in a full year average rate for the euro at $1.09 and the pound sterling at $1.30. Since current rates are below these figures, we have about $0.03 of risk over the balance of the year if rates hold at their current levels. Having said that, with the strong start to the year, we are increasing our organic parts and services revenue growth expectation to between 4.5% and 6.5%. We are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.80 to $4.10, with a midpoint of $3.95. This is an increase of $0.08 compared to the prior midpoint. The raise is primarily attributable to our first quarter performance, as the balance of year has mostly offsetting effects, as shown on Slide 19 of the earnings deck, related to benefits due to organic growth and related operating performance, metals prices above our original forecast and share repurchases, offset by headwinds from lost earnings tied to the Glass disposal in April, weakening FX rates and the impact of the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Please note that the share repurchase benefit is attributable both to the shares that we purchased in the first quarter, which will give us a benefit of roughly $0.03 on a full year basis, and the anticipated repurchases from the proceeds of the Glass sale of approximately $0.05. While there are lots of puts and takes in the forecasted numbers, I want to specifically highlight the operating performance component. As I previously stated, our operational excellence initiatives have created a significantly stronger and more resilient business, which is helping us to improve operating results despite the current inflationary environment and supply chain challenges. And finally, we remain on track to deliver at least $1 billion of free cash flow for the year, achieving strong free cash conversion in line with our expectations for the business. Thank you once again for your time this morning. And with that, I will turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Varun, for that financial overview. We believe our unique competitive position across all of our operating segments continues to translate into strong results for our company during difficult conditions. I am extremely proud of how our team of 46,000 employees tackle the headwinds we faced over the past 2 years, which subsequently positioned us well as we entered 2022. Our strong first quarter performance and raising our guidance for 2022 is a true validation of our confidence and commitment to creating long-term value for our stockholders. And again, I would like to acknowledge the bravery and courage of our Ukrainian team as they operate in an unthinkable environment. Our thoughts and hearts are with you all. And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is open. Bret Jordan : Hi, good morning, guys. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Bret. Varun Laroyia : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : Varun, now that you\u2019ve got the investment grade rating and you called out the opportunity to extend payment terms do you have any better visibility as to how far you might be able to extend them here? I mean, obviously, you\u2019ve got a \u2013 you have the rating now. So have you had conversations around those terms? Varun Laroyia : Yes. Absolutely. And Bret, thank you for raising that piece and acknowledging LKQ is now an investment-grade company. It\u2019s taken a lot of time. And the overall pivot to operational excellence has certainly been looking at every aspect of our business, income statement, functions and also the overall balance sheet. Yes, we do anticipate several hundred million upside related to getting the investment grade. However, it will not happen overnight. If you think about our European vendor financing program, which is coming along incredibly well, we still have a gap. And really, what we do is we benchmark ourselves given the product assortment with, say, what the folks in the U.S. are doing, right? And so in terms of even being able to get to a one to one with regards to AP, offset by inventory or inventory offset by AP, we have a gap, a significant gap. And that runs into a fair bit. So again, it won\u2019t happen overnight. We obviously do have these contractual negotiations with our vendors. On an annual basis, the team is moving in the right direction. And so, we really don\u2019t see it in the short-term, i.e., within 2022. But I think from 2023 onwards, we certainly will see that piece continue to climb further. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then a quick question. I think you said March was one of the best shipping volume months in the last couple of years. But is there a way to quantify your North American aftermarket in-stock levels? Where you are on inventory fill versus target? Nick Zarcone : Bret, this is Nick. Thanks for the question. Our fill rates are not where we would like them to be. We tend to run well into the 90s. We are not in the 90s today. We\u2019re probably in the mid to high 80s. So there is progress to be made. It all relates to the supply chain challenges. Again, it has nothing to do with our suppliers being able to produce the product. It all has to do with transporting the product from Taiwan into the U.S. and Canada. Again, we\u2019ve got some incremental containers on the water in March. We\u2019re hoping for a few incremental containers in April, May as well. But it takes \u2013 with the port congestion and transportation issues here in the U.S., we won\u2019t see any of that inventory until mid to late summer. When that hits, it should help a little bit. From a fulfillment perspective, we do not believe it\u2019s going to take us back to our historical levels, but it will help. What we do feel very confident about is our fulfillment levels are the best in the industry even with the challenges that we are facing. The reality is our smaller competitors are struggling to get product. And from an overall perspective, from a competitive perspective, we think we\u2019re still leading the pack. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Your line is open. Michael Hoffman : Hi, thank you very much. And great opening round here, thanks. I appreciate it. On the wholesale side, just to dig a little deeper, total volumes were down, just the mix inside whether it was a new aftermarket versus a recycled remanufactured. Is that correct? Nick Zarcone : That\u2019s correct. We had good volume growth in our salvage products, our recycled products, particularly as it relates to mechanical parts. Transmissions were particularly strong. We had great growth from a volume perspective and our remanufactured products, again, largely engines and transmissions. It was the aftermarket collision parts where we saw volumes down. And of course, that\u2019s the largest share of our North American revenue. Michael Hoffman : Okay. But the good news is you\u2019re able to shift around even if fulfillment came down. That\u2019s part of your competitive advantage, is you\u2019re able to shift around to support volume. Nick Zarcone : We\u2019re the only folks who have the ability to sell recycled product if we don\u2019t have the aftermarket product in-house. Michael Hoffman : Got it. And then, Varun, on the guidance, so everything goes up except the free cash flow. I\u2019m assuming, versus February, you\u2019re planning on spending more on inventory, and that\u2019s the difference? And what is that delta? Varun Laroyia : Well, listen, it\u2019s \u2013 well, inventory, certainly, as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019re trying to build that piece up, and we\u2019re making some good progress. In Q1, Michael, every segment of ours, so all four segments were actually able to generate more inventory and secure more inventory. I think when you look at the numbers specifically, North America was up, specialty was up, self-service was up, as was Europe. In the case of Europe, obviously, the stronger dollar clipped the translation piece of it and also in North America with the held-for-sale classification for PGW. It seems as if it did not grow, but that also grew. But with regards to free cash specifically, any inventory increase, we see ourselves being able to offset with our payables program. But really, if you think about why has free cash not kind of gone up despite all of the $0.08 center raise on a full year basis. From a cash perspective, it really is from a receivables perspective, but the strong organic growth that we are now forecasting, from a midpoint of between 3% to 5% previously and now taking that up by 150 basis points at both the bottom end and the top end, at receivables. And that\u2019s a good problem to have because with higher economic activity, we see higher receivables coming through. We saw that come through in Q1 also. And so it will just be a cycle more than anything else, that economic activity will raise receivables. But in terms of inventory, yes, it will go up. But we believe we can offset that with payables. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Your line is open. Daniel Imbro : Hey, congratulation guys in the quarter and thanks for taking our questions. Nick Zarcone : Thanks, Daniel. Daniel Imbro : Nick, I wanted to ask. You mentioned during your prepared remarks, but given the inflationary environment, are you seeing insurance companies opt more often for alternative parts? I mean are we seeing or do you expect the APU finally take a meaningful step higher? I guess while we are on that topic, how State Farm progressing, or are they still increasing their alternative part usage? And what does that mean for your North American wholesale growth? Nick Zarcone : Yes. So, at this point in time, based on the backlog that I mentioned in the repair shops, the insurance companies just want to get parts on the car. And whether it\u2019s an aftermarket part or recycled part, or quite frankly, an OEM part, because every day that, that car is in the shop, they are generally paying a rental car fee and which clearly increases their prices. So, it\u2019s not that they are trying to aggressively move to a higher APU given the inflationary environment because it\u2019s whatever part is available. We do believe, as I mentioned in my formal comments, that once the supply chain kind of works its way through and some of the challenges we have from a fulfillment perspective begin to normalize that our product set provides a great opportunity for shops and for insurance carriers to lower their overall cost. And they can use the price benefit that we have relative to OEM pricing has helped offset some of the other inflationary costs. Daniel Imbro : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess I also wanted to just follow-up on the competition side. You just mentioned the smaller guys are struggling with inventory. Do you expect \u2013 I mean how does that play out? Are they going to not be able to compete longer term? Do they start using price to try to gain share back? Just kind of trying to think through what the derivative impacts are of the smaller guys continuing to struggle to keep up with you? Nick Zarcone : Our sense is that at some point in time, and we can\u2019t put a timeframe on it, Daniel. At some point in time, the supply chain will balance itself out. And that will obviously help us and it will help the smaller folks as well. Nobody is trying to buy volume these days because it\u2019s a shortage of product. And so pricing is strong. So, we don\u2019t anticipate anybody, not us, not our \u2013 even our smaller competitors are trying to buy volume through price. Because when there is not enough inventory to go around to begin with, that would not be a smart move, right. They will continue to compete. We will continue to compete. We think we have got significant advantages from a product growth perspective, from a product perspective and from our service capability. And that\u2019s how we are going to continue to compete and grow our market share in the months and quarters to come. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore from Truist. Your line is open. Nick Zarcone : Good morning Stephanie. Stephanie Moore : Hi, good morning. Congrats on a great start to the year. Nick Zarcone : Thank you. Stephanie Moore : I wanted to touch on the European margin expectations for the year. Clearly, some headwinds that I think were not originally expected, but still looks like we will continue to move forward with nice double-digit margins. So, maybe just talk through levers that you have been able to pull on your end to offset some of these headwinds as well as maybe give us an update on where we stand on the 1 LKQ program? Varun Laroyia : Stephanie, let me start off with the European margin piece of it and then Nick will pick up on where we are with the 1 LKQ Europe program. Yes. Listen, in terms of where European margins came in, slightly softer. But I think it\u2019s fair to know the fact that the Ukraine-Russia conflict was not anticipated. So, that certainly has clipped the margin trajectory of the business in Q1. And there was the odd customer bankruptcy also. But really, on a full year basis for balance of year, the team, all of us, we are very confident of being able to hit what we have put out there from a public commitment perspective of hitting our sustainable double-digit margins. And so while Q1 kind of clipped it for about just over $0.01 in \u2013 with the Ukraine-Russia conflict, on a full year basis, we think it will kind of clip us about six. So, there is another five yet to go. And that\u2019s really what you see in the earnings deck where we have given a walk from the prior original guidance to what we are now suggesting. But in terms of how the business is progressing, the organic growth is coming through strongly. And we expect the operational side of things with the higher organic revenue growth that Europe has put up and really what it continues to forecast, which again is not all price, it\u2019s actually a good mix of volume and price and \u2013 which is actually incredibly heartening. And the same thing, as Nick mentioned, about North America. They are the ones that do have good product availability. We would like to have some more. But in terms of our investments that we have been making those are certainly beginning to bear fruit and really shows the resiliency of the business that we have built up on both sides of the pond. But again, Nick, if anything else you would like to add from a 1 LKQ Europe perspective? Nick Zarcone : Yes. The 1 LKQ Europe program is right on track. Organizationally, we have gotten that behind us now for several quarters. Arnd has his full team in place, a wonderful set of management talent. The individual platforms are working together much more on a day-in, day-out basis. We are getting the benefits that we were hoping to achieve. From a procurement perspective, there is still room to go there. We are not remotely done. There is still room to go. And the focus in the future is getting a little bit better labor efficiency by consolidating some of the roles in our shared service centers, whether that\u2019s in Southern Poland or in Bangalore. And we think there are some further opportunities there. And then the IT rollout, that\u2019s going to be, like we said originally, that was going to be kind of a 4-year journey. We are a couple of years into it. But it\u2019s right on track and just about on budget, so we are really pleased there. Stephanie Moore : Great. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And then maybe lastly for me, if you wanted to just touch on kind of a longer term view as the vehicle dynamic changes across the globe, changing from ICE to EVs, and how you think you are positioned with some just recent investments that you have made? Nick Zarcone : Yes. So, there is no doubt that there are changes to the car park, both in North America and in Europe. But they are evolutionary, very evolutionary. They are not revolutionary. The reality is the impact of EVs probably won\u2019t be felt until well into the 2030s. And our goal \u2013 and if you were to read some of the materials we put out there for our European business, the goal is to be \u2013 first, as it relates to being able to supply repair shops with parts for electric vehicles, EV first. And Arnd and the team are putting plans in place to do that. We suspect that most \u2013 everybody in Europe, folks like us is trying to figure out a way to support electric vehicles because they will grow from being 2% or 3% of the car park to maybe 10% of the car park over the next 10 years. And it\u2019s going to be a real opportunity. We don\u2019t view it as a big \u2013 as a huge threat. We view it more as an opportunity to expand the product set and to provide our customers with even a broader array of products. Same in North America, though I think the EV shift is going to be a little bit slower here in North America. And just like we have made the acquisition of a battery remanufacturing business, we are in the process of buying a second battery technology-related business. Again, these are small nascent operations. But they will give us key technology that we will need as we move forward to provide a good set of products and services to our customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Baird. Your line is open. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions as well. I wanted to follow-up, Nick, on 1 LKQ Europe. Could you just shed a little more light on progress you are making on your private label program in Europe? Nick Zarcone : Sure. So, the first thing we did, Craig, on our private label front is we had to rationalize and consolidate all the various brands. Because when you take a look at all the companies we had acquired in Europe, essentially, we had 90 different private label brands that we have bought along the way. And there is no need for us to have 90 different brands. So, we have rationalized that out significantly. We have put all of our private label product activity and the growth of that business under the leadership of a single person on a pan-European basis. We refer to it as our components business. And we have an individual who came out of the Stahlgruber organization that is focused on growing that business across the European platform. Some countries are ahead. Like the UK, we have the highest penetration of owned brand or private label products. In other countries, like in Germany, it\u2019s significantly lower. Our goal is to raise the total so to have a higher penetration in each of the countries in which we operate. And it\u2019s not going to happen overnight. Part of it is making sure that the private label product that we put out there is extremely high quality, because the \u2013 ultimately, the customers will not react well with low-quality products. So, we are working with all of our vendors to make sure we have great quality product. And then the goal is in each of the countries where we operate, to get the percentage of private label revenue up. When we do that, okay, private label is less expensive and very price competitive for the customer. And so that will have a little bit of an impact on revenue, but the margins are significantly better. And that\u2019s all part of the thought process. Craig Kennison : And just as a follow-up. First, are you willing to share like the percentage of private label today and what that margin differential looks like? And then second, do you need to make investments in a single unified European private label brand, or will there be multiple brands in multiple countries? Nick Zarcone : We will probably have multiple brands, but we are consolidating it down significantly from what we started with. And we do have a brand called the E-Motive that we have in the very, very early stages. Maybe not even \u2013 maybe kind of batting practice warm-ups where we are starting to roll that brand out across the European platform. We have not disclosed our private label penetration in Europe. Again, we are the highest in the UK and probably the lowest in Germany and all the other countries are somewhere in between. In total, today it\u2019s probably around 10%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Prestopino from Barrington Research. Your line is open. Nick Zarcone : Good morning Gary. Gary Prestopino : Good morning all. Hey. Now that you have got this investment grade on your debt, I mean, have \u2013 would you say that your priorities could shift to more aggressive share repurchases overall? I mean is there a real need to continue to pay down debt as you have done? Varun Laroyia : Great question, Gary and good morning. No, I don\u2019t think anything really changes on a day-to-day basis. If you think as to we have been operating with the investment-grade credit metrics now for probably six quarters, right. And so from that perspective, debt is well kind of arguably under-leveraged at this point of time, but kind of following our balanced allocation product, capital allocation policy. We have been kind of talking about the fact that we are not prioritizing debt pay-downs at this point in time. With the investment grade rating that comes through, I think there was a previous question on the call also. Over time, it doesn\u2019t happen overnight, but as we go, renegotiate client-vendor partner contracts, that higher level of trade payable days certainly lifts. And that certainly will release a few hundred million dollars of incremental free cash flow over the next few years. With debt levels arguably below where they need to be, we are happy with what the overall debt leverage is. So, nothing really changes because we have been operating at those metrics for quite some time. The key piece really is that we continue to look for opportunities to grow our business. Organic is obviously that much better. Seeing the level of organic revenue growth coming through our businesses is incredibly heartening. So, that really is the key focus, making sure that we provide all the capital required to continue to stretch out our lead from an organic perspective. And as and when opportunities come up to do some corp dev activities, we will certainly do that. But again, we are not going out that whale fishing or elephant hunting. It\u2019s basically high synergy tuck-ins, building up incremental adjacencies, critical capabilities. And then whatever is the excess free cash, yes, having a share repurchase program is incredibly helpful. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. And then last question. Nick, you mentioned that because of supply chain issues, some aftermarket parts, particularly on collision repair, are in short supply, are you starting to see or be close of this a shift where salvage parts are being substituted for what could have been at more of an aftermarket part usage just because of this supply chain? Nick Zarcone : Yes, absolutely. I mean every time we have a customer on the phone, if we do not have the aftermarket part in stock, but we do have a recycled part in stock, we try and cross-sell. Again, we are the only company that can do that because. We are the only company that offers both recycled and aftermarket parts. And our salespeople have the inventory screens for both product sets right in front of them when they are talking to their customers. So, we try and cross-sell every opportunity we have. Varun Laroyia : Materials, I think it\u2019s fair to say it really shows the power of what we have built up out here. No one at this level of size and scale has the dual sourcing strategy of kind of aftermarket and recycled parts. And so that really is where we have been investing a lot. Our salvage recycled business is doing an outstanding job. And as you kind of saw from the slides in the earnings deck, we are certainly investing more, whether it be buying Dutch to kind of set up our salvage yards, or for that matter, making sure that we continue to be a very active player in the salvage market with regards to the number of total loss vehicles that we are purchasing. That business is rock solid. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Nick Zarcone : Good morning Ryan. Ryan Brinkman : Good morning. You mentioned getting ahead of inflation as opposed to waiting to see what the impact might be. I am just curious what measures you may have taken, whether it\u2019s primarily passing along higher costs or maybe proactively taking price in anticipation of higher future costs. Maybe it\u2019s a combination of pricing and cost containment efforts. And then as you are taking price, presumably, you are testing the elasticity of demand for various different products and different markets. And I would be interested what you might be learning in terms of the customers\u2019 ability or willingness to pay higher prices for the various different products that you distribute. So, for example, are you seeing greater ability to pass along price for more non-discretionary products relative to discretionary products, or are you better able to raise price for higher-end products versus lower end products, or is it the other way around, or so whatever insights you might be gleaning as you go through this process? Nick Zarcone : Yes. So, a lot of questions there, Ryan. The reality is, again, we did \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say that we took prices up in anticipation of higher costs later. Not that we were ahead of it, but we didn\u2019t wait to see our costs go up and then do prices. So, I would say we \u2013 I think we timed it pretty well. Again, it\u2019s a very competitive market out there. And at the end of the day, your ability to push price ultimately is dependent upon overall market pricing. Like I said, supply is short. That\u2019s true with all different types of parts. And so nobody out there is leading with price as a way to buy volume, right. Everyone, I think is trying to hold their prices tight. Again, we knew inflation was coming. It was no surprise. And so we weren\u2019t shy. The reality is no customer likes prices to go up, just like nobody listening to this call likes to pay more for anything, right. But the reality is governments around the world have $32 trillion of capital into the marketplace as a result of the pandemic. And when you have more units of currency chasing a fixed \u2013 faster goods and services, prices go up. And there is not probably a country in the world that hasn\u2019t seen the negative impact of inflation. And if you don\u2019t stay on top of it, you fall behind, and you never catch up. And we made a conscious decision not to come out of the box behind the curve. Yes. So, I am not \u2013 I don\u2019t want to imply that we are leading the curve, but we are staying constant. I think we are doing the good job of matching the ability to push prices along with the higher cost. And look, everyone knows that shipping containers from the Far East into North America is up five-fold to six-fold from where it was a couple of years ago. That\u2019s not 6% or 7% inflation, right. That\u2019s significantly more. Labor is up more along the lines of normal inflationary statistics that you have read. And so we have moved prices up. And we have had customers who haven\u2019t been happy, but they understand that, right. Because they know what\u2019s going on in their own businesses as well. And there is no free lunch. And we are a humble distributor. And we have no intention of getting caught holding the inflation bag, if you will. It\u2019s not our job to fund the parts and services industry in the automotive repair marketplace. And so we are going to do what we can to protect ourselves from inflationary pressures. There haven\u2019t been huge differences between kind of the type of parts that we have been able to move price along. Again, we have done our best to move along on all types of parts. Again, every market is a little bit different. Every country is a little bit different depending on overall competitive dynamics and the like. The inflationary pressures in the U.S. are higher than in Europe. That doesn\u2019t mean that Europe doesn\u2019t have inflationary pressures. They absolutely do. But we see it a little bit more intense here in the U.S. than overseas. Operator : And there are no further questions. Mr. Nick Zarcone, I will turn the call back over to you for some closing remarks. Nick Zarcone : Well, I want to thank everyone for your time and attention this morning. And we certainly look forward to continuing the discussion with you. I think as everyone knows, we are hosting our Investor Day on June 1st. And we would hope to be able to see most of you there in Nashville. We are hosting at our national \u2013 at our North American headquarters. It will be a live event. We understand that some of you may not be able to find your way to Nashville. And for those, the event will also be virtual in nature. It will be telecast, and you will have the ability to come in via the Internet. Again, that\u2019s June 1st in Nashville. And then again, obviously, we will be speaking with everyone in late July when we report second quarter results. So, with that, I would like to bring this call to a close. Again, we thank you for your time and attention. And we hope you have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the LKQ Corporation's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Mr. Boutross, you may begin your conference. Joseph Boutross : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we're planning to file our 10-Q in the coming days. And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Dominick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I will provide some high-level comments relative to our performance in the quarter and then Varun will dive into the financial details and provide an update on our guidance before I come back with a few closing remarks. The second quarter of 2022 was one of the most unusual and complicated operating environments we've encountered maybe ever, but clearly, since the financial crisis. During the quarter, we were confronted with ongoing COVID risk and the issues associated with an uptick in positive cases in our workforce. Major labor constraints, ongoing supply chain disruptions, a challenging inflationary environment globally as evidenced by June being the highest level of inflation the United States have seen in some 40 years. Soaring energy prices, commodity price volatility, the unfortunate conflict in Ukraine and political unrest across the globe. And all this has resulted in major volatility in the foreign exchange markets with the euro weakening materially in the quarter and reaching parity with the dollar in July. I think I speak for all CEOs across all industries when I say the sheer number of cross currents and headwinds have created some very challenging business dynamics. Yet, the LKQ team delivered another quarter of solid performance, driven by excellent focus and execution, exceeding many expectations, both internally and externally. I am very proud of the hard work and dedication demonstrated by our 45,000 employees that enabled our company to deliver on behalf of our stockholders and our customers during the quarter. I am equally proud of the team's commitment to effectively immense the dynamics of our business, which they can control, while not losing focus on growing the business, developing our people and continuously looking for opportunities to generate leverage and synergies across our operating segments. This effective management will serve the company well as we progress through the balance of 2022 and continue to confront many of the same headwinds. Our confidence in our team's ability to manage through this environment is validated by the reaffirming of our 2022 guidance, which Varun will discuss shortly. Now on to the quarter. Revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $3.3 billion, a decrease of 2.7% as compared to $3.4 billion in the second quarter of 2021. Parts and services organic revenue increased 3.8% on a reported basis and 4.2% on a per day basis. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures decreased revenue by 1%, and foreign exchange rates decreased revenue by 5.6% for total parts and services revenue decrease of 2.7% on a reported basis or 2.4% on a per day basis. Other revenue fell 2.9%, driven by a decline in precious metal prices. Net income for the quarter was $420 million as compared to $305 million for the same period of last year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.49 as compared to $1.01 for the same period of 2021, an increase of 47.5%. These amounts reflects a $127 million gain on sale of the PGW Glass business in April or $0.45 a share. On an adjusted basis, net income in the quarter was $307 million as compared to $340 million for the same period of 2021. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.09 as compared to $1.13 for the same period last year, a 3.5% decrease. The adjusted results exclude the impact of the PGW sale. Now let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. In North America, organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment increased 10.7% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, which exceeded our expectations. This performance confirms the resiliency of our business model and our team's ability to effectively implement pricing initiatives to offset inflationary pressures. As it relates to volume, during the quarter, we saw some weakness, which was consistent with a 2.6% decrease in second quarter fuel consumption as measured by the U.S. Department of Energy. Additionally, vehicle miles traveled saw a little year-over-year growth, and Q2 growth was down relative to Q1. The largest pressure point in North America continues to be the aftermarket collision parts product line, which experienced reduced year-over-year volumes due to lower performance rates associated with the supply chain disruptions. During the quarter, we benefited from some minor relief in the aftermarket supply chain relative to Q1, which translated into a very modest increase in our fill rates, with June aftermarket fill rates reaching the highest levels of 2022. While we are still well below historical levels, we are encouraged by this modest positive trend in the supply chain, which is also evidenced by the decrease of spot container costs the market witnessed during the quarter, albeit the shipping costs are still multiples above pre-pandemic levels. During the quarter, we were successful in getting a higher level of aftermarket collision parts shipped from Taiwan, but most all of that inventory is still on the water and won't be received in our warehouses until late summer or early fall. Our salvage collision part volumes were up a bit compared to last year as we were able to shift some of the aftermarket demand over to recycled parts. Recycled and remanufactured mechanical part volumes were generally flat on a year-over-year basis. The value proposition of alternative parts could not be more attractive that insurance carriers base loss pressures from increased parts cost, rising labor cost and technician shortages at the repair shops, broader supply chain issues and decreased availability and increased cost of rental cars. During the quarter, collision repair costs increased 11.6% year-over-year with cycle time still being over double their historical averages. Recently, the value proposition of CAPA Certified Aftermarket Parts is being recognized by the largest auto insurer in the United States, that being State Farm through a small pilot program. On June 20, State Farm began an 8-week program where it introduced aftermarket bumper covers, headlights and taillights when preparing repair estimates and settling auto claims in the Oklahoma and Texas markets. As you all know, State Farms historically has not utilized the aftermarket collision parts. We cannot predict the outcome of the pilot or estimate how this will impact State Farm's parts strategy going forward and neither should you. That said, as with many things, the first test is the widest and the tallest and we're cautiously optimistic that aftermarket parts could potentially become a larger portion of State Farm's parts spend over the long term, as they work through the outcomes of this pilot program. Moving on to our European segment. Organic revenue for parts and services in the second quarter increased 4.2% on a reported basis and 4.9% on a per day basis. Our regional operations continued to experience varying revenue performance in the quarter, but every geographic market was positive year-over-year with our Benelux, U.K., Central and Eastern European and salvage businesses being the top performers. Importantly, Italy realized year-over-year growth, which reflected the second consecutive quarter of positive revenue performance in that region. As mentioned last quarter, we halted all sales of parts into Russia when the war commenced. This decision reduced same-day organic growth for the European segment during the second quarter by approximately 1.5% to 1%. Excluding the impact of the lost Russian revenue, same-day organic growth in Europe was 5.4%. When taken as a whole, the European volumes were down a bit during the quarter, but pricing was strong. We continue to make great progress with our 1 LKQ Europe Program. Alongside solid organic growth during the quarter, our European segment achieved double-digit segment EBITDA margins which represented incremental improvements, both sequentially and year-over-year. Our European teams focus on pricing actions, private label branding and procurement initiatives generated positive results in the quarter. As I've said before, the execution element of the 1 LKQ Europe program will be with us forever, and it will be the driving factor behind the productivity improvements in years to come. Given all the current operating challenges in Europe, including the foreign exchange and geopolitical dynamics, I am very pleased with Europe's performance in the quarter. Now let's move on to our specialty segment. Organic revenue for parts and services for specialty declined 11.5% in the quarter, largely due to a tough year-over-year comp. As you may recall, this segment reported 30% organic growth in the second quarter of last year. So on a 2-year stack, the annual revenue growth is still well into double digits. Indeed, specialty revenue in the second quarter would have been a record for the team, if not for the buoyant performance in 2021. Our RV parts category performed better than the segment level growth as a whole during the quarter, as demand for the majority of our RV parts offerings is driven more by the size of the RV part and not new RV unit volume. That said, certain product groups such as towing that have some exposure to new unit volume, underperformed in the quarter. Also, some of the softness that the SEMA-related products based in the quarter was due to a year-over-year decrease in light vehicle sales in the U.S. In particular, pickup truck sales were down nearly 12% in the quarter, an important vehicle category for our specialty offerings. Now on to self service. Organic revenue for parts and services for our Self Service segment increased 13.2%. There were some softness towards the end of the quarter in precious metals prices, which also impacted segment EBITDA margins year-over-year. Self service also had increased vehicle procurement costs as we were challenged to source inventory. The recent volatility in commodities further validates the rationale for breaking out this nondistribution Self Service business as a separate segment, given it represents the vast majority of the other revenue category. Let's move on to the initial Q3 revenue trends. Revenue for North America wholesale operation have gotten off to a solid start, though we don't anticipate it will continue at the double-digit growth rates experienced in the first half of the year. Our European segment is also witnessing a good start, with growth rates continuing at second quarter levels. Lastly, specialty revenue is slowly trending back towards prior year levels now that it has lapsed the incredibly strong growth rates experienced in the first half of 2021. We are experiencing some level of supply chain shortages and disruptions across all of our segments. These disruptions are creating product scarcity and freight delays that are resulting in meaningful availability pressures. While supply chain challenges are also driving cost inflation across all our segments, we have been very effective in passing along these higher costs, as witnessed by our margin performance. Alongside supply chain inflationary pressures, like many businesses across the globe, we are facing wage inflation and increased competition for labor. We are constantly looking at our wage structure and turnover rates across all of our segments to ensure that we stay ahead of any competitive pressures and help backfill the open positions with the best candidates we can attract. Our focus on the total rewards received by LKQ employees, not just compensation, is helping us navigate the difficult labor markets. From a corporate development perspective, in the second quarter, we acquired 4 businesses. In the United States, we acquired Bumblebee Batteries, another EV battery remanufacturing operation. In Europe, we acquired a workshop concept in The Netherlands, 2 very small former Hess Automotive branch locations in Germany and the equity interest of our former JV partner in a small aftermarket parts business in Germany. In addition to closing on the sale of our PGW business during the quarter, we also divested our equity interest in 2 small joint ventures. Lastly, on the ESG front, on May 23, we released our 2021 Sustainability Report and unveiled our new brand identity, reflecting the company's transformation from a salvage dismantler and recycler to a leading global value-added and sustainable distributor of vehicle parts accessories and services. LKQ is widely known and respected for our environmental stewardship. But within our 2021 CSR, we provided a deeper understanding of our social impact initiatives and strong governance structure, both of which underpin the long-term strength and success of our business. This year's report is another step in evolving our holistic ESG focus across our global organization with new and robust disclosures and accomplishments. Also during the quarter, 50/50 Women On Boards, a leading education and efficacy campaign driving the movement towards gender balance and diversity on corporate Boards recognized LKQ as a 3-plus company. This award acknowledges our efforts in understanding the importance and advantages of having a diverse Board that ultimately benefit stockholders, customers, employees and communities. And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run you through the details of the strong second quarter financial performance. Varun Laroyia : Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. I'm excited to be able to report that we carried the momentum generated by our operational excellence initiatives through the second quarter and produced another strong set of financial results. As Nick described, there is a great deal of volatility in the market related to inflation, supply chain challenges, exchange rate fluctuations and commodity price movements on top of the geopolitical events and the ongoing pandemic. All these factors could easily have become a distraction and taken our focus away from executing on our operational priorities. I'm proud to say that the LKQ team did not let that happen, and our second quarter results reflect this ability to stay on point. Let me start with some highlights of the last quarter. As we announced in June, Moody's became the final of the 3 rating agencies to assign LKQ an investment-grade rating following previous upgrades by Fitch and S&P. We believe that we've taken the right actions over the last 3 years to strengthen our credit profile, and the Moody's upgrade to Baa3 with a stable outlook is further validation of our strategy. As discussed last quarter, achieving an investment-grade rating opens opportunities to improve free cash flow over the upcoming years, in addition to the immediate drop-off in the leans to the credit facility following the covenant suspension. With respect to free cash flow, we produced a healthy $288 million in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date figure to $638 million, and importantly, putting us on pace to achieve our full year guidance of $1 billion. I'm pleased that we were able to build our inventory towards the optimal level as shipping congestion eased a little bit which resulted in a net cash outflow for the quarter of $162 million on this specific account. Strong free cash flow, along with the proceeds from the PGW Glass sale allowed us to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders. We repurchased over 8 million shares for $404 million and paid a quarterly dividend totaling $70 million. In just the last 12 months, we have repurchased over 20 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion and paid $215 million in dividends. In May, our board authorized a further $500 million increase to our share repurchase program to a total of $2.5 billion being authorized. We had about $600 million available as of the end of June, and we have remained active in the market in July. As previously stated, in April, we completed the sale of the PGW aftermarket glass distribution business for gross proceeds of $361 million. We recognized a pretax gain on sale of $155 million or $127 million after tax. Our U.S. GAAP EPS reflects the $0.45 gain, though we have deducted the gain from the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS. I'll now shift to the quarterly results. As expected, and previously communicated, precious metal prices were a drag on results year-over-year, generating a $32 million negative effect on segment EBITDA and an $0.08 headwind on adjusted diluted EPS. Most of the impact related to the precious metals found in catalytic converters, the prices of which were near record levels in the second quarter of 2021, roughly $20 million of the negative effect was reflected in the Self Service segment. Exchange rates created a further headwind as the average rate for the euro and pound sterling decreased by 12% and 10%, respectively, compared to Q2 of 2021. The currency impact reduced segment EBITDA by $20 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.04 relative to last year. And finally, not having the PGW business for the full quarter was a further $12 million headwind to segment EBITDA versus the prior year. Keeping those external factors in mind, our second quarter results reflect a solid operating performance, while gross margin decreased by 30 basis points compared to a year ago, a 70 basis point negative effect came from the metals prices alone. Benefits in pricing and mix partially offset the metals impact. Overhead expenses, as a percentage of revenue, rose 60 basis points year-over-year due to inflationary pressures. Income taxes were booked at 25.3% for the year-to-date period, a 20 basis point increase over our prior guidance, reflecting the shift in the geographic mix of U.S. dollar earnings, as impacted by the significant shift in FX rates since we spoke 90 days ago. As Nick mentioned, diluted EPS was $1.49 for the quarter, including the $0.45 PGW gain and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.09. I'll now turn to the segment operating results. Starting on Slide 8. Wholesale North America produced an EBITDA margin of 18.7% for the quarter, down 90 basis points from the prior year period. Gross margin declined by 80 basis points. Inflationary increases in material and freight costs were offset by higher parts pricing and productivity initiatives. Segment overhead expenses were roughly flat owing to lower personnel costs from incentive compensation and productivity initiatives to mitigate inflationary pressures. Europe reported a 10.8% EBITDA margin for the quarter, up 10 basis points from the prior year period. As you'll see on Slide 9, gross margin improved by 80 basis points, primarily from procurement initiatives and pricing. Overhead expenses increased by 60 basis points from higher personnel, freight and fuel costs. The segment's strong second quarter performance reinforces the team's expectation that they will deliver a double-digit margin for the full year. Moving to Slide 10. Specialty's EBITDA margin of 13.4% declined 150 basis points compared to the prior year, mostly coming from a decrease in overhead expense leverage, driven by an organic revenue decline of 11.5%, as the anniversary a very tough comp from the prior year when the business delivered over 30% organic revenue growth in the first and second quarters of 2021. Inflationary pressures also grew overhead expenses higher including personnel, freight and fuel expenses. The overhead expense increases were partially offset by 60 basis points of benefits from operating expense synergies, mostly generated from the SeaWide acquisition. To provide some context to the segment's performance, pre-pandemic in Q2 of 2019, specialty reported a margin of 12.7%. Since then, the team has made great progress on pricing and productivity, resulting in a 70 basis point improvement from the second quarter of '19 through to Q2 of 2022, in addition to growing the business by over $100 million in revenue. Moving to self service. Self service reported an EBITDA margin of 15.3% for the second quarter of 2022, a solid result for the segment, but below the heightened margin achieved a year ago. The decrease in self service's margin in Q2 of 2022 was driven by movements in metal prices estimated as an 840 basis point negative effect year-over-year, higher car costs and inflationary increases related to freight, fuel and personnel expenses. The third quarter will be markedly tougher for the segment as the higher car costs from the second quarter cycle through in a significantly lower pricing environment for metals before stabilizing in the fourth quarter. I touched on liquidity and capital allocation in the highlights, so I'll reference a few other items of note. As shown on Slide 13, our year-to-date conversion ratio of free cash flow to EBITDA is roughly 70%, noting that the glass proceeds and the gain on sale are not reflected in these figures. There continue to be timing elements that will reverse over the course of the year, and we are confident in our ability to generate sustainable free cash flow in line with expectations of converting EBITDA to free cash flow in the 55% to 60% range for the full year. We have made further progress in rebuilding our inventory levels to achieve our fill rates targets. As you can see on Slides 31 and 32, we have increased inventory in 3 of our 4 segments since December 2021. Specialty was flat through December, but was in a stronger position than our other segments and thus hasn't required a similar inventory build. We remain confident that our inventory positions will enable each segment to continue to offer best-in-class availability and service reliability relative to our competitors. Moving on to capital allocation. We paid down our debt balance by $248 million in the quarter. Our net leverage ratio came in at 1.2x EBITDA and interest coverage exceeds 30x. It's worth noting that our net leverage ratio of 1.2x is in line with the June 2021 figure despite the use of $1.3 billion for share repurchases and dividend payments over the last 12 months. As our earnings release of this morning indicated, the Board has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, which will be paid on September 1 to stockholders of record as of August 11. I will wrap up my prepared comments with our updated thoughts on projected 2022 results. Our guidance assumes there are no significant negative developments related to the COVID-19 in our major markets. Scrap and precious metal prices hold near average June prices and the Ukraine-Russia conflict does not escalate further. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes recent European rates with the balance of year rates for the euro of $1.02 and the pounds sterling at $1.20. Starting with the revenue outlook. We remain comfortable with our revenue outlook and are holding our organic parts and services growth range between 4.5% and 6.5%. We are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.85 up to $4.05 with a midpoint of $3.95. We have narrowed the range as we are halfway through the year, but maintained the midpoint of our prior guidance. To understand why we held the midpoint, please refer to Slide 18 in the presentation, which bridges our prior and current guidance figures. We generated operational benefits in the second quarter and expect further upside in the second half of the year. The total operational improvement is $0.11, which highlights the resilience of the business in difficult trading conditions. While the Ukraine-Russia conflict is still a negative on a full year basis, we have seen better-than-expected results as areas of the country reopen with fighting concentrated in the eastern part of Ukraine. We are honored to be able to support critical mobility needs in the country where feasible and are very proud of the work being done by our colleagues in Ukraine. Capital allocation is also a benefit of $0.03 relative to our prior guidance, primarily related to timing. Note that we are including share repurchases through the week ended the 22nd of July in our guidance and as in prior periods, not assume any further retail purchases for the balance of the year. That's the good news, mostly tied to the areas directly under our control. And then there are other negatives, which are primarily external factors. Headwinds from the weakening FX rates, I mentioned earlier, contributed a $0.06 reduction relative to prior guidance. Declining metals prices are expected to have an additional negative $0.07 impact primarily in the third quarter as we turn cars purchased in the first and second quarters when metals prices were higher at a lower projected scrap and precious metal prices. FX rates and metals prices can move significantly over time. We may have further upside or downside if the actual figures play out differently than we have assumed in our guidance. And finally, we remain on track to deliver at least $1 billion of free cash flow for the year achieving strong free cash conversion in line with our expectations for the business. We haven't increased the minimum, given the negative exchange rate effects and the projected tax payment for the PGW gain, which, in the aggregate, are estimated to be approximately $50 million. We expect to overcome both factors to meet or exceed the $1 billion estimate. Thank you once again for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments. Dominick Zarcone : Thank you, Varun, for that financial overview. Let me restate our key initiatives, which are central to our culture and our objectives. First, integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And fourth, to continue to invest in our future. As you can see from our results, we are committed to driving these metrics forward regardless of the operating environment. We are doing our very best to effectively manage the items which are under our control so as to offset the headwinds which are largely outside of our control. And for that, I offer a tremendous thank you to our team members across the globe that make it happen each and every day. They define what it means to be LKQ proud. And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Scott Stember. Scott Stember : Congrats on the very strong results despite the nonstop headwinds that you're facing. Dominick Zarcone : Thanks, Scott. Scott Stember : First question, I'm just going to jump right to State Farm. Obviously, they left the market more than 20 years ago and they've come back in dipping their toe in. Can you maybe just size this up versus prior attempts of them going back in the market? How real this feels and how tangible and how big this could be, if it really does come to fruition? Dominick Zarcone : Yes. So let's put everything in perspective. Great question, Scott. State Farm is the largest automobile insurance company in the United States of America. They have roughly an 18% market share. They stopped using aftermarket collision parts back in the late 1990s, as a result of some policy language that certain of their customers took issue with. It had nothing to do with the actual parts, it just had to do with policy language. And they stayed on the sidelines really throughout the entirety of their litigation, which lasted for 20 years. And in 2019, they finally settled that suit for about $250 million, which is dropping the bucket, right? That was 20 years ago. And over the last 3 years, people have been wondering now that, that was settled, are they going to come back? State Farm is a very thoughtful, very conservative organization and they move pretty slowly. And this is just a pilot. It's a AV pilot in 2 states with 3 product lines. That said, it is encouraging that this is really the first time outside of some pilots with chrome bumpers for pickup trucks that they are actively looking at the market and evaluating the utilization of a broad array of parts. The reality is if they were to turn it on completely, all at once, which we don't think they will do, we think this is going to -- again, in classic State Farm fashion, this will draw out fairly slowly over time. There is a potential of an 18% increase in aftermarket demand because they're 18% in the marketplace. We don't anticipate any impact on our 2022 or 2023 results because, again, this will probably play out over a longer period. Scott Stember : All right. And just going back to North America, you talked about in June, you saw some encouraging results from a fulfillment standpoint. Could you just give a little bit more detail on that? Dominick Zarcone : Certainly, historically, our fulfillment rates in North America have been well into the mid-90% range. And coming out of the pandemic of all the supply chain issues and the like, we fell below 90%. We picked up a couple of percentage points in the month of June, which was good. We're still well below where we want to be, well below where we used to be. But the fact that we're moving up is encouraging. And obviously, a lot of that has to do with the aftermarket product, which, as I indicated in my prepared comments, was -- is the 1 product line that has been most affected by the supply chain challenges. The volume of aftermarket parts is down. Pricing is very strong, but the volume is down. And we have a lot of inventory on the water, as I mentioned. We were very successful in getting containers filled and on ships in the second quarter. We won't -- given the supply chain, we won't see that until late summer or early fall. But with that, we believe we will be in a good position to continue to drive fulfillment rates back north. We do not believe we're going to get back to plus 95%, but we're moving in the right direction. Scott Stember : All right. And just lastly, your 4.5% to 6.5% parts and service organic growth rate has not changed, but has the composition by segment changed? Dominick Zarcone : Not materially. Europe is right on track with where we would expect them to be, as I indicated. North America, in the first quarter and the second quarter, we're ahead of our expectations. And so there's a little bit more of a shift and impact from the North American business. The Specialty business, as we've seen given the monster comps that we had last year, was down, I think, 15% in the first quarter, 11% in the second quarter. We're trending in the right direction. Again, we've only got 20-some days of data on Q3. We're closing the gap. And our goal would be by the end of the year to be a lot closer to prior year numbers. So maybe a little bit of shift from out of specialty and into North America, but again, comfortable with that 4.5% to 6.5% range. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison. Craig Kennison : First question, just on inflation. Nick, can you characterize the rate of inflation in your cost structure and whether that's easing at all? Dominick Zarcone : Thanks, Craig. It's almost impossible to put a single number on inflation because it's coming at us from so many different corners at different rates. Fuel expenses are up dramatically. I mean gas used to be $3.50 a gallon. During the quarter, as high as over $5 a gallon. Now it's easing back a little bit. But that's not the 9% inflation that the rest of the -- that's being published about the United States inflationary factors, right? Labor rates are up significantly. The good news was in June, for example, we didn't have to go to the spot market for container shipment at all. It was all under contract. And so while it's still above where it was pre-pandemic, it wasn't quite as bad as we had feared. So it really varies almost by category of expense and by location. The experience in North America is different than in Europe. But overall, all of our costs are up. The cost of goods is up. All the SG&A expenses are up. Nothing is -- almost nothing is down other than what we can do to have productivity measures to reduce the consumption of SG&A type items. But it's a big headwind. There's no doubt about it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Butler. Brian Butler : Well, just the first one. Can we talk about the trade working capital opportunity? And how should we think about our model kind of some of the trade working benefits plays out in the second half of 2022? Varun Laroyia : Brian, it's Varun Laroyia calling. That's a great question and certainly a topic very close to my heart, but also over the past few years for the entire organization out here. It is a key element of the revised annual cash incentive program since 2019. And just tremendously proud of the shoulder that every single individual across the enterprise has put into it. And clearly, as you see, we are happy with the inventory build as some of the supply chain congestions eased. Again, it is all relatively speaking, it certainly isn't back to pre-pandemic levels. But if you think about where we've been over the past couple of years, the second quarter was a good quarter for us to be able to pick up inventory in our businesses. And that certainly is what we're here to do to ensure that the right part available at the right place and at the right time. So that really has been the key for us. As you think about the second half of the year, similar to what we've done in the first half, we don't believe that we need to build up inventory levels significantly above where we currently are. But as you know, we typically do, do an inventory build in the fourth quarter because of the seasonality of the overall business coming out of the winter season in Q1 and Q2. So we do expect to build up some inventory towards the back end of the year, but the single biggest piece, as you can think about is the payables offset. And you certainly saw that in the second quarter also. While there was inventory build, we certainly had a nice move on our accounts payable balances to offset that. And then the final piece really within trade working capital is receivables. And on the back of some strong organic revenue growth, North America, as you would have seen on Slide #5, reporting a 10.7% organic revenue growth rate, Europe at 4.2% on a constant currency basis at 4.6%. We do expect receivable balances to move up. And I'm perfectly okay with that as long as our teams continue to manage the past due receivables. And so from that perspective, if the only big buildup is on the receivable side, that's okay. That's kind of -- that's the sign of a good healthy growing business. So overall, while we've had a good solid start in the first 6 months with free cash at about $638 million, we feel comfortable about hitting the minimum $1 billion that we have committed. You do need to note that with the FX challenges from a European perspective, the free cash that gets translated back into U.S. dollars, that obviously is lowered as a result of that, number one. But the other piece really is if you think about the PGW divestiture that we did in the second quarter, there are taxes to be paid, estimated taxes to be paid in the third quarter. Those 2 elements, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, amount to about $50 million, we'll overcome that. And hence, we're still kind of maintaining a minimum of $1 billion of free cash for the full year. Brian Butler : Okay. That's very helpful. My second question was on kind of looking at -- can you talk a little bit about price and volume mix when you look at the U.S. and the EU for the parts and service business for the second quarter? Dominick Zarcone : Yes. The -- it's a great question. As we tried to indicate in our prepared comments, a lot of the organic growth, no surprise, given the inflationary environment that we're dealing with, has come through price. The volume question, again, like the inflationary question, it really depends clearly business by business, product line by product line. In North America, the aftermarket product volumes were down. Salvage collision volumes were actually up because we were able to transfer some of that demand for our aftermarket product into salvage product. The salvage mechanical side of things were kind of flattish. We had some uptick in the reman business. And so net-net, we had -- we were down in North America, but some things were down, some things were up. Same in Europe, you really have to go geography by geography. We had some of our businesses where the volumes were up low single digits, which is great. We had other areas where volumes were down, say, 1% or 1.25%. But pricing was very strong again. And specialty, with the 11.5% decline in organic volumes were down. But again, that's relative to the monster comp. So it really depends on business by business, geography by geography. I believe our teams are doing a great job of managing. We're always trying to get the most volume that we can because ultimately, that's important to sustaining the business. But equally it's important, particularly these days, is making sure that we're covering the inflationary pressures through our pricing actions. And so we're -- we believe the team is doing a nice job of balancing those 2 objectives. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro. Daniel Imbro : I want to start on the North American wholesale side. So obviously, the State Farm development feel like they're positive for growth. But I also want to ask on pricing. I think most of the quarter was driven by pricing. Are we still seeing OEMs raise prices further, Varun? And as you look to the back half and maybe into next year, I mean, would the expectation be that given the broader inflationary backdrop, these pricing increases continue? Or is there a risk that pricing flows or probably have to come down on the OEM side? Dominick Zarcone : Yes, Daniel, this is Nick. The OEs, they don't just increase all the prices on all their parts every month. That's not how they operate. They're very selective in how they're pricing their parts. Some prices go up significantly, some prices don't go up at all. And obviously, all the OEMs kind of have their own strategy. In general, their prices have gone up a little bit less than or generally less than overall inflation. And so we -- whenever they take their prices up, that provides us an opportunity, not just us as a whole, alternative parts industry as a whole, the ability to take pricing up a little bit as well. I can't predict what they're going to do in the future. Ultimately, they're dealing with the same types of inflationary pressures as all the other businesses as it relates to input costs, whether that be materials, commodities, labor, all the rest, right? All I can say is we will try -- we keep a very close eye as to how the OEs are pricing their product. We need to maintain a competitive stance. We think we're doing a good job of doing that in this current environment. Daniel Imbro : Great. That's helpful, Nick. And then Varun, maybe one on the European margins. I think we touched on demand a bit in the last question. But I think at the Analyst Day of our call, you guys noted that further margin expansion was possible and above 10% profit levels. Given the change in the last 30, 60 days and FX rates, economic backdrop, inflation, I mean, do you still think it's possible to see EBITDA margin expansion this year, next year for Europe as you look ahead? Varun Laroyia : Yes. Listen, great question, Daniel, and thank you for giving us the opportunity to respond to that. Listen, I think, as you know, Q1 with the Ukraine-Russia conflict, there were some challenges associated with that. But the underlying business operates in a very resilient market. Folks have kind of talked about the fact that energy prices have been moving up with what's happening further out there. But we really haven't seen a significant drop off on a VMT basis, number one. And that really is the key driver for our European business. So from that perspective, really happy with the way our European business continues to perform. Nick obviously gave some color on the broader platforms in terms of how they've been performing also. I think the key piece out here has been making sure that we have the inventory to satisfy the demand, which we do. But overall, very happy with the way the margin trajectory of the European business continues, and we feel comfortable and confident about the double digits on a full year basis. With regards to 2023, we haven't given any guidance as of now. But needless to say, if you kind of go back to our commitment to the markets way back in September of 2019 when we launched the 1 LKQ Europe Program, at that point of time, we said exiting 2021, we would be a sustainable double-digit margin business. We certainly delivered that in '21. We're delivering that '22. There's no reason for us to start to backslide at this point of time. So while we haven't given any guidance, we do expect there to be further goodness from a margin and profitable growth perspective across our European segment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan. Bret Jordan : On that last question, Varun, you said that VMT has remained pretty stable in Europe. Could you talk about the consumer demand trend, I guess, sort of the cadence in the quarter as obviously compounding volatility over there? Has it had any impact as we've progressed? Dominick Zarcone : Actually, the back part of the quarter was much stronger than the first quarter, Bret, which we were heartened to see. Again, you got to keep in mind, we're largely in what would be deemed a consumer nondiscretionary business, right? We provide service parts that keep vehicles on the road. People need their cars for mobility to get to work, to conduct their daily life. And if the car can't operate, they're going to spend the money to put it back into operational mode. And everyone knows in tough times, you can probably stretch out your oil change for a bit, right? You can stretch out some of the service items for a bit. But sooner or later, you need to repair your car, you need to keep it serviced. And that's what we love about our business, right? It's largely consumer nondiscretionary. No business is totally recession-proof if you want to use that word. But we feel very comfortable with where we are. And again, our operating results in May and June were much better than they were in April. So we're optimistic. Bret Jordan : Great. And then within specialty, could you sort of carve out the performance differences between RV, which I think you called out as being pretty stable versus the SEMA-related product is sort of within that total specialty decline. Could you give us a feeling on the pieces? Dominick Zarcone : Yes. So the RV side of it, what I indicated was down less than the unit -- the business as a whole. Business as a whole was down 11.5%. RV was off less than that. And again, you really have to almost go product set by product set. So core RV products really are tied to less to the RV SAAR breadth, but more to the utilization of the RV and the size of the park. We've done a lot of correlation analysis over the years on this. And what we've always seen is that RV revenues tied a lot closer to campground spending than the RV SAAR because a lot of what we sell are replacements and consumables and that all relates to the utilization of those units. If you go back to the financial crisis, right, The Great Recession, campground spending was flat. It stayed -- hung right in there. And -- but there are some products like towing, which is a great example, which really crosses RV and marine and some of the SEMA product, towing was soft. And on the SEMA side, that's where probably a larger percent relative to RVs, large percent of the spend goes on to vehicles, right? People buy the new pickup truck, their new Jeep and they want to fit it out and pickup truck SAAR was off 12% in the quarter, which is the second quarter in a row that it was down, right? So that's where there is a little bit more pressure. But again, some of it is a comp against almost an unrealistic comp of what we did in 2021. And like I said, the specialty group, including all parts of the specialty group, are doing better and they're clawing their way back to prior year volumes at least in the first few days of the third quarter. We probably won't get there for the quarter as a whole, but we're closing the gap. And from our perspective, that's what's important. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Gary Prestopino. Gary Prestopino : Couple of questions here. First of all, Nick, you didn't cite the growth in collision claims in North America as a comparison to what you did in North America. Do you have statistic handy? Dominick Zarcone : Yes. So repairable claims in the second quarter were up about 6% compared to 2021, but still down 6% compared to 2019. So the industry is still down relative to the pre-pandemic levels. Gary Prestopino : Okay. That's fine. And then Varun, on an absolute dollar basis, how much did -- was FX -- did FX positively impact SG&A? Varun Laroyia : We haven't called that piece out, but I will tell you from a North America perspective, clearly, there's little to none. But if you think about it, really where does the FX exposure come through, it's from our European business. And so if you think about where the European business, total SG&A was around $420-odd million. And if you then kind of go -- you can back into that number, Gary, and this is the way you should think about it. Within the slide deck, we obviously have on Slide #27, we obviously have the FX rates out there also. But essentially, the euro has been the big kind of decline. So roughly call it about a 10% decline on there. So kind of run that piece of the $420 million, but that basically is what the -- it's kind of strange to see a benefit, but the translation benefit, if that's what you're referring to from a lower conversion rate, that's really where it would come through. Dominick Zarcone : And Gary, it's important to keep in mind that the FX issues that we're dealing with are translation issues, i.e., just converting the foreign currency in the U.S. dollars. By and large, they are not transactional issues. We do have some transaction exposure, some of the purchasing of parts in Europe is dollar-denominated, particularly things like oil-based products which are dollar-denominated. But those are things where we know in advance, we're going to be buying, and we can do some hedging of that. So total FX kind of exchange losses, if you will, from a transactional perspective in the quarter was less than $2 million. So it's all just translation of foreign currency results into U.S. dollar results. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Zarcone, I turn the call back over... Dominick Zarcone : Well, we always want to thank everyone for their time and their participation in our call. We know you're all very busy. This is a busy time of the earnings season. We appreciate spending some time with us, and we look forward to joining back up at the end of October. We're going to be pleased to announce our third quarter results. So thanks for your time and attention, and we'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Dennis and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the LKQ Corporation's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  I would now by the turn my conference over to Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations for LKQ Corporation. Please go ahead. Joe Boutross : Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone, and welcome to LKQ's third quarter, 2022 earnings conference call. With us today are Dominick Zarcone, LKQ's, President and Chief Executive Officer; Varun Laroyia, Chief Executive Officer of LKQ Europe; and Rick Galloway, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we're planning to file our 10-Q in the coming days. And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Dominick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe. Good morning to everybody. And thank you for joining us on the call to discuss our third quarter results. Last month we announced a couple of important leadership changes, including Varun Laroyia moving from the CFO chair to become the CEO of our European operations; and Rick Galloway succeeding Varun. Since that move happened with just a few weeks left in the quarter, after I provide some high level comments, Varun and Rick will tag team on the financial details and the updated guidance for 2022. I will then provide some closing comments before opening the call to your questions. Once again, LKQ recorded strong operating results notwithstanding a very difficult macro environment. The pandemic is still creating challenges. The labor market remains tight and the supply chain is less than optimal though finally, starting to show some signs of improvement. The war continues in Europe and economies around the globe are showing signs of softness as many governments tried to curb their runaway inflation created by the monetary stimulus utilized to support economies during the early days of the pandemic. But the biggest current headwind is in the foreign exchange market. With the U.S. dollar reaching levels we haven't seen in over 20 years. While we can hedge much of our transactional exposure with about 46% of our revenue being sourced from our European segment, we cannot hedge the translation exposure. To put things into perspective, the euro and pound sterling fell approximately 7% relative to the dollar during Q3 and have fallen about 15% since the start of 2022. The volatility in exchange rates on a year-over-year basis had a material impact on our reported results during the quarter, reducing revenue by $228 million and adjusted EPS by about $0.07 a share during the third quarter. I believe when you focus on our local currency results, you will agree that our company is performing extremely well and we are quite pleased to achieve our EPS goals in light of the ongoing and challenging environment. The leadership changes announced in mid-September are moving forward in a seamless manner and clearly demonstrate the depth and breadth of our talent. As discussed in each of the past three investor day events, talent management has been a key priority for LKQ and the benefits of that focus shine through at times like this. Overall, it was a strong quarterly result and we continue to be optimistic about the future. Our decision to increase the dividend reflects the confidence that we have in our business. Now onto the quarter. Revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $3.1 billion, a decrease of about 5.9% as compared to $3.3 billion in the third quarter of 2021. On a constant currency basis third quarter revenue grew up by about 1% to a little over $3.3 billion. Parts and services organic revenue increased 4.8%, while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures decreased revenue by 2.3% and the foreign exchange rates decreased revenue by 7.4% for a total parts and services revenue decrease of 5%. Other revenue fell 17.4% due to changes in commodity prices relative to the same period in 2021. And that's a reminder, PGW was included in our third quarter 2021 results.  Net income for the quarter was $261 million as compared to $284 million for the same period in 2021. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.95 compared to $0.96 for the same period of 2021, a decrease of 1%. On an adjusted basis, net income for the quarter was $266 million as compared to $300 million for the same period of 2021, a decrease of 11.4%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.97 as compared to $1.02 for the same period of 2021, a decrease of 4.9%. Importantly, please note that FX volatility and lower metals prices collectively created a $0.16 per share headwind in the third quarter of 2022 when compared to the 2021 results. Now let's turn to the quarterly segment highlights. In North America, organic revenue for parts and services of our North American segment increased 10.9% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, which exceeded our expectations. The impact of divestitures primarily PTW reduced revenue by 10.6% in the quarter. This organic growth performance is outstanding when you consider that the industry data suggests that collision liability related to auto claims were up only 2%. Also, North America delivered these results in the midst of decreasing miles driven, which is largely due to the increase in fuel prices. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, miles driven decreased 3.3% in July and was up only seven tenths to 1% in August. That said, the long term trends for North America continue to be very favorable. Continued technician shortages will benefit our diagnostics business as shops look to outsource their diagnostic repairs. Total loss rates trending down into the high teens, parts per claim, reaching over 12 parts per vehicle, a 20% increase from the third quarter of 2018 and office occupancy filling nearly a three-year high, which ultimately lead to more congestion in claims frequency. During the quarter, we were encouraged by the upward trend in our aftermarket volumes. During the quarter, we experienced some relief in the aftermarket supply chain relative to Q2, which translated into an increase in our fill rates. The biggest challenge exists on the domestic side of the supply chain, including the rail carriers and truckers, all of which are out of our control. In talking with several third-party experts, they generally expect these domestic challenges will continue into the first half of 2023. The spot market pricing for containers used in ocean freight has softened measurably, and our team is laser-focused on active rate reductions from our contracted carriers. Now onto our Self Service segment. Organic revenue for parts and services for our Self Service segment increased 7.2% for a third quarter. The softness in commodity prices resulted in a decline in other revenue of 24.8%. The soft metal prices also had a significant impact on segment EBITDA margins on a year-over-year basis. This was anticipated given the lag effect that Varun touched on during our second quarter call. Moving on to our European segment, organic revenue for parts and services in the third quarter increased 4.8% on a reported basis and 5.8% on a per day basis. Acquisitions added one half of 1% growth in the quarter, while the exchange rates resulted in a 14.7% decline on a year-over-year basis. I am quite pleased with the organic growth, albeit mostly driven by price in an environment facing high inflation, continued supply chain hurdles and an energy crisis in Europe. All of our European regional platforms recorded strong local currency organic revenue gains with some being in the low double digits. The only decline on a year-over-year basis related to the sale of product to Russian based jobbers, which as previously mentioned, we completely stopped back in February when the war commenced. Now let's move on to our Specialty segment. Organic parts and services revenue for Specialty declined 9.1% in the quarter, a sequential improvement from Q2, but still down and below our expectations. You may recall this segment reported 14% organic growth in Q3 of last year, so on a two-year stack, the annual revenue growth is still positive. The impact of acquisitions had a 6.6% positive impact on revenue growth in Specialty, while as a predominantly U.S. business, the exchange rates had a negligible impact. During the quarter, certain product groups such as towing that have some exposure to new unit volume, again underperformed in the quarter as the new RV unit sales have decreased year-to-date by over 23% through August. As a reminder, the majority of our RV parts are replacement parts that are not tied to new unit volume but are largely related to the size of the RV part, which is still running at record levels. Also, some of the softness that the SEMA-related products based in the quarter was due to a year-over-year decrease in light truck and SUV vehicle sales in the United States, an important vehicle category for our specialty offerings. Total U.S. light vehicle sales were flat year-over-year. Importantly, I would like to congratulate our Specialty team for receiving the RV Industry Association Award as the 2022 Distributor of the Year. This is the second year in a row for this recognition, further validation that our people are truly our greatest asset. Let's move on to initial Q4 revenue trends. Revenue for our North America wholesale operations has gone off to a solid start, largely driven by the improvement in aftermarket fill rates. Though we don't anticipate, we will continue to run at these very high levels, particularly as we lap the pricing movements initiated last year. Our European segment is also witnessing a good start with growth rates continuing at Q3 levels. Specialty revenue is also trending similar to the Q3 performance and it will have easier comps in the fourth quarter compared to the rest of this year. From my corporate development perspective, in the [indiscernible] quarter we divested our Florida shredder. As part of this transaction, we entered into a supply agreement to which our Florida self-service yards will sell or offer to sell its crust vehicles to the new acquirer. We also divested our equity interest in a small subsidiary of Stahlgruber. Neither of these divestitures are material. Our employees sit at the center of our ESG efforts. And we are in the process of working through our second employee engagement survey. We just completed surveying all of our North American employees and our in process in Europe. We have a lot of data to analyze, but the North American team had a 93% participation rate. Our independent advisor has mentioned this is extremely high for these types of activities and is generally indicative of a high level of engagement across the workforce. I look forward to showing more on this topic once the process is complete. And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun and Rick. Rick Galloway : Thank you, Nick. And good morning to everyone joining us today. I am honored to take on the position of CFO of LKQ, and I look forward to driving our financial and strategic initiatives to lead the company to even greater success. As part of the North American leadership team, I was heavily involved in rolling out and executing the operational excellence initiatives that have spurred significant improvement in profitability and cash flows over the last few years. Now as CFO, I will continue to drive the organization's focus on profitable revenue growth, delivering strong margins and free cash flow generation from this new vantage point. Especially as we face the macroeconomic headwinds, Nick mentioned, it will be critical to lean in on productivity and efficiency. And I look forward to partnering with the segment teams to continue to drive this forward. Turning now to the consolidated results, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.95 and adjusted diluting earnings per share of $0.97, which was a $0.05 reduction relative to Q3 last year. Our operational performance showed year-over-year improvement and was in line with our expectations. However, this solid operational performance was more than offset by unfavorable effects of $0.09 from volatility and metals prices and $0.07 from foreign currency exchange effects caused by the stronger dollar. Additionally, we had negative effects of $0.06 in total from one, divesting the PGW business in Q2; two, higher interest rates and three, a 20 basis point increase in the effective tax rate to 25.5%. We mitigated about $0.07 of the decline with the lower share count resulting from our share repurchase program. Shifting to segment performance. Much of the operational improvement in the quarter came from the wholesale North American segment. Going to Slide 10, the segment EBITDA margin of 19.4% is a record for the third quarter. We saw strong growth margin improvement of 190 basis points with a little over half from pricing and productivity initiatives and the remainder from the mix with the sale of the low margin PGW business. Overhead expenses were favored by 20 basis points primarily related to non-recurring expenses from Q3 2021. We're very pleased with the way wholesale is performing and while we believe wholesale will continue to generate strong margins, there will likely be moderation in upcoming quarters as we move towards the long-term expectation we presented at Investor Day earlier this year. On the Q2 call in July, we noted that self-service would face difficult conditions in Q3 and as expected self-service had a tough quarter with roughly break even segment EBITDA and a 2.6% margin. With scrap metals prices falling we experienced a negative lag effect as we turn cars purchased in the second quarter when metals prices were higher at lower scrap prices. We have a slide in the presentation to depict this effect. Looking at Slide 29, you can see the delta between the average scrap metals price in Q2 of $279, which influenced the amount we paid for the cars purchased and the current quarter average of $198, which drove the amount we received when scrapping the Q2 cars we purchased. We wanted to provide this depiction to help provide more clarity on the lag effect, but caution there isn't a perfect correlation between scrap steel prices and car costs as other market conditions will impact the purchase price of the cars. The reduction in prices along with lower volume processed in Q3 produce the decrease in gross margin and the negative leverage effect on overhead costs. We expect improved sequential profitability in Q4 as we cycle through most of the higher cost Q2 purchases by the end of September. I'll turn the call to Varun to cover the other segments as well as cash flows and the balance sheet. Varun Laroyia : Thank you, Rick. Appreciate that introduction and the overview of the North America wholesale and self-service segments performance. Let's move to Slide 11 of the earning deck. Europe delivered an 11.3% EBITDA margin for the quarter, down 20 basis points from the prior year period. Gross margin improved by 10 basis points as we worked to offset inflation with procurement initiatives and pricing. Overhead and other expenses increased by 30 basis points with inflation weighing primarily on personnel, freight and fuel costs. The segments solid third quarter performance reinforces our expectation that we will deliver a double-digit margin for the fuller despite the macroeconomic headwinds around general inflation, energy costs and the Russia/Ukraine conflict. While I have been in my new role as CEO of the European segment for a little over a month, I have gotten an opportunity to get an on the ground view of our operations and the management team. And I am even more impressed by the strength of our frontline businesses and despite the darkening macroeconomic clouds with judicious and decisive prioritization, I am confident that we can achieve our long-term operational and financial target. Moving on to Slide 12 specialties EBITDA margin of 10.8% declined 30 basis points compared to the prior year coming from a decrease in overhead expense leverage driven by an organic revenue decline of 9.1% as they anniversary a tough comp from the prior year when the business delivered a nearly 14% organic revenue growth rate in the third quarter. Inflationary pressures also pushed overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue higher including personnel, freight and fuel expenses. The overhead expense increases were partially offset by a 70 basis point benefit from lower incentive compensation and 80 basis points of benefits from operating expense synergies largely generated from the SeaWide acquisition of a year ago. Shifting to cash flows and the balance sheet. We produced a healthy $224 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $862 million. We have made good progress in rebuilding our inventory levels in wholesale North America and in Europe. As shown on Slide 32, we increased our inventory values in these segments, do please note that the dollar increase doesn't directly equate to a quantity change given the higher input costs. Using North America aftermarket as an example with higher per unit costs by inventory balance in dollar terms is close to Q4 of 2019, while the total available quantity on hand is down approximately 20%. We still have some work to do to optimize inventory at hand, especially going into the busier winter season, so we expect further fine tuning of inventory levels over the balance of the year. Through September the cash conversion ratio is 64% conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow just above our target range of 55% to 60%. There continues to be timing elements that will reverse over the course of the year. For example, the third quarter inventory build will result in higher outflows for payables in the fourth quarter, and we are confident in our ability to generate sustainable free cash flow in line with our expectations. As of September 30th, we had net debt of $2.2 billion with a net leverage ratio of 1.3 times EBITDA which is comfortably inside our target range of being below 2 times. Our effective borrowing rate rose to 3% for the quarter and with the effective rate heights in the U.S. and Europe we are $1.6 billion in variable rate debt, so a 100 basis point rise in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately $16 million. As you can imagine, we are evaluating our fixed versus floating rate mix as part of a larger review of our capital structure and credit facility, which matures in approximately 15 months and we expect to complete this assessment shortly. Most of our transactions are conducted in the home entities functional currency, for example, buying inventory for our U.S. locations in U.S. dollars or European entities borrowing funds in local currency to create in natural operating hedge. As a result, our currency exposure is weighted to translation of foreign currency denominated results into U.S. dollars rather than transaction gains and losses where we have transaction exposures, we hedge through forward contracts. We are comfortable with our current approach to managing foreign exchange risk, though we are monitoring market conditions to determine if a change in strategy is required. With a strong free cash flow and the proceeds from the PGW Glass sale earlier this year, we have been able to return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders in 2022. We repurchased over 17 million shares for $891 million through September, including almost 7 million shares for $343 million in the third quarter. Additionally, we paid quarterly dividends totaling $210 million year-to-date. We had approximately $260 million available on the previous board share repurchase authorization as of September 30th, and we have remained active in the market in October with a further $119 million purchase through last Friday. Earlier this week, our board authorized a $1 billion increase to our share repurchase program for a total authorization of 3.5 billion and extended the term through October of 2025. We are pleased to have this program expansion to be able to continue to use share repurchases as part of our balanced capital allocation strategy. As our earnings release of this morning indicated the board also approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.275 per share, which will be paged on December 1st to stockholders of record as of November 17th. This reflects a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend. Before I turn the call back to Rick, I would like to take a moment to thank LKQ's leadership team, our global finance organization, and all our dedicated employees across the organization. It has truly been a great privilege to serve as your CFO over these last five years. Over that time, the company has achieved tremendous things with significant growth and profitability and free cash flow, building a rock solid fortress like balance sheet and generating robust shareholder returns. I truly appreciate everyone's efforts to reach this point and I feel honored to have been a part of the team during this pivotal period. Now we need to leverage our strengths to become even more successful. I leave the finance organization in Rick's capable hands and I look forward to working with him in my new role. With that, Rick, back to you. Rick Galloway : Thanks Varun. I'm also looking forward to working with you in this new capacity. I will conclude with our updated thoughts on projected 2022 results shown on Slide 6. Our guidance is based on current conditions and recent trends and assumes that scrap and precious metals prices hold near September prices and the Ukraine/Russia conflict continues without further escalation or major additional impact on the European economy and miles driven. On foreign exchange our guidance includes recent European rates with the balance of the year rates for the Euro of $0.97 and the pound sterling at $1.11 versus $1.02 and $1.20 in the previous guidance effectively a 5% and 7.5% decline. We narrowed the organic parts and service growth rate range to 4.75% to 5.75% with the midpoint up slightly from our year-to-date growth at 5.1%. Please note that we have one fewer selling day in Q4 this year. We are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.85 to $3.95 with a midpoint of $3.90. We have narrowed the range as we are three quarters through the year and lowered the midpoint of our prior guidance by $0.05. To understand why we reduced the midpoint, please refer to Slide 7 in the presentation which bridges our prior and current guidance figures. Operating performance remains solid and represents upside of $0.02 relative to our prior guidance. The frontline businesses continue their resilience in difficult conditions. Capital allocation is also a benefit of $0.03 relative to our prior guidance, primarily related to higher repurchase volume. Note that we are including share repurchases through the week ended October 21st in our guidance. That's the good news generally tied to the areas under our control. Then there are the negatives, which are primarily external factors. Declining metals prices are projected to have a negative $0.04 effect. Headwinds from the weakening FX rates mentioned earlier contribute a $0.03 reduction relative to prior guidance and unless the trend reverses will be a negative factor in 2023. Taxes and interests drive another $0.03 negative effect, including the rate changes previously noted. FX rates and metal prices can move significantly over time. We may have further upside or downside if the actual figures play out differently than we assume in our guidance. We expect to deliver approximately $1 billion of free cash flow for the year achieving free cash flow conversion in line with our expectations for the business. Translation of foreign currency denominated cash flows will have a negative effect given the lower euro and pound sterling rates used in our latest estimates. But we are still anticipating 55% to 60% EBITDA conversion to free cash flow adjusted for the PGW gain. Thanks for your time this morning. With that, I'll turn the call to Nick for his closing comments. Dominick Zarcone : Thank you Rick and Varun for that financial overview. Let me restate our key initiatives which are central to our culture and our objectives. First, to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, to drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn give us the flexibility to maintain our balanced capital allocation strategy; and forth, as always to continue to invest in our future. As you can see from our results, we are committed to driving these metrics forward regardless of the operating environment. Our teams across all of our segments are executing on their operational targets and they have done a tremendous job during these unpredictable and unique times. With respect to the items we can't control, such as FX rates, the supply chain and labor market constraints we don't have a crystal ball, but it appears we will be confronting these uncontrollable items as we enter 2023. That said, I am confident our operational excellence efforts can navigate and effectively manage most any challenge. Why? Simply stated, we have the best teams in each of our segments and industry and their track record over the last three years speaks for itself and for that, I offer a tremendous thank you to our team members across the globe that make it happen each and every day. They define what it means to be LKQ proud. And with that operator we are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first questions from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking our questions and congrats on the quarter. Dominick Zarcone : Good morning, Daniel. Daniel Imbro : Rick, I wanted to start on something you said around kind of North American margins. I think the comment you made was you expected them to moderate going forward maybe 4Q into next year. Can you just provide more detail on what the drivers of that outlook is? Is it a change in underlying core margin to due to maybe wage or other cost pressure or kind of what, what was driving that comment around moderation going forward? Rick Galloway : Yes. Thanks Daniel for your question. Good \u2013 it's a good question. The margins we had in Q3 obviously very favorable record that we had and so very pleased with what the team's done. One of the things that we've seen over the last call it 12 months or so is the competitive market and the ability of us to be able to pass through some pricing and do it pretty effectively early on. So there's a couple of things that are happening, one of the things that we'll see is the increase in our overall product cost inflation that, that we would expect. And going back to what we've seen and what we told you guys in Q2 is the long-term view for us is probably somewhere in the low-to-mid-17 is where we would expect that to be. With the inflationary increases that that we keep seeing, the ability to pass on that cost to our customers will be a little more challenged as we come into 2023. I would think that it would be a slow move \u2013 a little bit slower moves to those numbers that we've said on the long term piece though. Dominick Zarcone : I don't know if you want to add anything on that. Varun Laroyia : No, that's good. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Hi, thank you. So I do have two. So this one's a little out of the left field, it's geopolitical, so I'm curious about your views on looking forward, it appears the EU energy crisis as peaked a bit. We're at full capacity on natural gas supplies. Maybe there's a little relief, so I'm curious about that and then the other part of that same question. The China leadership not changes, but continuity, what's the Plan B if China decides it's going to embargo shipping out of Taiwan and what's Plan B related to that? And then I have a question about 2023 after that? Dominick Zarcone : Okay. Michael, this is Nick. Thanks for your question. As you know, and as everyone knows, the entire aftermarket collision parts industry moved to Taiwan decades ago. There are no material production capacity outside of Taiwan. It just doesn't exist. There are no plants sitting in Mexico or Vietnam or India sitting idle waiting for the Taiwanese machine to get shutdown, right? It doesn't exist. Now we pay very close attention, obviously to geopolitical events and we're not overly concerned about the scenario that that you laid out where China would effectively shut down the Taiwanese economy because they wouldn't pick out auto parts specifically and the reality is, if they were to shut down the economy and shut down kind of shipments out of Taiwan, auto parts is the least of everyone's concern. 65% of all semiconductor production and 90% of all advanced chip production comes out of Taiwan. So if China were to embargo export shipments, you would not be able to buy iPhones or new cars or metal equipment or anything that has a chip in it. And we think that the Chinese leadership is they're very smart, they certainly don't want to cook the golden goose that Taiwan represents in form of a really strong economy. Our sense and in talking with outside advisors is it'd be more likely that China would move kind of to a Hong Kong model first where they would seek to have significant influence over the territory, but not just shut \u2013 totally just shut down their economy. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then the second follow up question, I realize you're still in budget process for 2023, but there's some knowns sitting here today, where your interest rates move to taxes, FX, freight, what are those pieces of the waterfall, what is the net plus or minus of those relative to the new midpoint? And then clearly you have a positive view about their structural growth still. So I'm just trying to understand headwinds? Dominick Zarcone : Yes. So on the 2023 outlook you are absolutely correct. We're in the middle of our budget process and we have yet to see any submissions from the field. We don't have a consolidated view at this time. What I can tell you however, is that nothing has changed maturely from what we presented back at the Analyst Day and the Investor Day this past June 1st in Nashville. So on the revenue front, we will likely shake out at a consolidated per day growth rate similar to 2023 or similar to 2022. But we'd probably get there with a slightly different mix as indicated in my prepared comments we do not anticipate that the recent double-digit organic growth in North America wholesale business will be sustainable. It's just, it's too high. Europe should post up similar organic growth next year as what we're doing this year, which is in the mid-single digits. We do anticipate that specialty will return to positive revenue growth, likely in the low- to mid-single digits and self-service assuming scrap prices stay where they are can sustain low- to mid-single digit growth as well for their parts and services business. All that obviously is based on what we talked about in Nashville and that is market growth being in the low-single digits, a bit of share gain, which we always are trying to achieve each and every year in each of our businesses and some boost from inflation. As Rick indicated 2023 will have one pure selling day than 2022 which clips you for a few basis points of growth, 40 basis points to be exact. And so hopefully that gives you a sense of local currency revenue trends, but the strong dollars that we've had this year that's going to carry over assuming rates stay about where they are next year. And so Michael, when you and everyone else on the call are building your models you should probably bake in kind of the exchange rates over the last few weeks, which is about $0.97 for the Euro and $1.11 for the sterling because at those levels, just to put it in perspective, that's like a $450 million headwind from a U.S. dollar perspective after taking into account the translation impact to the currencies. Now, in terms of margins, as we just indicated in answering Daniel's questions long-term, we believe that our North American wholesale business can sustain margins in that low- to mid-17% range. We don't expect to go from where we are today down to 17% next year. We think it's going to be a more gradual decline. In Europe we are absolutely committed to achieving consistent double-digit EBITDA margins. The one LKQ year program is still underway. We would expect to see some minor margin improvements with specialty, particularly if we can get some modest revenue growth and the self-service margins assuming no significant changes in scrap prices should get back to kind of mid-teens. On free cash flow, again, 55% to 60% of EBITDA we believe is the right target. Interest costs will be higher due to the impact of the higher rates on our floating rate line of credit balances as Varun indicated that was about $1.6 billion as of September 30th. At current interest rates, that would be about a $28 million headwind, which is about $0.07 a share. Now obviously earnings per share will benefit from the 17 million shares that we repurchased thus far in 2022. So we've got a lot of work ahead of us on the budgeting front. But hopefully that gives you enough to get into the right zip code when building your models for next year. Operator : Your next questions from the line of Ali Faghri with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Ali Faghri : Good morning and thanks for taking my question and Varun and Rick congrats again on the new roles. Rick Galloway : Thank you Ali. Ali Faghri : So my question is on used car pricing, obviously we're seeing used car prices come down real time right now. Maybe you can remind us what the impact is of lower used car prices on your business? Rick Galloway : Yes. Simply lower used car prices generally translate into lower cost of the vehicles \u2013 of the total loss vehicles at the salvage auctions because there's as prices come down the competition at the auctions includes rebuilders and if used car prices come down, what they can pay for their feed stock if you will that total loss vehicle has to come down as well, if they're going to maintain their margins. And so it's not a dollar-for-dollar reduction if you will, but we would expect that as used car prices settled down a little bit, that the price that we have to pay for the cars at auction will also come in a bet. Ali Faghri : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next questions from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions as well and congratulations to the whole team. Varun, I wanted to start with you and ask about your priorities for Europe and maybe frame them in the context of the LKQ 1 strategy. Where do you see an opportunity to double down on some of these initiatives and where might you dial back your priorities in order to focus on what you see as the highest priority? Varun Laroyia : Well, good morning, Craig and thank you for the kind wishes. Super excited both Rick and myself, but I think it really is yet another testament to the work that we as a management team have done from a talent development perspective that all the dominoes that kind of went through were all fulfilled internal with internal talent. With regards to the European business now that I've been on that the ground for a little over a month at this point of time, I kid you not. I am so excited about the opportunities we have out there, both internal and external, and I kind of frame it up from a market perspective in any case, if you think about the limited new car inventory, think about elevated used car prices. Think about the aging carpark. These are all supportive of a healthy demand in the aftermarket. So that's just kind of framing the piece and despite the fact that VMT is under pressure given the energy prices over in Europe, listen people are still doing hybrid working. So as you think about the go-forward run rate with regards to more people coming from a day into the office a week to two days, moving now towards companies trying to push for three days a week and then from there on VMT will recover and hopefully at some point of time once the geopolitical crises also tend to calm down a little bit more specifically the Ukraine/Russia conflict that's ongoing. I am bullish about the future. So that's it in terms of framing that entire piece. With regards to my specific priorities very simple, the first one is we grow the business and we will grow the business faster than the market. Organic growth will be the key focus though we always have the opportunity to look into highly accretive and selective acquisitions. So number one, grow the business. The second one is be decisive about prioritization and then just flawlessly execute. We have so much opportunity across Europe that arguably on the flip side of it is we have too much opportunity. And so really the key piece that I have shared with my management team is making the fundamentals \u2013 building the fundamentals, which essentially as a distribution business is the right part at the right place and at the right price, and then we will deliver flawlessly, right? We are here to promote affordable mobility and that really is what we do. There is no one else that has the kind of distribution footprint, the scale, the ability to invest through cycles, our advanced logistics distribution centers like in Tamworth, in Berkel, coupled with an aging carpark, super excited. And this is before I get into some of the internal programs such as back office and private label. Those continue to remain opportunities for us. So, number one, grow the business faster than the market. Second, be decisive about prioritization and flawlessly execute. And the final one is developing talent. We have a tremendous management team out there. Super, super I've kind of put them up against absolutely anybody. But again, our ability to develop talent further as we continue to execute on the various opportunities out there. To your question about the one LKQ Euro program, if you actually pull out the presentation that Nick and myself had presented on the 10th of September 2019, there were four fundamental building blocks. One was procurement, the second one was private label, a third was revenue optimization, and then the fourth one was essentially the ERP, okay. Those are the key priorities and that is really where we are doubling down. I feel super excited about where we are, but clearly there is more work to be done and just making sure that we don't get distracted by the various, I'd say peripheral opportunities and really double down on what we had committed to doing. So that really is where we are and as I said, yes the macroeconomic clouds are darkening, but in terms of our ability to execute through those, given the sectoral tailwinds, very, very excited. Craig Kennison : Thank you. Operator : Your next questions from the line of Scott Stember with MKM Partners. Please go ahead. Scott Stember : Good morning, and I echo my compliments as well to everybody in management. Thanks for taking my question. Dominick Zarcone : Thank you Scott. Scott Stember : You guys talked about Europe seeing some areas that are growing in low doubles. Could you just maybe parse out which areas in Europe did better? And with regards to, I guess, what you're seeing right now, are you seeing any signs that the countercyclical benefits of the mechanical aftermarket are starting to kick in? Varun Laroyia : Hi, Scott, it's Varun. Let me answer your question. Listen, in terms of the elevated gas prices, those are something that's something that we certainly tracking. We don't get regular VMT data like we get here in the United States, but there are other metrics, other KPIs that essentially kind of I give you the same result, whether it be congestion indices, whether it be fuel consumption, diesel, petrol, things along those lines. So that is something that I am keenly watching along with my team. And yes, there are certain pressures from that perspective.  But having said that pricing, the higher input cost that's coming through is being priced through across the entire market, right. And that's kind of moving into, call it, mid-to-high single digits, and that is coming through. You can see that through the gross margin side of things also. So with regards to, is there any deferral taking place at this point of time, we really haven't seen any deferral other than the fact that service mechanicals you need to \u2013 if you're driving and even if you're not driving once a year, you need to get your oil and oil filter changed, for example. So from that perspective, the countercyclical nature of what we do over in Europe is actually very, very resilient. And that really is what we are excited about. Pricing is sticking through at this point of time, and I know given how we operate our businesses, service reliability, having access to inventory, having a pristine balance sheet that supports us, my sense is there will be more stress in the broader market. But the larger ones will continue to power their way through because we are seeing some fairly rational behavior taking place across the market. I think on a go-forward basis, something to watch out for is inflation. Okay. And that certainly while it's kind of gone through the cog side of it in that has stuck, my sense is that certainly will be coming through on the labor side. I think based on CPI numbers that we're seeing out of the various European markets, that certainly is a key focus area for my team and myself, and really driving the productivity side of things where, again, we have a tremendous opportunity as with the three advanced logistics distribution centers that we've already set up essentially to futureproof our business. But again, lots more to do out there. And again, it won't be plain sailing for everybody, but really this is when market leaders, thoughtful leadership teams really rise to the top. Scott Stember : All right. And just one follow-up. Any update on State Farm? Dominick Zarcone : The answer is yes and no. So as you recall, Scott, during the summer State Farm initiated a 12-week pilot program in the State of Texas and Oklahoma where they decided to start using aftermarket headlights, taillights and bumpers. Well, that 12-week period has come to an end. That said, State Farm has continued to keep the program alive in the State of Texas and in the State of Oklahoma, and it's active today.  We're assuming that State Farm is reviewing all the data from their pilot, and certainly while there can be no assurances of any change, we take the fact that the program is still on place and ongoing a month or so after it was supposed to come to a close, we take that as a positive indication. Look, there is nothing more that we would prefer than for State Farm to expand the program, both from a geographic perspective. I mean, taking it national would be awesome. And from a product per perspective, that being all aftermarket parts as opposed to just headlights, taillights and bumpers. We have a continuous dialogue with all the major insurance companies. We're in constant communication. And obviously if State Farm decides to broaden their aftermarket utilization we will be sure to let everybody know. So officially, there is no news, but unofficially they're keeping the pilot going, which we take as a positive as opposed to a negative. Scott Stember : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Your next questions from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning guys. Dominick Zarcone : Good, good morning, Bret. Varun Laroyia : Good, good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : Hey, Varun, now that you've been in Europe for a month, and I guess we were talking about the 1 LKQ plan. How do you handicap that ERP consolidation? And maybe if you could talk about sort of over what period of time, it seems like such a complicated mix of supply chain systems over there? Having lived with it is that as big an opportunity as you thought initially? Varun Laroyia : Yes, listen, I think, in terms of, just to kind of remind everyone from a broader perspective, you are essentially talking about one of the key underpinnings of the 1 LKQ Europe program was to essentially integrate certain backend processes of the business. So, maintaining the frontend, entrepreneurial, local nature of our business and making sure we have best-in-class customer intimacy, and also the last mile of delivery, no change to any of that. But in terms of one of the key enablers in unlocking the overall cost to serve is from a back office perspective. Nick and I have talked about this ad nauseam with regards to where we get our payables done from, where payroll runs from, that, frankly, 1 rate [ph] doesn't care about as much as long as it is done efficiently and effectively. But really it's the case of having the ERP system out there, which unlocks all of these pieces. Nothing has changed on that front. And if you go back to thinking about how we built up the European business, largely bought through private equity companies. And that has, I think, as all of us know, typically have a very limited time horizon with regards to certain investments. So in terms of making the investment on the ERP, no change at all. In fact, that's an area that I'm working with my management team to double down and get it done even quicker because the pools of opportunity that it opens up are still very, very attractive. So no change on that front and really making sure that the entire organization has got its shoulder behind it rather than it being a technology project. So some due difference out there in the first few weeks, but overall, no change on that front in terms of where we are going. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then a question on specialty. When you think about the RV business versus the SEMA type categories, could you sort of talk about relative cyclicality? And I think you'd expected sort of positive low single digit growth in 2023. What would be the impact of a recession, maybe as it sort of like, as you look at the SEMA side of that business? Dominick Zarcone : I'll take that one Bret. What we have seen is our revenue on the RV side is not tied necessarily to RV SAR, new unit sales, as much as it's tied to campground utilization. And so unlike \u2013 there are a couple product lines that I indicated things like towing, there is a direct correlation to new unit sales because the first time RV buyers usually need to get hitches and related towing gear installed on their vehicle. But again, most of the RV revenue comes from kind of consumables and things that need to be replaced. And that's directly related to the overall size of the RV park, as well as the campground utilization, which is currently running at record levels. And so there is going to be a little bit of a ying and a yang if a recession really does hit. What we also know is that during recessionary times folks kind of reallocate their vacation dollars and would tend to shy away from getting on applying and applying to Disney World and look for more cost effective ways to vacation with their families and camping cost effective way of doing that. On the SEMA side of the business there are a number of products tied to new vehicle sales, particularly pickup trucks, jeeps and other SUVs. The enthusiast marketplace tends to hold pretty steady through the recessionary environments. And so at the end of the day, Bret, it depends on how deep and how long the recession goes. And we can't predict that. We feel good about our market position as being the leader in that market, and we will continue to work hard to drive profitable revenue growth wherever we can. Operator : Your next questions from the line of Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead. Gary Prestopino : Hey good morning all. Quick question on the recycled side. I mean, we could be looking at an unprecedented decline in used car prices for the next year or two. How does that impact what you're buying at auction? And then I guess the other question I would have there is do you see \u2013 do the prices of the parts as the cars come down on the recycled side, do they come down concurrently with the decline in car prices? Dominick Zarcone : I'll take that and then I will invite Rick to provide any commentary that he may have. The reality is as prices come down, as I indicated, the cost of what we have to pay at auction tends to come down as well. Again, it's not dollar for dollar, but there is a correlation there. The reality is that doesn't make us buy more vehicles or not. We buy the vehicles that we need to have the inventory that we believe is required to fulfill customer demand. Okay? We don't bid on every car that comes to the auction and we bid on the vehicles based on the parts demand that we see and the need to have the inventory. And so that's not going to change. We're going to stay very focused on utilizing our models, our AI, and the like to buy the vehicles that we need to drive the best margin. Just buying a total loss vehicle because it's for sale. If those [indiscernible] are going sit on their warehouse shelf for the next year or two there is no utility to us doing that. And so we focus on buying what we need. And if the car prices come down, that is great. We do not adjust pricing of the parts based on the cost of the car because again, we price relative to where the OEs have their prices, we need to maintain that value proposition for the insurance companies to continue to have them push the utilization of alternative parts. And so our ability to price up in some parts based on what the OEs are doing, but just because the price comes down doesn't mean we\u2019ll automatically lower the price of the parts that we sell. But Rick, anything else? Rick Galloway : No, I think it was spot on. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. And then lastly, Varun, you mentioned something about, or somebody did, what's the impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on your interest expense? Rick Galloway : Yes, no, I'm the one who mentioned that Gary. Essentially at the end of September, we had about $1.6 billion of variable rate debt on the revolver. So every 100 basis points will essentially be $16 million of higher interest expense. That was a simple math. So total debt was about $2.4 billion. We had cash and handed for about $270 million and net debt of $2.2 million, which as you know, we've got two euro bonds for half a billion and two and fifty million. So, the only change on that really would be on the variable rate debt. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next questions from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Thanks for letting me do the follow-up. When do we see, or maybe you answered it by saying there would be a gradual decline back to normal margins in U.S., the benefit of freight coming through on the inventory that is a margin plus. Rick Galloway : Yes, so I appreciate the question. So, we've been seeing obviously this the spike that we saw earlier in the year, late last year, earlier this year. And so you would start seeing the relative decline over Q4 going into Q1 as it sort of normalizes with a lot of offsetting items. Right? So, there is the other inflationary increases that we're keeping a keen eye on along with product cost increases that are somewhat flowing through that inventory level as well. So, the other thing to keep in mind is that as the spot market was rapidly going up due to our size and scale, we were able to get a lot of contracted rates. And so some of the increase that we saw would have been mitigated against competition. Dominick Zarcone : Yes. So, another way of thinking about that Michael, is as the spot pricing escalated from what was $2,500 for a 40-foot container back in 2019 to as high as $20,000 in parts of 2021 and early 2022. Because so much of our volume came on contracted rates we were hurt less than our smaller competitors when the spot markets soared and we're going to benefit less as the spot market comes back in. That will all roll through our inventory and then ultimately into the cost of goods sold. Operator : And this does conclude the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now turn the call back over to Nick for any closing remarks. Dominick Zarcone : Well, obviously as always, we really thank you for your time and attention. We understand there is a lot of things going on today in the markets. We certainly look forward to providing another update in late February of 2023 when we report our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. And at that point in time, we'll establish obviously our full year 2023 guidance. So again, we appreciate your time and attention as always. And thanks for your interest in LKQ. Operator : This does conclude LKQ Corporation\u2019s third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the LKQ Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Joe Boutross : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rick Galloway, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning, as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-K in the coming days. And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter and full year 2022, and then Rick will dive into the financial details and discuss our 2023 outlook before I come back with a few closing remarks. This month, we are celebrating the 25th anniversary of our company's founding in February 1998. What started with a few salvage facilities in the U.S. has grown to a Fortune 300 business with operations in 28 countries and over 45,000 employees, providing a wide array of aftermarket and recycled parts used to repair, maintain and accessorize vehicles. Our operations are leaders in their respective markets and are well positioned to continue their success in the future. Getting to this point has been the result of the dedication of our past and present teams. And I want to express my sincere appreciation for all of these efforts. I am excited to see what this team can deliver in the future, as the LKQ team is never satisfied, never rests on its laurels and has always pushing to be the best. When LKQ was founded, ESG was not the hot topic that it is today. But ESG has always been a vital part of our strategy. Through our recycling operations, we are enabling the circular economy in doing our part to reduce waste. I am proud of our contributions to date and I can assure you that our emphasis on sustainability will continue to be an integral part of our mission. Our success in ESG is being recognized by external parties. On December 05, 2022, MSCI upgraded LKQ to their highest ESG rating of AAA, placing LKQ in the top 5% of all companies that they rate globally. And on January 31 of this year, LKQ was included in Sustainalytics' 2023 Top-Rated ESG Companies list. The fourth quarter of 2022 closed a year where the resilience of our businesses shine through a myriad of uncontrollable headwinds, ranging from economic softness, inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, energy cost spikes and a war in Europe. From an operating perspective, the fourth quarter was a very strong set of results, and I could not be more proud of our team. The continuation of exceptional organic revenue growth and strong margins in our North American wholesale segment, when combined with solid organic revenue growth and the highest fourth quarter EBITDA margins in the history of our European segment, offset the impact of the continued headwinds experienced in our Specialty and Self Service segments. The January revenue trends are similar to the levels generated in the fourth quarter. While the operations were collectively right on target with the guidance that we provided back in October, the annual tax provision was higher than anticipated, which drove a full year catch up in the fourth quarter and resulted in quarterly EPS at the low end of the guidance range. Rick will provide more detail on the tax provision in a few minutes. Now on to the strong quarterly results. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $3 billion, a decrease of 5.8% as compared to $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by FX translation and the divestiture of PGW. Parts and services organic revenue increased 4.5% on a reported basis and 5.9% on a per day basis. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures decreased revenue by 3.1% and foreign exchange rates decreased revenue by 6.1%, for a total parts and services revenue decrease of 4.8%. Other revenue fell 20.1%, primarily due to weaker commodity prices relative to the same period in 2021. Net income in the fourth quarter was $193 million as compared to $235 million for the same period in 2021. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.72 as compared to $0.81 for the same period last year, a decrease of 11%. During the quarter, we had an unfavorable $0.15 year-over-year impact related to the higher-than-anticipated tax rates. The tax rate was also higher than anticipated during our third quarter call, which generated an unfavorable $0.05 effect on adjusted diluted EPS relative to our guidance. On an adjusted basis, net income in the fourth quarter was $209 million as compared to $254 million for the same period of 2021, a decrease of 17.5%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $0.78 as compared to $0.87 for the same period of last year, a decrease of 10.3%. Net income for the full year of 2022 was $1.14 billion as compared to $1.09 billion for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share for the full year of 2022 was $4.11 as compared to $3.66 for the same period of 2021, an increase of 12.3%. Please note that 2022 results include the gain on sale of PGW. On an adjusted basis, net income for the full year of 2022 was $1.1 billion. That's compared to $1.2 billion for the same period of 2021, a decrease of 9.4%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year was $3.85 as compared to $3.96 for the same period of last year, a decrease of 2.8%. Adjusted earnings exclude the gain of the PGW sale but include the impact of the higher tax rate. Now let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 12, organic revenue for parts and services in the fourth quarter for our North American segment increased 10.3% on a reported basis and 12% on a per day basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. We continue to perform well in North America especially when you consider that according to CCC, collision liability related auto claims were down [0.9%] (ph) year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Looking back at our performance through the financial crisis, from 2008 to 2010, our North American business grew organically at an average of 7.5%, which drove the alternative part usage rate, or APU rate, above its historical annual growth rates. As we enter 2023 and face the reality of a global recession, our alternative parts offerings clearly become more attractive during these challenging economic periods. We are also encouraged by the trend in parts per repair, which reached an all-time high in 2022. Important to note is that our sweet spot has expanded and today stands at model years four to 15 years of age. All these items combined positions North America well for continued organic growth in 2023. The upward trend in our aftermarket sales volumes and the ongoing improvement in our fill rates continued in the fourth quarter with fill rates reaching their highest percentage levels in 2022, and today stands at close to the pre-pandemic level of 93%. Importantly, as the supply chain recovered and fill rates increased, the entire industry realized a 220-basis point improvement in the aftermarket percentage of APU, taking share back from the OEs as we progress throughout the year. The supply chain has stabilized and our inventory is generally where we want it to be. The main issue we are confronting today are continued delays at some of the railheads due to congestion. As many of you know, on December 7 of last year, State Farm announced that they are rolling out expanded non-OEM collision repair parts to use in most of the United States. We are excited the State Farm is embracing the aftermarket value proposition that the industry offers, which will ultimately benefit the end consumer. We continue to actually analyze this opportunity and we are well positioned to compete for our fair share of this opportunity and have built our inventory appropriately to do so. Our salvage inventory is also healthy and we saw some relief on our cost per vehicle during the quarter. The salvage business had solid organic growth, largely driven by price, but as we entered December, we witnessed an upward trend in our salvage volumes. Total loss rates increased a bit in the fourth quarter, which were largely seasonal. And as you can see, it had no impact on our organic growth. These slightly higher loss rates played a role in our ability to source the right level of inventory at auction at attractive prices. As we have stated before, fluctuations in loss rates are largely net neutral events for LKQ. Moving on to our European segment. Europe organic revenue growth of parts and services in the quarter increased 4.6% on a reported basis and 5.8% on a per day basis, which represents the best fourth quarter per day organic revenue growth since 2016. I'd also like to highlight that Europe's segment EBITDA margin was the highest fourth quarter level since entering the European market in 2011. On a full year basis, Europe's performance is another year of double-digit segment EBITDA margins, which is consistent with our 1 LKQ Europe initiative and strategy. Rick will cover more margin details in his prepared remarks. Throughout the quarter, our European team was laser-focused on the cost structure, including rationalizing headcount to create a more nimble and agile team and focusing our team on a narrow and actionable list of key projects. These projects represent the highest return opportunities that the team can execute in the near term, further cementing the long-term resiliency and market leadership of our European segment. On February 1, LKQ Europe announced that it expanded its European salvage network with the acquisition of Dutch-based Rhenoy Group. Founded in 1991, Rhenoy is a leading supplier of remanufactured engines and recycled OEM car parts. Rhenoy operates a salvage dismantling facility in the Netherlands and remanufacturing plants in both the Netherlands and Poland. As you know, the roots of our company lie in the dismantling of salvage vehicles to recycle OEM parts. As part of our European strategic plan, we intend to capitalize on that history and knowledge, coupled with our remanufacturing capabilities, to grow our salvage network across our European footprint. And with this tuck-in acquisition, we take one small incremental step towards that objective. I want to congratulate our STAHLGRUBER team on their 100th anniversary and commend them for building a resilient and market-leading business that continues to demonstrate an ability to adapt to the ever-changing independent aftermarket. A century since founding brothers Otto and Willy Gruber started the business. Today, the STAHLGRUBER business continues its history of embracing change, which positions them well to capture further opportunity as the car park shifts towards EVs and other forms of mobility. We can't wait to see the next -- what the next 100 years brings for STAHLGRUBER. Now let's move on to our Specialty segment. During the fourth quarter, Specialty reported a decrease in organic revenue of 10.6%. Throughout 2022, Specialty was up against tough 2021 comparisons in the midst of decreased demand for certain key RV parts and a slower-than-expected recovery in U.S. light vehicle sales. Looking at the Specialty segment on a multi-year basis, since 2019, Specialty has generated approximately a 4% compound annual growth rate for organic revenue, outperforming the industry growth of SEMA and RV-related products. A few Specialty operational highlights would include that Specialty continued to realize the full benefits of the SeaWide synergies, which exceeded our expectations in dollars and operational execution. And Specialty won O'Reilly's 2022 [Top] (ph) Supply Line award for the third year in a row. Now onto our Self Service segment. Organic revenue for parts and services for our Self Service segment increased 4.8% in the fourth quarter. Self Service was again challenged by commodity pricing as seen in the material decline of other revenue which impacted our expectations for the quarter. On the corporate development front, the fourth quarter was fairly quiet. While we did not complete any material transactions during the quarter, our corporate development team is actively assessing various opportunities that exist across our operating segments. As the global economies continue to soften, that may lead to multiple compression and we are well positioned to execute on synergistic acquisitions that fit our strategic objectives. Outside of Q4 corporate development efforts, I am pleased to announce that this past January, we entered into a memorandum of understanding with Korea Zinc Company Limited, a world-class general non-ferrous metal smelting company. Under the memorandum of understanding, we will work towards a potential large scale joint venture related to the recycling of lithium-ion EV batteries in the United States. This is again evidence that we will continue to strategically position the company to adapt to and seize the longer-term opportunities that exist in the ever-changing car park. Turning to ESG. During the fourth quarter, we continued to build out our ESG program by focusing on our people efforts and various social initiatives. Here are a few worth noting. Every colleague employed by LKQ ELIT Ukraine for at least six months received a one-time hardship payment to support pain for energy and the general increase in the cost of living owing to the Russian invasion. Our U.K. and German operations also implemented one-time hardship payments to support our employees in those markets given the state of the overall European economy. We initiated a voluntary daily pay benefit in the United States that allows our employees to access a portion of their earned pay on demand. The company implemented this benefit with the financial wellness of our people in mind. And we launched our first employee inclusion group, the LKQ Veterans Network, a program that embraces our proud community of employee veterans and veteran allies who support and encourage each other to share experiences, veteran recruitment, career development, outward engagement, professional growth and retention. In 2022, our North American salvage operations continued our leadership as the largest recycler of vehicles by processing over 753,000 vehicles, resulting in, among other things, the recycling of approximately 3.6 million gallons of fuel, 2.2 million gallons of waste oil, 2 million tires, 700,000 batteries and approximately 955,000 tons of scrap metal. The end result of these efforts resulted in nearly 13 million recycled and repurposed parts being sold into the collision and mechanical repair shop industry that otherwise would have ended up in landfills. Let's turn to the inflationary environment, again a key item of interest for most listeners on this call. As I discussed this time last year, we expected inflation to be a headwind throughout 2022 and that expectation became a harsh reality all year across each of our segments. Fortunately, we are beginning to see some moderation with inflation in the U.S., and recently we witnessed the rate of inflation drop for the last three months in a row across the Eurozone. Eurozone inflation stood at approximately 8.5% in January, down from October, where it was almost 11%. Despite this drop, many of our key operating markets continue to face high inflation rates with certain countries running in the high-single to low-double digits. In the U.S., the labor markets continue to be strained and unpredictable in the midst of higher interest rates and mounting fears of a recession. Daily we read about high profile layoffs, yet new claims for unemployment benefits remain at a historic low. As of late, wage inflation is beginning to slow and certain areas of our business are seeing reductions in turnover. But these reductions are not material and we are far from out of the woods, but it is validation that our retention and employee engagement programs are gaining traction. Our engagement efforts aren't simply an HR mandate. They are programs that stretch across all levels of the organization and are a key component of our culture. Our global engagement score of 74 is significantly above the average for companies of our size. Studies have shown that employees who are engaged are 14% more productive and that companies with engaged employees are 23% more profitable than those with disengaged employees. So, from a business perspective, positive employee engagement is critical, but importantly, it's the right thing to do for our most important asset, our people. Lastly, before I turn the discussion over to Rick, who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our outlook for 2023, I am pleased to announce that on February 21, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.275 per share of common stock payable on March 30, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 16, 2023. Rick Galloway : Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. Before I go into details of the fourth quarter, I'd like to reflect on what LKQ accomplished in the last year. We entered 2022 with a strong position based on the success of our operational excellence initiatives and solid balance sheet after reporting the highest profitability in the company's history in 2021. We expected there to be headwinds in 2022 from the areas Nick mentioned. As you can see on the bridge, on Slide 5, these headwinds did set us back, but the LKQ team drove operational improvements to produce roughly $0.40 of operating increases relative to 2021. We also sustained the positive momentum around cash flow generation, with free cash flow of just over $1 billion in 2022, and healthy conversion ratio of 60% of EBITDA. Our work on free cash flow in recent years supported some noteworthy accomplishments in the last year : LKQ achieved investment-grade ratings from all three major rating agencies; returned $284 million to shareholders through quarterly dividends and increased the quarterly amount by 10% in October; repurchased roughly 20 million shares of LKQ stock for just over $1 billion, which combined with the carryover benefit from 2021 purchases added $0.23 of EPS compared to 2021; and all while maintaining a net leverage ratio at less than 1.5 times EBITDA. In early January 2023, we replaced our prior credit facility, which included a $3.15 billion revolver, with a new unsecured facility, including a $500 million term loan and $2.0 billion revolver. Our confidence in the balance sheet and ability to generate robust cash flow factored into the decision to reduce the size of the facility. We were pleased to complete this new facility ahead of the prior facility becoming current and lock-in funding over the next five years at a competitive rate structure. Generating these successful outcomes despite challenging conditions is a credit to the entire LKQ team and I want to thank all of them for their contributions. Now turning to the fourth quarter results, starting with segment performance. Going to Slide 14, Wholesale North America continued its strong performance, posting a record fourth quarter segment EBITDA margin of 18.5%, a 330 basis point improvement over last year. We saw gross margin improvement of 150 basis points, driven by favorable mix and the sale of the lower margin PGW business as well as pricing and productivity initiatives. Overhead expenses were favorable by 180 basis points, primarily related to non-recurring expenses incurred in 2021. Strong organic revenue growth aided by the rebound and aftermarket parts volume offset inflationary cost increases and benefited operating leverage. As mentioned in prior quarters, we believe there will likely be some moderation in segment EBITDA margin in upcoming quarters as the benefits of the 2022 price increases fall away with the resultant EBITDA margin expected to be in the high 17%-s, low 18% range for 2023. Europe also delivered its highest-ever fourth quarter margin at 10.0%, up 110 basis points from the prior year period. As seen on Slide 15, gross margin improved by 10 basis points as we worked to offset inflation with pricing and procurement initiatives. Overhead expenses decreased by 70 basis points with an emphasis on cost structure and improved leverage due to the 5.8% per day organic revenue growth. Inflation related to personnel, freight and fuel costs remains a critical concern across the European markets. The team is actively addressing the pressures through productivity initiatives. Europe produced a segment EBITDA margin 10.2% for the full year, the second consecutive year of double-digit margins. I want to commend the Europe team for achieving this result despite the onset of the war on the Ukraine and significant macroeconomic headwinds. And we are optimistic about incremental margin expansion of 20 basis points to 30 basis points in 2023. Moving to Slide 16. Specialty's EBITDA margin of 6.2% declined 130 basis points compared to the prior year, coming from a decrease in overhead expense leverage, driven by an organic revenue decline of 9.1% per day as they anniversary a tough comp from the prior year when the business delivered a 6% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter on top of the 17% growth in Q4 2020. Inflationary pressures also pushed overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue higher, including personnel, freight and fuel expenses. The overhead expense increase were partially offset by lower incentive compensation and benefits from operating expense synergies, largely generated from the SeaWide acquisition. As you can see on Slide 17, Self Service profitability improved sequentially from the low point in Q3, but remained on the low end of our historical range of 5.2% for the fourth quarter and below our expectations. Metals prices continued to have a negative effect on results with unfavorable lag effect and reduced operating leverage caused by the lower metals revenue dollars. When we broke out Self Service as a separate segment in Q1 2022, we highlighted that this business would have cycles, mostly driven by commodity price volatility. We are working through a down cycle now and the team is focused on buying the right quantity of cars at the best price to drive margin dollars higher. With the uncontrollable commodity dynamic in this business, we will emphasize generating margin dollars and free cash flow rather than targeting a specific margin percentage. Now on to the consolidated results. We reported diluted earnings per share of $0.72 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.78, which was a $0.09 reduction relative to Q4 last year. As previously mentioned, our operational performance showed year-over-year improvement and was in line with our expectations. However, this solid operational performance was more than offset by unfavorable year-over-year effects of $0.04 from volatility in metals prices and $0.03 from the foreign currency exchange effects caused by the stronger dollar. Additionally, we had a negative effect of $0.03 from higher interest rates as benchmark rates were markedly higher in Q4 2022. As Nick mentioned, taxes were the most significant unfavorable variance for the quarter, reflecting a $0.15 year-over-year impact and a $0.05 negative variance relative to the guidance provided back in October. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter last year, we recognized almost $0.10 in tax provision benefits from discrete items and the reduction in our full year effective rate. We experienced the opposite effect in Q4 2022, as we recorded a negative provision effect of approximately $0.05 from increasing our full year effective rate and unfavorable discrete items. The effective rate increase primarily related to this shifts -- to shifts in the geographic distribution of income. We mitigated about $0.07 of the decline with our lower share count, resulting from our share repurchase program. During the fourth quarter, we incurred $11 million in restructuring expenses, the majority of which relate to a new program we kicked off late in the year. We initiated the 2022 global restructuring program and recognition of the ongoing macroeconomic concerns heading into 2023. All of the segments have submitted plans to improve operational efficiencies by streamlining functions, closing underperforming locations and halting non-essential projects. The total cost of the 2022 program are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $40 million to be incurred over the next few years. Projected cost savings of $20 million related to the program are included in our 2023 guidance, and we expect annual run rate benefits of approximately $30 million by 2025. Shifting to cash flows and the balance sheet. We produced $166 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $1.28 billion, the third consecutive year we have exceeded $1 billion. With the supply chain issues abating, we made good progress in rebuilding our inventory levels in Wholesale North America and Europe. As shown on Slide 35, we increased our inventory values in these segments. Though note that the dollar increase doesn't directly equate to a quantity change given the higher input costs. We are comfortable with our current inventory holdings and are pleased with improvements in aftermarket fill rates. We will continue to evaluate our inventory holdings and may increase our balances in 2023, but not to the extent seen in 2022. The supply chain finance program contributed to an increase in days payable outstanding in Europe in 2022. With the signing of the new credit facility, certain restrictions around the program were eliminated and we view further program expansion to be an opportunity in the next few years. For the year, the cash conversion is 60% conversion of the EBITDA to free cash flow, in line with our targeted range of 55% to 60% We finished at the high end of the range in our guidance, partially due to the lower-than-projected capital expenditures. For the year, capital expenditures were 1.7% of revenue, which is below our targeted 2.0% to 2.25% range. We have experienced delays in receiving capital assets, such as trucks, as a result of supply chain delays. As a result, some of our 2022 orders will be delivered in 2023 and reflected in capital expenditures in the 2023 financials. As of December 31, we had total debt of $2.7 billion with a total leverage ratio of 1.5 times EBITDA, which is comfortably inside our target range of below 2 times. Please note that going forward, I will reference total leverage statistics rather than net leverage as the new credit facility changed the metric to total leverage. Our effective borrowing rate rose to 4% for the quarter due to the market rate hikes in the U.S. and Europe. We have $1.8 billion in variable rate debt, so 100 basis point rise in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by $18 million. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares for $152 million and paid a quarterly dividend totaling $74 million. I will conclude our thoughts on projected 2023 results as shown on Slide 6 through 8. Our guidance is based on current market conditions and recent trends and assumes that scrap and precious metals prices hold near December prices and the Ukraine Russia conflict continues without further escalation or major additional impact on European economy and miles driven. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes recent European rates with balance of the year rates for the euro of $1.08 and the pound sterling at $1.22. We expect organic parts and service revenue growth of between 6% and 8%. Please note that we have one fewer selling day in 2023 and have included associated with the expansion of aftermarket parts volume resulting from State Farm writing claims on CAPA certified parts in three product lines : headlights, taillights and bumper covers. We are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.90 to $4.20, with a midpoint of $4.05. This is an increase of $0.20 or 5% at the midpoint relative to the 2022 actual figure. Looking at Slide 7 in the presentation, you can see how we get from the 2022 actual EPS to our 2023 guidance. Operating performance is expected to generate growth of $0.24 relative to the 2022 results, mostly related to Wholesale North America from volume growth and Europe due to margin improvement. We do expect a continuation of challenging conditions for Specialty from softening demand for RV-related products and Self Service related to commodity prices and input cost inflation. Share count benefits are projected to add $0.10 to the full year 2023 EPS over and above the share count benefit associated with the deployment of our PGW proceeds. Note that there are no share repurchases assumed for 2023 in this figure. This amount reflects the carryover benefit from 2022 purchases. So, we're expecting very solid improvement on the operations side in 2023, which will drive year-over-year growth despite some non-operational challenges. The exchange rate benefit is nominal and is offset by softening in metals prices. The PGW divestiture creates a $0.02 headwind, reflecting the net reduction caused by lost profits, partly offset by the share count benefit generated from the redeployment of proceeds into share repurchases. Interest is projected to be a significant cost increase with our weighted average borrowing rate on variable rate debt having already risen from close to 1% in 2022 to about 4% by year-end. We anticipate an additional $0.13 in interest expense in 2023 on a year-over-year basis due to higher average market rates. We have included an effective tax rate of 26.3% in the 2023 guidance, roughly in line with the final 2022 rate. We expect to deliver approximately $975 million of free cash flow for the year, achieving 55% EBITDA conversion to free cash flow despite a few key headwinds. As seen on Slide 8, we expect to produce incremental cash flows relative to 2022 from operations, including increased profitability and trade working capital improvements to counteract the following uses of cash. First, as mentioned previously, we underspent on capital expenditures in 2022, including equipment delays, and expect to see an increase of approximately $78 million relative to the prior year. Second, the higher interest rates will require increased cash payments for interest expense, which we are currently projected at roughly $50 million. Third and final, we anticipate increased tax payments of $60 million due to profitability increases and the timing of payments. Thanks for your time this morning. With that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Rick, for that financial overview. In closing, 2022 was another banner year for our company and again validated the strength of our strategy, our business model and, most importantly, our people. Let me restate our key strategic pillars, which continue to be central to our culture and objectives as we've entered the new year. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn gives us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And fourth, we will continue to invest in our future. With these pillars in place, coupled with our industry-leading teams, we are well positioned to both face the challenges the new year presents and to continue to deliver positive year-over-year operating results for our shareholders. As always, I want to thank the over 45,000 people who work at LKQ for all they do to advance our business each day and for driving our mission forward regardless of the challenges. Time and time again, our teams have shown that these challenges are opportunities for growth, both for themselves and for the overall organization. And with that operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Baird. Your line is open. Craig Kennison : Okay, thanks, and good morning. I wanted to ask about your recycling business in Europe after you've acquired Rhenoy. I mean, I know it's not large in the scheme of things, but perhaps you could just update us the recycling footprint you have today in Europe and whether the time is right to maybe make a bigger push, build something like your North American auto recycling business now in Europe? Nick Zarcone : Yes. Good morning, Craig, and thanks for the question. So, for many years, we've had an operation in Scandinavia, in Sweden. We call it Atracco. It's been operating quite well for quite some time. It's not a huge business. But it is a nicely profitable business. And we started in Scandinavia, and particularly Sweden, because that recycling market looks the most like the U.S. market, when you think about how the insurance companies participate in the industry and the utilization of recycled parts. And so that was our beachhead if you will. And it's proven to be a very nice investment. Obviously, Rhenoy is our maiden voyage on to the continent. And we anticipate that there will be incremental opportunities to expand the footprint. The recycling business in Europe, generally speaking, is different than in the U.S. It is largely driven by the commodities as opposed to parts sales. And as you know, as a distributor of parts, we're more focused on the parts side and the commodity side. And so, it's going to take some time for the European market to shift. There are some regulatory changes going on in Europe as it relates to the circular economy and utilization of green parts. We think this is going to be a good time to slowly kind of build up our presence. We've got a boatload of intellectual capital here in the U.S. We think it's going to be a good time to extend that to the other side of the Atlantic. But it's going to be a slow process, Craig. You should not expect any major shifts over the next year or two or three. But we think we're incredibly well positioned to expand our footprint on the recycling side in Europe. And it's all a matter of finding the right businesses to acquire, the right management teams, the right values, the right environmental practices, but we're optimistic that there'll be more tuck-ins like Rhenoy as time unfolds. Craig Kennison : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Stember from ROTH MKM. Your line is open. Scott Stember : Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions as well. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Scott. Scott Stember : Can you talk about State Farm? What you're seeing? Early experiences? How fast it's ramping up? And then, also are you hearing anything about State Farm potentially expanding past the two or three SKUs that they're currently using right now? Nick Zarcone : Yes. So, State Farm made their announcement just in December. It's not like going over to the wall and flipping the switch, right? You have a couple of decades of history of repair shops being kind of driven into [their head] (ph) that State Farm did not use aftermarket parts. And so, it's going to be a slow transition. Our volumes of those three-part types on State Farm claims is moving up. And so, we think that it's on track for -- to hit the overall opportunity for 2023. I think we quantified that in our last call as being under $100 million. We've had one month, right, January, under our belt. If you kind of extrapolate that out, we think that they're going to continue to push their new policy throughout the marketplace, but it can take a little bit of time to get up to kind of full speed. Scott Stember : Got it. And then, just a follow-up... Nick Zarcone : There is no indication at this point in time, but again, we're not -- but -- what, sort of 45 days after the announcement that they're going to extend the program to new product types. That's certainly our hope. We think that is the logical thing to do, but we thought that was the logical thing to do for the last 20 years. Scott Stember : Got it. Well, clearly in a better spot than we were 10 years ago. So... Nick Zarcone : Absolutely. Scott Stember : And just if I could just slip one last question in Europe. I don't know if you gave granularly detailed by market. But what are you seeing -- the countercyclical benefits of the aftermarket -- or the mechanical parts aftermarket starting to kick in? Maybe just give us a little color there. Nick Zarcone : Yes. So, as Rick and I both indicated, organic growth in Europe in the fourth quarter was a little bit over 5% on a per day basis, on a same day basis, which was terrific. Every single one of our markets was up nicely and either in and around that mid-single digit range with the exception of one business, which is, we call, components business on a year-over-year basis, that was still negative, because that's the business that used to sell into Russia. And if you recall, we shut every single element of that down the day that proven they rolled tanks over the border. And so, on a year-over-year basis, that volume has just gone. But all the geographic platforms showed really good organic growth in the fourth quarter. Scott Stember : Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is open. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. Rick Galloway : Good morning, Bret. Nick Zarcone : Good morning. Bret Jordan : You called out strength in alternative parts utilization in North America. Is that a tailwind from OE certification programs or what they're doing in collision on the OE side driving prices up to the point where it forces more alternative parts utilization, or what do you see as the tailwind of that mix? Nick Zarcone : Well, we believe that in the fourth quarter, the biggest part of that tailwind is that the aftermarket, including ourselves, by far the largest player, we actually had inventory to sell. As you recall, we had supply chain challenges coming out of 2021 into 2022 and our fulfillment rates, because of that, were down. I mean, historically, we've been in this the mid-90% range. And as we indicated in prior quarters, we're down into the low to mid-80%-s, right? The fact that we actually have the inventory need to be responsive to customer demand is the primary reason the whole aftermarket industry was able to grab over 2 percentage points of share back from the OEs. And we think that -- and we're very proud of that. Obviously, we're the largest player in the aftermarket parts space. We're charging hard to take share, not just from the OEs, but from our smaller competitors as well. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then, on the recycling of batteries in North America, the partnership you talked about, can you give us a little more detail sort of is that something that you use your existing infrastructure? And obviously, not a lot of batteries in the vehicle park yet, but where do you see that being a contributor? Nick Zarcone : Yes, this is not a play for 2023 or even 2025, perhaps this is a 10-to-15-year play, right? And what, ultimately, we believe is it's pretty well documented that there's not enough lithium being mined to produce all these batteries that are going to go on the EVs that folks are anticipating going to be on the road. And so, recycling the key elements out of existing EV batteries can become critical. We don't have the technology to do that. We recycle parts, but we don't know how to recycle chemical elements, right? But that's where Korea Zinc comes in. I mean, they are truly a world-class organization when it comes to reclaiming and recycling all sorts of various non-ferrous metals. And we believe that's a combination of their ability and process technology on the one hand was our ability to source cores and batteries on the other hand is a -- it could be a great partnership. Now, it's a memorandum of understanding, right? It's not a joint venture yet. The goals over the next couple of years to figure out and work together to develop a plan that could be profitable for both companies. But it's moving us into the next generation of mobility and we're very excited about it. And we think Korea Zinc will be a terrific partner for us. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brian Butler from Stifel. Your line is open. Brian Butler : Good morning, guys. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Brian. Brian Butler : Just on the first one on the guidance. When you think about the $975 million in cash flow, I mean, it sounds like that's kind of the minimum. And if you were to try to back up into an EBITDA number using the conversion of the 55% to 60%, that kind of puts you at $1.77 billion, kind of just under 13% margins. Is that kind of the right way to think of the low end of EBITDA? Rick Galloway : Yes. So, we -- the way we're looking at it -- thanks for the question. The way we're looking at it is 55% is the minimum of where we're sort of guiding on the conversion piece of it. So, as we're driving into this thing, the mix between what happened year-over-year in the earnings with the interest payments, the tax payments coming down and the capital expenditures, I would -- I think we've got a gap, call it, 50 plus or minus, we kind of gear right in that range. That's where I would kind of look on the free cash flow piece. And then, backing into that, we've guided 55% to 60%. We think that's a pretty reasonable approach, where we hit the 60% in the prior year 2022, bringing that down a little bit with the CapEx expenditures in 2023 is how we end up getting to that $975 million. Brian Butler : Okay. But just think -- I mean, again, just kind of backing it into trying to guess on the EBITDA, I mean, as that gets to the 60%, you would expect the EBITDA to also be higher as well. Is that a fair way to look at it? Rick Galloway : Yes, that's a fair way. Yes. Brian Butler : Okay. And then, on a follow-up question. When you think about the CapEx, the additional spend that kind of move from 2022 into 2023, I mean if you kind of even that out over the two years, you kind of were at $1 billion based on your guidance... Rick Galloway : That's exactly... Brian Butler : It will be about $1 billion guidance. So... Rick Galloway : Yes, that's exactly [indiscernible]. Brian Butler : Okay. Great. Can you give a little color just kind of on what drove that? And then, maybe kind of what's the right way to think about CapEx on a longer-term basis? Rick Galloway : Yes. So we look at 2% of revenue, 2% to 2.25% of revenue is usually the kind of guide that we've given. We have 1.75%, I think it was 1.77%, something like that in 2022 as things pushed out, primarily trucks, equipment pushed out with the supply chain issues. And then when you think year-over-year, we're right in that 2% range that we've been kind of guiding to. So, there may be ebbs and flows back and forth between different years, but that 2% to 2.25% is the right way to look at it. Brian Butler : Okay. Perfect. And then, just last one. Is there any risk on the inventory build at Specialty, if cars kind of that market, that demand remains soft, is that something we should be watching? Rick Galloway : No, I don't think so. So, we have a traditional build throughout the year, and we ended up decreasing that a little bit and then driving that down toward the end of the year to end up virtually flat year-over-year on overall inventories, and it's something that we're watching very closely with the demand. And so, nothing to be concerned about in that area. Brian Butler : Okay. Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Your line is open. Daniel Imbro : Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking our questions. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Daniel. Daniel Imbro : Nick, I want to start on the European side. I think at the end of your prepared remarks, you talked about Europe having some specific projects they're working on. Can you provide some more color just around what those are? Is that just the growth in the collision parts? Are there other costs projects that Varun and the team are working on? Any kind of quantification as we think about potential margin impacts from those initiatives? Nick Zarcone : The answer, Daniel, not to be snide, but the answer is yes, right? We've got a number of different projects over in Europe. Rick mentioned restructuring, the 2022 restructuring plan, that hits all of these segments, including the European segment. It's part -- folks should think about restructuring at LKQ as part of our continuous improvement plan that every year, we're looking to find ways to optimize our business and to get excess cost or better throughput and efficiency from each of our operations. And so, yes, there are some restructuring plans over in Europe, just like North America and Specialty. We're looking at programs to continue to drive organic revenue growth, particularly volume growth. And Varun and the team are focused on some key programs there. They pulled in headcount a little bit, particularly at the kind of at the head office level, not just in Zug, but across the operating platforms as well, just to make sure that our administrative costs are aligned with the realities of 2023 and the economic climate. So, it's a number of different initiatives, Daniel, none of which we're going to put a pinpoint as to what it means from a euro or dollar perspective, but it's all with the goal of continuing to drive organic revenue growth and better margins. And as I think Rick indicated in his prepared comments, we're anticipating that the margins in Europe will... Rick Galloway : 20 basis points to 30 basis points. Nick Zarcone : Will go up by 20 basis points to 30 basis points in 2023. And that's been included in the guidance that Rick set out. Daniel Imbro : Great. That's helpful color. And then, I wanted to just circle back on the potential battery remanufacturing JV. If you take a step back and just think about how State Farm handled the aftermarket after one accident 20 years ago, I mean, have you guys talked to the insurance companies? Do you think that they're actually going to reinsure remanufactured EV batteries? Or if there's one accident, does that become a category that insurance companies just won't touch because of the liability? Just trying to think through what the actual end market could be there. Can insurance companies actually do that? Nick Zarcone : Yes. So, Daniel, you need to separate the collision business from the mechanical repair business. And the EV batteries, what we're doing right now with Bumblebee and Green Bean, the two companies that we bought over the last year or so that remanufacture batteries, that has nothing to do with the collision business. That just has to do with the failure of the batteries and the life batteries to extend the life of the vehicle, okay? The memorandum of understanding on recycling with Korea Zinc, again, has nothing to do with remanufacturing. That is truly a recycling to get to the core elements that are inside that EV. And so, you need to keep -- there's a big difference between remanufacturing and recycling. Recycling, there's not a battery left to go back into another vehicle, right? Remanufacturing is where we truly look at the battery, we replace certain cells. That is not an insurance-driven profit. If you have a nine-year-old EV and your battery is failing, you're not going to get reimbursed a nickel from your insurance company to go replace that battery. That's going to be an out-of-pocket expense. Daniel Imbro : Got it. So, this is more on the -- it's on the mineral extraction or kind of recycling side, the potential... Nick Zarcone : Yes. Daniel Imbro : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Nick Zarcone : Yes. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Nick Zarcone, I turn the call back over to you for some final closing remarks. Nick Zarcone : Well, as always, we greatly appreciate everyone's time and attention on this call. We know it's a busy reporting period, and we appreciate you spending the hour with LKQ. Again, I couldn't be more proud of our team and the results that we posted up not only in the fourth quarter of 2022, but the full year as a whole. We're looking forward to being back on line with you in about, I don't know, 60 days or so, in late April, when we announce our first quarter results. So, thank you for your time, and we'll be talking to you soon. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Rob and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the LKQ Corporation's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Joe Boutross : Thank you operator. Good morning everyone and welcome to LKQ's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rick Galloway, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions, or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC this morning. As normal, we are planning to file our 10-Qs in the coming days. And with that I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter and then Rick will dive into the financial details before I come back with a few closing remarks. On February 28th, the company kicked off a year-long celebration of our 25th anniversary by ringing the opening bell at NASDAQ. The celebration is focused on our 25-year history, our customers, our employees, the communities that we serve, and further energizing our global team about our future. Following this initial celebration, we hosted leadership conferences in both North America and Europe for key leaders across each of our operating segments, where we all had a chance to celebrate educate and collaborate on our past successes and share the excitement of what the future holds for LKQ. While we've had a great run since 1998, I am highly confident that the next 25 years will be even better. As an organization we have always held a core set of values that has helped us achieve our success and created the LKQ we are today. Like all aspects of life, change is inevitable and as an organization it's critical that we advance our values forward to lay the foundation for the next 25 years. Keeping us moving forward, during the quarter, I had the pleasure to announce our updated values for the future. Values that unite our global enterprise as a cohesive and focused One LKQ and that will serve as a single guide to ensure we deliver on the promises we hold true for all constituents. The values are development, excellence, leadership, integrity and trust, value-added, embracing change, resourceful, and sustainability. Simply put, it spells DELIVERS. Expanding on the word DELIVERS the One LKQ team across the globe delivered a solid first quarter performance and an outstanding start to 2023. During the quarter, our two largest segments North America and Europe exceeded our expectations as our teams embraced our operational excellence initiatives. The first quarter of 2023 started the year where 2022 left off as the resilience of our business shine through a myriad of uncontrollable headwinds ranging from economic softness, inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, energy cost spikes, and a war in Europe. The continuation of exceptional organic revenue growth and strong margins in our North American and European segments more than offset the impact of the headwinds experienced by our specialty and self-service segments. The variance in performance across our operating segments this quarter validates our long-term diversification strategy both with respect to geography and product and speaks to the true strength of our organization and our portfolio of businesses. Now on to the first quarter 2023 results and year-over-year comparisons. Revenue was $3.3 billion in the first quarter for both 2023 and 2022. Parts and services organic revenue increased 7.9% on a reported basis and 7.1% on a per day basis. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures decreased revenue by 3.3% and foreign exchange rates decreased revenue by a further 3% for total parts and services revenue increase of 1.5%. Other revenue fell 19.2% in the first quarter of 2023 primarily due to weaker precious metal prices relative to the same period in 2022. Net income was $270 million in Q1 of this year as compared to $269 million last year as better operating results more than offset the negative impacts related to soft foreign currency exchange rates, higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. Adjusted net income was $279 million in Q1 of 2023 as compared to $287 million last year a decrease of 2.8%. Diluted earnings per share was $1.01 in Q1 of this year compared to $0.94 last year an increase of 7.4%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $1.04 this year as compared to $1 even last year an increase of 4%. The increases in earnings per share relative to the changes in net income illustrate the positive impact of our historical share repurchase activity. Let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from slide 7 organic revenue for parts and services in North America increased 14.4% on a reported basis, a record first quarter performance. North America also reported its highest quarterly segment EBITDA margin on record. Rick will cover the segment level margin details shortly. We continue to perform well in North America especially when you consider that according to CCC collision liability-related auto claims were down 4.4% year-over-year in the first quarter. Our growth was balanced between price and volume improvements the latter of which was particularly evident in the aftermarket product line which was the result of two factors : first, having largely worked through the industry supply chain issues and having proper levels of inventory enabled us to get back to our historical level of fulfillment rates. Second, the impact of the State Farm program is unfolding nicely and building demand for aftermarket headlights, taillights and bumper covers. This upward trend in our aftermarket sales volumes is consistent with a general rise in APU which approached pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter. I am pleased to say that the increase in APU also included an uptick in the recycled parts category increasing 150 basis points year-over-year. Combined aftermarket and recycled parts have witnessed nearly a 500 basis point improvement in APU since the first quarter of 2022. The value proposition of alternative parts is gaining share from OEs as insurance carriers face both catastrophic losses from all the storm activity in the quarter and premium pressures as policyholders are tightening up their spending in the midst of an ongoing soft economy. Total loss rates increased slightly in the first quarter to about 19%. But as you can see it appears that total losses had little to no impact on our organic growth. Based on industry research, we expect total loss rates to end the year in the range of 18% to 19% as the market absorbs the recent increase in used car prices as we've entered 2023. Now moving on to our European segment. Europe organic revenue for parts and services in the quarter increased 9.7% on a reported basis and 8.2% on a per day basis, which represents the best first quarter per day organic revenue growth since 2016 when we were a much smaller organization and operating in only six European countries as compared to over 20 today. I'd also like to highlight that Europe's segment EBITDA margin was the highest first quarter level since 2016. During the first quarter, we saw high single-digit to low double-digit reported organic growth in each of our key operating geographies. In particular our Benelux, German and Eastern European operations performed exceptionally well. The revenue growth reflected a combination of positive movements in both price and volume. We believe we are continuing to take share in these large and highly fragmented markets. The European team is laser focused on the cost structure including rationalizing headcount to create a more nimble and agile team and focusing on a narrow and actionable list of key projects. With that operational focus, the European team delivered the lowest first quarter SG&A level since 2017, notwithstanding, a challenging inflationary environment. Additionally, the European team began the integration of the Rhenoy salvage and remanufacturing acquisition that we announced during the last earnings call. In addition, we are ramping up our location count in France with the opening of a distribution center in Marseille earlier this month, bringing our total location count in France to seven. Now let's move on to our specialty segment. During the first quarter specialty reported a decrease in organic revenue of 13%, which was below our expectations. The RV portion of our specialty business was impacted by the wholesale shipment and retail unit sales of RVs, which are down 57.7% and down 23.7% year-to-date through February respectively. We expect to see further declines in the RV market as recent industry reports project that full year 2023 wholesale shipments will be down about 34% year-over-year. So we believe that the challenges for our specialty segment will continue throughout 2023. As we work through the balance of the year, our efforts will be focused on the RV repair and service as RV usage rates remain strong and the ongoing growth in light vehicle sales by building the right inventory to service this market space. Truck off-road and performance parts revenue are also down on a year-over-year basis but less than what we are seeing in the RV sector. Notably specialties marine business posted organic growth of 10.4% in the quarter and we are gaining share in this attractive market. Despite the industry-wide headwinds and the cyclical nature of this segment there is no one in the SEMA or RV distribution space that has such a talented team and has the experience and Lean Six Sigma capabilities to effectively manage through a down cycle. Now on to our self-service segment. Organic revenue for parts and services for our self-service segment increased 4.9% in the first quarter. Self-service was again challenged by soft commodity pricing particularly as it related to precious metals, which manifested itself in a significant drop in the value received for recycled catalytic converters. We believe that the challenges for self-service will persist for the balance of the year as well. While the rate of inflation is coming down across the globe, inflation continues to impact all of our businesses. Our teams are doing an effective job of getting price relief where possible and are using productivity improvements to offset the negative impact of the increased cost. Regarding labor, our open positions in North America dropped by 20% since year-end but the challenges with turnover have not abated. The labor market in North America is still overheated and we are pushing wages and selected benefits to combat the issue. In Europe, we are also countering the labor tightness with wage increases to retain our employees and we have maintained low turnover levels in the first quarter. On the corporate development front, as most of you know, on February 27th we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of Uni-Select's issued and outstanding shares for CAD 48 per share in cash representing a total enterprise value of approximately US$2.1 billion. Uni-Select is a leader in the distribution of automotive refinish and industrial coatings and related products in North America through its FinishMaster segment. In the automotive aftermarket parts business Uni-Select operates through its Canadian Automotive Group segment up in Canada and through its GSF Car Parts segment in the U.K. Today is Uni-Select's Special Shareholder Meeting and the final day that its shareholders may cast their votes on the transaction. So we don't yet have a final report. Considering that both ISS and Glass Lewis published reports supporting the transaction and that approximately 20% of Uni-Select shareholders entered into voting agreements to approve the transaction as part of signing of the acquisition agreement back in February. We are highly confident that Uni-Select shareholders will approve the transaction. We have submitted applications for approvals to the various regulatory authorities in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. And at this time all the regulatory reviews are proceeding according to plan. Both the FTC in the United States and the Competitive Bureau in Canada have until May 11, 2023 to determine whether to issue a second request for information. To address any regulatory concerns in the U.K., we have commenced a process to sell Uni-Select GSF Car Parts business. Our adviser has started the buyer outreach process. And while we can't say much at this time, we are pleased with the initial interest level in the asset. Ultimately, we hope to receive the required approvals and to complete the Uni-Select acquisition in the second half of this year. Now let's turn to ESG. During the first quarter we focused our people efforts on various social initiatives and in particular education for both our employees and importantly their families as they face the increasing cost of education. Recently we enhanced two existing educational programs available to LKQ employees. The Joseph Holsten Scholarship Fund established over a decade ago provides grants to the children of our employees to assist with post high school educational expenses. Prior to 2022 the fund was only available to our North American team, but we expanded the program to include our entire global organization. Our goal is to distribute at least $1 million of scholarships in 2023. Additionally, in Q1 of this year we increased our North American employee tuition reimbursement program by 100%. Our people are the biggest asset at LKQ and programs like the two I just mentioned are critical to enhancing employee engagement which in turn supports the continued success of our business. Importantly, we are honored and proud to be part of the educational development and personal growth of our employees and their families. We look forward to issuing our 2023 CSR before the end of the second quarter, a report that will expand our sustainability disclosures across many aspects of our global enterprise. Lastly, before I turn the discussion over to Rick, who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our outlook for 2023 I am pleased to announce that on April 25th, 2023 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.275 per share of common stock payable on June 1st 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 18th. Rick Galloway : Thank you, Nick and good morning to everyone joining us today. We're very pleased with the start to the year as our first quarter results highlight strong revenue growth and profitability. Our two largest segments North America and Europe generated above-expectation revenue growth and margins as our operational excellence initiatives continued to yield benefits. The Specialty and Self-service segments underperformed in the quarter as market conditions continue to produce headwinds for both businesses. Overall, we are pleased with the good start to the year and are on track to deliver on our full year guidance. As discussed on our February call in Q1, we replaced our prior credit facility which included a $3.15 billion revolver with a new unsecured facility, including a $500 million term loan and $2.0 billion revolver. We feel good about the new facility and our ability to fund our operating needs over the next five years at a competitive rate structure. Free cash flow generation remains solid noting that the quarterly phasing will be weighted more to the balance of the year than we've seen in the past couple of years when phasing was impacted by the pandemic and supply chain disruptions. The pending Uni-Select acquisition was a source of significant activity during the quarter with due diligence, deal negotiations and post-announcement financing activities. Nick provided an update on the transaction status, and I'll highlight the Uni-Select impacts on our first quarter financials. Turning now to first quarter results starting with segment performance. Going to slide 9. North America continued its strong performance posting a record first quarter segment EBITDA margin of 20.5%, a 240 basis point improvement over last year. We saw gross margin improvement of 190 basis points driven by lower freight costs, a favorable mix effect, with the sale of the lower-margin PGW business in 2022 and benefits from pricing and productivity initiatives. Overhead expenses were flat with lower freight vehicle and fuel expenses mostly offset by higher charitable contributions. The segment also reported a 50 basis point improvement in other income, mostly related to a non-recurring settlement of an eminent domain matter. While we believe there will be some moderation in segment EBITDA margin in upcoming quarters as the benefits of the 2022 price increases fall away the strong start to 2023 has improved our margin outlook to be in the 18s for the year. Europe also delivered a strong result with a segment EBITDA margin of 9.7% up 90 basis points from the prior year. As seen on slide 10, gross margin was flat while overhead expenses decreased by 90 basis points with the effects of improved leverage due to the 8.2% per day organic revenue growth and an emphasis on productivity initiatives on personnel costs. We remain optimistic about our previously disclosed expectation for full year margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points in 2023. Moving to slide 11. Specialty's EBITDA margin of 7.9 declined 470 basis points compared to the prior year. Gross margin was down 320 basis points year-over-year is under pressure from increased price competition as inventory availability continues to improve for our competitors discounting to increased sales volumes, and unfavorable product mix as low margin lines such as auto and marine have been less affected by revenue reductions. Overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue were up 150 basis points, primarily coming from the decrease in leverage driven by an organic revenue decline of 13.5% per day with impacts on personnel facility and distribution costs. The macroeconomic headwinds and the resulting effects on RV demand are expected to be an ongoing challenge for specialty, and we're forecasting a full year decrease in both segment EBITDA dollars and margin percentage. As you can see on slide 12, Self-Service profitability improved sequentially to 13.2% this quarter from 5.2% in the fourth quarter, but decreased by 680 basis points compared to Q1 2022. Metals prices had a net negative effect on results with lower precious metals prices more than offsetting lag benefits from sequential steel scrap price increases. Metal revenue decreased by 22.8% in total contributing to a reduction in operating leverage of 450 basis points. While car costs typically move in tandem with changes in commodity prices we have experienced a stickiness in car cost as precious metal prices have declined which created a gross margin headwind in Q1 that could persist in future quarters. On to the consolidated results, we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.01 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.04 the latter of which is $0.04 increase relative to Q4 last year. Our operational performance showed strong year-over-year improvement and was slightly ahead of our expectations as strength in North America and Europe offset underperformance in Specialty and Self-service reflecting challenging market conditions. The operating improvements resulted in an increase of $0.13 per share on an adjusted basis. We benefited by $0.05 due to the lower share count resulting from our share repurchases in 2022. These factors more than offset unfavorable year-over-year effects of $0.04 from the impacts of metals prices as shown on Slide 19 $0.04 in higher interest expense resulting from rate increases excluding the Uni-Select costs $0.02 from foreign currency effects caused by the stronger dollar $0.02 resulting from the divestiture of PGW in Q2 2022 and $0.02 due to a higher effective tax rate. On the tax rate, we applied an annual effective rate estimate of 26.6%, which is 30 basis points higher than the 26.3% rate in our prior guidance. The rate change is attributable to nondeductible Uni-Select transaction costs and a shift in the geographic distribution of income. As shown on Slide 17, the Uni-Select transaction affected various parts of the first quarter financials. We entered into a bridge loan facility to ensure committed financing was available for the Uni-Select transaction and incurred upfront fees of $9 million. Interest expense for the first quarter includes $3 million of amortization of these fees. The remainder will be amortized over the expected term of the facility likely before year-end. Note that we excluded the amortization from adjusted diluted EPS. To hedge the risk related to movements in the Canadian dollar exchange rate between signing, and closing we entered into FX forward contracts to purchase Canadian dollars at a specified rate. These contracts had a fair value of $23 million as of March 31. And as we are not eligible for hedge accounting on these contracts the mark-to-market gain is reflected on the income statement as a separate line item. Note that this gain is also excluded from adjusted diluted EPS. We incurred M&A advisory costs of $10 million in the quarter which are presented in restructuring and transaction related costs -- related expenses. Consistent with our historical practice these costs are excluded from adjusted diluted EPS. We also hedged the risk of movement in interest rates prior to the issuance of permanent financing in the bond market. These interest rate swaps had a negative fair value -- fair market value of $22 million and these swaps did qualify for hedge accounting. The mark-to-market adjustment was recorded to the balance sheet and there was no income statement activity in the quarter. We secured a delayed draw three-year term loan for CAD 700 million that will fund on the day prior to closing. Shifting to cash flow and the balance sheet. We produced $153 million of free cash flow during the quarter which is in line with our expectations and we remain on track for our full year estimate of approximately $975 million. As mentioned, we expect 2023 cash phasing to be different than in the past few years with higher weighting towards Q2 to Q4. By comparison in Q1 2022 free cash flow was $350 million, which we indicated was high as a result of timing. Recent years were particularly volatile in terms of cash flow timing as inventory levels came in 2020 in response to the pandemic-driven market conditions and then were built back up toward normal operating levels in 2021 and '22 where we elected to pay suppliers early to secure delivery of inventories during the supply chain disruptions. We're optimistic supply chain commissions will continue to stabilize in 2023 which should help to smooth some of the cash flow timing volatility going forward. Further impacting the year-over-year comparison we began to see the projected increase in interest rates which were $18 million higher in Q1 2022 and capital expenditures up $11 million over the prior year. Income tax payments increased $6 million in the first quarter and we anticipate a larger uptick beginning Q2 when we have two quarterly estimated U.S. federal payments. As of March 31 we had total debt of $2.7 billion with a total leverage ratio of 1.6 times EBITDA, which is comfortably inside our target range of below two times. Our effective borrowing rate rose to 4.7% for the quarter due to the market rate hikes in the U.S. and Europe. We have $1.8 billion in variable rate debt of which $700 million has been fixed with interest rate swaps of 4.6% and 4.2% over the next two to three years respectively. In the first quarter we repurchased roughly 100,000 shares for $5 million and paid a quarterly dividend totaling $74 million. As discussed in the Uni-Select call, we will emphasize debt repayments over share repurchases to reduce total leverage ratio prior to the closing date. I will conclude with our current thoughts on projected 2023 results. Our guidance is based on current market conditions and recent trends and assumes that scrap and precious metals prices hold near March prices and the Ukraine-Russia conflict continues without further escalation or major additional impact on the European economy and miles driven. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes recent European rates with balance of the year rates for the euro of $1.08 and the pound sterling at $1.23. We will not include any results for the Uni-Select business until the closing date. Our full year guidance metrics on slide 4 remain unchanged from the Q4 earnings call. We still expect reported organic parts and service revenue in the range of 6% to 8%, organic growth of 7.9% in Q1 includes an extra selling day in Europe, which we will give up in the balance of the year in addition to one fewer selling day in North America and Specialty in Q3. The first quarter per day figure of 7.1% is near the midpoint of the range. We still expect adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.90 to $4.20. As I mentioned, North America and Europe are performing ahead of expectations offsetting the softness in Specialty and self-service including precious metal prices and the higher effective tax rate. The free cash flow expectation of approximately $975 million and 55% annual EBITDA conversion remain in place noting that a portion of the Uni-Select transaction fees will have a onetime impact to free cash flow and create a headwind. We will provide a full update on all guidance metrics once the Uni-Select transaction closes. Thanks for your time this morning. With that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments. Nick Zarcone : Thanks, Rick for that financial overview. In closing, the first quarter was a great start to 2023 that again validated the strength of our strategy, our business model and most importantly our people. As we continue to progress through 2023, let me restate our key strategic pillars, which continue to be central to our culture and our objectives. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. We will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. And we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn gives us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And fourth, we will continue to invest in our future. As always, I want to thank the over 45,000 people who work at LKQ for all they do to advance our business each day and for driving our mission and our delivers values forward regardless of the challenges. And with that operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Your line is open. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Hey, Good morning, guys. Thanks taking my questions. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Daniel. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Nick, I want to turn to the North American organic growth side. Obviously really strong on a headline basis. I'm curious were there any noticeable industry changes that drove that whether it was a step-up in alternative part usage from State Farm faster than expected? Was there pent-up demand that got filled by the improved auction availability you talked about in the slides. Just trying to reconcile the big step-up on both a two year and a three year tax basis for the organic growth in the quarter? Nick Zarcone : Great question. Obviously, the demand in North America is ultimately driven by the need for parts to repair collision-damaged vehicles. We do that with both aftermarket parts and recycled parts. As disclosed, we are benefiting a bit from the price actions that we took last year. And so average selling prices are up a little bit, 2023 over 2022, but volumes are up as well. And that as I indicated in my prepared remarks it's really driven by a couple of items. One is we finally have our inventories where we need them to be. And so fulfillment rates are back in north of 90% on the aftermarket product which is terrific. And the State Farm program is starting to kick in. We talked about in the Q4 \u2013 Q4 call that we thought that would be somewhere in the $80 million to $100 million benefit for 2023 for LKQ. We're right on track to hit that. That's what we built into our expectations for the year. And State Farm, we knew was not going to be like turning the lights switch on. It was going to take time for that to build and it's building. I mean the reality is APU for the industry in the first quarter was about where it was back in 2018 and 2019. which is terrific. It obviously dipped quite a bit during the height of the pandemic and the shortage of aftermarket supply but we're back to good levels of APU, which is terrific. We believe we're continuing to take share. And there are longer term there are other metrics that bode in our favor. The cars are being built in a more complex manner. The average number of parts needed to repair a vehicle has increased by about 2.5 parts over the last five years. The average cost of those parts has gone up. And again we think APUs are going to continue to drive north particularly with the benefit of State Farm. And nobody is better positioned to capitalize on those trends than LKQ, because we're the largest distributor of aftermarket collision parts in North America. We are the largest distributor of recycled parts aftermarket -- or recycled collision parts in North America, the volumes on the mechanical side of salvage were off a little bit. And actually the volumes on the collision side salvage were off a little bit in the first quarter, but that just has to do with the fact that we were -- during the height of the pandemic and the constraints within our aftermarket inventory, we were the only player in the market where we were able to shift a little bit of that -- those requests over to salvage parts. And we talked about that in our past calls. And in this quarter, you got a little bit of that swinging back the other way. But we feel very good about how we're positioned in our North American operation. We believe that the future is bright. The growth is good. And we're going to go continue to take as much share as we can get. Daniel Imbro : I appreciate all that color Nick. And maybe I'll stay on North America with the little margin. Just clarifier, I think the North American margin over 20% was good to see. You got a 80 bps of a tailwind from freight in the quarter. I would assume you guys have locked in some of those. So would that kind of tailwind continue? And then similarly to follow-up on what you just talked about with growth staying so strong. Would maybe your expectations for North American margins to be higher this year than we talked about a few months ago just given growth is coming in faster than expected? Rick Galloway : Yeah. I appreciate the question Daniel. So good question. You're spot on. So during part of the prepared remarks, I talked about our expectations for the year will be elevated for our North American operations with the 20.5% EBITDA that they delivered just fantastic results from the team. Some of that will come back through pricing as we talked about, but we're comfortable saying we'll be within the 18s now. And we were guiding a little bit lower than that if you recall a couple of months ago as we were going to finish out the year, we don't think we'll finish out the year near as low as that. And it's really -- as you start thinking about that freight that freight -- when we looked at that year-over-year there was a pretty significant increase in freight in Q1 and that went away starting in Q2 last year. And so year-over-year there's a pretty nice benefit. That benefit almost goes away when we look at Q2 as we had already locked in some rates and there wasn't this excess freight is what we call it here there was excess freight on the ocean deliveries that really mitigated when we got into Q2. So still good results. I expect those to continue, but we will see a little bit of a tightening but not near as much Daniel. Daniel Imbro : Great. Well, congrats to Justin and everyone on the team and a good luck going forward. Rick Galloway : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is open. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning guys. Nick Zarcone : Good morning Bret. Bret Jordan : Switch over to Europe now. Could you talk about the 8.2% growth per day, breaking it out on price and units? And then as a follow-up to that you called out Benelux, Germany and Eastern Europe as very strong. Could you give us some performance spread to the UK and Italian business? And maybe talk about the cadence that you saw in the quarter as it progressed? Nick Zarcone : Sure. We are thrilled with the performance of our European business again on a per day basis over 8%, 9% on a reported basis. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, every geography was either in high single-digits or low double-digits. And we haven't seen a scenario like that for quite some time. Again we called out a couple of the higher performers being Benelux, Germany, and Central and Eastern Europe. But that doesn't mean that the rest of the team underperformed. Indeed they were in that high single-digit area. And it was a mix of price and volume. Again when inflation hit hard we did the best we could to get ahead of the curve because if you don't, inflation will eat your life from the inside out. I'm so proud of the efforts by our teams over the last couple of years to make sure that we were able to get ahead of that. But there was some good volumes comparisons. And look the first quarter of 2022 was a good quarter, but wasn't off the charts and so we had a pretty good comparison to go after. And we're optimistic that Europe will continue to produce good solid results. Again we're not anticipating 9% growth for the entire year for the European team. So, it may come in a little bit as we move through the next few quarters as the organization really picked up some momentum towards the back half of last year. The cadence through the quarter I mean there was we don't give monthly results, but it was solid and the second quarter is off to a decent start albeit we're 20 some days into the quarter and we still got a long way to go. What we're particularly pleased with our European business Bret is the margins. Margins are up 90 basis points from where they were in Q1 of last year. And the revenue growth is great. We want to bring that down to the bottom-line because [Indiscernible] revenue doesn't do anything for an organization. And the reality is we've got the best margins in the European theater. When you look at it on an apples-to-apples US GAAP to US GAAP basis nobody has our level of EBITDA margins and we're very proud of that. Bret Jordan : Great. Yes it's looking good. And then one last question on the specialty business. Obviously sort of similar cadence question but starting to see some maybe softening in the U.S. consumer. Could you talk about the trajectory of that business through the quarter? Nick Zarcone : Yes, I mean it started off the year soft and ended the first quarter soft and that's why we've been very upfront with the same. We're not expecting any great turnarounds for the back of the year and it's going to come in below our original expectations and what was in our original guidance that we set back in the February call. We don't see any particular catalyst. And again all part types are not equal. As we mentioned the softer product lines include RV what's no pun intended, but what's attached to the RV volumes is towing product think about hitches and the like because every time somebody goes to get a brand new RV if it's a towable they need a hitch on their truck or their car, right? And so when new unit sales go down demand for towing product goes down. And so those are two product categories that are softest. The traditional SEMA product and the performance products again are down a little bit year-over-year. We think that's just the fact that they were so high in 2021 and 2022, but not down nearly as much as our RV product set. And then as Rick indicated, Marine is actually up a bit which is terrific. Important is that the specialty team is not taking it all sitting down. They've got a lot of programs particularly focused on productivity. They're adjusting the footprint their footprint of what they do. They -- we've already consolidated our fab tech California operation into our Fab 4 South Carolina operation. So, we're going to save some money there. We have dramatically reduced inventory in that business, to really align the working capital along with the current and anticipated revenue trends. We sold a very small underperforming business, to the former owner. But at the same time, this market in Specialty is going to provide us some opportunity to probably make a couple of small tuck-in acquisitions, that will go a long way to helping create and broaden our competitive moat in certain geographic or product markets. And we're going to take advantage of that. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Butler from Stifel. Your line is open. Brian Butler : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Brian. Brian Butler : Just kind of going back to North America, and maybe Europe too, just kind of on the larger trends of driving activity. Maybe some color there. Just how that's playing through on the results on the volumes, as well as was there any benefit kind of from the winter weather, or was that even a maybe a headwind meaning it was so mild? Nick Zarcone : No. I mean miles driven is kind of just basically, moderating along. There's no material growth -- no material declines. As we've said in the past, we have better statistics on that in the US than we do in Europe. But overall mobility, has not changed dramatically on a year-over-year basis, in the first quarter. And the reality is that's fine. We really got pinched obviously, back in 2020 when the pandemic hit, is when the literally mobility around the globe came to a grinding halt. And as long as vehicles are on the road and people are using their vehicles to get to and from work, fuel prices have come down generally on a global basis. They're not all the way down to where they were pre pandemic, particularly in Europe. But they've moderated a bit, and we think that's always good. Lower fuel prices tend to lead to perhaps, a little bit more miles driven and that creates demand for our parts. Again, we're assuming that the rest of the year that we're going to be kind of a flattish environment from an overall mobility perspective. Brian Butler : Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up, can you provide maybe a little bit more color just in Europe, on the payables and inventory and kind of what trends you're seeing there and how that matches with the expectations? Rick Galloway : Yes, I'll take that one. Thanks for the question. So, we're real pleased with the activity that we've had over in Europe in particular, with the vendor financing program, but also in the overall payables, right? We started making sure we transition away from just talking about vendor finance and talk about overall payables. And what we were able to see year-over-year is, that really a 10% improvement in our European operations on the days payable, as we extend that. And there's still room to go. We would expect similar-type improvement this year, and probably for the next couple of years. You got to think of it as not a race. We're not in a 100-meter dash here. We're in a marathon. It's going to be continuous improvement over and over again, every year as we deal with our vendors and really train them in the extension of the terms. And so, the team has done a great job. We got to see it. We got to see it in the free cash flow. We will see it again this year and continually improve even from Q4 to Q1 another improvement from what we've seen on there, as well. And it's both pieces, right? So, it's exactly where we're wanting to be and we expect that to continue for the next couple of years. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Scott Stember from ROTH MKM Partners. Your line is open. Scott Stember : Good morning, guys. Congrats on the very strong results Nick Zarcone : Thanks, Scott. Scott Stember : Going over to State Farm obviously things are cranking up nicely as expected, and it's just on two or three SKUs. Are there any signs that that SKU count will increase, whether it's radiators or fenders or door panels? Nick Zarcone : Yes. So, we knew that the decision by State Farm to begin to turn on aftermarket products like I indicated was not going to be flipping a switch over on the wall to turn on the lights, right? It was going to be evolutionary, not revolutionary. And the volumes are ramping up to our expectations. There have been no discussions about adding additional parts. State Farm has not done anything put out any statements made any comments publicly about expanding the program. To be sure, every time we talk with our folks at State Farm, we are continuing to encourage them to both accelerate the rollout of the existing parts and to add new parts to the program. But the direct answer to your question is there has been no, material movement coming out of Bloomington Illinois with respect to broadening the part types. Scott Stember : Got it. And then last question just going back over to specialty. You talked about the RV repair side. I know that you guys are pretty well entrenched with the OEMs to handle their warranty business. Are you seeing increased demand for just wear and tariff types of items? And how would you expect that to offset the general softness in the segment? Nick Zarcone : Yeah. You're correct. We do -- most of the distribution of warranty parts for not every OE but most of the OEs which is terrific. As you can appreciate the first quarter of the year is not a high utilization point with respect to RVs, because not a lot of people are using their campers north of the Mason-Dixon, line in January and February. It's a little chilly outside. We do expect that that activity will begin to ramp, as to whether gets warmer and people really get out to the camp grounds to utilize their units. And we think we're incredibly well positioned. We're making sure that we've got the right inventory to service those types of requests for warranty parts. And we're going to be standing ready to support all of our OE customers in that regard. Scott Stember : Got it. And then, just one last question back over to North America. You were talking about loss rates and as these higher-priced used units I guess work their way through the auction process. Can you talk about where you expect loss rates to be? Are we hitting a bottom here? Are we hitting a point where we could see an inflection in actual repairable claims going up? Nick Zarcone : Yeah. In our discussions with the industry groups and the folks who have all the data on the collision industry and total loss rates and the like, their expectation and our expectation is total loss rates for 2023 will settle out somewhere in the 18% to 19% range. They were 19% in Q1 as car prices -- used car prices moderate a little bit that's going to fluctuate around. But their expectation our expectation is somewhere in the 18s for 2023. And we'll pilot that. And again, the 19% in Q1 was up a little bit from last year and it had no impact on our growth. As we've said over and over we've lived through almost every cycle as it relates to total loss rates. And we just no pun intended we drive right through that. Scott Stember : All right guys. Thanks a lot. That's all I have. Nick Zarcone : Thanks Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Baird. Your line is open. Craig Kennison : Thanks for taking my questions. Rick I wanted to follow up on your fulfillment commentary. I think you said fulfillment rates were back above 90%. Can you give us a feel for that rate in Q1 of last year? And do you expect each quarter in 2023 to benefit from a similar lift in fulfillment, or does the benefit fade as the year unfolds? Rick Galloway : Yeah, Craig, I appreciate the question. As we look at the fulfillment rates last year we were in the upper-80s. We finished the year in the upper 80s. We started off really around 84, for the first quarter last year. And then as we progress through the year it gradually kept getting better and better and better. We're still up versus Q4's number as well. So we finished in the low-90s, but a slight improvement. And our expectation is that that will continue to etch up just a little bit throughout the year. So we're really pleased with the inventory availability. If you think about last year particularly in Q1 inventory was not very available for us. And we think we missed out on some share with OEs and the drop in APU. And then that's come back in Q1. And so the team is doing well and the inventory position we're very happy with in our North American operations. Craig Kennison : And then, could you comment on European fulfillment rates? Are there similar trends there given that in some cases you share, same dynamic? Rick Galloway : Yeah. It's in the 90s. I mean, that one didn't drop like we saw over here in North America. So still in the 90s and really pleased with our delivery performance out there. Craig Kennison : Perfect. Thank you. Rick Galloway : Yeah. Thanks Craig. Craig Kennison : And this concludes our question-and-answer period. Mr. Nick Zarcone, I turn the call back over to you for some final closing remarks. Nick Zarcone : Well as always we greatly appreciate your time and attention in spending the hour with LKQ. We're very proud of the first quarter. We're optimistic about the future, not just here in 2023 but for the next 25 years, as we continue to celebrate the first 25. And we look forward to chatting with everyone in about 90 days to announce second quarter results. So, thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And with that, I\u2019m happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe and good morning to everybody on the call. I hope you are all having a safe and enjoyable summer. This morning, I will provide some high level comments related to our performance in the quarter and then Rick will dive into the financial details and provide an overview of our updated guidance before I come back with a few closing remarks. The second quarter of 2023 was a continuation of what we delivered in the first quarter, where again the resilience of our businesses shined through with an exceptional organic revenue growth and strong margins in our North American and European segments, which more than offset the impact of the headwinds experienced by our Specialty and Self-Service segments. The non-discretionary nature of the parts these core segments distribute, coupled with our ongoing operational excellence initiatives, highlights the strength of our business model and our ability to generate robust profitability during periods of challenging macroeconomic conditions, including flat declining economic growth in several of our markets, decreases in commodity pricing, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and its impact on the broader European markets, and the continued increases in interest rates and its subsequent impact on consumers. The strength of our North American and European segments is evidenced by the fact that in the second quarter of 2023, North America and Europe collectively represented roughly 90% of our total segment EBITDA versus 79% for the second quarter of 2022 and just 74% in 2021. The variance in performance across our operating segments this quarter again validates our long-term diversification strategy, both with respect to geography and product and speaks to the true strength of our organization and our portfolio of businesses. Now on to the second quarter 2023 results and year-over-year comparisons. Revenue for the second quarter was $3.4 billion, an increase of 3.2%. Parts and services organic revenue increased 4.8% on a reported basis and 5.4% on a per day basis. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was flat year-over-year and foreign exchange rates increased revenue by 0.6% for total parts and services revenue increases of 5.4%. Other revenue fell 23.9% in the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to weaker precious metal prices relative to the same period in the prior year. Net income for the second quarter of 2023 was $281 million as compared to $420 million last year. Diluted earnings per share, was $1.05 in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $1.49, a decrease of 29.5%. The company completed the divestiture of PGW Auto Glass in the second quarter of last year, which generated a pre-tax gain of $155 million and an after-tax gain of $127 million or $0.45 a share in the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted net income of $291 million in Q2 of 2023 compared to $307 million last year, a decrease of 5.1%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2023 was flat with last year at $1.09, coming in flat to the prior year is a testament to the strength of our operating performance as we faced headwinds from significantly lower commodity prices and higher interest expense. Rick will provide further financial details in his prepared remarks. Now, let\u2019s turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 8, organic parts and services revenue for North America increased 8.3%. North America also reported the highest quarterly EBITDA margin on record as a standalone segment, excluding self-service. We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that collision and liability-related auto claims were down 3.1% year-over-year in the second quarter. Similar to Q1, the growth in North America was a combination of price and volume improvements. The pricing impact primarily reflected the year-over-year benefit of increases implemented late in Q2 and Q3 of last year as opposed to further increases in 2023. The volume pickup was particularly evident in the aftermarket product line and was the result of two factors. First, having largely worked through the industry supply chain issues and returning to proper levels of inventory enabled us to get back to our historical level of fulfillment rates with year-to-date aftermarket fill rates at their highest level since June of 2020. Second, the impact of the State Farm program continues to unfold nicely and is building demand for aftermarket headlights, taillights and bumper covers. As previously disclosed, in December of last year, State Farm announced that it would allow the use of these aftermarket part types. Late last month, State Farm announced that they are running yet another pilot. This time in California and Arizona for the use of a full range of aftermarket collision parts, including sheet metal products like fenders, hoods and trunk lids and other items like side mirrors and grills. As part of this pilot, State Farm requires at these parts to be certified by CAPA, a Certified Automotive Parts Association. As many of you know, we are by far the largest distributor of CAPA-certified collision parts in the United States. Importantly, we believe the potential expansion by State Farm into the utilization of these additional aftermarket part types validates both the high-quality standards of our platinum plus private label aftermarket parts offerings and our ability to deliver best-in-class service to State Farm\u2019s direct repair network across the country. We will be a beneficiary should State Farm ultimately decide to rollout the use of these additional aftermarket part types on a nationwide basis. This upward trend in our aftermarket sales volumes is consistent with a general rise in alternative part usage or APU, which again approached pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter. I am pleased to say that the increase in APU also included an uptick in the recycled parts category, increasing about 140 basis points year-over-year. Combined, aftermarket recycled parts have witnessed over a 400 basis point improvement in industry-wide APU year-over-year in the second quarter of 2023. Our outperformance is another indicator that we continue to take market share. Non-comprehensive total loss rates decreased sequentially in the second quarter to 20.4% from 20.9% in Q1. With the recent drop in used car prices, we expect total loss rates to slightly pick up for the balance of the year. And then as OEs work through their healthy inventory levels, industry experts believe we will likely see a mix shift to newer vehicles down the road and would expect to see any near-term increase in total losses to reverse cars given newer vehicles are less likely to be deemed a total loss. As stated in prior calls, we are generally agnostic as to the small up and down shifts in the total loss rate. Finally, last month, I had the opportunity to spend some quality time with the top performing general managers and salespeople at an event for our North American business. I must say their enthusiasm regarding the future of LKQ was simply energizing. Now, let\u2019s move on to our European segment. Europe\u2019s organic revenue growth for parts and services in the quarter increased 8.5% on a reported basis and 9.8% on a per day basis. It was a quarter of records for the European segment, which reported the highest quarterly revenue ever at $1.64 billion, the highest EBITDA at $188 million, and the highest second quarter EBITDA margin percentage ever at 11.5%. During the quarter, we saw high single-digit to low double-digit reported organic growth in some of our key operating geographies. In particular, our Benelux, German and Eastern European operations performed exceptionally well. The revenue growth reflected a combination of positive movements in both price and volume. We are confident we are continuing to take share in these large and highly fragmented markets as witnessed by ECP, our UK business, which generated its highest level of per day sales on record. In the second quarter, LKQ Europe entered into a strategic partnership with Mobivia, Europe\u2019s largest independent provider of automotive maintenance and repair services, operating under 11 brands in 18 countries across Europe. The agreement between Mobivia and LKQ Europe is based on a dual mode of collaboration, which includes the procurement and delivery of automotive parts to Mobivia\u2019s 530 ATU service branches across Germany. LKQ and Mobivia are both leaders in our respective sectors of the European automotive aftermarket. And thanks to this collaboration, we will leverage our strengths to provide a differentiated solution that is unparalleled in the marketplace. Our European team continues to face cost inflation across all operating markets. And to combat this, the team has taken decisive structural and multiple efficiency actions. These actions resulted in year-over-year improvements in SG&A for the second quarter despite this challenging macro environment. I spent last week in Europe meeting with all the senior leaders across the segment and also with the regional teams in the UK and the Benelux region. I am incredibly proud of the performance of the European team in what they are delivering. And I am very excited about all the initiatives they have underway to grow the business and enhance our leading competitive position. The team\u2019s focus and drive are outstanding and they are creating a uniquely special and market leading business. Now, let\u2019s move on to our Specialty segment. During the second quarter, Specialty reported a decrease in organic revenue of 12.9%, which was below our expectations. There were major differences in the demand for various part types with the truck, off-road and marine categories being down less than 2%, while RV and towing related products were off substantially more than the overall segment decline. The RV portion of our specialty business was impacted by the wholesale shipment and retail sales of RVs, which were down 50% and 20% year-to-date through May respectively. We expect to see further declines in the RV market as recent industry reports project that full year 2023 wholesale shipments will be down 40% year-over-year. With that, we believe the challenges for our Specialty segment will continue in the back half of the year. Now on to our Self-Service segment. Organic revenue for parts and services for our Self-Service segment increased 4.7% in the second quarter. Self-Service was again challenged by extremely soft commodity pricing, particularly as it related to precious metals. On the corporate development front, during the quarter and recently in July, we completed some smaller, highly synergistic tuck-in acquisitions, including a U.S. based remanufacturer and distributor of OE replacement engines, marine replacement engines and high-performance trade engines, a leading independent truck parts distributor in the UK, a Holland-based automotive aftermarket parts distributor, a Belgium-based business that distributes automotive parts, paint, tools and accessories and aftermarket accessories distributor with locations in Texas and Oklahoma. Additionally, during the quarter, we divested a small non-core business in our Specialty segment. The net annualized revenue impact of these six transactions collectively is approximately $240 million. As most of you know, on February 26, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of Uni-Select\u2019s issued and outstanding shares for CAD48 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion. The process is on schedule and we are pleased with our progress. During the second quarter, we received the required approvals from Uni-Select\u2019s shareholders, the Superior Court of Quebec, the antitrust regulators in the United States and in Canada. On July 21, the Competition and Markets Authority in the United Kingdom issued its Phase 1 decision on the transaction. And in response, we immediately submitted our proposed undertakings related to the divestiture of Uni-Select\u2019s GSF car parts business in the UK for evaluation by the CMA. In light of those developments, yesterday, we waived the closing conditions relating to regulatory approvals and I am happy to announce we plan to complete the acquisition of Uni-Select on or about August 1. The pending divestiture of GSF continues to progress in accordance with our desired timeline. After we complete the customary competitive bid sale process, this CMA will complete its suitability review of our proposed buyer. Upon receipt of approval of the buyer from the CMA, we will complete the sale of GSF likely in the third quarter. Now turning to ESG. During the order, we initiated or expanded various programs that centered around our people, LKQ\u2019s most important asset. As part of our response to our employee engagement survey, we identified that ensuring the health, safety and well-being of our employees is essential to our success. With that engagement data, we took actions. We expanded our Inspire to Thrive wellness program globally, which focuses on the physical, mental and financial well-being of our employees. We expanded the installation of dash cams across our North America and specialty fleets, a program that enhances the safety of our drivers. And at ECP, our team implemented two exciting programs, 25 by 25 and PAVE, which stands for people adding value everywhere. Both these programs are centered around our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Again, we implemented these programs as they are in the best interest of our employees. I could not be prouder of the continued progress on our ESG efforts, which was again validated in June by MSCI maintaining our AAA ESG rating a rating that very few companies can claim. Lastly, I am pleased to announce that on July 25, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.275 per share of common stock payable on August 31, 2023, to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 17, 2023. I will now turn the discussion over to Rick who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our outlook for 2023. Rick Galloway : Thank you, Nick, and welcome to everyone joining us today. The second quarter was another solid performance from the business with highlights including record high segment EBITDA margin of 20.6% in North America and at 11.5%, the highest quarterly margin in a decade for Europe, organic revenue growth in the high single digits in North America and Europe, operating improvements countering headwinds from commodity prices and interest costs. Strong free cash flow of $414 million in the quarter and the completion of a $1.4 billion bond offering to secure financing for the pending Uni-Select acquisition. I want to reiterate Nick\u2019s thanks to the global LKQ team for delivering exceptional results in difficult conditions. To provide further details on these results, I will start with comments on segment performance. Going to Slide 10. North America continued its strong performance, posting a segment EBITDA margin of 20.6%, a 190 basis point improvement over last year. We saw gross margin improvement of 150 basis points driven by lower freight costs, pricing and productivity initiatives and a favorable mix effect with the sale of the lower-margin PGW business. Overhead expenses were favored by 40 basis points, primarily due to lower freight, vehicle and fuel expenses. With the continued strong performance in our North American segment, we believe the full year segment EBITDA margins will finish the year in the low 19% range with some moderation in the second half of 2023 with salvage margins tightening, along with some normal seasonality. Europe also delivered terrific results with a segment EBITDA margin of 11.5%, up 70 basis points from the prior year period. As seen on Slide 11, gross margin improved by 20 basis points, while overhead expenses decreased by 50 basis points with the effect of improved leverage due to the 9.8% per day organic revenue growth and emphasis on productivity initiatives on personnel costs and reduced freight costs. There are some headwinds anticipated in the second half of the year as personnel costs increased due to wage inflation. We intend to mitigate these increases through productivity initiatives, and we remain optimistic about our previously disclosed expectation for full year margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points in 2023. Moving to Slide 12. Specialty\u2019s EBITDA margin of 9.5% declined 390 basis points compared to the prior year. Gross margin, which was down 370 basis points year-over-year is under pressure from increased price competition as inventory availability continues to improve our competitors in addition to unfavorable product mix as lower margin lines such as auto and marine have been less affected by revenue reductions. Overhead expenses were up 20 basis points, primarily from the decrease in leverage driven by organic revenue decline of 12.9% per day. The specialty team continues to take actions to align the cost structure with revenue trends, and prior restructuring efforts have provided some benefit in the second quarter to counteract the revenue softness. As you can see on Slide 13, Self Service profitability declined sequentially to 4.1% this quarter from 13.2% in the first quarter and decreased relative to the 15.3% reported in Q2 2022. Metals prices had a net negative effect on results with lower precious metal prices, representing a $50 million reduction in EBITDA and an unfavorable lag effect from sequential scrap steel price changes driving a further $5 million decline. Other revenue decreased by 28.3% in total, contributing to a reduction in operating leverage of 620 basis points. Relative to Q2 2022, the average price received for catalytic converters in Q2 2023 declined by 39% and scrap steel fell by 20%. While car cost typically move in tandem, which changes in commodity prices, we have experienced a stickiness in car costs, which were only down 12% relative to Q2 2022. These trends created a gross margin headwind in the second quarter that could persist in the second half of the year. Now for further details on the consolidated results. As mentioned, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.09 was flat to Q2 last year. Our operational performance showed strong year-over-year improvement with a net increase of $0.11 per share on an adjusted basis, driven by solid gains in North America and Europe, partially offset by the decline in the specialty business. We benefited by $0.04 due to the lower share count resulting from our share repurchases in 2022. These factors were ex of $0.08 from the impact of metal prices, as shown on Slide 27, $0.05 in higher interest expense resulting from rate increases and $0.02 due to a higher effective tax rate. On the tax rate, we applied an annual effective rate estimate of 27.0% and which is 40 basis points higher than the 26.6% in our prior guidance. The rate change is attributable to non-deductible Uni-Select transaction costs and other effects related to the Uni-Select financing. As shown on Slide 18, the Uni-Select transaction affected various parts of the second quarter financials. The income statement effects of the pre-acquisition net financing expenses and transaction costs have been excluded from adjusted diluted EPS. Once we complete the acquisition, going forward, interest expense will be reflected in adjusted diluted earnings per share. In May, we completed the offering of $1.4 billion of senior notes due in 2028 and 2033. We\u2019re happy with the results of the offering as a first-time investment-grade issuer, obtaining financing at 5.75% and 6.25% for the 5 and 10-year maturities was an outstanding outcome. We recorded interest expense on the bonds for the period between the issuance date and the quarter end in the interest expense line on the income statement. The interest earned from the bond proceeds is reflected in interest and other income. In Q1, we hedged the interest rate risk prior to the issuance of permanent financing in the bond market. Upon issuance of the bonds, we unwind these interest rate swaps and settled by making a payment of $13 million. As these swaps qualified for hedge accounting, the loss was held on the balance sheet and will be amortized to the income statement over the life of the bonds. With the completion of the bond offering, we terminated the bridge loan facility and amortized the remaining $6 million of upfront fees in Q2. To hedge the risk related to the movements in the Canadian dollar exchange rates between signing and closing, in Q1, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to purchase Canadian dollars at a specified rate. These contracts had a fair value of $46 million as of June 30. And as we are not eligible for hedge accounting on these contracts, the mark-to-market gain is reflected in the income statement as a separate line item. We incurred M&A advisory costs of $6 million in the quarter, which are presented in restructuring and transaction-related expenses. Shifting to cash flows in the balance sheet. With the $1.4 billion bond offering and CAD700 million term loan, we have secured the necessary financing for the Uni-Select transaction. By completing the bond offering ahead of the deal closing, we are carrying more cash on the balance sheet than usual at $1.9 billion. If you set aside the roughly $1.4 billion earmarked for the acquisition, we have $519 million in cash and $1.2 billion of available liquidity as of June 30. As of June 30, we had total debt of $4.0 billion with a total leverage ratio of 2.3x EBITDA, which takes into account the additional debt for funding Uni-Select and none of the projected EBITDA from the acquisition. The increase in the total leverage ratio above our target range of 2.0x was expected as we disclosed in our prior Uni-Select communications. We are committed to reducing our leverage ratio below 2.0x within 18 months of closing the transaction upon achieving our target leverage ratio, we will return to our balanced capital allocation strategy, including share repurchases. Our effective borrowing rate rose to 5.3% for the quarter due to global market rate increases. The increase in the leverage ratio above the 2.0x will trigger a 12.5 basis point increase in our credit facility margin going forward. We have $1.7 billion in variable rate debt, of which $700 million has been fixed with interest rate swaps at 4.6% and 4.2% over the next 2 to 3 years, respectively. We produced $414 million in free cash flow during the quarter and at $567 million on a year-to-date basis. We remain on track for our full year estimate of approximately $975 million. Compared to the year-to-date June 2022, free cash flow was down $71 million with higher outflows from income taxes of $39 million, interest of $38 million and capital spending of $37 million. These are the three areas we highlighted as headwinds in our February call, and the actual results are playing out mostly as expected. Interest payments will be a larger headwind than originally projected because of higher interest rates and the impact of Uni-Select financing coming on to the books before the acquisition closes. As previously mentioned, we have paused our share repurchase program and directed our free cash flow to paying down debt of $131 million in the second quarter as well as tuck-in acquisitions of $27 million. Additionally, we paid a quarterly dividend of $74 million. I will conclude with our thoughts on projected 2023 results. Our guidance is based on current economic conditions and recent trends and assume scrap and precious metal prices hold near June levels and the Ukraine Russia conflict continues without further escalation or major additional impact on the European economy and mouse driven. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes balance of the year rates for the euro of $1.09 and the pound sterling at $1.25, in line with June rates. We expect reported organic parts and service revenue in the range of 6.0% to 7.5%. Organic growth was 6.4% through June. We decreased the high end of the range in recognition of the ongoing challenges at specialty, which is down 13% year-to-date. We expect specialty to reduce the year-over-year decline in the second half of the year, but the lower full year expectation makes reaching 8% at the consolidated level unlikely. Please note, we have 1 fewer selling day in North America, Europe in specialty in Q3. We expect adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.90 to $4.10, which brings in the high end of the range from our previous estimate, while there is no change to the low end. The midpoint is now $4 per share, down $0.05 from our prior figure. We anticipate North America and Europe continue to perform ahead of prior expectations and are mitigating softness in our specialty segment, resulting in net operational growth of $0.05. However, the negative effects of declining metals prices of $0.07 and higher interest and tax expenses of $0.03 are more than offsetting this operational growth. Slide 5 shows the primary factors contributing to the EPS guidance change. There is no change to our free cash flow expectation of approximately $975 million and 55% annual EBITDA conversion, noting a portion of the Uni-Select transaction fees and pre-acquisition interest costs will have a one-time impact to free cash flow and create a headwind that we expect to overcome. To be clear, the numbers I just quoted do not include operating results for Uni-Select. We expect to close on Uni-Select on or about August 1 and assuming that timing, we are projecting the acquisition will be dilutive to adjusted diluted EPS by $0.02 to $0.04 per share in fiscal 2023. While we believe the transaction will be accretive over the first 12 months, in the early months, it is expected to be dilutive due to the integration costs and the time required to begin to achieve the synergies. Our overall expectation for the businesses have not changed, and we are excited to bring them in as part of the LKQ family. Thank you for your time today. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Rick, for that financial overview. In closing, the second quarter was another solid performance for team LKQ. I am beyond proud of the results we delivered for the first half of the year, particularly how the teams are diligently planning and positioning their respective businesses for the balance of 2023 as we continue to be challenged by certain uncontrollable dynamics. As we move into the second half of the year, let me restate our key strategic pillars, which remain central to our culture and our objectives. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And fourth, we will continue to invest in our future. As always, I want to thank the over 46,000 people who work at LKQ for all they do to advance our business each day and for driving our missions and our delivers values forward regardless of the challenges. And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Stember of ROTH MKM. Please go ahead. Scott Stember : Good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my questions. Nick Zarcone : Thanks, Scott. Scott Stember : In North America, I just wanted to touch on State Farm. I think in previous calls, you had talked about, I guess, based on those three SKUs throughout the country, about $100 million in benefit, getting a lot of questions from investors about what the potential is with California and Arizona now going fully live with the whole program. Nick Zarcone : Sure. I\u2019ll take that. Obviously, we are delighted by the movement State Farm is making in terms of utilizing our high-quality aftermarket parts, new pair of policyholders vehicles. You\u2019re correct. We previously mentioned that the upside from headlights, tail lights and bumper covers was about $70 million to $100 million on an annual basis once everything gets up and running. We are tracking toward that number. So quite frankly, probably towards the midpoint as there appears to be a little bit of cannibalization on the salvage side in addition to the significant cannibalization on the OEM parts side. These three-part types represent the highest volume of aftermarket parts as almost every collision requires the replacement of lights and bumper covers. If you think about three equal sized baskets, Scott, of lighting, bumpers and everything else, adding everything else to the bucket would add another 50% or so to our original estimate, which would push you towards somewhere in the $125 million to $150 million on an annual basis over time. Now that\u2019s probably a little bit higher than some preliminary guesstimates that some of you have had likely due to the fact that State Farm will only use CAPA-certified parts. And CAPA parts only represent about $1 billion of our overall aftermarket sales. When you add on top of that, that the $1 billion includes chrome bumpers, basically bumpers for pickup trucks that State Farm has been using for the last several years. So if you apply, roughly there is 16% to 17% market share on that lower base, you get back to that $125 million to $150 million on an annual basis of incremental revenue over time. So that\u2019s the number that we\u2019re comfortable with right now. I would also say that, that\u2019s a very nice revenue pickup. And because there is a limited amount of required SG&A to deliver all those incremental parts, we think there will be really good margins on that incremental State Farm business. Scott Stember : So that $125 million to $150 million, is that an all-in number? Or that\u2019s an additional amount just for California and Arizona? Nick Zarcone : No. That\u2019s all in. Again, everything else is about third of the bucket lights are about third and bumper covers or about third. Rick Galloway : The pilot, Scott, won\u2019t mean much for us as a product to the pilot. So we\u2019re \u2013 the numbers that Nick just quoted are assuming they go live at some point in time. Scott Stember : Okay. I am sorry for blithering the point here, but does that assume that the whole country goes live with all parts 100%? Nick Zarcone : Yes. Scott Stember : Okay. Got it. And maybe just walk over to Europe for a second. Obviously, tremendous growth there, it sounds like the volume has picked up nicely. Maybe just talk about some of the things that are really pushing growth there? I know that you guys are taking share and doing a better job. But are you seeing signs of the countercyclical nature of the business to kick in? Nick Zarcone : I wouldn\u2019t say countercyclical, Scott. I mean the reality is the economies in Europe are in much worse shape than the U.S. economy. If you just look at some of the published statistics, Germany is in a recession, they have had two quarters now of negative GDP growth. The UK is probably the worst off of any of the economies, the impact of the war, the impact of energy prices inflation. While inflation has come down a bit in the U.S., inflation is hanging pretty high over in Europe. And quite frankly, that\u2019s having an impact on the consumer. The fact that we are continuing to grow our business, both from a volume perspective and a price perspective tells us that while may not be countercyclical, we are more than holding our own as it relates to the overall economic backdrop in Europe. Again, good growth, we are highly confident that what this means is, over time the car park is going to age. And if you talk to anybody in our business, an older car is our friend. So, we think that longer term, these soft economic conditions in Europe will actually bode to our favor. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison of Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Rick, I had a question for you. North American fulfillment rates, is there any way to quantify the year-over-year increase you saw this quarter? And then how long do you expect tailwinds from that improving fulfillment rate to impact North American organic growth? Rick Galloway : Yes, it\u2019s a good question. Thanks \u2013 Craig, thanks for the question. Fulfillment rates are back to the mid-90s, which is kind of our target, as we have kind of talked in the past, we were low-90s when we think about where we were just a year ago in Q2, actually, we are in high-80s as I am looking at the numbers, and so we have got about 5 points of improvement. As far as quantification, the difficulty in doing that is that it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag. So, I would hate to quote what the overall benefit was as far as dollars go. As there is a little bit of a movement, and we have talked about this before between the salvage side and the aftermarket. So, there has been a little bit of a flip. So, when some of the volume went away from aftermarket when the availability wasn\u2019t there, it went over to salvage. It\u2019s kind of gone back the other way. So, we are happy with where we are at. We don\u2019t think we need to go much more of where we are at as we are continuing to balance the free cash flow impacts of holding the additional inventories. Craig Kennison : Thanks. And as you look at like Q3 and Q4 and then 2024, do you still expect tailwinds, or do you think that has abated from a year-over-year perspective? Rick Galloway : Yes. I think were minor improvements, but nothing that\u2019s going to be meaningful for us at this time. I mean we are back to not quite where we were pre-pandemic, but I mean it\u2019s really, really close. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Bret Jordan : Hey. Good morning guys. Nick Zarcone : Good morning Bret. Bret Jordan : With a bit more visibility now, I guess of the Uni-Select business, could you talk about how you see the synergies having a North American mechanical business in Canada? Nick Zarcone : Yes. So, as we outlined back in late February when we announced the transaction, Bret, we are highly confident that there is $55 million of cost synergies that we will be able to get our hands on over the first kind of 3 years post-transaction. Most of that will come in the second year with only a few of those dollars needing a full 3 years to access. We are going to start the process just as soon as we can and trying to deliver the synergies very quickly. And again, there is facility savings. There are some procurement benefits and kind of all the corporate overhead and the like that we don\u2019t need. And so nothing has changed from the presentation that we gave everybody back on February 27th, 28th, when we announced the transaction. Again, we are highly confident in our ability to do that. Obviously, much of the synergies are going to come in the U.S. That\u2019s where the FinishMaster operations and our paint operations overlap. That\u2019s where a lot of the synergies come from. We have no plans on eliminating, changing or shutting down facilities up in Canada because we don\u2019t do what they do in Canada today, right. They are distributing small mechanical parts. That\u2019s the business that we have over in Europe. We do think that there will be benefits, revenue benefits that we can glean by broadening out their product line, giving them some incremental inventory to cover all car types that are used up in Canada by giving them some capital to grow their business. But none of that is included in the $55 million of benefits that we outlined when we announced the transaction. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then you didn\u2019t mention Leadtech [ph] in your prepared remarks. Could you give us an update on the third-party diagnostics developments? Nick Zarcone : Leadtech, yes, so we love our services business. The reality is it\u2019s growing about 25% a year, which is obviously significantly higher than any of our other businesses, and it has really strong margins. And so we are very, very happy about that. I mean if you look at some industry data, about 75% of all repairs at the MSOs are scanning the car for some of that technology. And about 18% of the repairs actually have some sort of calibration work being done on the vehicles. Now the 18% may sound low, but you got to remember that there is only a \u2013 today, there is only a small portion of the car park that has all the technology on it. Average price of a scan is running about $140. Average price of the calibration is running close to $400. And so it is a really attractive business. And the market is going to continue to grow because every year, there are simply more cars out on the roads with some of that more advanced technology on the car. That\u2019s where we got into the business several years ago. We have created what we believe is a market-leading offering, providing a high level of service to our existing customers. By providing some of those services actually in their shops, and we are optimistic about the future. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Butler of Stifel. Please go ahead. Brian Butler : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Nick Zarcone : Good morning Brian. Brian Butler : Just when you think about specialty, it doesn\u2019t sound like there is a bounce from the bottom, but do you feel like we have kind of reached the bottom and how to think about where the margins ultimately settle out, maybe kind of back half of \u201823 and then thinking about \u201824? Nick Zarcone : Yes. So, it\u2019s \u2013 we are not predicting that we are at the bottom yet. The reality, it\u2019s been a rough couple of quarters for our specialty business. We have not seen a catalyst that that\u2019s going to turn quickly. Obviously, as we start to get into 2024, we have got better, easier comps that we will be working against. And so the numbers from a growth perspective may not look as soft, but from an absolute dollar perspective, we are not anticipating a significant uptick. The good news is they did some restructuring earlier in the year. They are going aggressively at their cost structure. And so the month of June, they were actually back to double-digit margins even though they weren\u2019t there for the quarter. And so I would suggest that margins in and around the 10% range. It\u2019s something that we are striving to achieve even though the revenues may be challenged now for several more quarters. Brian Butler : Alright. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. And second question, how do you bridge the free cash flow outlook staying the same with the higher interest expense, what\u2019s offsetting that? Rick Galloway : Yes. So, if you look at the overall pieces that we have got, the trade working capital for us has been a nice improvement. We continue to see a nice improvement. We saw a really good improvement within Q2 as well. And then the earnings side is the other side of it. So, we are really happy with where we ended up in Q2. Overall, trade working capital improved roughly a little less than $180 million, and we expect to continue to drive that throughout the rest of the year. Brian Butler : Thank you. Operator : We now have the next question from the line of Gary Prestopino of Barrington Research. Please go ahead. Gary Prestopino : Hey. Good morning everyone. Nick Zarcone : Good morning Gary. Rick Galloway : Good morning Gary. Gary Prestopino : A couple of questions here. With your \u2013 some of the puts and takes on your adjusted EPS guidance, the changes here, which is rather minimal. But in looking at it, it looks like this does not really impact the consolidated segment EBITDA or the consolidated EBITDA that you generate for the year. Is that kind of a correct assumption? It looks like there will be very little impact from these \u2013 some of these changes. Rick Galloway : The metals will be an impact. But you are right, on the interest side \u2013 on the taxes side, those will be avoided. But the metals impact, you should feather that in. Gary Prestopino : Right. But you are also getting $0.05 from operating results, right? Rick Galloway : Yes, exactly. And it\u2019s roughly the same, Gary. I mean it\u2019s minimal as far as the difference go on the EBITDA side. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then Nick, could you \u2013 it seems like Varun has got things really humming over in Europe. Could you maybe talk about some of the actions that they have taken over there that have led to the margin improvement and the segment EBITDA generation in the quarter that were at record levels? Nick Zarcone : As Rick indicated, a lot of the focus came on SG&A. We \u2013 of the 70 basis point improvement, I think we split 20 basis points in gross margin and 50 basis points in SG&A. So, taking a really hard look across all of our platforms to make sure that we are doing the best job possible to control our overhead expenses. Now, when you have 9.8% per day organic revenue growth, that helps. But make no mistake, Gary, the inflationary environment, as I indicated over in Europe, is much more intense than it is here in the U.S. And so they have needed productivity gains to offset a lot of that increase and allow us to actually get to a lower SG&A percent as it relates compared to revenues. Rick did indicate that we have got some wage inflation coming at us in Europe in the second half of the year. We know that already. Certain other countries, particularly the Netherlands has another wage increase coming at them. We experienced already a couple of days strike in Germany as the unions over there and the work consoles have their members to use short-term strikes to try and position for better wages. And so those are all things we are going to have to deal with in the second half of the year. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Hi. Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Nick Zarcone : Good morning Daniel. Rick Galloway : Good morning Daniel. Daniel Imbro : Rick, I want to start on North American EBITDA margins. Obviously, I think you had guided earlier this year that was set down as smaller competitors got inventory and may be used price to get share back, but they have held in much stronger. So, I guess what\u2019s playing out differently than you thought? Are smaller peers being more rational, or is there something else driving North American wholesale margin up to offset some of that price competition? Rick Galloway : Yes. Thanks for the question, Daniel. It\u2019s a combination of several different things. One is productivity initiatives have been something that we focused on for a while that are helping to offset any of the risks we are seeing on the pricing side. The other thing is that competition, we believe has a decent amount of inventory and has been pretty good about holding pricing. So, we haven\u2019t been looking at a drop in the pricing piece as we were kind of expecting earlier. And as you heard in the prepared remarks, as we think about the back half of the year, there is a little bit more seasonality than anything else and kind of pulling away from the idea of how bad \u2013 how low could the margins go relative to where they are at right now. We are just not seeing it. So, I think productivity is one of the biggest things that is offsetting that. And we are continuing to drive it. So, we think we will end up in the low-19s for the full year number as we are coming into the back half of the year. Daniel Imbro : Thank you for that color. And then maybe a related follow-up on North America, I think Nick, you mentioned 400 basis points of APU improvement. That should have been on a guess just a nice tailwind to volume, but could you break out the 8.5% comp? How much was ticket versus like more ticket growth versus more traffic growth? And then are you seeing any change in OEM pricing? I think that\u2019s an investor concern out there as OEM production picks up. So, how is that side of the pricing backdrop been related to the traffic first ticket discussion? Nick Zarcone : Yes. North America, more than half of the year-over-year growth of volume, which is really good to see. Obviously, a lot of that has to do with the aftermarket volume, as we talked about, having the inventory in stock, getting the fulfillment rates up, the State Farm program, all that leads to higher volumes. And the OEs, they have kept \u2013 generally kept their prices steady. They certainly haven\u2019t dropped prices. And we don\u2019t think that they will. They have never shown a propensity to lower prices, if you will. I mean there was a period of time where they didn\u2019t increase prices for quite a bit. And then they started like everyone else, with inflation and everything else, we are taking some prices up. And so we did \u2013 we follow their tracks. So, our expectation is that they are going to keep pricing pretty moderate here going forward, and we will just continue to sell it at a discount to the OE list as we have done forever. People shouldn\u2019t anticipate any significant movement on behalf of the OEs or that having an impact on our pricing. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Nick Zarcone for closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir. Nick Zarcone : Well, I would certainly like to thank everyone for your time and your attention this morning. Again, we are very proud of the Q2 results that we were able to report earlier today, and we are looking forward, obviously, to the back half of the year. We certainly look forward to chatting with you again in late October when we announce our third quarter results. And until then, I hope you all have a wonderful fun into your summer. Thank you everyone. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s conference call, you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I\u2019d like to go ahead and introduce our speaker today, Joe Boutross, with LKQ Corporation. Please go ahead. Joe Boutross : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ\u2019s third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rick Galloway, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the coming days. And with that, I\u2019m happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter, and then Rick will dive into the financial details and provide an overview of our updated guidance, before I come back with a few closing remarks. The third quarter of 2023 represented some mixed results, which collectively fell short of our expectations. Wholesale North America continued to outperform, all while working on the integration of the Uni-Select acquisition. However, we experienced some unusual transitory events that, in aggregate, affected the short-term performance of our European operations. We also had continued pressure on commodities, which impacted Self Service, along with less-than-expected demand for our specialty products. The LKQ culture is one that takes accountability for results and is humble enough to understand that this quarter\u2019s results fell short of both our expectations and the expectations that may view on the call. Make no mistake, the shift to our operational excellence strategy implemented in 2019 has not changed. Structurally, our business model and financial outlook are sound, and we continue to be very optimistic about the future of LKQ. One quarter does not define the resiliency of our business model, the uniqueness of our global enterprise or the long-term opportunities that lie ahead for LKQ. The perpetual challenging macroeconomic conditions are not unique to LKQ, and they will continue to persist, but the LKQ team will move forward. On the positive side, we continue to experience strong organic revenue growth in our North American and European businesses achieving same-day growth of 5.8% and 6.2%, respectively. North America achieved excellent EBITDA margins, which were ahead of expectations, and our free cash flow was excellent, particularly in North America and Europe. On the downside, during the quarter, we faced a few unusual and transitory headwinds. In late September, our Italian subsidiary, Rhiag, completed a negotiation with the Italian tax authorities on the remediation of a value-added tax violation that was committed by certain of our third-party suppliers dating back to 2017. These suppliers are no longer in business, and thus, Rhiag agreed to remit the disputed amounts to the Italian revenue agency to remedy any damage caused by the VAT violations of the former suppliers. Additionally, our German operation was hit with periodic strikes at our large distribution center, which reduced our ability to fully replenish the branch network with inventory on a daily basis. Negotiations with the works council are ongoing, but there have been additional strikes in October, which will affect our Q4 results. It\u2019s important to note that resolving the matter is not fully in our control as the labor contract involved with some multiple employers in Southern Germany that must agree on terms through the employers association. These two items alone reduced our European organic growth by approximately 160 basis points and reduced segment EBITDA margins by 110 basis points. While we are disappointed with these two transitory items, our long-term view of the growth and margin potential of our European business has not changed. Related to commodities, pricing pressure continued in the third quarter, with scrap and precious metal down sequentially 14% and 23%, respectively, decreasing both margins and earnings per share. For context, in Q3, catalytic converter prices fell below $100 for the first time since early 2019, versus the third quarter of last year, when they averaged to $197. This difficult commodity environment, again, had a particularly negative impact on the profitability of our Self Service segment. Rick will provide a deeper dive into the EPS and segment margin details in the quarter when he discusses our updated guidance. The quarter included many other highlights worth noting. The company generated robust free cash flow, and we are on target to again reach $1 billion for 2023. On August 1, we announced the completion of the Uni-Select acquisition, a bespoke and highly synergistic opportunity that will add positive long-term shareholder value and further widen the competitive moat around our North American business. Yesterday, we completed the sale of GSF Car Parts to Epiris, a private equity firm based in the UK, the proceeds from the sale will be used for debt repayments. And finally, our Board has declared a 9% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.275 to $0.30 per share of common stock. This increase reflects the Board\u2019s ongoing confidence in our ability to continue to generate solid free cash flow and drive long-term value for our shareholders. Now, on to the third quarter 2023 results and year-over-year comparisons. Revenue for the third quarter of 2023 was $3.6 billion, an increase of 15%. Parts and services organic revenue increased 3% on a reported basis and 4.3% on a per day basis. Diluted earnings per share was $0.77 as compared to $0.95 for the same period last year, a decrease of 18.9%. While adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.86 compared to $0.97 for the same period of 2022, a decrease of 11.3%. Let\u2019s turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 8, organic revenue for parts and services for North America increased 4.1% on a reported basis and 5.8% on a per day basis. We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that non-comprehensive related auto claims were down 4.3% year-over-year in the third quarter. Similar to the first half of the year, the growth in North America was a combination of price and volume improvements, with the organic growth in our aftermarket collision products predominantly being volume-related. These nice volume increases were driven by our disciplined procurement efforts that allowed us to achieve the proper levels of inventory and the ability to stabilize and maintain our industry-leading fulfillment rates of over 93%, which helped us grow the business. The strong volume was also attributable to State Farm, expanding their usage of aftermarket headlights, taillights and bumpers beginning earlier this year. Further on State Farm, during our last call, I mentioned that State Farm launched another pilot program in California and Arizona for the use of a full range of aftermarket collision parts, including sheet metal products like fenders, hoods and trunk lids and other items like side mirrors and grills. Today, I am pleased to share that on October 16, State Farm announced that they are rolling out the use of these parts nationally to collision repair shops, which are part of their DRP program. We expect the incremental lift from this expansion at a full run rate will reflect a $20 million to $30 million annual benefit in revenues once fully ramped up. With respect to the UAW strikes, we believe that a continuation of the strikes will create incremental demand for our aftermarket and to a lesser extent, our recycled collision parts. Because the strike started in late September, there was no impact on our third quarter results, but we are starting to see an incremental per day volume uptick across all product lines, with some lines that have historically been sourced primarily from the OEs expanding at a faster rate. Obviously, we don\u2019t know how long this demand benefit will last, so we have not adjusted guidance for the UAW strike. North America EBITDA margins exceeded our expectations for the quarter, and we are on track to achieve the greater than 19% full year target we have previously discussed, excluding the anticipated dilution of Uni-Select. Let\u2019s move to our European segment. Europe\u2019s organic revenue for parts and services in the quarter increased 5.1% on a reported basis and 6.2% on a per day basis. While the market remains competitive, the business is performing well by increasing the organic growth rate in the quarter, mostly driven by volume. During the third quarter, we saw solid organic growth in all of our regions, despite the impact of the strikes in Germany, with regional same-day organic growth ranging from approximately 4.7% on the low end to 16.3% on the high end and a total same-day growth rate of 6.2%. Excluding the impact of the strike, the same-day growth rate was just shy of 8%, which is outstanding. The diversity of our European platform is also highlighted by the dispersion in EBITDA margins, with key lines of business and markets posting margins in the low teens, while certain smaller markets delivering mid-single-digit performance. While the labor situation will weigh on our margins in Q4, we remain confident in the long-term margin potential of our European operations. Now let\u2019s move on to our Specialty segment, which continues to face a soft demand environment. During the third quarter, Specialty reported a decrease in organic revenue of 6.1% on a reported basis and 4.6% on a per day basis, which again was below our expectations. As in the past, there were major differences in the demand for various part types. With the RV OEM warranty products and truck and off-road products up 3% and 2%, respectively, during the quarter, while RV accessories and towing-related products were off double digits on a year-over-year basis. The RV portion of our Specialty business was impacted by the wholesale shipment and retail unit sales of RVs, which were down 45% and 17% year-to-date through August, respectively. Though still down, the Specialty revenue decline in the third quarter was less significant than in the first half of the year. Still, we don\u2019t see a natural near-term catalyst for demand to bounce back, and we anticipate tough comparisons into the start of 2024. Now on to the Self Service segment. Organic revenue for parts and services for our Self Service segment increased 5.1% in the third quarter. Self Service was again confronted by the decrease in metals pricing, I mentioned earlier, particularly with respect to catalytic converters, which are linked to precious metal prices. Operationally, the Self Service team also had challenges with their ability to source vehicles at the appropriate cost. Simply put, car costs have not declined in lockstep with commodity prices, creating significant margin pressures and pushing Self Service into a loss position for the third quarter. We have already taken action with our buying practices and have installed an operational leader to drive standardization and process improvements across our Self Service buying group. The leadership team has also taken actions to reduce overhead costs, and the early returns have been positive. We expect this business to be marginally profitable in Q4. As reported, we closed on the Uni-Select acquisition on August 1. The integration activities and synergies are on target and in some cases, ahead of schedule. This past week, we completed the first wave of FinishMaster facility optimizations, with 10 locations being folded into an existing LKQ aftermarket warehouse location and two other FinishMaster locations being merged. From here, we will begin to see an acceleration of our footprint optimization. Our sales force and operations teams dedicated to the paint and related products market have been fully aligned, and we\u2019ve built out a synergy tracking team with various tools and metrics to assure we hit the targets we established when we announced the transaction back in February. Now that we\u2019ve owned the business for a few months, we see a slight shift in the FinishMaster business with MSOs representing a slightly larger share of activity. As you know, the MSOs are some of our largest customers on the parts side of the business. The bumper to bumper business in Canada is actively working with our European team to assess and take advantage of the procurement leverage that exists between their respective businesses. We have completed two tuck-in acquisitions in Canada that Uni-Select had in the hopper, and we have another small transaction that will close shortly. We are excited about the growth opportunities in Canada and believe we have a great team to execute the plan. Overall, I am confident in our North America team managing the Uni-Select integration, and that they will deliver the same strong results as they\u2019ve had with their operational excellence efforts over the last three years. Let me now turn the discussion over to Rick, who will run you through the details of the segment results and discuss our updated outlook for 2023. Rick Galloway : Thank you, Nick, and welcome to everyone joining us today. As Nick mentioned, our third quarter results reflected a mix of positives and negatives, but on balance was below our expectations. Our cash flow generation in our North America segment margins continue to be bright spots for us, and we will continue to build on these strengths. The earnings pressure was attributable to a combination of unusual items, softness in precious metal prices, and difficult market conditions impacting our Specialty and Self Service segments. While we expect challenges around economic conditions, commodity prices and exchange rates to impact the fourth quarter, we remain highly confident in the prospects of the overall business as the fundamental strengths that have driven strong results since we implemented our operational excellence strategy in 2019 remain intact. I will now provide further details on the financials, starting with cash flows and the balance sheet. As of June 30, we had total debt of $4.0 billion, including the $1.4 billion bond offering from May, with a total leverage ratio of 2.3 times EBITDA. With the August 1 acquisition of Uni-Select, we drew down a CAD700 million term loan and approximately $150 million on our revolving credit facility to complete the funding. By hedging the Canadian dollar exchange rate after announcing the transaction, we were able to save almost $50 million [ph] on the U.S. dollar equivalent of the purchase price, which is a terrific outcome. Factoring in the proceeds from the hedge settlement and the cash acquired, our net cash out for the Uni-Select acquisition dropped down from $2.1 billion to $2.0 billion. We committed to paying down debt post acquisition to bring our total leverage ratio below 2.0 times again within 18 months, and we got to work on this pledge in August and September, during which we paid down over $200 million of revolver debt with our free cash flow. As of September 30, our total leverage ratio was 2.3 times, so consistent with the June level and we expect a reduction in the leverage ratio as of year-end. The proceeds from the sale of GSF will be utilized to reduce our total debt, putting us in a better position to begin implementing a more balanced capital allocation strategy, which includes share repurchases. The Q3 debt repayments were possible because of our solid balance sheet and the generation of $344 million in free cash flow during the quarter. Through September, free cash flow is $911 million, and we are raising our full year guidance to approximately $1.0 billion in recognition of the strong performance year-to-date. I am pleased with our ability to meet the free cash flow expectations despite the headwind from acquisition-related transaction, restructuring and financing costs of almost $50 million. Also during the quarter, we invested $65 million on tuck-in acquisitions, and we paid a dividend of $74 million in September. As Nick mentioned, we raised our quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share, which speaks to our confidence in being able to generate robust free cash flows through economic cycles. Our effective borrowing rate rose to 5.5% for the quarter due to global market rate increases. We have $2.1 billion in variable rate debt, of which $700 million has been fixed with interest rate swaps at 4.6% and 4.2% over the next two years to three years, respectively. Moving to segment performance. Starting on Slide 10. North America reported a segment EBITDA margin of 17.0%, which includes the results of Uni-Select effective August 1. As we previously disclosed, Uni-Select operates at a lower margin than our legacy North America business because of the mix of product it sells. Adding Uni-Select diluted the North America margins by 180 basis points. Without Uni-Select, North America continued its strong performance with a Q3 margin of 18.8% and stayed on track to finish the year with a segment EBITDA margin in the low 19% range, consistent with what we disclosed last quarter. North America gross margin decreased 60 basis points, in line with expectations, with a decrease in salvage margins tied to car costs. Overhead expenses were roughly flat year-over-year. After the acquisition of Uni-Select, the North America team was able to work on integration and achieve a better understanding of the timing of our original assumptions. With increased access to personnel and visibility of financial and operational data, we are updating our projections for 2023 for Uni-Select to be dilutive in the range of $0.04 to $0.06. As Nick mentioned, we are focused on integration and are accelerating synergies related to FinishMaster branches to drive improvement relative to the estimated range and maximize the 2024 benefits. We remain confident in our investment thesis of Uni-Select, and we believe the transaction will be accretive in 2024. Europe delivered segment EBITDA margin of 9.3%, down 200 basis points from the prior period. There were a couple of unusual items that had a negative effect of 110 basis points on the results Nick mentioned. First, we booked a charge for value added tax audit matter in Italy related to prior years for $11 million, which impacted the margin by 70 basis points. We are comfortable that this VAT issue has been addressed and won\u2019t have a recurring effect. Second, the strikes at our primary distribution center in Germany had an estimated negative effect on segment EBITDA of 40 basis points. The remaining margin variance is attributable to gross margin compression, primarily in our Central and Eastern European regions related to customer price sensitivity with difficult macroeconomic conditions. We are addressing this matter with specific category management actions to meet price point expectations in the region while helping to improve margins. Moving to Slide 12. Specialty\u2019s EBITDA margin of 8.6% declined 220 basis points compared to the prior year. Gross margin, which was down 300 basis points year-over-year is under pressure from increased price competition as inventory availability continues to improve for our competitors in addition to unfavorable product mix as lower margin lines, such as auto and marine, have been less affected by revenue reductions. SG&A expenses were favorable by 80 basis points, mostly related to personnel and primarily coming from restructuring efforts in the last 12 months to align the cost structure with revenue trends. As the year-over-year organic revenue decrease has narrowed each quarter in 2023 versus the prior year, the same is occurring with segment EBITDA margin, and we expect the trend to continue in Q4 with the margin near last year\u2019s figure. As you can see on Slide 13, Self Service profitability declined sequentially to a loss of 0.6% this quarter from 4.1% in the second quarter and decreased relative to the 2.6% reported in Q3 2022. Metals prices had a net negative effect on results of $7 million, with lower precious metal prices representing a $17 million reduction in EBITDA and lag effects from sequential scrap steel price changes driving a $10 million improvement. Other revenue decreased by 24.4% in total, contributing to a reduction in operational leverage of 590 basis points. While car costs typically move in tandem with changes in commodity prices, we continue to experience a stickiness in car cost, which is contributing to margin compression. Now for further details on the consolidated results. As mentioned, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.86 was down $0.11 relative to Q3 last year. The primary negative factors were $0.04 from the impacts of metals prices, as shown on Slide 27, $0.04 from the VAT charge in Italy, $0.04 in higher interest expense resulting from rate increases excluding Uni-Select costs, and $0.02 attributed to the effects of strikes in Germany. Our operational performance was a slight negative after excluding the items noted previously, as solid gains in North America of $0.02 were offset by the decline in Specialty business of $0.03. We benefited by $0.02 due to the lower share count resulting from our share repurchase in 2022, and foreign exchange translation contributed to $0.02 of higher earnings with a stronger euro and pound sterling. On the tax rate, we applied an annual effective rate estimate of 27.0%, which is consistent with the rate in our prior guidance. I will conclude with our current thoughts on projected 2023 results. Our guidance is based on current market conditions and recent trends, and assumes scrap and precious metal prices hold near September levels. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes balance of the year rates for the euro of $1.06 and the pound sterling at $1.23, in line with current rates. We expect reported organic parts and service revenue in the range of 4.75% to 5.75%. Organic growth was 5.3% through September. We decreased the range in recognition of the estimated revenue loss associated with the German strike activity, difficult macroeconomic conditions in parts of Europe and the ongoing challenges at Specialty. North America has potential upside in Q4 related to the State Farm rollout and the UAW strike, which could push the full year result above the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.68 to $3.82, which brings in both the high and low ends of the range from our previous estimate. The midpoint is now $3.75 per share, down from the prior figure of $4 provided last call. And the primary drivers of the decrease in the midpoint are as follows : $0.06 from lost earnings related to the German strike activity, $0.05 of dilution from the Uni-Select acquisition that was not included in the prior guidance as we had not yet closed the transaction, $0.04 from the VAT charge in Italy, $0.04 from metal prices, $0.05 from operations, primarily related to Self Service and Specialty, and $0.01 from foreign exchange rates. Slide 5 shows the full bridge of the EPS guidance change. We increased our free cash flow guidance to approximately $1.0 billion from $975 million, with a 55% to 60% annual EBITDA conversion. With our year-to-date free cash flow of $911 million, we are anticipating roughly $90 million in Q4, which would be our lowest quarterly amount this year. Part of the sequential decrease is seasonal as we build inventory ahead of the winter \u2013 the busy winter season, and we also have higher interest payments scheduled for Q4 this year as the semiannual interest payment of the $1.4 billion Uni-Select bonds is due in December. Thank you for your time today. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Rick, for that financial overview. Before we open the call for questions, I want to reiterate what our global team has accomplished since starting the operational excellence journey back in 2019. In 2022, North America adjusted EBITDA margins reached their highest full year level in the company\u2019s history at 18.7%. Excluding the impact of Uni-Select, we are on track to beat that record again this year. As a reminder, North America ended 2018, which segment EBITDA margins at 12.6%. The 1 LKQ Europe Program has generated tremendous results since introducing the plan in September 2019, and the segment is on track to consistently drive full year double-digit EBITDA margins. Importantly, there is further runway for leveraging our scale and unparalleled distribution network. This is demonstrated by the strong organic revenue growth in the quarter and the first nine months of the current fiscal year and a significant year-on-year increase in segment EBITDA of $40 million after taking into account the two unusual items that cost the segment $19 million in aggregate. We\u2019ve generated free cash flow at or above $1 billion for three years in a row, and we are on target to make 2023 the fourth. We\u2019ve divested 16 businesses, representing over $625 million of revenue that did not fit our strategic objectives. We\u2019ve achieved investment-grade ratings from each of Standard & Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s and Fitch. We\u2019ve repurchased $2.4 billion of stock since initiating our first repurchase plan in October of 2018. We\u2019ve distributed $578 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders. And we\u2019ve achieved a AAA ESG rating from MSCI and built out a team to drive our global sustainability effort forward with targeted objectives. So yes, we are very LKQ proud. As we move forward towards the end of 2023, let me restate the key strategic pillars, which remain central to our culture and objectives. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn, give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And lastly, we will continue to invest in our future. As always, I want to thank the over 49,000 people who work for LKQ for all they do to advance our business each day and for driving our mission and our LKQ Delivers Values forward regardless of the challenges. Without a doubt, our people are LKQ\u2019s biggest asset. And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning guys. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Bret. Rick Galloway : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : Could you give us a little more color, I guess, on the UK asset sale, maybe some either quantified or maybe EBITDA multiple you got for that sale? Nick Zarcone : Sure, Bret. Great question as \u2013 anticipated. The definitive sale agreement includes a provision wherein we are not allowed to disclose any of the terms of the transaction. What I will tell you is that we ran a full and complete auction process that started out with dozens and dozens of potential buyers. We closed the transaction at the highest value that was \u2013 that came out of the option process. We had fully anticipated that the multiple that we would receive for GSF would be materially less than the multiple that we paid for the other businesses. And we built that into all the original analysis and that exactly proved to be the case. All things considered, we\u2019re happy to get the transaction behind us. As Rick indicated, we\u2019re going to use the proceeds to repay debt. And the other thing I would say is the multiple reflects the current M&A environment and the impact of higher interest rates. Particularly for leveraged transactions, we sold this to a PE shop over in the UK but again, it was generally in line with what our going expectations were. Maybe a little bit on the skinny side, but not materially different. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then a follow-up, I guess, the Canadian business, could you maybe talk about where you see working capital trending there? I mean, obviously, it should be a source of cash. Can you talk about maybe what their working capital investment is and how you might lever that? Rick Galloway : Yes. Thanks, Bret, for the question. I\u2019ll take that one. So one of the things that we\u2019re pretty excited about is the ability that the CAG Group or Bumper to Bumper Group has with the vendor financing program. We got about $65 million in the vendor financing program as one of the components to drive performance. It was underutilized and something that we think we can grow fairly significantly. The overall trade working capital that we inherited from the transaction, roughly, call it, $200 million that we think we can continue to enhance and benefit within the payables, similar to what we\u2019re doing over in Europe. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Craig Kennison from Baird. Your line is now open. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Craig. Craig Kennison : Hey Nick. Good morning. So in the guidance walk, you pegged the Uni-Select impact at a $0.05 headwind. I think, Rick, you said $0.04 to $0.06. I believe that last quarter, that was a $0.04 headwind projection. I know that\u2019s a small move, but it\u2019s in the wrong direction. I\u2019m just wondering if you uncovered something that wasn\u2019t as good as you hoped? Or is that just a function of rounding? Nick Zarcone : Hey Craig, I\u2019ll take that one. When we were analyzing and negotiating the transaction some nine to 10 months ago, we were working off of the Uni-Select annual budget for 2023, we had to make some estimates on our side as it relates to the quarterly phasing of how their business was going to unfold. We\u2019re now sitting here in October and we recognize that our estimates, as it relates to the seasonality and the phasing of their business, were off a bit, with kind of more of their activity hitting earlier in the year than we anticipated and a little bit less late in the year. In response, we\u2019re working hard to realize the synergies sooner rather than later, as Rick indicated. From our perspective, nothing really changes in a material manner related to the long-term economics of the transaction. And what I\u2019d also highlight for you, as Rick mentioned, is between the benefits of the FX hedge on the original purchase, some of the higher-than-expected cash on the balance sheet at closing, the transaction value actually declined by about $100 million, which helps offset some of that earnings difference from a return perspective, not necessarily from a, from an EPS perspective. Rick Galloway : And maybe I\u2019ll just add just a little bit more to that. You talked about the synergy piece. Craig, it\u2019s important to understand on the synergy piece, we\u2019ve accelerated some stuff. We\u2019ve talked about how we closed 10 facilities within the FinishMaster business. As far as the overall synergies, we\u2019re roughly 20% of our synergies have already been achieved on a run rate basis as of today. Craig Kennison : As a follow-up to that, Rick, I thought a lot of those synergies were tied to leases, which maybe three years before their expiration. So how are you able to accelerate what are essentially contractual agreements? Rick Galloway : Yes. They weren\u2019t all tied to that. There\u2019s a fair amount on the FinishMaster side that go throughout the period. So if there\u2019s something that is a little bit tighter, a little bit closer, that\u2019s the area that we were able to identify and say a pull in that opportunity and close those facilities at an earlier time. Craig Kennison : Thank you. Rick Galloway : Yep. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Stember from MKM Partners. Your line is now open. Scott Stember : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions as well. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Scott. Scott Stember : Can you talk about in Europe and Germany, you mentioned that it sounds like there was some progress in negotiations, I guess, later in the quarter. Are we trending in the right direction? Just trying to get a sense of how long this could potentially last and how far into 2024? Nick Zarcone : Are you talking about the strike in Germany? Scott Stember : Yes, sorry about that. Yes, the strike in Germany. Nick Zarcone : Yes. So look, employees or certain employees at our big distribution center in Sulzbach-Rosenberg, which fulfills all of our branches in Germany, a number of those folks belong to a union or a works council as they\u2019re called over on the other side of the pond. We don\u2019t have advanced warning as to when they decide to call a strike. It\u2019s very episodic. The issue is we\u2019re down in headcount. Not all the members go on strike, but probably we lose about 40% of our workforce when they are out in strike. And that creates significant issues in trying to move product into and out of the distribution center. But we need to replenish our branches on a daily basis. Because if the product is not out in the branch the next morning, it can\u2019t be sold. And some of the key bottlenecks are actually on the inbound movement of goods, as you can imagine, with less people to bring all that product in. The vendor delivery trucks get stacked up out in the drive, et cetera, et cetera, right? We have a phenomenal team at Stahlgruber that\u2019s doing everything possible to mitigate the issues. We are in flight in bringing in a second DC [ph online up in Bielefeld, which is in the northern part of Germany, but that\u2019s not going to come online in time to help with the strikes. The branch and corporate personnel in Bavaria, we pulled some of those folks into the distribution center to help with staffing. We\u2019re still down even after that from an overall headcount perspective, and obviously, those employees are not as productive because they\u2019re doing new things. We\u2019re trying to push more inventory out into the branches on non-strike days, but there are limits as to how much the branches can hold from a practical perspective. And we have to make educated guesses as to what product each particular branch may need in the future, which is not the same as fulfilling orders based on actual sales to [indiscernible]. As I indicated, the employees have been on strike for several days here in October, and we anticipate that\u2019s going to continue. The biggest part of it is it\u2019s not like in the U.S. where, say, Ford, GM and Chrysler are all negotiating separately with the UAW. Here, there\u2019s a group of employers, including Stahlgruber, that are all part of the same works council. And we need to get to a settlement as a group, we cannot do a one-off settlement with the union. We\u2019re hopeful we can bring this to a close yet this year. Like many unions around the globe, they\u2019ve got really big expectations. And there\u2019s a difference both in the amount of wage increases and the term of the contract. We obviously want to lock in the longer term, so we\u2019re not here next year talking about the same kinds of things. So the impacts of the strike are continuing into the fourth quarter. And we anticipate that they will continue at least through November. Rick Galloway : Scott, maybe just to throw a couple of numbers to that. In Q2, we saw about $0.02 a share. In our guidance, we essentially doubled that for Q4. So we\u2019re optimistic that it will close out in 2023 and not have an impact on 2024. But as of right now, in our guidance, we have a total of $0.06, $0.02 in Q3 and then $0.04 in Q4. Scott Stember : Okay. Got it. And then just a quick last question on the bumper to bumper business. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve mentioned this before. Can you just give us an indication of how the organic sales growth has been running just some of the industry dynamics up in Canada on the mechanical repair side? Nick Zarcone : Yes, the bumper to bumper is pretty much right on track, right on plan. So we are really pleased with that business and with the team. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve got a couple of small tuck-in acquisitions that we\u2019ve already completed and another one that will happen in Q4. So we anticipate nice growth up in Canada. Rick Galloway : To throw a number at it, Scott, high single digits is the way you should kind of think about that business right now. Scott Stember : Organically? Rick Galloway : Yes, organically. Yes. Scott Stember : Okay. Good enough. Thank you guys. Rick Galloway : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino from Barrington Research. Your line is now open. Gary Prestopino : Hey, good morning everyone. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Gary. Gary Prestopino : Rick, could you maybe go into some of the issues. I mean you mentioned pricing, but what exactly is going on for the 140 basis point decline in gross margin in Europe that you cited. You talked about something pricing in Eastern Europe was having some issues, could you maybe go in a little more detail on that? Rick Galloway : Yes. So if you think about what\u2019s going on over there with the recessionary environment and the activities going on, there is a little bit of price sensitivity. So what I was talking about in my prepared remarks is some price sensitivity in Europe that is \u2013 think of the good, better, best product brings that we offer. The customers are moving from the best to the better, better to the good, and we\u2019re seeing that come down. What we have seen and what we think the opportunity is in our overall category management. Think of things like private labeling, right? So private labeling, we have businesses not in Central and Eastern Europe that are getting in, call it, 35%, north of 35% on private labeling. And we also have businesses in Central Eastern Europe that are at single digits. Mid- to high single digits in that private labeling branding. As those customers move down to a different product offering, that\u2019s where we think we\u2019re going to be able to really drive overall profitability to move them over to a different product offering that actually helps us out. So it\u2019s just that consumer price sensitivity. The really good news, Gary, that I would tell you is our products are nondiscretionary. As we\u2019ve been saying, volume is really solid. That continues to be the case, both in Central and Eastern Europe. The team is doing a fantastic job as far as delivery performance and all of that. It\u2019s just a little bit of sensitivity on that recessionary environment that is squeezing the margins a bit that we think we\u2019re going to be able to rectify here in the next couple of quarters. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. And then versus the EPS bridge that you put in Q2 to Q3, it looks like, operationally, you were looking for a $0.05 positive in Q2. It\u2019s now slipped to $0.05 negative in \u2013 with the Q3 guidance. Is that all specialty that is making that shift? Rick Galloway : It\u2019s primarily actually self-serve. So Nick talked about some of the changes that we\u2019re making within self-serve, it\u2019s self-serve and specialty that makes up that $0.05, Gary, but it\u2019s over weighted on the self-serve side. So think of the car cost that need to come down. What Nick did and the team did is put some new leadership in, that he talked about in his prepared remarks, to drive down that overall procurement and enhance the overall margins. The good news is that early in the quarter, we actually saw negative performance, negative EBITDA. That flipped to a decent-sized profitable September as we\u2019re going into Q4. So we\u2019re seeing the trends in the right direction, but it\u2019s still that squeeze between the car cost and what the commodities have done. So think over weighted on self-serve versus what\u2019s going on in specialty. Specialty, what I talked about if you think about especially in Q4, we\u2019ve tightened up the margins. What we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve tightened up both the revenue side and the margin side as we\u2019ve gone through the year, when you think year-over-year. And we think Q4 \u2013 we believe Q4 will be pretty much on par on a margin basis versus what Q4 was last year. Gary Prestopino : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian Butler from Stifel. Your line is now open. Brian Butler : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Nick Zarcone : Good morning, Brian. Rick Galloway : Good morning, Brian. Brian Butler : Just on the first one back to Specialty there. Can you maybe break it down, how much of this is macro driven higher interest cost and buying cars, versus just tough compares from what was a stronger 2022? Nick Zarcone : Yes. It\u2019s a little bit of both, Brian, to tell you the truth. As you know, our North American and European businesses largely sell nondiscretionary parts that are used to repair vehicles, while Specialty primarily sells parts to accessorize the vehicles. As had Specialty is going to be more directly impacted by the broader macroeconomic environment, things related to economic growth, interest rates, consumer balance sheets and the like. The sale of light trucks, jeeps and SUVs has been reasonably okay, while the sale of new RV units has been very depressed, as you know. So with that, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that the sale of RV accessories and related products like hitches and other towing equipment have been much softer than the traditional SEMA product. We believe that retail sales of RV units is probably a better leading indicator for the potential demand for our RV accessories than wholesale shipments from the OEs to the dealers, because unsold units sitting on a dealer lot doesn\u2019t do anything to generate demand for the types of parts that we sell. And so with interest rates going higher and the financial health of the consumers eroding, that\u2019s why I said we don\u2019t see a near-term catalyst for a quick rebound in the RV marketplace. Now as we get into next year, we obviously have an easier set of comps because 2023 has been very soft. And so we wouldn\u2019t anticipate the same kind of negative growth in 2024 than \u2013 as compared to what we have here in 2023. Brian Butler : On the free cash flow side, working capital as year-to-date kind of $150-plus million benefit. When you look at that $25 million increase in the free cash flow outlook for the full year, can we go back to that and just \u2013 and what kind of \u2013 is that just working capital, all of that benefit? Or is there some other pieces within there that\u2019s driving that slightly higher free cash flow outlook? Rick Galloway : Yes. No, it\u2019s a great question. I mean you look at the free cash flow, you think year-over-year, when you combine three items \u2013 interest, CapEx and Uni-Select [ph] transaction costs, $250 million come down off of last year\u2019s number, where we were at roughly $1 billion, making all of that up and delivering a fantastic result. It\u2019s a little bit higher than $150 million if you think about the trade working capital. It\u2019s more like $180 million as we go into Q3. It\u2019s things like our vendor financing program that the European team does. The operational excellence initiatives span way beyond just the P&L side, they go to the balance sheet side as well. The team is doing a fantastic job driving the performance. They\u2019re up 12% versus year-end, up about $35 million on the vendor financing program, up 10% in payables. And so driving that over and over again is something that we see as a continuous improvement. So I would tell you, the performance is good, really solid performance year-over-year, and that trade working capital really is the catalyst behind driving that performance. Brian Butler : Okay. And if I can maybe slip one last one in. How much debt do you expect to repay in the fourth quarter? Rick Galloway : To repay? Brian Butler : Yes. How much debt paydown? Rick Galloway : We should have roughly about $150-ish million. About $150 million debt pay down in the fourth quarter. Brian Butler : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Bret Jordan : Hey guys. Second round here. You gave us the auto claims number year-over-year. Could you give us the total loss rate for Q3? Nick Zarcone : Yes, total losses, at least according to our best sources that we have here, Bret, was approximately 20.6% in Q3 of 2023, which was up a bit from both 2022 and 2021. So total losses were up a bit. That in part is why we think repairable claims was down 4.6%, right, because you had a few more total losses. As we\u2019ve always said, we\u2019re agnostic to the total loss rate. Because in reality, the more cars that roll through the auctions, creates more pine opportunities for our salvage operations at reasonable prices. The key, we believe, is what\u2019s powering the overall demand for products. And while repairable claims may be down a little bit, APU is going north. And APU is going north in part because the average number of parts required to repair a vehicle is at an all-time high of 15.7 parts in the third quarter. Obviously, the industry is fully recovering from our aftermarket parts availability. As we said, our fulfillment rates were back to over 93%, which is pretty close to our target. And then you\u2019ve got things like the benefit of the State Farm program, which will take a little bit of share away from the OEs as well. So our sense is that our same-day organic of 5.8% outstripped what we believe would be the net impact of all the other headwinds and tailwinds, giving us confidence that we\u2019re continuing to take share. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then one quick question. In the prepared remarks, you talked about FinishMaster having a slightly higher MSO mix. Could you give us more color on that? Is that \u2013 is pricing on FinishMaster products lower on average than your traditional paint business? Nick Zarcone : There\u2019s no doubt that the way that the accounting works and the way the contracts are \u2013 and that the margin on MSO business is less than the margins on a non-MSO. Because it\u2019s basically a service quotient to service fee, if you will, even though we have to record the full value of the product that are sold. And as I mentioned in my comments, MSO volumes were a little bit higher as a percent of the total than they\u2019ve been in the past. And that, quite frankly, that happens every time one of the MSOs buys an independent shop, right? It switches from \u2013 it switches the volumes. All in all, we\u2019re happy with the \u2013 with where we stand with the paint business. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Your line is now open. Daniel Imbro : .: Nick Zarcone : We believe absolutely. The reality is we posted up 5.8% on a same-day basis in the third quarter. Again, as I just mentioned in answering Bret\u2019s question, that\u2019s coming from better APU, it\u2019s coming from taking share from some of the smaller competitors. Our guess is that North America will probably have some similar growth in the fourth quarter as in the third quarter. On the one hand, obviously, the comps get harder, right, because last \u2013 Q4 of last year, we were starting to get back to our fulfillment rates into the low 90% range in the fourth quarter. Wherein earlier in the 2022, we\u2019re still well down in the 80s. So the comps were easier at the beginning of the year than they are going to be here at the end of the year. And on the other hand, though, we\u2019ve got the benefits associated with State Farm and some of the benefits related to the UAW strike. And there\u2019s no doubt that the UAW strike helps our North American business. On a long-term basis, we absolutely are confident in all the expectations we set, including those back in our Analyst Day in 2022. And what we think a couple of percentage points of growth, excluding inflation, is absolutely within our capability. Daniel Imbro : That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up. Rick, so you mentioned in your scripts that buybacks are part of capital deployment. But it does feel like you guys have done more M&A, whether it\u2019s a small one in Canada, you just bought Uni-Select. Can you maybe talk about like what just the strategic rationale is at buying at this point in the cycle? Could you \u2013 do you typically get better prices if we do enter a downturn? And just, I guess, how you plan on spending the $1 billion of free cash? You have $150 million of debt pay down of work to do, but what do you plan to do with the rest of it? Rick Galloway : Yes. It\u2019s good question, Daniel. Thanks for as you start thinking about the overall capital allocation strategy, that hasn\u2019t changed. So if you think about it on an ongoing basis, $1 billion, we have $300 million roughly for dividend. We obviously raised the dividend 9% based off of what the Board has approved and the solid cash performance that we have. Then we earmark about, call it, $200 million annually for tuck-in acquisitions. And then the remainder, about $500 million to do kind of what we want with it, right, whether we do share repurchases, whether we do some debt pay down. What we\u2019ve said is we\u2019d be over weighted \u2013 until we get below two times, we\u2019ll be over weighted on that remaining $500 million on debt paydown. So that\u2019s going to continue. But we constantly are looking at our opportunities, whether there is an opportunity on the share price, if there\u2019s some timing that offers us, we\u2019ll continually look at that. But what we\u2019re committed to is, within 18 months, we\u2019ll get down below that two times. And so that\u2019s something that\u2019s weighing in the back of our mind. So that\u2019s the way you should think about that capital allocation. Daniel Imbro : Great. Thanks so much. Rick Galloway : Yes. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn back the call to Nick Zarcone. Thank you. Nick Zarcone : Well, certainly, we want to thank everybody for your time and attention this morning. We know this is a busy reporting period, and we certainly appreciate spending some of your time here with LKQ. We obviously look forward to chatting with you again in February \u2013 late February of 2024 when we\u2019re going to announce our fourth quarter results, full year 2023 results. And obviously, we\u2019ll set the guidance for next year with all of you. So again, thank you for your time and attention, and we\u2019ll be talking in February. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to today's LKQ Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jordan and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions]. I\u2019m now going to hand over to Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations, LKQ Corporation. Joe, please go ahead. Joe Boutross : Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Galloway, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Justin Jude, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-K in the coming days. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. As many of you know, in late November, we announced my intention to retire as CEO effective June 30, 2024, and that the Board unanimously selected Justin as my successor following an intensive planning process that had been initiated well over a year ago. In the interim, Justin is serving as our Global Chief Operating Officer and I look forward to working with him and our segment teams to ensure the continuation of our operational excellence program that we started late in 2018. Nowhere has this program been more evident than in our Wholesale North America segment, which under Justin's direction has significantly expanded margins, improved cash flow, all while enhancing our leading market position. Time and again, Justin has proven himself as both a strong operating executive and an effective leader who definitively embodies LKQ's values. It is a pleasure having Justin on the call today in his well-deserved new role. I'm going to start by providing some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter and the full year 2023, followed by Rick who will dive into the financial details and discuss our 2024 guidance. And then, Justin, will provide some initial thoughts and commentary on our businesses, the path forward, and an update on our Uni-Select integration. Let me start with what LKQ accomplished in the last year, a year where operational excellence remained at the forefront of our efforts as we look to drive organic revenue growth, productivity, and excellent free cash flow. I am proud to say that the LKQ team delivered. Here are some of the 2023 accomplishments worth noting. LKQ delivered strong full year organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.7% on a reported basis and 5.1% on a per day basis. In February, we announced the highly synergistic Uni-Select acquisition and closed the transaction on August 1. We used our free cash flow to begin paying down debt as we strive to reduce our total leverage ratio to 2.0x. We're well on our way with net debt pay downs of over $375 million since the transaction closing, and the total leverage ratio at year-end was just 2.3x. We returned about $300 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and increased a quarterly amount by 9% in October. We also continued our share repurchase program with a $38 million outlay during the year of which $30 million was completed in fourth quarter. And finally, we sustained a positive momentum in terms of cash flow generation, with free cash flow of approximately $1 billion in 2023. This represents the fourth consecutive year at or above $1 billion, and the 2023 results reflect a solid conversion ratio of 59% of adjusted EBITDA. Now on to the quarterly results. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3.5 billion, an increase of 16.6% as compared to $3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. Parts and services organic revenue increased 2.8% on a reported basis and 3.4% on a per day basis. Foreign exchange rates increased revenue by 2.7% and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased revenue by 13.1% year-over-year, for a total parts and services revenue increase of 18.7%. Other revenue fell 16.4%, primarily due to weaker precious metal prices relative to the same period in 2022. Let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. Organic revenue for parts and services for our North America segment increased 5.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC, collision and liability related auto claims were down 7.9% year-over-year. We believe the significant outperformance is due to several factors, including an industry-wide increase in alternative part usage, or APU, which was in part driven by the continued progress of the State Farm rollout, the remaining positive impact of the UAW strikes, and lastly, LKQ continuing to take market share. The upward trend in our aftermarket volumes and the ongoing improvement in our order fill rates continued with fill rates reaching close to 95% in the fourth quarter, the highest level in 2023. As the supply chain recovered and fill rates increased, APU trended in our favor, particularly when looking at vehicles in our sweet spot. While total APU was about 36% in 2023, when looking at vehicles four to six old, it was approximately 40% and for vehicles more than seven years old, it was 51.6%. Both results represent meaningful increases over the 2022 levels. The aging car park will increase demand for the types of parts we sell into the collision repair industry. The salvage business had solid organic growth largely driven by volume. Total loss rates increased a bit in 2023 to 20.8%, but as you can see, it had no impact on our organic growth. Importantly, the increase in total loss rates is largely being driven by vehicles 10 years and older, which is a population of vehicles at the very tail end of our sweet spot. For perspective, today, the average model year of a vehicle being repaired in a collision bay is a 2017 model, with the total loss rate for that cohort of vehicles being just 18.4% in 2023. That further supports our thesis that total loss rates will not materially impact our growth. Industry experts believe the total loss rate will edge down a bit in 2024. As we have always stated, fluctuations in total loss rates are largely net neutral events for LKQ. During the quarter, we realized a slight revenue uplift from the UAW strikes, which has now leveled off and no further benefit is expected. Moving to our European segment. Europe organic revenue for parts and services in the quarter increased 3.9% on a reported basis and 5.1% on a per day basis. All the regions produced solid organic growth in the quarter with a particularly strong performance in the Benelux and Eastern European markets, as well as with our private label and salvage product lines. During the fourth quarter, our operations in Germany were again impacted by employee strikes at our large distribution center in Bavaria, while the ongoing discussions and negotiations between the works council and employers association continued. Throughout this process, our European team has worked diligently to mitigate the day-to-day impact of the strikes and their efforts have begun to offset some of the challenges that have impacted our German operations. Although the strikes continue, we have been able to temporarily add some short-term capacity to operate our business and service our customers. Additionally, to foster a resolution, we recently initiated an incremental and unique approach and proposed terms of an LKQ-only offer to the works council. We have also commuted those terms to our employees and are cautiously optimistic that we are making positive progress towards a resolution. Rick will provide you with the financial impact shortly. Now, let's move on to our Specialty segment. During the fourth quarter, Specialty reported a decrease in organic revenue of 7%, which was under our expectations. Specialty again confronted headwinds specific to RV and towing products. Within the RV space, RV wholesale shipments of new units from the OEs to the dealers ended 2023 on a positive note with an increase of 8.1% in December. This was the second consecutive month of year-over-year growth. Full year shipments, however, were down 36.5%. The general sense in the industry is that the RV headwinds have bottomed out, but we are not yet out of the woods as the dealers are still reluctant to fully restock accessories until they see the demand for new units increase. Truck accessories were also under some pressure in the quarter due to the drop in new vehicle production specific to the pickup and jeep categories, while marine and off-road product lines generated positive growth. Now to our Self Service segment. Organic revenue for parts and services for our Self Service segment decreased 5.6% in the fourth quarter. Self Service was again challenged by soft commodity pricing as seen in the other revenue decline, which impacted our expectations. The soft precious metal prices have continued into 2024 and in the short-term, we expect little relief from commodities as we have modeled accordingly. Briefly on the Red Sea crisis, as far as we can predict, there will be minimal impact on parts availability in our key segments. In Europe, our procurement team is seeing some disruption with the shipping lines having to divert their vessels via the Cape of Good Hope around South Africa increasing lead times and freight costs. The freight cost is expected to soften once the Chinese New Year four weeks from mid-January ends. As one would expect, if the crisis persists, then we will potentially witness an increase in freight cost. Our supply chain team is taking precautionary measures by adding additional orders to address the extra lead times, especially with our private label product. Lastly, on October 25 of 2023, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, we completed the divestment of GSF Car Parts formerly owned by Uni-Select. Since the GSF Car Parts business was held separately and never integrated into our business, we classified the business as discontinued operations upon acquisition. Before I turn over to Rick, who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our outlook for 2024, I am pleased to announce that on February 20, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of common stock that will be payable on March 28, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2024. Rick Galloway : Thank you, Nick, and welcome to everyone joining us today. Before I address the fourth quarter, I would like to reflect on what LKQ accomplished throughout 2023. We were optimistic about our prospects going into 2023 despite macroeconomic challenges, inflation, and declining commodity prices. With our operational excellence focus and strong balance sheet, we concentrated on the things we could control and in those areas we were very pleased with our performance. We encountered headwinds that set back the overall profitability, but we believe many of these are transitory and will be minimal in 2024. The non-discretionary nature of the majority of our business and the resiliency of our industry allows us to perform well in almost any market environment. Referring to the walk on Slide 4, I want to highlight the key year-over-year variances in our full year results. We reported diluted earnings per share of $3.51 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.83, the latter of which was $0.02 decrease relative to 2022. Our operational performance was a strong positive, delivering $0.27 year-over-year improvement with exceptional growth in North America partially offset by softness in precious metal prices and difficult market conditions impacting our Specialty and Self Service segments. Europe also contributed to the improvement with solid revenue growth and productivity benefits helping to offset the effects of the German strikes and the value-added tax matter in Italy. We benefited by $0.10 due to the lower share count resulting from our share repurchases in 2022. We experienced year-over-year headwinds from market conditions, the most notable of which were $0.19 from the impact of metal prices as shown on Slide 28, and $0.13 in higher interest expense resulting from rate increases excluding Uni-Select costs. Acquisition and divestiture activities had a negative effect including $0.04 of dilution from the Uni-Select acquisition, important to note, this result was $0.01 better than we anticipated in our Q4 guidance and $0.02 of reduced earnings related to the PGW divestiture in April 2022. Foreign exchange rates were favorable on average in 2023, which contributed to $0.02 benefit. The tax provision represented a $0.06 benefit driven mostly by favorable impacts from discrete items. We have also included a fourth quarter EPS walk on Slide 5. The main variances are similar to the full year drivers but with income taxes representing the largest variance from 2022. The 2023 provision included favorable discrete items and a slight full year effective rate reduction, while 2022 reflected a negative provision effect from increasing our full year effective rate and unfavorable discrete items. To expand on the operating performance for the quarter, I will provide additional detail on the segment results. Going to Slide 12, Wholesale North America continued its strong performance with a segment EBITDA margin of 16.3%. Q4 was the first full quarter with Uni-Select and as communicated, the transaction was dilutive to the segment margin by 220 basis points. Without Uni-Select, North American margins would have been comparable to Q4 2022 and would have delivered a record full year EBITDA margin of 19.7%. Q4 2023 benefited from some incremental sales in October, November attributed to effects of the UAW strike and we don't expect further upside in 2024. The Uni-Select integration is progressing ahead of schedule and with FinishMaster and LKQ locations merging; it's becoming increasingly difficult to determine a standalone Uni-Select impact. Therefore, we will not provide specific Uni-Select impacts on the North American results going forward, but will instead report just on synergy achievement. We expect the 2024 North American full year EBITDA margin, including Uni-Select to be around 17%. As shown on Slide 13, Europe reported segment EBITDA margin of 8.3% down 170 basis points from the prior year period. There were several unusual items which had a negative effect of 110 basis points on the results. First, the strikes at our primary distribution center in Germany continued in Q4 and we estimated the lost revenue and negative effect on the segment EBITDA margin of 50 basis points. Second, we booked a non-recurring compensation charge for $6 million, which impacted the margin by 40 basis points. Finally, we recorded a reserve for a value-added tax matter which lowered the margin by 20 basis points. The remaining margin variance is attributable to inflationary cost effects in SG&A expenses, primarily in personnel costs. Looking ahead to 2024, we project a return to a double-digit margin as we work past the strikes and the transitory effects that dropped the segment below a 10% margin in 2023. Moving to Slide 14, Specialty's EBITDA margin of 5.7% decreased 50 basis points compared to the prior year. Gross margin, which was down 290 basis points year-over-year is under pressure from increased price competition as inventory availability continues to improve for our competitors, in addition to unfavorable product mix, as the lower margin lines such as auto and marine have been less affected by revenue reductions than the RV market. I'm pleased to report our SG&A expenses were favorable by 210 basis points, mostly related to personnel and primarily coming from management restructuring efforts in the last 12 months to align the cost structure with revenue trends and lower benefits and insurance costs. 2023 was a tough year for Specialty, but by focusing on controllable costs, the team was able to mitigate some of the negative leverage effect on margin caused by the revenue decline. Going into 2024, the segment still faces challenging conditions and we expect low-single-digit organic revenue growth. However, we are optimistic about our ability to improve EBITDA margins by 10 basis points to 30 basis points through productivity. As you can see on Slide 15, Self Service profitability improved sequentially to EBITDA margins of 6.0% this quarter from a loss of 0.6% in the third quarter, an increase relative to the 5.2% reported in Q4 2022. Metals prices had a net negative effect on results of $6 million with lower precious metal prices representing a $13 million reduction in EBITDA and lag effects from sequential scrapped steel price changes driving a $7 million improvement. Other revenue decreased by 25% in total, contributing to a reduction in operating leverage of 620 basis points. As part of the actions taken earlier, in 2023, our average car cost decreased by 6% and 18% in Q4 relative to Q3 and Q2, respectively, which provided some margin relief and contributed to the year-over-year improvement. We are pleased with the return on to profitability in the fourth quarter and expect to improve our 2024 segment EBITDA in dollar terms compared to 2023. Shifting to cash flows and the balance sheet. We produced $87 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $1.0 billion. As expected, free cash flow was relatively light in the quarter as we had $96 million of interest payments, including the first payment on the U.S. bond issued in May and $125 million of capital expenditures. At $358 million of CapEx for the year, we exceeded our prior guidance by $58 million as we took advantage of our strong cash flow and liquidity position to make strategic purchases, some of which were pulled forward from our 2024 plan. For the year, the cash conversion ratio is 59% conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow, in line with our targeted range of 55% to 60%. With the future headwinds related to interest expense and capital spending requirements, we are widening our cash conversion target range to 50% to 60%. While we have opportunities to drive trade working capital lower, such as with the supply chain finance program, these opportunities are not as abundant as they were years ago when we began our operational excellence journey. The team has done terrific work to lower working capital levels over the last five years and the effects we're seeing in the strong free cash flow figures. We believe we can continue to generate free cash flow in the range of $1 billion on a recurring basis by converting earnings growth into cash flow, being efficient in our deployment of trade working capital and expanding our supply chain finance program. As of December 31, we had total debt of $4.3 billion with a total leverage ratio of 2.3x EBITDA. We paid down over $375 million in debt between the acquisition of Uni-Select at the beginning of August and year-end, a portion of which came from the sale proceeds related to the GSF business we divested in October. We remain committed to reducing our total leverage ratio to 2.0x within 18 months of the Uni-Select acquisition or more specifically during Q1 2025. Our current maturities include the \u20ac500 million senior notes due on April 1. We are working on refinancing options and expect to have a refinancing in place in the near-term. Our effective borrowing rate was 5.8% for the quarter as market rates remained relatively high in the U.S. and Europe. We have $1.2 billion in unhedged variable rate debt, so 100 basis point rise in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by $12 million. I will conclude with our thoughts on projected 2024 results as shown on Slides 6 and 7. Our guidance is based on current market condition, recent trends, and assumes scrap and precious metal prices hold near December prices. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes recent European rates with balance of the year rates for the euro of \u20ac1.09, the pound sterling at \u00a31.27, and the Canadian dollar at CAD0.74. We expect organic parts and services revenue growth between 3.5% and 5.5%. Please note that we have one to two more selling days in 2024 depending on the market with the increase coming in the second half of the year. Europe will be down a selling day in Q1 due to the timing of Easter. Our 2024 estimate includes growth associated with the expansion of aftermarket parts volume resulting from State Farm and the impact of Uni-Select, which will be included in organic parts and services revenue beginning on August 1. We are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.90 to $4.20 with a mid-point of $4.05. This is an increase of $0.22 or 6% at the mid-point relative to the 2023 actual figure. Looking at Slide 6 in the presentation, you can see how we get from the 2023 actual EPS to our 2024 guidance. Operating performance is expected to generate growth of $0.22 relative to the 2023 results, with growth coming from all four segments. We expect Europe and North America, including the Uni-Select contribution to generate more year-over-year growth than Specialty and Self Service. The transitory items in Europe noted in the last few quarters are expected to be a lesser impact in 2024 and thus will add $0.09 compared to 2023. The exchange rate benefit is nominal. Commodity prices are expected to be a headwind of $0.09 as the current precious metal prices used in the guidance are below the 2023 average. Excluding the impact of Uni-Select, interest expense is projected to be a nominal impact with a higher average rate mitigated by debt paydowns. Consistent with past practices, we have not anticipated future share repurchases beyond the call date of our guidance. We have included an effective tax rate of 26.8% in our 2024 guidance in line with the final 2023 rate. We expect to deliver approximately $1 billion of free cash flow for the year, achieving an EBITDA conversion to free cash flow in the low 50% range. There are various puts and takes in this estimate, including higher cash payments for interest and building inventory offset by improved earnings and increased payables. Capital spending is expected to be at the high end of our target range again at $350 million, which includes key investments in salvage capacity and Specialty distribution to support productivity and margin enhancement initiatives. We feel good about the projected full year cash flow estimate and the conversion ratio generating $1 billion in free cash flow provides flexibility to continue a balanced capital allocation strategy, including debt paydowns, our quarterly dividend, share repurchases, and investments in high synergy tuck-in acquisitions. In terms of quarterly phasing, we expect the earnings growth to be weighted more heavily to the back half of the year. Q1 has been affected by extreme weather conditions in certain markets and very low catalytic converter prices, which in recent weeks were running near 50% of the price in the same period of 2023. Q1 will also be affected by the timing of Easter, resulting in a lost selling day in Europe. The balance of the year will benefit from the additional selling days mentioned previously and a ramp up of Uni-Select synergies as the year progresses. Thanks for your time today. With that, I'll turn the call to Justin to discuss his vision and priorities for LKQ going forward. Justin Jude : Thank you, Rick, and good morning to everyone on the call. First, I am honored to be chosen to succeed Nick later this year as the next Chief Executive Officer of LKQ and I'm humbled to be able to lead our talented team into the future. I'd like to thank Nick for his mentorship and leadership. Our Board trusted me to lead LKQ through this next chapter, and most importantly, I'd like to thank my wife and kids for their love, patience and support because without them I wouldn't be where I am today. As I prepare to step into the CEO role in July, I am filled with enthusiasm and a deep sense of responsibility. My vision for LKQ is rooted in three fundamental principles : people, growth and operational excellence. People are the heart of LKQ. My first and foremost commitment is to each of my fellow team members across our global organization who are the backbone and essence of LKQ. LKQ's employee-focused culture, centered around communication, accountability, integrity and respect is not just a goal, it's a necessity for our collective success. Growing our business, delivering excellent service and products to our customers is a part of who we are. We will drive revenue organically by growing share of wallet with our customers and being opportunistic on tuck-in acquisitions. And lastly, operational excellence. We will continue to hone our culture of lean management throughout our operations. This will not only improve our financial metrics, but will also provide a consistent and repeatable operating rhythm where our customers will see continual improvements in our service levels. Alongside these principles, we will focus on four key priorities. First, integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, drive high levels of free cash flow, which in turn will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy and return capital back to our shareholders. And finally, invest in our future. In the short-term, the North American Wholesale team is focused on the integration of our Uni-Select acquisition and taking full advantage of the tremendous synergies that exist within our global footprint. I'm extremely proud of how the team is performing with the integration. As of today, we have integrated a total of 75 of the 151 FinishMaster locations, representing over 52% of the consolidated revenue. Corporate synergies are largely complete and on pace to slightly exceed our expectations. The overall synergy plan is on track to deliver above our previously stated targets well ahead of schedule. The buffer to buffer business in Canada completed two tuck-in acquisitions in October of 2023, representing a total of 14 locations as we convert some of that market from three step to two step. And buffer to buffer is working closely with our North American and European procurement teams to maximize additional revenue and cost synergies. In January, buffer to buffer placed their first purchase order with our Europe's private label team and we are confident these synergistic orders will increase over time, enhancing our offering and our competitiveness. Importantly, I want to again emphasize that Uni-Select was a unique opportunity that will enable us to widen the moat around our North American business and capitalize on revenue synergies, both in the paint and the hard part side that weren't there prior to this acquisition. Our North American teams are the best operators, motivators and integrators in the industry, and the results since starting our operational excellence journey in 2019 speaks for itself. I am confident of their ability to generate positive, operational, and financial returns with our Uni-Select business integration. Long-term in North America, we will continue to invest both in the recycled and remanufactured EV battery process as we are a natural fit to become the market leader in this growing space. Turning to Europe, over the last 45 days, I've spent time with our European leadership team diving into multiple aspects of their business. Andy Hamilton, our new CEO of Europe and I agree that there are many levers to pull in Europe. Our primary objective is to accelerate the integration of one LTQ Europe to fully leverage the network of our inventory, which today is still largely country specific. By linking the geographical and regional distribution network across our European footprint, we will drive higher levels of productivity, leading to improved fulfillment rates, enhanced customer service, and improved trade working capital. Achieving this objective will allow us to profitably grow and increase our market leading position. Additionally, in Europe, there is an opportunity to grow our offerings in such areas as private label, collision components, diagnostic and calibration, recycling, remanufacturing and EV aftermarket parts. We also have the ability to expand our LKQ Academy, a program that we offer to independent garages to enhance their EV knowledge base and capabilities, allowing these shops to see the changing technology as an opportunity. Lastly, I believe we have an opportunity to rationalize certain areas of our business through facility consolidation and fleet and logistics network optimization, which will allow us to create efficiencies across geographies and product groups. As we work through our ongoing integration efforts, we will continue to assess our mix of businesses and take decisive action to determine if we are the right owners of certain assets prior to integrating. In closing, I am extremely excited about driving our mission forward and expanding a lean operating model across our entire organization with a primary objective to move swiftly. LKQ has an extraordinary history and importantly, an extremely bright future. Now, let me turn it back over to Nick for his closing comments. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Justin, for your thoughtful perspective and comments, and Rick for that detailed financial overview. Our organization has once again proven to be incredibly resilient in any operating environment. Our global teams have worked with agility and urgency to continuously achieve positive results with our operational excellence strategy in establishing One LKQ, a unified and globally focused team. This success is a direct result of a shared mission amongst our over 49,000 employees, which is simply being the leading global value-added and sustainable distributor of vehicle parts and accessories by offering our customers the most comprehensive, available, and cost effective selection of parts and service solutions while building strong partnerships with our employees and the communities in which we operate. I'm confident LKQ will live that mission in 2024 and excel through this leadership transition. LKQ's future is very bright with Justin at the helm. And with that operator, we are now ready to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Daniel, the line is yours. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Hey, good morning, everybody. Congrats on the quarter. Nick Zarcone : Hey, good morning. Rick Galloway : Good morning, Daniel. Daniel Imbro : Justin, I want to start maybe on -- good morning, I want to start on the North American side. Rick, Justin, I know you guys aren't guiding to growth by segment, but obviously it's been holding in there nicely this year. Would the 3.5% and 5.5% kind of organic growth guide be a fair range for North America as well? And could you break out maybe your expectations of what you plan on seeing between pricing and then traffic growth as we head through the New Year here in North America side? Rick Galloway : Yes, sure. Thanks, Daniel. Thanks for the question. The way to think about it, I talked a little bit about it in the prepared remarks, Specialty is going to be in the low-single-digits, so that's going to be on the downside of it, whereas North America and Europe will actually be on a little bit of a higher side. When you think about both of them, it's going to be primarily driven by volumes as far as where that's going to come out for our North American operations. And then I did talk a little bit about the EBITDA percentage with Uni-Select included 17% is the number that we're guiding towards for our North American operations. Daniel Imbro : Great. And then, as a follow-up, want to touch on the balance sheet. Obviously free cash generation remains strong. I want to focus on vendor financing over in Europe. There's still room to drive that higher. Can you provide any quantification on maybe the progress you've made, Rick, over the last few years? And then, in terms of uses of cash, good to see the buyback restart here in 4Q, are you comfortable with that being a more readable part of capital allocation moving forward? Rick Galloway : Yes. I appreciate the question. You're spot on the vendor financing program, supplier financing program; we're very pleased with what we saw. We ended the year at $411 million of -- in the vendor financing program. That includes $71 million related to Uni-Select with the acquisition that we did. That's compared to $244 million that we had at the end of 2022. Obviously, there's going to be some ups and downs. We finished a little bit on the high end from what we expected, but very good usage. We'll continue to see a little bit more going into that particularly for our European, but also for our Uni-Select operations, hoping to drive a little bit of more free cash flow. But it's not going to be at those same levels. It's not going to be a 20% increase going into 2024. So I caution you to not put too much in there as far as that goes. And then on the share repurchases, we're pleased with where we are turning out on free cash flow. We hit the billion dollars that we had talked about. That's inclusive of the $30 million that we purchased in Q4 on shares. And then again, we were active in Q1, and we think that this will be a regular piece of it. Obviously, there's significant commitment that we made on the leverage ratios getting down to 2x within the first 18 months. So that's technically January or Q1 of 2025. So there'll be a significant overweighting on the debt payments throughout the year. But we will be active as we see opportunities. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Michael, please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Good morning. And Nick, I know you got one more earnings call, but you do get to leave the business better than you found it, so well done. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Michael. Michael Hoffman : So my question is back to the free cash. I think you're getting a lot of these today, probably, and there's two parts of it. When do we get back to a compounded growth rate in the cash? And then the European question, part of that is, what's the remaining gap between payables and inventory in Europe that is an opportunity to capture that would drive some of that compounding. Rick Galloway : Yes. Thanks, Michael. As far as the free cash flow goes, if you think about the last couple of years, and I talked briefly about this in the prepared remarks, we were able to drive a significant portion of some of our lower hanging fruit on trade working capital. And then in addition to that, we did have a little bit of a benefit in the last couple of years, not 2023, but prior to that, if you're looking back a little bit on CapEx as well, where we did -- we had some supply chain financing, or not supply chain financing, but supply chain issues and getting some of those materials. And so CapEx was a little bit lower. If you think back to, like, 2020, when we had a high, we only delivered -- we only had about $172 million of CapEx, whereas we had $358 million this year. So there's pretty significant catch-up, if you will, on that portion. So what I would say is we're at a normalized level, and the compounding you're talking about with EBITDA and driving overall earnings and then driving free cash flow, that's what we should start expecting as we've just now normalized that amount. As far as the opportunity in Europe goes, we think that there's still opportunity. I wouldn't put necessarily a number to it, Michael. I think we had about a 20% improvement, a little over 20% improvement in our vendor financing program in 2023, which is great. It's not going to be 20% in 2024. It's going to be lower than that, but it's still going to be positive and still going to be cash generation coming out of our trade working capital going into 2024. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then my second question, Justin alluded to the possibility of portfolio optimization and I'll get very specific. I get that self-serve was the start of the company, but at this point, do you need to own the self-serve business to be the LKQ you are today going forward? Justin Jude : So first off, I would say our self-serve team manages very well through some challenging conditions in 2023. But I'll give you an answer on my overall thoughts on portfolio management, which really hasn't changed from the company standpoint, from Nick Standpoint. Our job is always to look at whether we're the right owners of the businesses, whether it's product lines, whether it's businesses that operate in different geographies. And if they fit in our long-term operating model, if they hit our financial metrics, it's something we'll look at keeping and optimizing, and if not, we'll optimize it and look to sell it. But I would say that's just my general idea on portfolio management. Historically, self-serve has been a decent business for us too. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Kennison of Baird. Craig, the line is yours. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning, and Nick and Justin, congratulations to you both. Question -- Nick Zarcone : Thanks, Craig. Craig Kennison : Justin, I think -- Europe and some levers that you and Andy might pull, maybe you could dig into that a little more, especially on the private label side. But any other levers that you can pull to drive margin expansion. Justin Jude : Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, guy. I have spent several weeks over in Europe meeting the teams over there, the leaders of our different businesses. I'm very optimistic about our future, spent quite a bit of time with Andy Hamilton, our new CEO. Andy did run our ECP operations in the UK, which was our highest profitable and one of our highest businesses that drive private label. Some of the things that him and I have talked about that he's laser-focused on is category management. And that includes driving more private label, which will bring us better margins, really leveraging our inventory and logistics without borders. Today, we're very optimized within the countries for which we operate, but we're still independent within those countries. So we're going to continue to accelerate the One LKQ Europe to leverage that inventory, freeing up free capital. In addition, it'll give us better fulfillment rates, which will drive organic revenue and also looking at labor productivity. And so these are things that Andy's been once again laser-focused on with his team, and him and I are aligned on that pretty well. So very optimistic about the opportunities in Europe. Craig Kennison : As a follow-up, is there a way to frame your fulfillment rates in Europe and contrast them with what you can achieve in the U.S. or North America? Justin Jude : It's a lot of different product lines today, we're heavily collision focused in the U.S. and North America versus hard parts over there. We're grabbing some of, I would say, the best practices to track fulfillment rates. We have a lot of orders in our European operations that are not necessarily on the phone like they are in the U.S., so a lot of online, a lot of e-commerce with businesses. But one of the things when we look at category management and we rationalize some of the different excess product lines that we may carry, still carrying an application for what the customer is looking for, but maybe not so many different brands, that will actually allow us to drive our fulfillment rate set. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Bret, please go ahead. Bret Jordan : You talked about bumper to bumper doing some purchasing from European vendors. Could you talk about how much supply chain synergy there -- is there? How much bumper to bumper product could come from existing vendors? Nick Zarcone : Yes. We've got -- so, Bret, I'll start and then if you want to chime in, Justin. So we've identified within the $55 million some procurement synergies. It's less than a $10 million number, as far as the overall opportunities on that portion of it that we have been already active talking back and forth with our European operations in driving some of that. And it's been real small thus far as far as the opportunity goes, getting into the P&L, but it is progressing nicely. So, Justin, I don't know if you want to add anything. Justin Jude : Yes. To your point, we have started leveraging our European supply chain, bringing in some private label that we already operated on or already carried at bumper to bumper in Canada. Our next phase is looking at new product lines that today bumper to bumper does not carry. So it's not only a cost of goods to get there, but also a revenue generation and margin improvement with new brands and new product lines offering within the private label, so. Nick Zarcone : Yes. You recall that when we announced the transaction back in February 2023, one of the opportunities we saw actually related to European makes and models, because today, up in Canada, that cohort of cars represents 10% of the car park. But bumper to bumper historically has distributed almost zero product for European makes, models. And we know somebody who knows a lot about the European marketplace, and that's where the focus will be to bring in product lines to service that 10% of the market up in Canada. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then you talked about EV battery recycling, and I guess, what does that mean? Are you talking about extracting them or actually processing, like, a redwood materials? Is that North America or Europe? And is that a capital investment to get into that business? Nick Zarcone : Yes. So our primary focus right now, Bret, is on the remanufacturing of the batteries, taking a battery that's not operating at normal levels, taking out the cells that are defective, putting in new cells and getting that battery back on the road, essentially extending the life of the powertrain. We have -- as we noted last year we're talking with some third parties about recycling not where we would be operating facilities, but where we could be a partner because nobody has access to the batteries. None of the big folks trying to do the recycling really have access to the supply chain. And with our salvage operations, we are the perfect entity to help partner. So we are taking a hard look at key partnerships that could help us move forward on the recycling side. But we would not be necessarily owning and operating large recycling facilities. Operator : With that, we have no further questions on the line. So I'll hand back to Nick for any closing remarks. Nick Zarcone : Well, we certainly thank you for your time and attention this morning and for a productive call, a good set of questions. Just a couple of key dates for everyone to keep in the back of their mind. First, our first quarter call is going to be on Tuesday -- Tuesday, April 23. Normally, we host our calls on Thursday, but this year, that week in April is an overlap with our Annual Leadership Conference in North America, which begins on Thursday, the 25th. So Q1 reporting will be on Tuesday, April 23. Second, we'd like everyone to mark their calendars for our 2024 Investor Day, and that's going to take place on September 10 and will be held at our North American headquarters down in Nashville, Tennessee, so April 23 and September 10. And with that, I'd like to thank everybody on the call for your time and attention. And as always, I extend and my sincere thanks to the 49,000 strong LKQers who make it happen every day. Take care, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning everyone. My name is, Angela, and welcome to the LKQ Corporation First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I'll be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations for LKQ. Joe, please go ahead. Joe Boutross : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Galloway, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Justin Jude, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the coming days. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone. Nick Zarcone : Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody listening to our earnings call for the first quarter of 2024. I will provide a few introductory remarks. Justin will then provide some highlights to our Q1 segment activities. Rick will provide a review of the financial details of the quarter and our guidance for the year before I have a few closing remarks. I'm turning 66 in a few days and as reported in late November, I will be retiring as CEO of LKQ on June 30th. With that, this will be my 38th and final quarterly earnings call with all of you. It has been an absolute honor and privilege to serve LKQ and to interface with the investment community since joining the company in early 2015. I am incredibly proud of the organization, my team and all we've achieved over the years. We are very different company today than the one I joined almost 10 years ago, one that is focused on operational excellence, balanced capital allocation, improved returns on capital and the development of our most important asset, our people. The first quarter of 2024 proved to be a difficult environment for our business and our results came in below expectations. While we did a reasonable job of managing the items under our control, we experienced soft overall market conditions largely due to incredibly mild winter weather in North America, which reduced demand for collision parts and the continued soft demand for our specialty products. These market factors created pressure on revenue and overall operating leverage. We have already made adjustments to our cost structure in light of the current levels of demand. Related to Europe and our business in Germany, there has been no material progress with our union negotiations in Germany. To help insulate our customers in that market, we have increased our temporary workforce to largely mitigate the revenue impact with the risk of ongoing strikes, and we've opened a second, albeit a much smaller distribution facility in Bielefeld, Germany, which is outside of Bavaria and not impacted by the union activity. Overall, we remain optimistic about the remainder of the year. Now on to the quarterly results. Revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $3.7 billion an increase of 10.6% compared to the $3.3 billion for the first quarter of 2023. For the first quarter of this year, parts and services organic revenue decreased 0.3% on a reported basis, but increased 0.5% on a per day basis. Foreign exchange rates increased revenue by 0.8% and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased revenue by 11.6% year-over-year for a total parts and services revenue increase of 12.1%. Other revenue for the first quarter of 2024 fell 14.6% primarily due to weaker precious metal prices relative to the same period in 2023. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2024 was $0.59 compared to $1.01 for the same period of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.82 for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $1.04 for the same period of 2023. Lastly, on April 22nd, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 a share of common stock payable on May 30, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 16, 2024. And now let me turn the call over to Justin. Justin Jude : Thank you, Nick, and welcome, everyone, to the call. As Nick mentioned, we are not pleased with the results delivered in the first quarter. However, I do think the team is focused and on the right track to confront some of the anomalies we faced, and I'll detail some of those action plans on this call. During our February call, Rick discussed our guidance for the year and indicated that we expected a softness in Q1 and our full year guidance was back end loaded. Rick's comment was correct as we did experience a soft Q1, but it was beyond what we and the overall markets in which we operate anticipated. That said, we are a continuous improvement company and we know how to drive improved operational and financial performance across our entire global footprint. While we got off to a slower than expected start for the year, our team has 3 more quarters to recover the shortfall, and we are confident we have actions in place to achieve the previously communicated EPS guidance. Rick will cover more of these in his prepared remarks. Now for a few high-level segment comments. In Wholesale North America, organic revenue decreased 3.3% due to a few key factors. First, we are coming off a strong comp of 14.4% growth in Q1 of last year. Second, there was an 8% decline in repairable claims. While this decline was largely driven by the extremely mild winter weather that Nick had mentioned, as the U.S. experienced the 5th warmest quarter on record, there were several other dynamics such as abnormal changes in auto insurance rates and used car pricing that we believe also had a negative impact. Finally, we experienced some challenges with aftermarket inventory entering the East Coast ports due to the ongoing Panama Canal disruption. We have yet to witness any disruption from the Baltimore tragedy, but we are closely monitoring this situation. Offsetting some of the aftermarket inventory delays, the salvage business posted positive growth in the quarter. As the North American team faced the soft demand, John Meyne and his team immediately shifted their focus to accelerating the integration of FinishMaster. This swift action resulted in the consolidation of 65 branches in Q1, bringing the total to 99, which represents two-thirds of the acquired locations. We initially communicated the rationalization of the FinishMaster locations that would take us 3 years to reach this synergy level, and I'm impressed the team was able to accomplish this within the first 8 months following the acquisition closing. Today, 100% of FinishMaster sales and operations have been fully integrated. And through this process, the team uncovered additional synergies allowing us to increase the previously disclosed estimate amount from $55 million to $65 million. This effort caused some short term strain on the team slightly impacting margins, but it was the right thing to do long-term. And we continue to make strides with our Bumper to Bumper business in Canada by leveraging the European procurement size and scale. I want to again emphasize that Uni-Select was a unique opportunity that will enable us to widen the mode around our North American business and capitalize on revenue synergies that exist with paint and hard parts. I am confident and committed to this transaction generating positive financial metrics for all stakeholders. In Europe, organic revenue increased 2.7% on a reported basis and 4.4% on a per day basis, the best across our operating segments. Rick will cover the EBITDA results in his remarks, but let me cover several actions taking place to drive improved performance. I have made 4 different trips to our European operations in the first quarter to meet with the broader leadership team and look for improvement opportunities. I am pleased to see how focused the team is to drive integration and improve performance, all with a goal of enhancing our margins. Andy Hamilton and his team have deployed new detailed tracking tools that are actively being reviewed. These tools include pricing actions, productivity initiatives, a restructuring plan focused on taking costs out of the business, portfolio divestments and implementing a new technology within our distribution centers to lower the total cost of delivery to our customers. In Germany, we expanded our distribution capacity by opening a second highly automated regional distribution center, which will reduce the strain on our primary distribution center in Bavaria where the strikes have been occurring. Specific to divestitures and after careful and thorough analysis of our European business model, market trends and the overall economic environment, we made the strategic decision to divest our operations in Slovenia to a long-term value partner of LKQ. That sale closed last week. Additionally, we entered into an agreement to divest our operations in Bosnia and we expect to complete that sale in Q3 subject to the receipt of regulatory approval. We will continue to assess our business and our European market mix to determine if we are the best operator and whether we should fix or exit certain underperforming markets. Given the small size of these divestitures, we are not disclosing the terms of these two transactions. One of the biggest projects we plan to update on a quarterly basis is our European SKU rationalization program. Today, little product commonality exists across the entire European platform which prevents us from maximizing the leverage of our pan European footprint. This project will reduce the total number of SKUs, reduce our complexity, simplify the offerings to our customers and drive several benefits which include improved fulfillment rates, improved gross margins, reduced inventory levels and a decrease of our cost to serve our customers. When Andy kicked this project off in early Q1, we had over 900,000 SKUs across our European operations with less than a 7% overlap. Based on the first phase of this project, we believe we can achieve a 35% reduction in overall SKUs over the next 2 to 3 years. We look forward to Andy providing a deeper dive into this program on our September 10th Investor Day this year. Now turning to specialty. Their organic revenue decreased 1.4% in the quarter, tracking closely to plan and showing improvements month to month within the quarter. Certain product categories witnessed positive year-over-year growth. Automotive products, which includes truck and off road parts and accessories, increased 2.5% despite pickup truck and Jeep sales being down 5.6% and 11.4% respectively. Also, marine posted growth in the quarter. RV-related products decreased 8.5%, the smallest revenue decrease when compared to the 2023 quarterly growth rates. Our specialty team has focused their efforts on targeting margin actions relating to price and cost controls, some of which we saw in the quarter with year-over-year improvements in SG&A. Turning to self-serve, they had an organic revenue decrease of 10.5% in the quarter, primarily driven by commodities and inclement weather in key markets, but margin performance exceeded our expectations. On the corporate development front, during the quarter we closed on 2 tuck-in acquisitions including a heavy duty truck parts supplier and an aftermarket parts distributor in Belgium. We also made an equity investment in a startup recycler of lithium ion EV batteries. Now, let me turn it over to Rick for a detailed overview of our financials. Rick Galloway : Thank you, Justin, and welcome to everyone joining us today. We released our full year guidance in February. We expected Q1 earnings to be challenged by the impact of weather conditions in January, very low catalytic converter prices and year-over-year decrease in selling days due to the timing of Easter. The actual results reflect lower than forecasted revenue mostly due to a reduction in North America aftermarket product volumes, which were predominantly related to a significant decrease in the number of repairable claims. On a consolidated basis, gross margin fell short of target as pricing did not fully cover input cost increases. Overhead expense actions were taken and others are currently in process, but the benefits will be seen in the balance of the year rather than Q1. Despite the Q1 results, we remain committed to our full year earnings guidance. We have 9 months to make up the shortfall and the core strength of the business are still there. We are digging deep on the operational excellence principles that drove our growth and margin expansion over the last 5 years and are taking decisive actions. As Justin described, each of the segment teams have detailed action plans in place to deliver the full year numbers. Turning now to the first quarter consolidated results. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.82 were $0.22 lower than the prior year figure. Operating results were the largest individual factor with a $0.12 reduction, mostly related to North America. This figure includes the anticipated Uni-Select headwind as the integration efforts were ongoing. We expect the Uni-Select impact to flip to accretion going forward in 2024 as the synergies Justin mentioned are realized. Movements in commodity prices, primarily precious metals contributed a $0.06 year-over-year decrease. Other items including investment performance and taxes drove a 4% decrease. Now for segment results. Going to Slide 9. North America posted segment EBITDA margin of 16.3%, a 420 basis point decrease relative to last year. During the last call, we projected the full year margin would be around 17% for the full year impact of the Uni-Select dilution. The reported margin was below the full year expectation due to leverage impact from the lower revenue in Q1. Relative to the prior year, in addition to the communicated anticipated Uni-Select dilution effect on gross margin, salvage margins were down reflecting unfavorable revenue and vehicle cost trends compared to the prior year period and lower catalytic converter prices in Q1 2024. Overhead expenses partially offset the gross margin reduction with lower costs for freight, charitable contributions and incentive compensation. Q1 2023 also included a nonrecurring benefit from an eminent domain settlement that created a year-over-year negative variance. North America is executing action plans to recover the profitability miss in Q1 and we expect the full year EBITDA margin to be around 17%. Looking at Slide 10, Europe reported a segment EBITDA margin of 8.7%, down 100 basis points from last year. Gross margin excluding restructuring costs improved by 60 basis points, but was offset by higher overhead costs including personnel costs tied to wage inflation in markets such as Germany, the UK and the Benelux region. While we have grown gross margin, we have not covered the overhead cost increases and we have work to do on pricing and productivity to mitigate the cost inflation. We still expect to achieve double-digit margins in Europe for the full year. Moving to Slide 11. Specialty's EBITDA margin of 6.4% declined 150 basis points compared to the prior year driven by a 170 basis point decrease in gross margin. Competitive pricing pressure remains a challenge for the business and we are evaluating options and implementing changes to improve our net pricing. We believe the full year Specialty EBITDA margin will be flat to a slight increase as we work through the lingering gross margin pressures. As you can see on Slide 12, self-service generated an 11.7% EBITDA margin in Q1 2024 compared to 13.2% last year. In dollar terms, segment EBITDA decreased by $6 million. The impact from commodities represented a $16 million headwind. However, the efforts to manage vehicle costs helped mitigate a portion of the commodities impact and overhead cost controls produced a year-over-year benefit. We have not seen double-digit segment EBITDA margin in percentage or dollar terms since Q1 2023. So we are pleased to reach this level again this past quarter. We implemented a global restructuring program in the first quarter focused on enhancing profitability. The largest portion of the activity will come from the European segment. And as Justin mentioned, will include exiting certain businesses or markets which do not align to our strategic objectives. Initially, this includes exiting businesses in Slovenia and Bosnia, which are relatively small with under $40 million in combined annual revenue and evaluations of other markets are ongoing. We recorded $27 million in charges in the quarter including $17 million in asset impairments and $8 million in inventory write downs. Other charges are expected in future periods for severance, lease termination costs and other shutdown related expenses. Shifting to cash flows and the balance sheet. We produced $187 million of free cash flow during the quarter and we remain on track for a full year estimate of approximately $1 billion. As of March 31, we had a total debt of $4.3 billion with a total leverage ratio of 2.3x EBITDA and we remain committed to reducing our total leverage ratio below 2.0x. In March, we successfully completed a EUR750 million bond offering with a 7-year maturity and a fixed 4.125% interest rate. The offering was completed to pay off the existing EUR500 million bonds that were scheduled to mature on April 1, 2024. We upsized the offering by EUR250 million in response to very strong demand from fixed income investors reflecting LKQ's strong credit profile and solid cash flows. The additional proceeds were utilized to pay down a portion of our euro revolver debt. The larger offering allows us to lock in capital at an attractive rate for an extended period and diversify our maturity profile. The bonds are publicly tradable and listed on NASDAQ. We do not have significant debt maturity until January 2026. Our effective borrowing rate was 6.0% for the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points relative to Q4 2023. We have $1.7 billion in variable rate debt of which $700 million has been fixed with interest rate swaps at 4.6% and 4.2% over the next 1 to 2 years respectively. In the first quarter, we repurchased roughly $6 million shares for $30 million and paid a quarterly dividend totaling $81 million further validating that as we reduce our debt levels, we are migrating to a more balanced capital allocation strategy. I will conclude with our current thoughts on projected 2024 results. Our guidance is based on current market conditions and recent trends and assumes that scrap and precious metal prices hold near March prices and the Ukraine/Russia conflict continues without further escalation or major additional impact on the European economy and miles driven. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes rates in line with the first quarter. The global tax rate remains unchanged at 26.8%. Our full year guidance metrics on Slide 4 remain mostly unchanged from the Q4 earnings call. We expect reported organic parts and service revenue in the range of 2.5% to 4.5% which is a 100 basis point decrease in the range. The softness in Q1 organic growth drove the decision to lower the full year range. We believe that mild winter weather conditions were a major contributing factor to the revenue softness and will have some carryover effects into Q2, but otherwise will be a temporary headwind relative to repairable claims. However, if repairable claims in North America do not rebound to a more normalized level, we would expect to be closer to the low-end of the full year range. We are closely monitoring monthly claims data and the team is ready to take decisive cost actions if claims remain depressed. We still expect adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.90 to $4.20 with the revenue volatility there is heightened risk to the profitability estimate. But we are confident in the action plans being implemented in all segments to address controllable factors such as our cost structure to keep us inside the previously issued range. The free cash flow expectation of $1 billion, 50% to 60% annual EBITDA conversion remain in place. Improved profitability over the balance of the year and diligent balance sheet management should support achievement of the full year target. Thanks for your time this morning. But before I turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments, on behalf of our LKQ team globally, I'd like to thank Nick for his leadership, vision and integrity during his tenure as our CEO. Nick, you left a tremendous mark on LKQ and have positioned us well for the next chapter of our evolution. We wish you and the growing Zarcone family all the best. Nick Zarcone : Thanks, Rick, for those very kind comments. When I took the seat as CEO in 2017, I believed it was my responsibility to be the primary advocate for our greatest asset, our people, and to place them at the center of LKQ's mission. I am incredibly thankful to all my past and current colleagues who served each other in pursuit of being an employee focused organization. Collectively, we made great progress over the years, which carry forward in the first quarter, when we were awarded Mental Health America's Bell Seal for workplace mental health at the gold level. And we were again selected as a 5-star employer by Workbuzz for our U.S., Indian, Mexican and Canadian businesses. It is with tremendous pride and humility that I depart knowing that the entrepreneurial culture that was established in 1998 when the company was founded lives on today and that every day our 49,000 global employees never lose sight of the passion needed to serve our customers and our communities. They are committed to not only grow the company, but themselves as individuals. The gratitude I have from my fellow employees is immeasurable and I cannot thank them enough for creating an incredible journey for me. And with that operator, we are now ready to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have the first question from Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig Kennison : Nick, all the best to you. It's been a pleasure working with you. My questions go to the comments around insurance prices. I'm just curious if you could walk through how higher and really significantly higher insurance prices impact your business overall? Justin Jude : Yes. And just talking to, this is Justin Craig by the way. And talking to different folks in the industry, when we saw the insurance increasing 20% to 22% year-over-year, we saw deductibles increasing and so in some cases it caused folks not to necessarily repair their car. We still think the majority of our issue that we saw in Q1 from repairable claims was weather, but there's a lot of other commentary that we heard from other folks such as used car pricing, which saw huge decreases and huge increases in insurance rates. So we still think the primary driver for the repairable claims being down is weather. But when anything when we see huge swings like that with used car pricing or once again insurance rates, it has some effect on us. Operator : The next question is from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Could you maybe just unpack a little bit more on this decline in the gross margin in North America? I know Rick went through a couple of things there, couldn't write them down quickly enough, but some of this was Uni-Select, but what were some of the other factors there that impacted that margin to so much to go down close to 500 basis points or over 500 basis points? Rick Galloway : Yes, Gary, fair question. So when we talked about it in the closing of Q4 for the guidance for this year, we said we'd be around 17% for the year with the dilution on Uni-Select. The product offering that we have for the various products that we sell for Uni-Select, the paint products and the hard part side of the business makes a different margin profile including the base business that we had before makes a similar margin as far as that paint side of the business goes. So with the increase in revenues that's one component. We thought we'd be down around 17% for the year. We still think we'll be at around 17% for the year. The major contributing factor for being below 17% for Q1 is primarily related to leverage. With the volume decline that we saw, significant volume on the repairable claims, we said about 8% on repairable claims and our overall volume is down a little over 3%. That's mostly a leverage component. And as we said, the team has really put some strong efforts in to work on the integration consolidation of various Uni-Select integrations, 65 different facilities that we consolidated. So some of that extra cost, little duplicate cost that will go away as we go into the rest of the year. And that's where we have that confidence of bouncing back and getting back to that 17% number that we've been talking about. Gary Prestopino : Yes. But I was asking about the gross margin, Rick. Is that I understand you were talking about the same margin. So No, I just the gross margin had a pretty big decline. So I just want to unpack that a little bit more. Rick Galloway : Yes, most of that is mix. The other component that we have that we've been talking about for about 12 months, maybe 18 months is the salvage margin. So, what we talked about was there would be this squeeze in the salvage margin. So, as we thought about where we were at last year, which is about 20.5% of EBITDA, most of that gross margin piece that we see on the decline is that salvage margin squeeze. And so, what we don't do is we don't talk about it being revenue versus the cost side because everything is so unique in that industry. So we've been seeing that squeeze. It started happening in Q3 of last year and it continued in Q4 and then again in Q1 as expected. Those items are as expected what we've been kind of communicating externally to everyone. Operator : The next question is from Scott Stember with Roth MKM. Scott Stember : Nick, I echo what was said before. It was great working with you and wish you nothing but the best of luck. Nick Zarcone : Thanks, Scott. Scott Stember : Can we talk about Europe for a second? How did the individual regions perform? Just trying to get a sense if there was any regional weakness or if anything stood out on the positive side. Rick Galloway : So let me just go high level and then I'll turn it over to you, Justin. I know you've been spending a lot of time out there. So, Scott, appreciate the question. If you think year-over-year, the biggest impact that we had on overall EBITDA margins is really the inflationary impact of wages. So that happened throughout the year, but primarily starting in Q2. So it'll sort of calendarize as we start getting into Q2. There's roughly 200 basis points down that you have on overall wage inflationary increase. What the team has been able to do was improve on pricing and productivity initiatives to call back roughly half of that. And so, we're on a trajectory that we're pretty pleased with. Of course, we'd always like to have a little bit more, but the overall margins that we had, the 8.7% in Q1, reflects that really low year-over-year impact on the wage increases. And Justin, I don't know if you want to talk a little bit more about the various different regions. Justin Jude : Yes. And Scott, like some of the markets such as the Benelux area or even in Germany, we're seeing mid teen increases in labor rates and it's a market issue. That happens immediately. The team has been actively working on pushing price out, but we're very also conscious to make sure we don't impact the market and start to lose market share. And so we'll continue to push pricing through Q2 to cover that up. We do typically pass it on. We are a humble distributor as you may have heard Nick say before, but we just saw immediate increases in labor rates and it's just taken us some time to pass those prices through to cover that. Nick Zarcone : And on the revenue side, Scott, all of our regions showed good organic growth, positive organic growth in the quarter, which is terrific. Particular bright spots included actually Central and Eastern Europe, where we saw some good growth. Our private label product saw excellent growth during the quarter. And all the other regions were in and around that 4% on a same day basis plus or minus a little bit. So again, it was good consistent performance across the platform. Scott Stember : Yes. And just one final follow-up. I know you guys are not going to be breaking out, Uni-Select going forward within wholesale. But just trying to get a sense of how the mechanical repair side of the business trend, just trying to get a sense of the market, how things hold them up and at least internally are sales growing? Nick Zarcone : You're talking about the bumper to bumper business that we have up in Canada, Scott? Scott Stember : Yes. Yes, correct. Nick Zarcone : Yes. So the progress on bumper to bumper has been very positive. There's been a few tuck-in acquisitions that we've worked on taken from 3 steps to 2 steps. We're very pleased with what the team has done on the integration side of that business as well. And we're starting to see some of the opportunity that we're actually working together, right, between the hard part side of the business and how we can work a little bit better together. We've talked about it before that that business is Canada is really the only place that we do everything that LKQ has the power of doing and we're starting to see that power of LKQ up in Canada. So, it's been good progress. Justin, I don't know if you want to expound a little bit on bumper to bumper as well? Justin Jude : Yes. No, I mean obviously we've done some tuck in acquisitions. We've gotten those integrated pretty well. The team is doing well on getting into the LKQ family. I would say overall in North America, the mechanical is up. So we're only in aftermarket hard parts in Canada with bumper to bumper, but if you look at the major mechanical that we had through our used and our remanufactured in the U.S. and in Canada. We saw an increase in VMT and VMT typically relates to more maintenance and repairs on the mechanical side. So we saw an increase in our engines, transmissions both on the used and the reman side. So overall, the business on the major mechanical and overall mechanical is doing well in North America. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have the next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : On the North American business, I guess to take a little deeper dive, I think you call out weather, but I guess historically, I think 2017 was a warmer winter and I don't recall as much impact. So could you maybe bucket the negative from the Panama Canal issue, maybe the positive from State Farm having gotten into the space year-over-year? And then if you could give us any color on alternative parts penetration, is there any negative shift there? Justin Jude : Yes. Once again, overall, I mean, from the stats that we can see externally, we think it's mostly contributed to weather. I'm not sure I don't have the facts in front of me from 2017. Other things that we hear that caused some of the repairable claims being down, I mentioned such as skyrocketing insurance rates, plunges in used car pricing. We did see an uptick in ATU driven by length, I think a lot primarily by State Farm. Anytime when the carriers are looking to save money, they're going after recycled parts or aftermarket parts. And so on a year-over-year basis, Q1-to-Q1, we did see an uptick of roughly 200, I can't remember the exact number, but 260 bps improvement in APU. So market share gained on the APU side. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then your comment about a 2017 around 17% full year for North America. Is that run rate of 2017 or getting the full year to 2017 and sort of catching up from the miss in Q1 and being above that at some point in the year? Rick Galloway : Yes, Brett. We expect to be 17% for the year, not a run rate. So we'll catch up that we believe we'll catch that up and be around that 17% that we talked about 60 days ago or so. Operator : The next question is from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. This is [indiscernible] on for Ryan Brinkman. Thanks for taking our question and best wishes for your retirement, Nick. Could you just give us a sense of the underlying drivers of the 2024 organic parts and services revenue growth guide in terms of contribution from volume versus pricing? And any color on how these assumptions have changed versus the prior guide earlier this year? Thanks and I have a follow-up. Nick Zarcone : Yes. So I'll take a stab at that. So overall, we did lower the organic guidance due to the revenue miss that we had in Q1 related to the repairable claims. We're pleased with where the growth was in our European operations. On an organic per day basis, we're over 4% on growth. So, we're very pleased with where we're at on that. Most of the growth that we have between the 2.5% to 4.5% is the new kind of line that we put in the sand from this guide. We expect most of that to be a volume piece. There'll be minimal pricing impact, but there'll be some pricing impact, but it'll probably be overweighted on the volume piece. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. That's very helpful. And just as a follow-up to Bret's question, just wanted to get a sense of how you are thinking about the impact from unfavorable cop up dynamics over the next couple of years as fewer vehicles fall in the 40 year old 4- to 6-year old sweet spot as we anniversary the pandemic and ship started in new vehicle sales form? Justin Jude : You said unfavorable I didn't catch the word after unfavorable mid midway through your question. Unidentified Analyst : Just on the car parc dynamics, like, you know, we have fewer 4- to 6-year old vehicles in that sweet spot for LKQ. So just wondering how we should think about the impact from a volume perspective there? Justin Jude : I mean, right now, we're seeing the car part growing in North America. We're seeing that it growing in an aging, all leading to great improvements and the need for alternative parts utilization whether that's mechanical or collision, whether that's used or remanufactured. So we see great trends in the car park for North America. Nick Zarcone : And just to be clear, our sweet spot on the closing side, we've always indicated is kind of 3 to 10 years. After 10 years, people tend not to get their cars repaired just because the overall value of the car and sometimes people lop off their collision coverage. But the parc inside that 3- to 10-year age bracket is still very strong. What we are seeing is on total losses that is shifting towards very old cars, cars north of 10 years old, which generally would end up in the collision base anyways. So we think the dynamics of the car park are trending just fine for our collision base business. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Just a follow-up on that last topic. I guess, as your internal math as the class of '21, class of 2020, the pandemic, new vehicle sales impact starts to swing into that 3- to 10-year old sweet spot. And have you done the math here over the next couple organic growth? Rick Galloway : No, we don't see that part as a headwind for organic growth. I mean the complexity of the vehicles, the value of the parts and the number of parts work to offset some of that, Bret. So we don't see that as a negative trend for us at all going further out. Justin Jude : And Brett, I would say being in the industry for 25 years, 10 years ago insurance carriers would not typically ride aftermarket or alternative parts in the first 0 to 3 years. That has changed quite a bit in the last 10 years where we can get a product pulled up in aftermarket world relatively quickly, 6 to 9 months, and we see nearly all carriers riding current model year for aftermarket or recycled to try to drive that APU. So we don't see that as an impact to us. Bret Jordan : Okay. And I guess since I got back in line, I get my 2 questions. On European SKU rationalization, I think you're talking about taking 35% or reducing your overlap by 35%. What's what do you see that impact being to margin in that? I guess, more products from fewer suppliers. How do you see maybe the bucket, how many basis points you think you can get out of that initiative? Justin Jude : Yes. We haven't quantified the overall margin improvement. We know it's there. We haven't publicized it, I should say. In that, I would say when that 35% reduction, that's in lieu of us actually adding more private label. So we're going to be adding more SKUs to the mix to get more private label as Nick talked about. That is growing. We're expanding that in other countries and we still plan on reducing the net number of SKUs and with private label that typically comes at the higher margins. But the other comment you made it would be less suppliers which would create some operational efficiencies from an SG&A standpoint in the warehouses and the distribution centers as well as some margin lift with fewer suppliers. Rick Galloway : And Bret, I mean this is kind of the catalyst, one of the bigger projects that we've got over in Europe. This is one of the things that will help us significantly when we think about logistics without borders. So as far as the opportunity here, we think the opportunity one of the reasons we're highlighting it is we think the opportunity going forward over the next couple of years, this is a really major contributing factor for us that we'll talk about a little bit more in September 10th when we do our Investor Day. Andy will kind of lay it out in a little bit more detail on there. Operator : Thank you. As a reminder, everyone, it appears that we have no further questions. So I will hand back over to the management team for closing. Justin Jude : Yes. Operator, this is Justin. Just before Nick closes us out, I want to give, I guess, the investors and really all of our employees that I feel super excited about the future of LKQ. I mean, if you look at the segments for which we operate in such as North America, as I mentioned earlier, the car parc is growing, it's aging, all great things that lead to alternative parts utilization, whether that's in the collision world or in a mechanical world. We've seen inflationary cost pressure on the insurance carriers. Carriers are all trying to drive more alternative parts utilization to combat some of the losses. We see the number of parts per estimate increasing and will continue to increase. We see part pricing increasing and continue to increase. The complexity of vehicles really leads to our services business, which allows us to do things like technical repairs or calibration. We're also very excited about the Uni-Select acquisition that's going to bring us tremendous synergies. And if you jump over to Europe, it's a core segment for LKQ. We have a great management team over there, we're the market leader today with the best margins, that market is still highly fragmented which leads to an opportunity for further consolidation. The team has a clear roadmap on accelerating margin enhancement with extending the, and accelerating the integration a lot of what Rick talked about with the SKU rationalization will lead towards that. And then we're getting the Bumper to Bumper benefits on the procurement side because of scale and size that we have with our European procurement teams. And then you know then jumping down to specialty, I mean we've got the strongest leading position in that space, we're the number one leader in the distribution of RV and SEMA-related products. We've got a great management team that can manage really through all cycles and we've seen that. And so and I think looking at specialty for the month for the quarter even though we were still negative, we saw month to month as I mentioned improvements and March was actually the first month where we saw an increase year over year in demand and an increase year over year in sales. And so just in closing, I just want to reiterate that we have the market leading positions in nearly everything we do. We have long-term great trends that operate in our favor, so truly excited about the future. And with that, Nick, I'll turn it back over to you. Nick Zarcone : Thanks, Justin, and thank you to everybody on the call for spending time with us here this morning to review our first quarter results. We will be back together, at least Justin, Rick and Joe will be back together with all of you on July 25th to discuss our second quarter results. And again, I'd like everyone to put Tuesday, September 10th on your calendars for the Investor Day that will be held down in Nashville. So thank you for your time, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you, Nick. This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning everyone. Welcome to LKQ Corporation Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kiki [ph] and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Joe Boutross, to begin. Joe, please go ahead. Joe Boutross : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to LKQ's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. With us today are Justin Jude, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rick Galloway, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the coming days. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Justin Jude. Justin Jude : Thank you, Joe and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I am deeply honored and excited to be able to speak with you today as the CEO of LKQ, a company where I've spent the last 20 years working with dedicated colleagues to build a strong and vital business. Before diving into the results for the quarter, I want to start by laying out my overarching priorities for our company and the plans we are executing to enhance performance and drive value for LKQ shareholders. LKQ is a strong company with market-leading businesses. We have been successful by leaning into our operational excellence strategy with a focus on profitable revenue growth, margin enhancement and cash flow generation. Under my leadership, we will prioritize these strategic pillars which are an integral part of LKQ's culture. However, this doesn't mean we'll follow the exact same playbook. I expect my team to challenge the status quo, to be innovative, to set goals and communicate them so we hold each other accountable and to learn from mistakes. Rick and I have years of experience operating successful businesses, of which 4, we're together running our North American wholesale segment. We will work together with our global team to run an efficient organization, one that is focused on growing market share while driving productivity and actively managing the cost structure. In terms of capital allocation, our guiding principle is to direct our resources to the most value-enhancing opportunities. From our vantage point today, share repurchases will be a priority and a means of driving shareholder value. As you can see from our repurchase activity in the second quarter, we believe our shares are trading below their intrinsic value and repurchases represent our best use of funds. We see attractive return metrics in our shares and through our capital allocation priorities, you should expect to see ongoing programmatic share repurchasing activity. We have paused any large-scale acquisitions and raised the hurdle rate for improving synergistic tuck-in transactions. In fact, we have walked away from deals in recent months because the returns on investment did not meet our new criteria. Rationalizing the asset base has been a key element of our strategic framework. We have routinely examined our assets from individual locations up to lines of business to determine if the assets align with our future plans. As part of this process, we identified certain lines of business that did not fit our strategic objectives and we took action, divesting 14 businesses in the last 5 years which represented over $600 million in low margin revenue. These transactions were done judiciously and following a disciplined process to achieve a favorable outcome and we will continue to carefully evaluate whether we are the right owners for any of our businesses while we focus on our core strengths. Finally, cash flow generation will remain central to our business. Delivering strong cash flow allows us to invest in our future through capital projects and to return value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining a manageable debt level and our investment-grade rating. I'll now provide some comments on our results and then Rick will discuss our financials and guidance. Our second quarter results did not meet expectations on the top line. In the first quarter, we faced revenue headwinds from a decrease in repairable claims in North America which was influenced by mild and dry winter weather conditions. In our Q1 commentary, we noted there would be a carryover effect in the second quarter as shops had lighter backlogs than normal going into April and we acknowledge a further risk to revenue if repairable claims didn't rebound as we were projecting. As you can see from our second quarter results, the revenue trends moved in an unfavorable direction in North America as well as our other 3 segments. On a per day basis, organic parts and revenue was down 2.9% overall and was negative in each segment. Drilling down and starting with North America, organic revenue decreased by 5.3%, with the largest drop coming from aftermarket collision parts. Similar to Q1, repairable claims were down in the second quarter by 7%, proving to be a headwind. Although not material, access to aftermarket inventory following the Panama Canal disruption and delays with inbound deliveries also had a negative effect. As we continue to see a reduction in repairable claims during Q2, we dug deeper into the market to further understand the drivers of this sequential decrease. While weather was a contributing factor to the reduction in Q1's repairable claims, as we mentioned on the last call, we further researched the impact of rising insurance costs and declining used car values on the consumer's decision to repair their vehicle. We found the combination of these economic factors, rising insurance premiums and repair costs relative to the declining used car prices have the largest aggregate effect. In parallel, we also engaged a leading global consulting firm to conduct an independent assessment of the market and their findings lined up with our deep dive analysis. Based on these findings, we believe that most of these factors are temporary as weather conditions will fluctuate from year to year and economic conditions should normalize over time, allowing for insurance cost to moderate and used car prices to stabilize. We believe that an improvement in economic conditions will contribute to more cars being repaired. The smaller impact of repairable claims is the ongoing effect of ADAS technology entering the car park and we estimate that headwind to approximately be a 1% decrease in repairable claims per year. This is further supported by research from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the Highway Loss Data Institute, that states there is little evidence that partial automation systems are preventing collisions. However, the ADAS impact is not news to us and it doesn't change our near and long-term outlook on the collision market as we believe there will continue to be offset [indiscernible] volumes with revenue opportunities from an increase in parts per estimate, the cost of more complex replacement parts, expanding our services of calibration and diagnostics and continued growth in APU. Rick will discuss in more detail how we are factoring these temporary effects into our guidance. We have taken decisive cost actions to address the revenue shortfall. As we discussed on the last call, we accelerated the FinishMaster integration and announced a global restructuring program in the first quarter. With revenue remaining soft in Q2, we implemented a further cost reduction plan and I am pleased with the progress the North American team has made. Just as the team proved throughout the COVID pandemic, we know how to drive cost out of the business and we exited Q2 with $60 million in run rate savings on the cost reductions. By making these actions quick, North America was able to generate a segment EBITDA margin above 17%, in line with our previous guidance. Our actions have been careful and deliberate and we believe we are well positioned to scale back up again as demand increases. Switching to our Europe segment; organic parts and services revenue increased by 0.3% on a reported basis but declined 1.3% on a per day basis due to volume reductions. There were several factors behind the negative trend with economic conditions being the most significant component. Modest economic growth and high inflation across many of our markets, including the U.K. and Germany, have impacted demand contributing to a year-over-year decline in overall volume. Like North America, we expect the unfavorable economic conditions to be a temporary headwind but one that will likely persist through the second half of 2024. Other factors impacting revenue include the strike activity in Germany and heightened competition from small distributors. With the pressure coming from soft consumer demand, we are seeing some of our smaller competitors aggressively lowering prices. LKQ has been a price leader but we are also very disciplined. By resisting price decreases, we lost some volume in the quarter. However, we do not think the short-term pricing behavior of these competitors is sustainable or irrational strategy and we believe our compelling value proposition will continue to be a key competitive advantage. Europe has also taken actions to mitigate the revenue decline, including cost takeouts and productivity initiatives. Given local regulations, these efforts require more time to implement and thus, the benefits weren't fully realized in the second quarter. We expect to see greater cost savings as the year progresses and into 2025. Additionally, the European team continues to advance our SKU rationalization project. The team has reviewed product groups representing about 1/3 of our revenue and we believe there is an opportunity to reduce about 30% of the current SKUs in these groups. The SKUs would be delisted over a 3-year period starting in 2025, with the large majority coming in the first 2 years. As I noted in my introductory remarks, we continue to review our portfolio and look for opportunities to divest noncore businesses. In Q2, we reached an agreement to sell our operations [indiscernible] and the transaction is expected to close in the third quarter. Combined with the previously announced sales of our Bosnian and Slovenian businesses, the ELIT Polska divestiture reflects our ongoing efforts to streamline and simplify our operations while improving our margin profile. This sale represents a good strategic fit as both LKQ and Mekonomen operated in Poland but neither had the scale to compete effectively with the larger players in the market. The combined operation will be better positioned to compete and we will share any upside potential through our investment in Mekonomen. Shifting to specialty; organic revenue was down 2.1% for the quarter, roughly in line with the Q1 change. Softness in RV demand continues to be a headwind with uncertain economic conditions and high interest rates contributing to pressure on retail volume. We are seeing growth in some product lines, including marine. Consistent with the rest of the organization, specialty has taken cost actions to protect margins and is narrowing the gap in the year-over-year margin change. I want to mention some other noteworthy items for the past several months. In May, we received a favorable ruling from the Federal Circuit Court related to design patents. We believe the ruling is a win for the aftermarket industry and consumers who benefit from the value proposition offered by aftermarket products. In June, the Verdi Trade Union and Employers Association in Germany entered into a new collective bargaining agreement. The new contract which runs through April 2026, covers approximately 5,000 of our employees and puts an end to the strike activity we experienced over the last year. We remain dedicated to providing the industry's best service to our customers and this agreement will improve our ability to deliver on this commitment. We have already seen an improvement in branch availability following the agreement and we expect to get back to pre-strike levels in the second half of this year. In the quarter, we did a handful of tuck-in acquisitions, mostly by our BUMPER TO BUMPER business in Canada, where a tax law change provided an incentive to finish deals prior to June 30. As I noted earlier, we are deprioritizing M&A as we shift focus to share repurchase and other more accretive uses of capital. On that note, we returned over $200 million to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. This included the highest number of shares repurchased any quarter in the past 18 months and we are continuing to repurchase shares in Q3. Our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share to be paid in August. Finally, from a governance standpoint, we regularly review the composition of our Board and ensure that we have members with the relevant experience and skills to support our mission. As part of this process, last week, we added Andy Clarke as a new board member. Andy is a former public company CFO and financial expert and we are excited to add his expertise to the Board. I'll now turn the call over to Rick for a review of the financials and guidance. Rick Galloway : Thank you, Justin and welcome to everyone joining us today. The Q2 results reflect lower than forecasted revenue for the second quarter as discussed by Justin. On a consolidated basis, gross margin also fell short of target as the lower aftermarket volumes in North America contributed to an overall mix decrease and pricing in Europe did not fully cover input cost increases. While our second quarter performance did not meet expectations on the top line, we took swift and impactful cost actions and dug deep on the operational excellence principles that drove our growth and margin expansion over the last 5 years. Those actions, including accelerating the FinishMaster integration and implementing a restructuring plan helped improve our margins despite the lower revenue. We saw sequential EBITDA margin expansion of 140 basis points on a consolidated basis, including 100 basis points in North America which brought us back up above 17%. With the expectation of continuing headwinds impacting top line performance, we are updating our full year guidance. While each of the segment teams has detailed action plans in place to maximize their performance for the remainder of the year and rightsize the business for current volume trends, the ongoing revenue challenges across the business and persistent inflationary pressures in Europe expected in the back half of the year will result in lower revenue and earnings. Turning now to the second quarter consolidated results. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.98 was $0.11 lower than the prior year figure. Movements in commodity prices, primarily precious metals, contributed to a $0.04 year-over-year decrease. The balance of the decrease was predominantly driven by operating results that did not offset the higher year-over-year interest expense resulting from the Uni-Select acquisition. Operating results were negatively impacted by decreases in organic revenue, including the lower North American aftermarket collision volumes and the resulting overall mix decrease and margin pressures stemming from the difficult macroeconomic conditions in Europe. Now for segment results; going to Slide 11. North America posted a segment EBITDA margin of 17.3%, a 330 basis point decrease relative to last year. Last quarter, we projected that the full year margin would be around 17% due to the dilution impact from Uni-Select. The reported margin for the second quarter met our expectation as the cost actions offset the lower aftermarket revenue and the related mix effect on gross margins resulting from lower aftermarket collision revenue which has a higher margin than our other wholesale product lines. Relative to the prior year, in addition to the Uni-Select dilution effect on gross margin, salvage margins were down, reflecting less favorable revenue and vehicle cost trends and lower catalytic converter prices in Q2 2024. Overhead expenses partially offset the gross margin reduction with lower costs as a percentage of revenue for personnel, including lower incentive compensation and lower freight. With the swift cost actions taken in response to the lower volumes being largely completed, we are reiterating our expectation of 17% EBITDA margin for the full year. Looking at Slide 12. Europe reported a segment EBITDA margin of 10.6%, down 90 basis points from last year. Gross margin including restructuring costs declined by 130 basis points, driven largely by pricing challenges to offset input cost increases given the difficult economic conditions in Europe. As Justin noted, our smaller competitors were aggressive in lowering prices which limited our ability to push price to cover higher input costs. Overhead expenses were favorable by 30 basis points. Personnel costs as a percentage of revenue were lower year-over-year as the reduction in labor-related accruals previously recorded for the ongoing union negotiations in Germany were partially offset by wage inflation in most markets. We have not fully covered the ongoing overhead and cost of goods sold input cost increases and we have more work to do on pricing and productivity to boost the margin percentage. Many of these actions have been initiated and are in process but the benefits will be more notable in the back half of the year and heading into 2025. With the macroeconomic environment in Europe and timing of the cost action benefit, we expect EBITDA margin in Europe to be in the mid-to-high 9s [ph] for the full year 2024. However, on a long-term basis, we continue to believe in our ability to deliver double-digit EBITDA margins in Europe. Moving to Slide 13. Specialties EBITDA margin of 8.9% declined 60 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by a decrease in gross margin. Demand softness in the RV product lines and competitive pricing pressures remain challenges for the business. We have been implementing changes to improve our net pricing and saw sequential quarterly improvement in gross margin in the last 2 quarters. Overhead expenses were roughly flat but did include duplicative operating costs related to a distribution center consolidation project which are nonrecurring. We believe the full year segment EBITDA margin will be slightly lower than the 8% we saw last year as we worked through the lingering gross margin pressures. As you can see on Slide 14, self-service generated roughly 10% margin in Q2 compared to 4% last year. In dollar terms, segment EBITDA increased by $6 million despite a $7 million headwind from commodities. The efforts to manage vehicle costs helped mitigate the commodities impact, combined with overhead cost controls produced a year-over-year benefit. We have seen year-over-year improvement in segment EBITDA margins for the first half of 2024 and we were pleased to reach near double-digit margins this quarter. As noted last quarter, we implemented a global restructuring program focused on enhancing profitability. The largest portion of the activity comes from the 2024 divestitures in the Europe segment, as discussed by Justin. These divestitures represented approximately $140 million in combined annual revenue. In addition, we incorporated restructuring actions in North America to reduce headcount, exit underperforming locations and other related actions. In total, we recorded $43 million in charges in the quarter, including $29 million in asset impairments and $6 million in inventory write-downs. Further charges are expected in future periods for severance, lease termination costs and other related expenses. Shifting to cash flows and the balance sheet. We produced $133 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $320 million. In the second quarter, we deployed $125 million for share repurchases and paid a quarterly dividend totaling $80 million, returning value to our shareholders. Over the life of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased 59 million shares for $2.6 billion. And as of June 30, there was $921 million remaining on the authorization. As of June 30, we had total debt of $4.3 billion with a total leverage ratio of 2.3x EBITDA. We remain committed to maintaining a manageable debt level and our investment-grade rating. Our effective borrowing rate was 6.1% for the quarter, an increase of 10 basis points relative to Q1 2024. We have $1.7 billion in variable rate debt, of which $700 million has been fixed with interest rate swaps at 4.6% and 4.2% over the next 1 to 2 years, respectively. I will conclude with our current thoughts on projected 2024 results. When we provided guidance on the Q1 call, we viewed the prior quarter's performance as largely temporary and expected a rebound in repairable claims in Q2. Given the sustained declines in overall volumes due to the lower repairable claims in North America and the volume decreases in Europe, given the difficult macroeconomic conditions, we are lowering our full year guidance. As mentioned previously, we view the volume declines as largely temporary but now expect the impact to continue into the second half of the year. While we have taken actions to mitigate these effects through cost controls and margin actions, those will not be enough to offset the full impact of lower revenue expectations. Our guidance is based on current market conditions and recent trends and assumes that scrap and precious metal prices hold near June prices and the Ukraine Russia conflict continues without further escalation or major additional impact on the European economy and miles driven. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes rates roughly in line with the second quarter. The global tax rate remains unchanged at 26.8%. Our full year guidance metrics on Slide 5 have been updated from the Q1 earnings call. We expect reported organic parts and services revenue in the range of negative 125 basis points to positive 25 basis points. At the negative 0.5% midpoint, this is a decrease of 400 basis points from the prior guidance. The softness in Q2 organic revenue growth, along with the expectation that we will not see a swift recovery in repairable claims in North America, drove the decision to lower the full year range. We believe the factors Justin described led to the revenue softness in North America and will remain a temporary headwind. In Europe, while we anticipate some improvements in Germany following the successful conclusion of the union negotiations, the challenging macroeconomic backdrop leads us to believe that we will not see a quick rebound of volumes compared to their Q2 performance. As a result of the revenue headwinds, we expect adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.50 to $3.70, a decrease of $0.45 from the midpoint for the previous guidance. The primary drivers of the decrease in midpoint are explained on Slide 6 and include : $0.37 from lowering operating results, including the reduction in revenue expectations and persistent inflationary pressures outpacing market pricing, partially offset by cost savings, productivity and restructuring initiatives; $0.08 from non-EBITDA related items, including investment performance, depreciation, interest and taxes; and $0.03 from lower FX rates and commodity prices. These are partially offset by a $0.03 benefit from share repurchases. While we continue to see variability in revenue trends, the team is doing an excellent job in addressing controllable factors to align to the current market environment and adjust for the short-term economic headwinds. The free cash flow target of 50% to 60% annual EBITDA conversion remains in place but with the lower earnings expectations, we now expect free cash flow of approximately $850 million. Diligent balance sheet management should support achievement of the full year target while continuing to balance trade working capital needs heading into 2025. Thank you for your time. I will now turn the call back to Justin for his closing comments. Justin Jude : Thanks, Rick, for the financial commentary. Before we move to your questions, as we've communicated on recent calls, we are hosting our Investor Day on September 10 at the headquarters in Nashville and also via webcast. I hope you can all join us to discuss how we are charging our future. Rick and I will cover the overall LKQ strategy and then we will focus on our 2 largest businesses : the wholesale North American and Europe segments. Our senior management from these segments will present business overviews and targets for growth and margin expansion. To close out, in the first half, we faced obstacles that have tested our resolve and resilience. Through it all, I have seen the unwavering dedication and hard work that define our LKQ culture. I am inspired by the LKQ team's commitment to excellence and perseverance in the face of adversity. We are well positioned to navigate the road ahead, seize new opportunities and accelerate our work to create value for our shareholders. I'll now ask the operator to open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We've now received the first question from Scott Stember from ROTH MKM. Scott Stember : In North America, you talked about -- last quarter, you talked about weather and the emerging trend, I guess, of lower repairable claims because of the economy. It seems like that part of it has become a bigger piece. Just trying to get a sense of if you had to frame out how much of the weakness is due to weather and just more just underlying economic issues in the country. Just trying to get a sense of how cyclical this business is starting to become. Justin Jude : Yes. So if you look at the weather piece, it was a large item in there. But if we looked at that economic factor, it was the majority of the headwinds that we face in repairable claims. As I mentioned on the call, we did a deep dive. We talked to a lot of our customers, insurance carriers. We also engaged that third party which was BCG, to do that deep dive in Q1 and part of Q2. And so whether it's the weather side, whether it's the economic factor, we see all those things as being temporary in nature. Hard to say when some of those economic factors start to reverse but by far, the majority of all of the issue of repairable claims we saw was just temporary in nature. Scott Stember : All right. And the $60 million that you talked about in cost cuts, I assume that was for North America, that's year-to-date. Did you put out a goal for the full year? And how much of that is going to stick? I imagine some of it is just related to pay and stock comp and things like that. But just trying to get a sense of how much will stay? Rick Galloway : Yes. So good question, Scott. You're correct. Most of that came through from North America. I think the North American business can make the impact much quicker. So as far as the target goes, one of the things that we look at is we look at the overall performance, we look at it on a daily basis. There's a lot of other metrics that we go to. So there wasn't a specific dollar threshold target. What it was is trying to get us back to the point that we talked about a few minutes ago within getting North America back up above 17 and really driving overall performance. That team, when there's tough economic conditions, I think everyone realized that the North American team is fantastic in operating in a cyclical environment, if you look back a couple of years ago. And so most of those actions were completed by quarter end and then we'll start seeing that come through, through the rest of the year. We also have similar actions over in Europe. Obviously, there's some different requirements, regulatory requirements that will delay us but we will start seeing some of those come in, in Q4 and then pretty much a full benefit as we go into 2025. Scott Stember : And as far as how much will stick? Rick Galloway : Yes. So as far as how much will stick, the full amount will stick. I mean these are permanent cost reductions that we're looking at. We're not sitting there trying to figure out this much is going to be a temporary basis and we're somewhat [indiscernible]. These are permanent cost actions and that's one of the things that Justin talked about is that, we need to make sure we're operationally excellent and looking at overall permanent reductions. And these items will stick. Operator : The next question is from Craig Kennison from Baird. Craig Kennison : Justin, regarding the SKU count reduction plan in Europe, how do you ensure that it doesn't impact your fulfilment rates? Justin Jude : Yes. So our goal is kind of twofold. One, we want to simplify the business in our operations. We have a lot of SKUs that are duplication -- that are duplicated if you think of applications. So when a customer calls for a specific year making model, we have several brands of those. We have a large team within our Europe operations across all countries, working to analyze that, the whole SKU rationalization project. I mean as of today, we've really not non-stocked any part or removed any SKUs from the application or removed any SKUs from our DCs. It's very small. We're very cognizant that we want to make sure we have a better application coverage. So right now, there's definitely some holes where when a customer calls us for a part, we don't have it. So we want to improve the availability of the application level. When it comes down to brands, obviously, there are certain brands in certain countries across Europe that we need to have and we will have. And so we have, once again, a large team focused on this project to make sure we don't make the wrong decisions. The other thing that we're going to be pushing also towards, that the team is excited about is driving our private label throughout the rest of our Europe operations which as you guys can imagine, the private label brings the best gross margin for LKQ. Craig Kennison : Is there a way to frame your private label penetration today and where it could be? Justin Jude : We have some countries that are in the 30%, other countries that are in the single digits. We'll hear from Andy Hamilton at the Investor Day and we'll talk a little bit about some of our strategy to drive that even higher at our Investor Day once again in Nashville on September 10. Operator : The next question is from Gary Prestopino from Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : A couple of quick questions. Number one, the free cash flow generation that we're expecting for this year. I would expect, given what you've said, Justin, about share repurchases, the priority is share repurchases and you're fairly happy with your debt levels at this point. Rick Galloway : Yes, Gary, I can take that one. I'll speak for Justin. And yes, we are content with where our debt levels are right now. And we will have a primary folks and Justin kind of laid it out during his presentation, prepared remarks, that a priority is focusing on total shareholder return and there will be a large focus on share repurchases, particularly as we see the opportunities with our current stock price. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then a second quick question. You gave us a number for repairable claims being down. But do you have any numbers on what frequencies were in the quarter? Justin Jude : We don't have an exact number on that, Gary. But I will tell you the actual frequency was not as bad as the repairable claims; for example, the weather brought down frequency and obviously brought down repairable claims. That economic situation -- there were accidents out there and as we reach out to customers, insurance carriers, we found these actions just weren't getting repaired. And so we don't have an exact number of that but I would say the majority -- maybe not, sorry, the majority was temporary, as I said earlier. A large chunk was what I would say, the frequency was there, they just weren't getting repaired. Operator : The next question is from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Bret Jordan : On the BCG study, I guess, the economic factor, are they projecting that this lost volume is forever lost or is this deferred? I guess, sort of what was the takeaway from the impact? Justin Jude : They kind of thought that there's some pent-up demand in this piece but then there's also some volume of frequency that occurred that just probably won't ever get repaired. It's hard to -- it's hard to speculate on how much will actually come through eventually into the mix. But just with the rising insurance costs, the deductible cost, the repair cost climbing and then that the consumer's vehicle value dropping, it will be -- we'll have to see what happens with the economic if it changes the consumers' behavior. But we do think there is some pent-up demand but nothing that shows us it's going to start coming in relatively quickly. Bret Jordan : And I guess you commented about price competition from smaller players in Europe. Are you seeing any price competition from smaller collision players in North America, like Empire, Cosmopolitan or any of that? Justin Jude : Yes. And I would say that's nothing new. It probably slowed down a bit during the pandemic and the supply chain issue where we had a lot of inventory and a lot of our smaller folks did it. As they started getting their inventory back in, they kind of went back to their old ways of offering price more than service. And so that's not necessarily anything new for us. So yes, we still see it. Bret Jordan : Okay. And I guess housekeeping, what was the total loss rate in the quarter? Justin Jude : I kind of don't know if I have that number handy on it. Rick Galloway : Bret, we can get back to you. I think it was roughly 21-ish but we can get back to you on that one. Operator : The next question is from Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. This is Josh Batra [ph] on for Ryan Brinkman. Thanks for taking my questions. Could you help us unpack -- could you help us unpack the $0.37 impact to operating results embedded within the bridge to the updated EPS guide? Mainly in terms of the contribution from weaker revenue growth outlook and mix shift-related margin headwinds as opposed to the benefits from ongoing cost initiatives. And I have a follow-up. Rick Galloway : Yes, it's a good question. When we're looking at the overall $0.37, it's a significant amount of volume. North of $0.50 would be volume and then there's some other pricing impacts that would be in addition to that. And then we're looking at a pretty substantial productivity initiative in the back half which is what I was talking about a few minutes ago on the $60 million cost reductions that are working to offset that to bring us to the $0.37. But if you think about it, we're somewhere north of, call it, $0.60 with some negativity on volume and pricing and then clawing back a fair amount of that through productivity initiatives. Unidentified Analyst : Understood, that's very helpful. As a follow-up, just curious if the organic revenue growth metrics reflect an impact from the recent CDK outage at dealers, that may have perhaps led to a backlog at the collision repair shops in the U.S. as OE parts shipments were delayed. And separately, wondering if you could share with us any impact of LKQ observed from the Hurricane Beryl into July? Justin Jude : Yes. I caught on the CDK comments. So I will tell you, I think there was roughly, what, 15,000 dealerships, not all those are automotive. There is some volume that we gained from that CDK when some of the OE dealerships could not necessarily service the parts. Obviously though, when we saw a headwind of repairable claims coming down 7.1%, it wasn't enough to -- the volume from CDK wasn't enough to offset that. A lot of the dealers that -- I mean, we still see those dealers today that have body shops and service centers. A lot of those are kind of have gone through the repair. They've either fixed the issue or they're off to CDK. So we had a little bit of a volume tick up there but nothing meaningful. Unidentified Analyst : Any color on Hurricane Beryl? Rick Galloway : We had some shutdowns within a couple of our facilities as far as the cost side goes. We haven't seen any type of volume changes. We're still kind of going through that as far as the hurricane goes but nothing material that we've seen at this point. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Butler from Stifel. Brian Butler : Just starting out, I guess, when you look at the first quarter result, our first half results and kind of then pair that with the guidance revision that you gave, it feels like the repairable claim outlook is definitely still on a downward trajectory in the third quarter and maybe into fourth quarter. So what gives you the confidence that this is just temporary in nature? And maybe, is there any historical precedent that we can look at and give you some comfort, again, that this isn't a much longer-term secular trend? Justin Jude : Yes. So I mean, if you look at our last year Q1, we had very tough comps, Q2 tough comps and in the guide, a little bit softer Q2, Q3 and Q4. If we look at our -- so our thought is over a prior year, we see that getting better throughout the back half of the year, meaning not as bad as what we saw in Q1 and Q2. If we look at just our run rate of revenue from month-to-month, from May to June and July, I mean, obviously, we had a week there with 4th of July that slowed down. If you look at our normalized daily run rate of revenue, we're seeing that kind of flat. And while we don't have how repairable claims are shaken out in July yet or any part of Q2, our volume is staying flat, if that makes sense. So we think we've kind of hit bottom. There may be some still negative on year-over-year trends because last year, it was a decent amount of repairable claims to -- I'm sorry, there's a decent amount of cars getting fixed because of -- if you think about it, used car pricing was climbing pretty aggressively last year. Now the opposite is happening where used car pricing is dropping. And do consumers want to spend that money out of their pocket to fix that vehicle when the used car value has dropped. So we're pretty confident in the new guidance on what we see on revenue for LKQ for the back half of the year. Brian Butler : I guess so if you think about that guidance and the way the market should view that, I mean, it feels like that's got to be, as you said, kind of you're starting to flatten out almost the bottom. Is that almost a worst-case scenario? I mean, obviously, there's, I'm sure, scenarios where it can get worse. But is this kind of one of the low case scenarios where you put this guidance with the expectation of kind of resetting expectations going forward from there? Justin Jude : Yes. We hope the volume is level. I don't know if it was worst case necessarily. Obviously, it's hard for us to predict what happens with the economy and used car pricing and some of these other dynamics that affect us. I've got to imagine at some point, we say it's temporary because at some point, used car pricing has to stabilize, normalize and then start to increase. Rick Galloway : So Brian, part of the way that we look at this in the forecast is the economic factors that we looked at ourselves and then further validated with the study that we did started to indicate when the insurance companies have increased their pricing. And so you get essentially a onetime change within the behavior with significant increases in insurance premium costs moving from one deductible to another deductible. And that impact started sort of in late Q2, early Q3 of last year which we think will then lead through at least through the end of the year. And that's what we've put in, that year-over-year impact going through the end of the year. But then once you annualize that, the change from one deductible to another deductible, we don't expect that to continue. We expect moderating within the insurance premiums and the behavior from the consumer will be back to a more normalized behavior. Brian Butler : Okay. And so again, not to [indiscernible] point. But I guess then the 2024 guidance is kind of the starting point to where you think growth comes, starts to return. There's not a big rebound somewhere in here in 2025? Rick Galloway : No, we don't. Yes, that's correct. We don't think that there's some sort of big rebound. There's nothing that indicates to us that there will be a significant bump up one way or the other. But it will be the new starting point, if you will, in the back half of the year that will grow from there. Operator : The next question is from John Healy from Northcoast Research. John Healy : I know that it's been talked about a lot already but I just thought I maybe ask the question differently. Relating to the accident frequency dynamic, I mean what's does the BCG study kind of say about, if they said anything, just kind of accident frequency potentially over the long term? And did you guys kind of flesh out with the scenario where maybe the decline in claims is maybe some form of accident avoidance technology and vehicles starting to proliferate through the car part? Like did they address that? And if they did, how did they refuse that as maybe potentially a sign of what's starting to change here? Justin Jude : Yes, I'll answer that. This is Justin. The second part of your question on the technology [indiscernible]; I kind of made it a comment in my script on ADAS. So ADAS is not a new phenomenon -- phenomenon for us, sorry. We've seen the -- as the car park really starting in 2016 getting introduced with more of these features for ADAS or accident avoidance systems, we would start to see that reduction in overall repairable claims. We think right now, it's around 1%, BCG confirm that. That's what we would call as more kind of constant. Now while that may be a reduction of accidents by 1%, we see the overall market still growing for the future because of more parts per estimate. The complexity of those parts are higher which means higher prices. Also, there's more business going in for calibration and services and we also see a continual opportunity to improve APU. But your question on the technology, it's been there. It's been in the car park for quite a while and we see that about as a 1% reduction, 1% year-over-year reduction in the repairable claims. When we talk about the future, the forecast, in nature, the majority by far was these temporary items, whether it was weather or whether it was these economic factors, they did not and we didn't necessarily speculate as to when do -- obviously, the weather is the weather and it happens and it could be year-to-year, it could be different. But they and LKQ is not going to speculate on when some of these economic factors are going to start to improve and help drive higher repairable claims. Rick Galloway : And Justin, maybe I'll just add back on to one thing that Bret was asking a few minutes ago. The repairable claims, we did see the peak in Q1, 21.4%, start dropping, Bret, to 20.7% in Q2. So it's starting to make its way back down on total losses. I'm sorry, total losses. Operator : We currently have no further questions. So I'd like to hand over to Justin Jude, President and CEO, for closing remarks. Justin Jude : Thanks, operator. First, I want to thank our team out in the field, both in North America and Europe and the other countries for which we operate. Just we all face challenges. We face headwinds in the overall market but very proud of the team and how they reacted, getting our business rightsized or how they're working still to rightsize that business. So very much appreciative of that team. And for everybody on the call and for all of our employees and investors, as we talked about some of these headwinds, it's not an LKQ problem, it's a market issue right now. We're making sure we have the cost put [ph] in place and we'll be ready to go when the volume starts to recover and we have quite a bit of initiative and we'll share some of those at our Investor Day on September 10, once again, in Nashville, about how we have opportunities to continue to grow market share and that will help us as the market continues to recover. So with that, thanks everybody for joining the call, we appreciate it. And with that, we'll end the call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning everyone and welcome to the LKQ Corporation's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. My name is Lydia and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I'll now hand you over to Joe Boutross, Vice President, Investor Relations to begin. Please go ahead. Joe Boutross : Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone and welcome to LKQ's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. With us today are Justin Jude, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rick Galloway, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call. Now let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions, or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the coming days. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Justin Jude. Justin Jude : Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I want to start by saying that our thoughts and prayers are with all of those that have been affected by the Hurricanes Helene and Milton. The Southeast, in particular, is one of LKQ's strongest regions, which is a testament to our many dedicated employees and longstanding relationships with our customers in the region. We are grateful to report no fatalities among our LKQ team members, but property damage and disruptions to daily life have affected many. At LKQ, we pride ourselves on being a good corporate citizen and partnering with the communities in which we operate. In response to the hurricanes, we have earmarked funds to cover requests into our Employee Assistance Fund for financial relief and reached out to our employees for recommendations of local causes that could use our help. We also have made donations to charitable organizations involved with the disaster response efforts. I would also like to thank the LKQ team members who jumped into action to aid their colleagues and communities while there are too many individuals to name, I am truly inspired by their efforts to gather and deliver supplies to those in need and assist in the cleanup. As the region begins its recovery period, LKQ stands ready to continue to provide support. Shifting now to the quarter, last month we held an Investor Day where I laid out my management style and priorities. As a reminder, I stated that my priorities would focus on operational excellence and maximizing total shareholder return. In the third quarter, we evidenced this focus by taking action to simplify, integrate, and rationalize the business while returning value to our stakeholders. Let's start with the capital allocation and shareholder returns. At recent trading levels, we believe the best use of our capital is repurchasing our shares. We were active in the quarter, repurchasing 3 million shares for approximately $125 million. With $800 million left on our authorization and plans to remain active in the market in the coming years, I am pleased to announce our Board of Directors approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $1 billion with an extension through October 2026. Management's recommendation to increase and extend the authorization and the Board's approval thereof is evidence of our confidence in LKQ's future and our ability to generate robust free cash flow. In August, we paid a quarterly dividend totaling $79 million and our Board approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share to be paid in November. Moving to our operational excellence initiatives, the simplification of our portfolio and operations is a key pillar to drive better returns. As part of our portfolio review, we completed the sale of our Poland operation to Mekonomen in July and recently finalized the sale of our Bosnia business. Additionally, we have another small transaction nearing completion in the coming weeks. While this transaction is a very small component of our North American operation, the sale will eliminate a loss-making business while freeing up management's time. On the integration front, we continue to work on merging our recent acquisitions into existing LKQ operations. While most of the heavy lifting is done on Uni-Select's footprint rationalization, the teams are identifying additional efficiencies and have selected seven more locations for closure. Andy Hamilton talked about the SKU rationalization effort in Europe, and I am pleased to report the team pushed this project forward in the quarter and have now reviewed over 25 product groups representing 425,000 SKUs for more than 50% of our project scope. Also in Europe, we are working on restructuring activities to reduce costs and increase efficiencies related to our logistics network. We will have more details on these efforts in 2025. And lastly, our specialty business recently completed the combining of two warehouses near Dallas, a legacy facility, and a facility we acquired as part of a 2023 transaction into a new more efficient single location. Our commitment to lean operating culture is critically important, especially in a period when the top line is facing headwinds. In addition to the substantial cost actions we have already taken this year, all of our businesses are undertaking another review of the cost structures as part of our annual budget process. Additionally, we are conducting a benchmark study on our overhead costs to determine where we have opportunities to be more productive and cost effective. Growth is our final operational excellence pillar, and we strive to grow organic revenue and increase operating margins. We were not wholly successful in this regard during the third quarter, as many of the economic and industry headwinds we faced in the first half of 2024 continued to have a negative impact on our results. While parts and services revenue was down roughly 4% organically on a per day basis, there were some positives to take away. North America declined 7.5% on a per day basis, with aftermarket down to a greater extent than salvage. Q3 extended the trend of year-over-year repairable claims decreases, with claims falling 9.5% following a 7.0% drop in the second quarter. Our collision volumes were down only 6%, showing that despite the drop in claims, we did not lose share. We believe the decrease in claims are still tied to the economic factors we discussed last quarter, such as the rising insurance premiums and the decrease in used car pricing. While we anticipated claims volumes would not rebound quickly in the second half, the Q3 decrease was higher than we projected, and it contributed to an underperformance of revenue relative to guidance. The Q3 claims figure suggests the possibility of a longer recovery period than we previously thought, and we are working through this evaluation with our strategy and operations teams as part of our 2025 budget process. Europe's revenue was flat on a per day basis, but was an improvement from the 1.3% decrease we reported in the second quarter. Certain markets showed single-digit growth, while others declined at a similar range. Economic conditions remained challenging across most markets in Europe, notably in Germany and the U.K. Competition is also contributing to the challenging condition, as consistent with last quarter, some of the smaller players are aggressively pushing price. The North American revenue decline of 7.5% per day was larger than what we reported in the first two quarters. The sequential change is attributable to repairable claims in Q3 and the mixed impact of incremental paint revenue in the organic calculation. We passed a one-year mark since the Uni-Select acquisition on August 1st, 2024, and as a result, the FinishMaster revenue became part of the organic calculation for part of Q3. Organic paint revenue was down by a greater percentage than the segment as a whole, resulting from softness in FinishMaster's direct sales. There was some revenue loss post-acquisition as customers re-evaluated their supplier situation, and sales reps left to join competitors. As we integrated the business and aligned our sales teams, we believe the situation has stabilized, and the team is working to win back business with LKQ's combination of superior availability and service. Specialty took a step backward in the third quarter, with organic revenue down 10% on a per-day basis, compared to 2% in the first half. Economic conditions, including higher interest rates and relatively low consumer confidence, have contributed to lower vehicle and RV sales, thus creating a significant headwind for our part sales. We expect the challenging conditions to continue through the fourth quarter. Shifting to our profitability measures, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 2% compared to Q3 last year, and the segment EBITDA margin improved by 30 basis points. Rick will provide further details on these numbers in his remarks. Before turning the call to Rick, I want to mention a few noteworthy items for the quarter. Hurricanes Helene and Milton have affected our operations in North America, as some of our locations and many of our customers were shut down as a result of the storms and the after effects. To give an idea of the impact on LKQ's operations, Helene forced four closures of nearly 25% of our locations in the Southeast, and these locations were down between one and six days. Milton forced closures of nearly 75% of our quarter locations for between one and four days. Thankfully, we didn't incur any significant property damage, so the impact will be mostly related to lost revenue. Earlier this month, dock workers on the East and Gulf Coast went to strike for three days. A tentative agreement got them back to work as negotiations continue on a final contract. We expect the strike dates to have an impact on our inventory, as each day off was estimated to require a week to catch up. We were already experiencing delays for shipments brought into the East Coast, and while we believe our current inventory levels are adequate to support the business, there could be some minor impacts to our fill rates over the coming months. We are also contingency planning in case a final contract isn't agreed to by January. Last quarter, we reported that we reached an agreement with a trade union representing a number of our employees in Germany, and we are pleased with the progress in restoring normal operating performance and branch availability improved in the quarter, rising to nearly 95%. I'll now turn the call to Rick for a review of the financials and guidance. Rick Galloway : Thank you, Justin, and welcome to everyone joining us today. Third quarter results reflect solid overall performance, but with some variability across the business. Europe performed well in the face of challenging macroeconomic conditions, but revenue in our North America and specialty segments came in lower than expected due to factors mentioned by Justin. As discussed during the Investor Day, we were experiencing softer than anticipated revenue in North America in July and August numbers. This softness continued into September with preliminary repairable claims data indicating a larger than expected decrease in total Q3 year-over-year repairable claims. Additionally, Hurricane Helene had a small but negative impact on the final week of the quarter. These challenging economic conditions, including further declines in collision claims from Q2 to Q3, were difficult to overcome, but we are proud of all of our 48,000 employees who remained focused on delivering solid operating performance through our lean operating model. Turning now to the third quarter consolidated results. Our actions to simplify the business and align cost structures to demand levels contributed to improvement in our segment EBITDA margins by 30 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.88 was $0.02 higher than the prior year figure. Lower share counts due to our ongoing share repurchase program and lower taxes contributed to a year-over-year improvement in adjusted EPS of approximately $0.04. These were offset by roughly $0.02 of a net decline in operating results. We saw significant improvements in EBITDA in both our Europe and self-service segments. Europe posted double-digit EBITDA margins for the second straight quarter despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. Self-service benefited from their focus on improved vehicle procurement costs and productivity with some additional help from more favorable movement in scrap steel prices during the quarter. However, organic revenue declines in North America driven largely by aftermarket and paint volumes contributed to a mixed decrease and ultimately lower EBITDA for the North America segment. Difficult economic conditions in the auto and RV markets also led to a decline in organic revenue and earnings in our specialty segment. As noted in Q1, we implemented a global restructuring program focused on enhancing profitability. In Q3, we expanded the 2024 restructuring plan to simplify the business and to align with current demand including additional footprint rationalization and streamlining our logistics models. Given the persistent market demand pressures and macroeconomic challenges, we are continuing to execute on our restructuring plans in North America and Europe to reduce headcount and exit underperforming locations. As a result, we incurred $14 million in charges for the quarter. Further charges are expected in future periods for severance, lease termination costs, and other related expenses. Now for segment results. Going to Slide 8. North America posted a segment EBITDA margin of 16.1%, a 90 basis point decrease relative to last year. Last quarter, we projected the full year margin would be around 17% with the full year impact of Uni-Select dilution. The reported margin for the third quarter was below our expectations as the cost actions taken including Uni-Select synergies from integration and other restructuring efforts were not enough to offset the lower aftermarket revenue with the related mix effect on gross margins as aftermarket collision revenue has a higher margin than our other wholesale product lines. Relative to the prior year, salvage margins were also down reflecting more favorable revenue, vehicle cost trends, and commodity prices in the prior year period. Overhead expenses decreased 90 basis points in North America reflecting lower personnel costs primarily related to incentive compensation with the Uni-Select synergies and productivity initiatives largely offsetting significant inflationary pressures and the leverage effect of the organic revenue decline. With the headwinds on repairable claims and salvage margins as well as the impact from the hurricanes, we estimate North America's EBITDA margins will be in the low to mid-16s for the full year. Looking at Slide 9, Europe reported a segment EBITDA margin of 10.2%, a 90 basis point improvement over last year. Gross margin rose slightly despite the difficult economic conditions as we were able to pass along some pricing to help offset input cost increases in certain markets. Overhead expenses were favorable by 70 basis points compared to the prior year period. While productivity measures largely offset inflationary pressures, our prior year SG&A expenses included a 70 basis point charge related to a nonrecurring value-added tax audit matter in Italy. We remain focused on productivity measures to offset the ongoing inflationary pressures on overhead expenses and cost of goods sold and have expanded the 2024 restructuring plan in Europe to support these efforts. Many of these actions have been initiated and are in process, but the benefits will be more notable in the fourth quarter and heading into 2025. When we talked 90 days ago, we expected EBITDA margins in Europe to be in the mid to high 9s. With current volume expectations and the actions we've taken to address productivity, we believe EBITDA margins will fall in line with this range. On a long-term basis, we expect to deliver double-digit EBITDA margins in Europe. Moving to Slide 10, specialties EBITDA margin of 7.3% declined 130 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a decline in organic revenue and resulting leverage effect on overhead costs. Demand softness in the auto and RV product lines and competitive pricing pressures remain challenges for the business. We have been implementing changes to improve our net pricing and saw sequential quarterly improvement in gross margin in the last three quarters. Overhead expenses were roughly flat in dollar terms, but were higher as a percentage of revenue, primarily due to lower operating leverage on the organic revenue decline. We believe the full-year segment EBITDA margin will be closer to 7% given the continued organic revenue declines. Self-service generated a 7.3% segment EBITDA margin in Q3, which is an almost 800 basis point improvement from last year. In dollar terms, segment EBITDA increased by $11 million. Efforts to manage vehicle procurement costs combined with overhead cost controls and favorable movements in scrap steel prices helped drive an improvement in profitability. Shifting to cash flows and the balance sheet. We produced $341 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $661 million. We invested approximately $16 million in two small tuck-in acquisitions, including one in Canada and one in Europe. In addition, we paid down approximately $35 million in outstanding debt. In the third quarter, we continued to return value to our shareholders with $125 million per share repurchases and our quarterly dividend totaling $79 million. We will also continue with our $0.30 per share quarterly dividend into 2025. At this level, the dividend payout aligns with our stated capital allocation policy and allows us to retain strategic flexibility for capital allocation. We have committed to allocating at least 50% of our free cash flow towards dividends and share repurchases, and our third quarter activity kept us on pace to deliver on this commitment. On a year-to-date basis, we have generated free cash flow of $661 million and invested $520 million for share repurchases and dividends, or almost 80% of our free cash flow. As of September 30, we had total debt of $4.4 billion with a total leverage ratio of 2.4 times EBITDA, a slight increase from the prior quarter but within a range of expectations. We remain committed to maintaining a manageable debt level and our investment grade rating. Our effective borrowing cost was 5.5% at the end of Q3, slightly down from Q2 as a result of recently lowered benchmark rates. We have $1.7 billion in variable rate debt, of which $700 million has been fixed with interest rate swaps, which effectively provides a fixed rate on over 75% of our debt. I will close with an update on our full year 2024 guidance. We expected in our prior guidance the drop in repairable claims volumes in North America would remain at the same level of year-over-year declines into the back half of the year. Given the greater-than-anticipated drop in the third quarter weighing down organic revenue, combined with lower-than-expected volumes in our specialty business and headwinds from hurricanes in the southeastern portion of the U.S., we are adjusting our full year guidance. As mentioned previously, we view the market-driven volume declines we'll abate, but expect them to impact us in the fourth quarter and eventually level off in 2025. While we have taken action to mitigate these effects through cost controls and margin actions, those will not be enough to offset the full year impact of the lower revenue expectations. Our guidance is based on current market conditions and recent trends and assumes that scrap and precious metal prices hold near September prices. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes rates roughly in line with the third quarter. The global tax rate edged up slightly to 27.0% due to shifts in our geographical mix of earnings. Our full year guidance metrics on Slide 12 have been updated from Q2 earnings call. We expect reported organic parts and services revenue in the range of negative 275 basis points to negative 175 basis points. At the negative 2.25% midpoint, this is a decrease of 175 basis points from the prior guidance. The continued softness in Q3 organic revenue in North America and specialty, along with the impact of the hurricanes in the U.S., drove the decision to lower the full year range. We expect the top-line headwinds in North America will linger into 2025. We are working through our budgeting process for next year and will update you on the expectations during our Q4 earnings release in February. In Europe, the top-line recovery from the difficult economic environment in several markets is slower than originally anticipated, and we expect Q4 organic growth to be similar to what we saw in Q3. As a result of these headwinds, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be slightly lower and in the range of $3.38 to $3.52, a decrease of $0.15 from our previous midpoint. The primary driver of the decrease includes the market-driven demand dynamics in North America and specialty. While we expect to see volatility in these revenue trends, the team is focusing on addressing those items within our control, including our cost structure, and will continue to execute on productivity and restructuring initiatives, which will partially offset these revenue trends in Q4 and will further benefit us heading into 2025. The free cash flow targets at 50% to 60% annual EBITDA conversion and approximately $850 million remain unchanged from prior guidance. Diligent balance sheet and capital expenditure management will help deliver the full-year target despite the lower expected profitability while continuing to balance trade working capital needs heading into 2025. Thanks for your time. I will now turn the call back to Justin for his closing comments. Justin Jude : Thanks, Rick, for the financial commentary. As I close the book on my first quarter as CEO, I want to thank all of my LKQ colleagues for what they do each and every day to make LKQ an exceptional company. Things don't always go according to plan, and Q3 threw us a few curveballs, but the LKQ team immediately went to work addressing these issues. Their knowledge, resilience, and work ethic are second to none, and we will help us emerge even stronger from the challenging conditions facing our industry. I am very proud to work with this team, and I am excited about LKQ's future. I will now ask the operator to open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Craig Kennison : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wondered if you could shed more light on the issue with respect to paint and the competition that you're seeing there. What's going on in that category? Do you think it's a change in the competitive landscape or just a tactical move by your competitors? Justin Jude : I'd say maybe a mixture of both, Craig. This is Justin. Thanks for the question. If you remember last year, we announced the intent to acquire Uni-Select, and then it went six months. We were kind of in a quiet period. We couldn't talk to FinishMaster folks. We couldn't talk to the customers. At that time, that quiet period creates some unsureness, and FinishMaster had lost some accounts pre-acquisition or pre-closing and leading into post-acquisition. As you know, some of those contracts get worked on six months in advance. Additionally, there was a larger MSO that had been lost by FinishMaster, and that business was being migrated away after we acquired and closed on FinishMaster. Obviously, we talked about rapidly integrating the footprint, integrating the sales teams. We kind of started off at a lost position of where we expected to be, but the teams have aligned the sales, refocused the groups collectively. Right now, we think that we're showing that we've moderated the loss and started to grow share. Really, we don't think there's anybody that can compete with us on our service and availability. Craig Kennison : Maybe just, Justin, if you could shed light on the value proposition LKQ has with respect to having paint as part of your overall portfolio and whether that's persuasive to your customers. Thank you. Justin Jude : Yes. As you guys may know, the margin on paint is lower than typically on parts. A lot of the paint competitors that we deal with, even FinishMaster prior to LKQ acquiring them, would cut their costs from the service level to make sure that they can maintain their profits, such as delivering once a week or delivering twice a week. So now, when we've integrated the warehouses of FinishMaster into the LKQ footprint, we're delivering to our body shops two times a day in some markets, same day, every day of the week. We're able to put paint on that vehicle. So, from a service level, from an inventory depth standpoint and availability, it's hard for any of these other paint distribution businesses to compete with us on a like for like. Just because our cost structure, we already have the truck going there, once again, once a day or twice a day, with parts both used in aftermarket and then for us to add paint out of the same warehouses is just a marginal increase in cost. So, from a service level and cost to serve, it's, in my opinion, it's very hard for our competition to compete with that. Craig Kennison : Thanks, Justin. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Stember with ROTH MKM. Please go ahead. Scott Stember : Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions as well. Justin Jude : Good morning, Scott. Scott Stember : Within North America, I'm trying to parse out what happened in aftermarket. I remember last year, you guys caught lightning in a bottle because of State Farm coming back into the market and the availability of aftermarket parts increased. Is this more a function of tough comparisons for aftermarket or is there something going on where customers are shifting their focus and preference back to salvage? Justin Jude : I'm going to use that line, by the way, lightning in a bottle. I like that, Scott. Yes, I would say it's really tied to the repairable claims fees. I mean, if you look at our aftermarket business, it's 100% tied to collision. And so, when you see the claims drop, that puts a lot of downward pressure on the aftermarket piece. Like any time we talked about in the last call, any time the market drops, our competitors don't necessarily, whether that's OEM or whether that's other aftermarket distributors, our competitors don't necessarily know if it's the market or if they're losing shares. So, they get a little bit more aggressive on price trying to get some shares. So, we don't chase price down, but it does create some pressure on the margin a little bit with aftermarket. But the line issue with the drop in aftermarket would be tied to the repairable claims fees. Rick Galloway : Yes Scott, just to add on to that, just a minute. The other thing to think about is with State Farm coming up last year, and you look at that compared to the repairable claims, there was a significant difference between the downgrade in the repairable claims in the back half of last year versus where revenue was. That plus the strike that happened at the OEs last year did help our overall revenue. So, the comps, you're correct on the aftermarket piece, there are tougher comps when you're looking at what happened within the industry last year as well. Scott Stember : Got it. And then just last question. There was a lot of things, a lot of transitory add-ons, which impacted this quarter and probably the fourth quarter as well from the storms and strikes. Is there any way to quantify the impact from the storms for the full year or how much of your guidance coming down was because of that and the strike? Rick Galloway : Yes. So, let me take that one, Scott. As far as the third quarter impact, it was minimal impact on the storms. There was a - Helene hit at the very end, and I talked about it just briefly, that there was a little bit of an impact on the last week of the quarter. Going into Q4, we did see, obviously, Milton hit the Southeast as well, and there was significant cleanup, and there's still significant cleanup on Helene but we're still trying to quantify. We didn't receive very much, as Justin talked about, property damage, but we are still seeing the impacts of revenue. So, part of what we're doing within our revenue and our overall EPS guidance, if you think about what we talked about Investor Day, Investor Day I talked about as being below our previous midpoint. I think when we look back to where consensus was, is below $3.50, $3.53, I think is what it was for the year. So, if you think about the only thing that's really happened since then is a little bit further decline in repairable claims than what we had expected. We were expecting about what we saw in Q2, which was around 7%, and now it's a little north of 9%. So, we're framing that out. And then, additionally, there's two hurricanes and a strike that happened. So, that's how we get, essentially, that $0.07 dropping from that roughly $3.53 consensus down to $3.45. Scott Stember : Got it. That's all I have. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Butler with Stifel. Your line is open. Brian Butler : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Rick Galloway : Morning, Brian. Brian Butler : When you're looking at 2025 and you talk about macro pressures abating at some point, what gives you confidence ? I mean what - is that this - that you will see some kind of abatement of the claims issue into 2025? And is that a second half of 2025, or is that kind of a first half? Just trying to get a sense of what you're thinking about from a perspective of timing on that. Rick Galloway : Yes, Brian, I mean, on the repairable claims piece, as I talked about, it's really an output of how the insurance cost is affecting the consumers, whether that's in their premiums or whether that's an deductible that they may have raised, then relative to what that used car value is after that vehicle is fixed. I think we've seen, there might have been a couple increases with a couple months here and there, but we've almost seen two years of declining used car pricing. And so we kind of, and as we talk to people in the industry and outside of the industry, we kind of forecast that used car pricing at some point should moderate, hopefully in the back half of 2025, and start to show some improvement. As those used car values start to increase, it makes it more economical for consumers to repair their vehicles, whether it's from a collision or even general maintenance. And so we think overall some of that headwind of used car pricing should start subsiding, I would say, in the mid-2025 and start to show some improvements in the back half of next year. Brian Butler : Okay, that's helpful. And then on the free cash flow, you maintained it at $850 million for 2024. What capital spending is either being pushed out or foregone kind of to hit that $850 number? And how do we think about that, again, coming back online in 2025? Rick Galloway : Yes, Brian, I can start off and take that. What I talked about, and I think it is important, cash is king, right? So if we look at $850 million, which is what we had all year long talking about our free cash flow, the team has done a tremendous job managing trade working capital. Trade working capital, the usage of our supply chain financing has been going up. The extension of terms. A large focus on trade working capital is the bulk of how we're able to achieve this, even with decline in overall EBITDA dollars. When you look at some of the CapEx items that we're pushing off, there's always a need for it, but we're saying, look, let's make sure that there's nothing that's going to impact our overall earnings, nothing's going to impact our growth. And so there's some of the things that you can delay for three months, six months, something like that, that we're looking at the overall returns. And keep in mind as well, when Justin came on, he looked at the hurdle rates, and he wasn't just talking about acquisitions or divestitures. He's looking at overall hurdle rates. So there's some items that just quite honestly don't pass the hurdle rate that we've got in there. And so there's been a little bit of a change of, look, if it's not going to pass the hurdle rate, there's a better use of our cash. And so that's the way to think of that. It's not delaying repairs or anything like that that would come and sort of increase the number next year because we've delayed it this year. It's more of, it just doesn't pass the hurdle rate, and it's a project that we're probably not just going to do. Brian Butler : Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead. Hi. Gary Prestopino : Hi, good morning, everyone. Justin, you mentioned that in Europe you reviewed 25 product categories, 425,000 SKUs, about 50% of what you want to do. Will this be completed by the end of 2024, and then you can start implementing changes that would benefit going into 2025? Justin Jude : Yes, Gary, we do not forecast that we're going to be completed by the end of 2024. Our expectation is, I mean, you're talking, obviously, hundreds of thousands of SKUs, and you need to understand the market dynamics of what those brands may, whether they're relevant in those markets or not, making sure that we have coverage by an application more so than coverage by a brand. We're projecting that the complete analysis will be done in early 2025, and we'll start to be able to make changes on our SKU, our stocking level of certain SKUs, and start to show some of those improvements, although small, in the back half of 2025. But it won't be done by the end of this year, but it should be done by the early Q1 - early 2025, okay. Gary Prestopino : Okay, and then just lastly, with the exit of operations in Poland and Bosnia, I mean, in Europe, do you have any other small operations that you're considering closing in these various countries, or are you basically done with all that with these smaller cats-and-dog operations? Justin Jude : Yes, Gary, our review of the portfolio is constant, ongoing. There are other smaller operations, both in North America and in Europe, that we're always analyzing. There may be some more on the horizon. Anytime we do investitures or something like that, my preference is just show you, don't tell you about it. So once again, our portfolio review is constant, ongoing, and we'll continue to look at that. Gary Prestopino : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jash Patwa : Hi, good morning. This is Jash Patwa on for Ryan Brinkman. Thanks for taking my questions. Justin, with industry headwinds weighing on top-line growth in the near term and visibility around recovery timeline seemingly low as of now in both North America and Europe, do you expect to see incremental acquisition opportunities in the market as relatively less sophisticated peers start to face the profitability front of these broader headwinds, especially given their lack of pricing discipline? Just trying to gauge if the current environment could provide a conducive environment for accelerated industry consolidation, and whether LKQ would be willing to lean incrementally into M&A if the opportunity arises. Thanks, and I have a quick follow-up. Justin Jude : Yes, I guess, I mean, mainly around the acquisition piece, we have definitely came out publicly and said we're not looking after any large acquisitions with the way our stock prices are now, we're heavily weighted towards share repurchase. There are acquisitions that we'll bring into the company, but these are smaller, synergistic, highly synergistic tuck-in acquisitions that bring returns in the mid-to-upper teens over a short period of time. Think of acquisitions where we may have a market that has three-step distribution. One of our customers is that wholesale distributor, and we can acquire that wholesale distributor that may be our customer and convert that market from three-step to two-step. So, there are some that are opportunities, and we've done some. We'll continue to look at those, but they're going to be small and highly synergistic. Rick Galloway : I think just to add on to one of the things I heard you talking about was consolidation within the overall marketplace. One of the things with LKQ having so many acquisitions over the last 25 years, we're involved with a lot of the discussions, and there's not anything that we're overly concerned about or something that we're seeing that is a major change in the overall market conditions that we won't be able to combat with the footprint that we have and something we're pretty confident on. One thing, the line was a little bit shaky when you were talking. If there's anything that we missed on there, just let us know, and we can respond to that. Jash Patwa : No, that's very helpful color, thanks for that, and I just wanted to get if you could give us an update on the Elitek diagnostics and calibration business, any color around how that business has scaled over the past couple years? How are you anticipating go-forward growth here, and how should we think about the scope and potential implications of the ongoing lawsuit with Repairify? Thanks. Rick Galloway : Yes, on the Elitek piece, majority of our business there is mobile, where we actually have technicians going and augmenting body shops' work to make sure they can calibrate the vehicle and do technical repairs. That business was growing pretty strong for us for a while, but with the repairable claims coming down as we have, it's kind of given some extra free time to body shops, in some cases some of the MSOs, to figure out how to do it internally right now. That business is still strong, good margins for us. The growth has slowed down, but it's still growing. On the Repairify side, any once again, not much of our business is on the mobile I'm sorry, is on the remote piece, but we don't have any concerns with the IP on that case. Jash Patwa : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Bret Jordan : Hi, good morning, guys. On the working capital cash flow that you're seeing. Could you talk about sort of what inning you're at there and how much you'll see still available after you generate cash from working capital this year? Rick Galloway : Yes, Bret, we've been seeing about a 10% improvement when we look at our overall trade working capital, particularly the payables as well as the supply chain financing. We're seeing that again this year. If I look at our European operations, we're up almost 12% versus year end on our supply chain financing program. I would expect we'd probably have another year or two to be able to go with those, and then it starts to weigh in. As far as the working capital goes, we're obviously making a really big push this year, especially with what's going on in the overall market dynamics, to drive free cash flow and make sure that we deliver on the free cash flow commitment that we made at the beginning of the year. And so the team's doing a tremendous job of doing that. I think we have a little bit more time to be able to enhance that going into 2025, and then it starts tapering off probably the back end of 2026. Bret Jordan : Okay, and then I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about competition in Europe. Is that primarily GSF in the U.K., or is there other competition in other regional European markets? And could you maybe parse out dispersion in Europe? You called out Germany and U.K. as weaker. Was Benelux in Italy relatively stronger, or all in the same bucket? Justin Jude : I would say the worst economic ones were the U.K. and Germany, economic slowdown in the Benelux area. Going back to your comment on competition, I mean, obviously GSF is in the U.K. market, but we have competitors in every market for which we operate in. So anytime there's some of those headwinds or market dynamics, sometimes the smaller competitors react differently. But I would say every market, we have several different competitors that we compete with day in and day out. Bret Jordan : Okay, great, thank you. Rick Galloway : One thing, I think we're getting close to the end of the overall questions. One of the things that came in through a couple of the analysts, I just want to make sure we're there, in the effort of doing our simplification and simplifying our new document that we put out for the press release and then also for the earnings presentation, we did pull out gross margin by segment. Let me give that to you. That's something that we don't have a problem giving. I just have pulled it out of the overall document. So I know there's a couple of questions. Craig, I know you had mentioned that as well. In North America, we had 42.8%. In Q3, in Europe, we had 38.4%. In specialty, we had 26.0%. And then in self-service, we had 41.7%. So if that helps you guys with your models, I just want to make sure you have the data on the call. Justin Jude : And with that, it looks like we're going to wrap up the call. I want to give a huge shout out and a huge thanks to our over 50,000 employees for what they do every day. Our industry is facing challenges right now. It's not the first time. It won't be the last time. But I'm extremely proud of each and every one of our employees on how they reacted on the cost structure, how they reacted on making sure that we grew share or did not lose share. Our company, LKQ, with our size and scale and quite honestly, our winning culture, there's nobody that can beat us in the future. So huge thanks to the employees for everything that you guys do. And also huge thanks for all those that participated on the call today. We appreciate it. And we will talk to you guys on the next one. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our call today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.",
