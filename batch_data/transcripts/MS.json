Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements which reflect management\u2019s current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. The presentation may also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our SEC filings at morganstanley.com for a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of Morgan Stanley. This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or instrument. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman. James Gorman : Thank you, Celeste. Good morning everybody and thanks for joining us. Before I comment on our performance this quarter, I\u2019ll discuss our thoughts on capital returns both for this year and for the medium to long term. The recently completed CCAR was a significant inflection point for us. As you know, we secured a non-objection to increase our capital returns. We respect the CCAR process and made significant investments in that process over the past several years and we have a program specifically focused on continuing to raise the bar each cycle. In 2013, we asked for and received a non-objection to maintain our dividend and the ability to purchase the balance of the wealth management business. In mid-2013, we applied for our first buyback since 2007 of $500 million. In this latest CCAR, we applied to double the dividend, our first increase since 2007 and a $1 billion buyback. We intend to (indiscernible) to our capital request in future years. Going forward, we will look to drive our dividend yield to at least levels commensurate with the broader S&P, which has historically been around 2%, sustained by growing earnings from wealth and investment management. In fact, an 80 to 100% payout on just the earnings from wealth and investment management suggests an annual dividend at two or three times our recent increased level just based on 2013 earnings and share count. In addition to growing our dividend substantially, we expect to continue to increase our buyback with a focus on both mitigating employee issuance and reducing our share count. Share buybacks will make up the difference between dividends and the total payouts which we intend to drive toward 100% of churn earnings over the next several years. Now clearly when we can do this is obviously a function of regulatory approval. Turning now to the businesses in the first quarter, in challenging markets for institutional and retail investors, we drove our revenues and PBT higher across our three business segments versus a year ago as we continued to execute against our strategic plan. Ex-DVA, our revenues were up 4% versus the first quarter of 2013 while our expenses were up 1%. Our expense ratios improved across the segments and our overall earnings per share grew 13%. In fact, ex-DVA our earnings grew despite a significantly higher tax rate than a year ago. ROTE from continuing operations excluding DVA improved as well to 9.8% while ROE improved to 8.3%, up 130 basis points and 80 basis points year-over-year respectively. We continue to work towards sustainably higher ROEs across all of our businesses through the execution of our strategy with a particular focus on growth in the bank, which we believe is substantial, as well as on a fixed income ROE and our broader firm-wide expenses. I look forward to your questions at the end of the call. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Ruth to discuss the results in detail. Ruth Porat : Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures. The impact of DVA in the quarter was positive $126 million with $76 million in fixed income sales and trading and $50 million in equities sales and trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues were $8.8 billion, up 7% versus the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate from continuing operations was 33%. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders excluding DVA were approximately $1.3 billion. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share excluding DVA were $0.68 after preferred dividends. On a GAAP basis including the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues for the quarter were $8.9 billion, earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $1.4 billion, reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.72 after preferred dividends. Book value at the end of the quarter was $32.38 per share and tangible book value was $27.41 per share. Turning to the balance sheet, our total assets were $835 billion at March 31. Deposits at quarter-end were $117 billion, up $4 billion versus 4Q. Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $203 billion compared with $202 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Turning to capital, although our calculations are not final, we believe that our common equity Tier 1 transitional ratio will be approximately 14.1% and our Tier 1 capital ratio under this regime will be approximately 15.6%. Risk-weighted assets are expected to be approximately $398 billion at March 31. Reflecting our best estimate of the final Federal Reserve rules, our common equity Tier 1 ratio using the pro forma Basel III fully phased in advanced approach was 11.6% at March 31. Our pro forma standardized ratio was 10.2%. We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio under the recent U.S. regulatory proposal to be approximately 4.2%. For reference, under the prior methodology, our supplementary leverage ratio is 4.5%, up from 4.2%. These estimates are preliminary and are subject to revision. We continue to expect to see the required 5% level in 2015, including an assumption for increasing returns of capital to shareholders despite the Fed\u2019s recently announced more demanding requirements. In addition to the mitigation items we highlighted on the fourth quarter call, we see opportunities to mitigate the recent inclusion of the CDS long add-on through steps such as compression, re-hedging, and roll down. Turning to expenses, our total expenses this quarter were $6.6 billion, down 18% versus the fourth quarter due to significantly lower legal expense, seasonality, and our focus on cost reduction. Compensation expense was up 8% versus the prior quarter on higher revenue. Non-compensation expense was $2.3 billion primarily reflecting lower legal expenses, seasonality, and cost management. Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In institutional securities, revenues excluding DVA were $4.5 billion, up 21% sequentially. Non-interest expense was $3.3 billion, down 29% versus the fourth quarter. Compensation was $1.9 billion for the first quarter, up versus the fourth quarter on higher revenue, reflecting a 41% ratio excluding DVA. The decline in non-compensation expense to $1.4 billion primarily reflected significantly lower legal expenses. The business reported a pre-tax profit of $1.2 billion excluding the impact of DVA. Including the impact of DVA, revenues were $4.6 billion and pre-tax profit was $1.4 billion. In investment banking, revenues of $1.1 billion were down 17% versus last quarter, reflecting seasonality. Results represent strong performance for our first quarter across all products. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked number one in global announced M&A and number two in global IPOs and global equity and equity linked at the end of the first quarter. Notable transactions included : in advisory, Morgan Stanley acted as advisor on the five largest transactions, including as exclusive financial advisor to WhatsApp on its $16 billion sale to Facebook \u2013 this transaction reflects Morgan Stanley\u2019s continued leadership in the largest and most complex transactions in the technology sector; and as exclusive financial advisor to Suntory Holdings in its acquisition of Beam Inc. for $16 billion. This continues our leadership in cross-border activity as well as in Japan. In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as joint global coordinator for the $2 billion IPO of Altice Group. This is the largest ever IPO of a cable operator in EMEA. Morgan Stanley also recently acted as lead financial advisor to Altice Numericable on its acquisition of Vivendi\u2019s phone unit, SFR, including acting as joint book runner on its \u20ac16 billion of non-investment grade acquisition financing. In debt underwriting, Morgan Stanley also acted as active book runner for Exxon Mobile Corporation\u2019s $5.5 billion offering of senior unsecured notes. This transaction is Exxon\u2019s first U.S. dollar senior unsecured debt offering. Advisory revenues of $336 million declined 25% versus our fourth quarter results due primarily to seasonality. Announced advisory transactions were up significantly versus a year ago. Equity underwriting revenues of $315 million were down 24% versus the fourth quarter driven by lower global market volumes and typical seasonality. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $485 million, essentially flat to the fourth quarter as market activity remained at very high levels. Equity sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were $1.7 billion, an increase of 13% from last quarter. Revenues were strong across regions and products driven by higher client activity. Case revenues were up driven by increased volumes in all regions. Prime brokerage revenues were up significantly driven by higher balances and robust client portfolio management activities. Derivatives revenues grew as volatility trended higher. Fixed income and commodities sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were $1.7 billion, up significantly from the fourth quarter. Revenues increased significantly in all major products. Commodities saw broad-based strength across the energy complex driven by extreme weather in North America and increased client demand. Revenues outside of commodities were driven higher by seasonality and strength in credit products. Average trading VAR for the first quarter was $50 million, essentially flat to the fourth quarter. Turning to wealth management, revenues were $3.6 billion in the first quarter. Asset management revenues of $2 billion were up versus last quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher market levels at the beginning of the period and positive flows. Transaction revenues decreased 10% from last quarter, consisting primarily of commissions of $540 million, down 6% versus the prior quarter due to fewer trading days; investment banking-related fees of $181 million, down 12% versus last quarter, reflecting a lower U.S. equity underwriting calendar, most notably with fewer closed-in funds; and trading revenues of $275 million, down 15% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting lower gains in deferred compensation plans. Net interest revenue increased 2% to $539 million driven primarily by higher revenues from our bank deposit program and continued growth in our lending products. Other revenue decreased to $62 million from $110 million. Net interest expense was $2.9 billion, down 3% versus last quarter. The compensation ratio was 60%, up versus the fourth quarter due to seasonality. Non-compensation expense was $762 million, down 13% versus last quarter due to the absence of an impairment charge as well as continued expense discipline. The PBT margin was 19%. Profit before tax was $691 million. Total client assets surpassed $1.9 trillion. Global fee-based asset flows were $19 billion, a record level. Fee-based assets under management increased to a record $724 billion at quarter-end, representing 37% of client assets. Global representatives were 16,426, essentially flat to the fourth quarter. Bank deposits were $132 billion, down $1.6 billion versus the fourth quarter. Approximately $108 billion were held in Morgan Stanley banks. We continued to grow our wealth management lending balances and increase our penetration rates with our retail client base. Our mortgage balances increased 10% and our PLA balances increased 9%, while our committed undrawn PLA facilities grew at an even more rapid pace. Investment management revenues of $740 million were down 12% from the fourth quarter. In traditional asset management, revenues of $437 million were up 2% from the fourth quarter driven by higher market levels and client flows. In real estate investing, revenues of $131 million were down 18% driven by lower investment gains. Merchant banking revenues were $172 million, down 32% driven by a tough comparison to very strong investment gains in the fourth quarter. Expenses were $477 million, down 6% from the fourth quarter due to declines in compensation and non-compensation expenses. Profit before tax was $263 million, down 22% sequentially. MCI was $54 million versus $46 million last quarter. Total assets under management increased to $382 billion driven by market appreciation and increased flows. Turning to our outlook, as we begin the second quarter, our investment banking pipeline is strong across all products. M&A is particularly robust. The pipeline is growing with an increase in activity from EMEA and Asia. On the financing side, the flow is healthy for both equity and fixed income underwriting. With respect to sales and trading, overall economic and market conditions continue to be favorable for equities; however, the challenges that weighed on certain parts of fixed income markets for much the quarter persist. On the retail side, trading activity is consistent with levels we saw in the first quarter, though we enter the tailwind from higher equity markets. In addition, we continue to have momentum with FA adoption and client penetration is increasing, an important driver of growth, profitability, and increased earnings consistency. Over the last several years, we have assiduously worked to reposition our businesses in a way that is aligned with regulatory change. We have made the tough decisions, provided metrics to demonstrate our progress, and have a suite of businesses that are complementary. Thank you for listening, and James and I will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hello. So I have a couple parter on commodities first, just if you could frame how much of a contributor it was to FIC in the quarter, whether it be relative to last year or prior peaks \u2013 obviously something went very well there. Ruth Porat : Well, there were a number of important factors in the overall FIC performance, strength in commodities clearly being a big driver given volatility in the market due to weather and robust client activity; but as I noted, we also had strength in credit corporate and mortgages, and those continue to be strong areas for us. So overall, it was up meaningfully. It was the biggest driver in year-over-year performance. Glenn Schorr : Okay, and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything you can update us on. There\u2019s one of the competitors sold a piece of their physical business. You guys have been contemplating that. A, if there\u2019s an update on that/ and b, in the quarter how much of a contributor was that, just for the thought process on the go-forward? Ruth Porat : Sure, yeah. To try and help you size it, you exclude the two physical oil businesses that we\u2019re selling, overall fixed income was up slightly year-over-year on a percentage basis, so still up excluding those two physical oil businesses. And then in terms of where we stand on that, we\u2019re continuing to work on the sale of Transmontaigne and we\u2019ll give you an update when we have something more to say on that. Glenn Schorr : Okay, that\u2019s cool. You also mentioned and we could see it in the numbers, prime brokerage is doing awesome. Curious on how you weigh that business doing as good as it\u2019s doing with the fact that you still have the lowest leverage ratio in the group and have some work to do. So I heard your comments on what you can do in derivs land, but is there any pricing benefit that you can pass through on prime brokerage? Just curious how you balance that. Ruth Porat : Well, I think there are really two different points within your question. Prime brokerage is a gem franchise for us. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time talking about how we manage our business across nine boxes, product on the one hand, cash, derivatives and PB and geography on the other hand \u2013 Americas, Europe and Asia \u2013 and we manage really intently within each box. But over many quarters, I\u2019ve talked about the importance of adjacencies, in particular with our PB clients. The deeper we go with them, the deeper they go across our franchise, so we think have a very positive, strong, mutually productive relationship with our PB clients, and that\u2019s an important franchise for us. If I switch to the leverage part of your question, in our view we have a very strong, clear path to improve our leverage ratio, and it is consistent with the business strategy we\u2019ve talked about. The real levers are things that go to things like compression trades or RWA rundown and spec, so that\u2019s a very different answer. It doesn\u2019t affect what we are talking about here on the PB franchise side. Glenn Schorr : Okay, cool. I appreciate that. Last one \u2013 without opening too many cans of worms here, I wanted to get your thoughts on all the focus on high frequency and what it means for your equity business. How can you help us frame that? That would be super-helpful. Ruth Porat : Sure. You know, since 2009 Morgan Stanley has been very vocal with regulators and has been on the record about the necessity for changes to market structure to protect clients. We\u2019ve advocated for increased transparency and trading protocol. You can see that in docs we\u2019ve filed with regulators as far back as 2009 \u2013 they\u2019re all in the public domain, so we welcome ongoing enhancement to equity market structure. I think we\u2019ve been a leading voice in this area for a long time and in fact we\u2019ve implemented protocol and governance consistent with this in our business. Glenn Schorr : And then maybe just to be annoying, the book mentions a really big number for Speedway, and I think it controls a lot of volume. I don\u2019t know if you want to help us with what\u2019s the real number in terms of contribution or size that. Ruth Porat : Well, just to clarify what it is, it\u2019s an execution tool in our electronic trading toolkit. It\u2019s consistent with offerings across the Street. We make it available to all our clients, many of whom you\u2019re familiar with, and the key to us in all that we do is risk management. Risk management checks add latency, and latency is inconsistent with extreme speed strategies. And also to clear up any source of confusion, it facilitates connectivity only to (indiscernible) around the world. It doesn\u2019t connect to any dark pool anywhere, and overall H&Ps (ph) are not a meaningful driver of our business. Glenn Schorr : Okay, that\u2019s good for me. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Guy Moszkowski : Thanks, good morning. I noticed that the capital allocated to the institutional business came down by about $1.5 billion linked quarter. Is that directly related to RWA reductions that you would have had in the fixed income business, or it more complicated than that? And if it is, maybe you can explain to us what\u2019s driving it. Ruth Porat : Sure. It is more complicated than that, but we did have a further reduction in risk-weighted assets in fixed income. They\u2019re in fact down to $199 billion as of the first quarter, down from $210 billion in the fourth quarter, so continuing to make progress there. The way we calculate required capital is based on whatever the capital regime is in place at a point in time. In this quarter as a result of the regime change, in particular with the Basel I numerator moving to the transitional Basel III numerator, that drove the capital reallocation. The Basel III transitional numerator by definition has deductions that phase in over time, so in managing the business we look towards a Basel III fully phased in lens. There are a couple of moving pieces \u2013 yes, we reduced the risk-weighted assets, but the biggest driver here at the table is the regime change. Guy Moszkowski : Got it. And if I can just relate the comment that you made about the increase in the old-style SLR in the quarter, which I think you alluded to about 30 basis points, how does that relate to the target that you laid out back in January for a 30 or 40 basis point increase just from exposure, compression and the like? Is that being driven by that, or were there other puts and takes? Ruth Porat : So there were a number of drivers. As I said, we\u2019re still very comfortable \u2013 greater than 5% in 2015, and with increasing returns of capital. This quarter in the numerator, we benefited from higher earnings, and as we talked in prior calls, that adds what I keep calling a multiplier effect because it reduces the deductions on DTAs, and importantly it also increases the investment capacity for those items that get into that 10% bucket, thereby reducing the numerator deduction. In addition to that, we have been quite focused on mitigating some of the numerator deductions, so you\u2019re seeing the benefit of that beginning to flow through, and then in the denominator of course we continue in with compression trades in RWA reductions, as I indicated. Guy Moszkowski : Got it, and then just to beat a little bit on the SLR horse, there has been a proposal made just in the month of March by Basel\u2014people assign different acronyms to it, but I\u2019ve heard SACCR, which would be a standardized approach to counterparty credit, which I\u2019ve heard broadly could be a plus as well. I was wondering if you had done any numbers on that preliminarily. Ruth Porat : Yeah, if SACCR is adopted, that would be about a 50 basis point benefit to the SLR and a 30 basis point benefit to the standardized ratio. Guy Moszkowski : Wow, so it\u2019s quite meaningful. Ruth Porat : It is. Guy Moszkowski : And you\u2019re calling it SACCR \u2013 is that a patented Morgan Stanley term? Ruth Porat : You can use it if you want. Guy Moszkowski : Okay, thanks. I guess the only other question that I would really have would be if you could\u2014you know, we talked a little bit about commodities and the fact that fixed income would still have been up, or FIC would still have been up year-over-year even with the planned sales having taken place. Can you give us a little bit more color on what you saw in the rates business in the quarter, because obviously for banks that have a heavier contribution from rates and from FX, so what\u2019s called the macro businesses, we saw much, much weaker results so far. Ruth Porat : Well look, I think that we\u2014and I said this\u2014and we saw the same headwinds you\u2019ve heard from others with lower client activity. That was a tougher market, just given all that was going on in the environment. For our rates business, it was down year-over-year, reflecting lower volumes, but up nicely versus last quarter. We are really focused on this centralized, federalized resource management across all of the macro product, but it was a tougher part of the market. Guy Moszkowski : Got it. So mix was just one of the more important differentiators for you guys, I guess? Ruth Porat : It was. As I said, it was commodities, it was credit, it was mortgage. Guy Moszkowski : Right. Just one final question on wealth management \u2013 a 10% increase in the loan balances linked quarter is obviously strategically what we want to see, but it is a very large percentage on what\u2019s starting to be a fairly sizeable business. How comfortable are you that your risk controls are where they need to be in what\u2019s obviously been a tough mortgage market? Ruth Porat : So the growth\u2014again, we\u2019ve got a couple of things going for us. One is very low penetration with a very large client base. We\u2019re meaningfully underpenetrated versus our peers, and we\u2019ve been slow to build this product precisely for the reason you flagged, which is top of our list, which is ensure tight, proper credit risk management and all of the processes around it, as well as ensuring that it\u2019s a good experience for our clients and our financial advisors. So it\u2019s up a nice percentage. I would say the other thing that\u2019s benefiting that is it\u2019s up a nice percentage off of a small number, and we\u2019re continuing to see good growth in the mortgage side given this low penetration. We\u2019re finding that FAs who use the product are using it longer and increasing their penetration. The credit standards are very tight \u2013 you know, FICO (indiscernible) 50, LTV 60%; and again, it\u2019s with our client base so we know the clients. We have their assets here. The other growth area in PLA is a very\u2014is the highly over-collateralized, significantly over-collateralized product, as I think you know. It\u2019s securities-based lending, and again it\u2019s all with our existing client base. There\u2019s virtually no credit losses to date, and risk management has been the driver across all of these businesses. Guy Moszkowski : Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning guys. So just a real quick one to clarify, I believe, Ruth, you said that your IB backlog is up. Just wanted to make sure \u2013 is that based on year-end, because Goldman highlighted that their IB backlog actually shrunk since year-end. Ruth Porat : So our backlog is up across all products from year-end. M&A, as I noted, in particular is strong and the pipeline continues to build. I think you can see that just from the flurry of announcements that have occurred since quarter-end. Brennan Hawken : Yeah \u2013 no, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s just good to see continued momentum there. Then another one \u2013 the CCAR was sort of a surprise here to some firms this year, and I guess the Fed highlighted some process improvements in their comments. Do you guys have any outstanding process improvements with the Fed, and was there anything in that CCAR process that sort of jumped out that investors should be aware of? Ruth Porat : So I think the whole industry is waiting kind of the formal Fed feedback process, but I think\u2014you know, we generally received positive feedback about our processes. As James said in his opening comments, we\u2019ve invested meaningfully in the process and for the last several years, we had something we call our CIP program \u2013 continuous improvement program. So regardless of what we even hear back, we look to up the approach and the analytics each year, and that process hasn\u2019t stopped. We continue to raise the bar for ourselves on the overall process. We feel good about our processes around CCAR. Brennan Hawken : Terrific. And is it your view that the Fed feels good about your processes as well? I understand you can\u2019t\u2014based on the information you received from the Fed, is that your perception? James Gorman : Brennan, I don\u2019t think we want to get in the business of trying to explain what the Fed\u2019s view or isn\u2019t. All that mattered to us is we put in for a buyback and dividend and they are approved, and we\u2019re continuing down the path that we laid out. Brennan Hawken : Appreciate it. Just trying to maybe get some insights into what is proving to be a very murky process for all of us on this end. James Gorman : Understood. Brennan Hawken : Then is it right that you guys have slimmed down your management structure in wealth management? I think we saw a reduction in the number of divisions and regions. And maybe, could you help us think about whether that\u2019s driven by potential expense basics or whether that\u2019s done to slim down decision-making and the like. Maybe help us understand that move a little bit. James Gorman : I think it\u2019s probably what I would describe as the last gasp post-the integration. This has been a four-year integration, and now that the business is very stable, I think the FA account was flat to maybe modestly up. The new leadership under Shelley O\u2019Connor determined that she could make some changes there to just make the organization faster moving, a little more nimble, a little more efficient, and put the team in place to make that happen. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. James Gorman : No problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi. So to the extent that prime brokerage has performed better, can you give us any numbers around that \u2013 what are the prime brokerage revenues this quarter versus a year or two ago, or can you give us some market share figures around your prime brokerage business? Ruth Porat : Well as you know, we don\u2019t break out components within businesses. The client balances and revenues are all up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Mike Mayo : Okay, and how does it compare to the time of the crisis? I remember a lot of clients were leaving Morgan Stanley and then they\u2019ve come back. Have you gotten back to pre-crisis levels? Do you expect to get back there? Ruth Porat : These are the highest balances that we\u2019ve had since the crisis. We\u2019ve continued to nicely steadily build. Mike Mayo : Okay. Shifting over to wealth management, you\u2019re redeploying the deposits. What are the yields and margin that you\u2019re getting as you deploy those deposits? Ruth Porat : So last quarter in the deck, we laid out a couple of things because we thought it was important as everyone was doing their analysis that we show you what the asset growth would be and the changing mix over time as we moved from cash into FAS and loan deployment and included yields there, current yields, and then just to follow the forward yield curve. Those really haven\u2019t\u2014you know, we\u2019re getting the benefit of the improving mix, but yield by product hasn\u2019t really changed much, as you can see, with the rate environment. But really, the upside to us is the ongoing deployment across the portfolio. Mike Mayo : Separately, I\u2019m looking at your deck from January where you said you wanted to drive ROE above 10% in fixed income and commodities. Did you exceed that in the first quarter, and how is that progressing? Ruth Porat : Well, we\u2019ve certainly had progress because you can see the revenues, and I just provided the RWAs. So we\u2019ve had higher revenues, reduced RWAs, now down to $199 billion \u2013 that\u2019s relative to the $210 billion last quarter, and to about 250-ish last year. So we\u2019re certainly getting better returns in that business, and our view is that we have more do to there. As we said, when we look at ROE and we\u2019re managing to ROE in that business, it\u2019s about revenues, expenses and capital optimization, and the team is continuing to focus on all of those. Mike Mayo : Can you give us any update on the run-off of legacy assets in FIC? Ruth Porat : I think you sort of get that, Mike, in the RWA rundown. So that\u2019s a combination of passive and active, and part of the active is how trades are structured and part of it is actually running down as much as we can as rapidly as we can. So if you go back to third quarter of \u201911, we had $390 billion of risk-weighted assets in our fixed income business, and as you know, we keep bringing forward our target in time. We dropped for that $180 billion from 2016 to 2015, and what that really captures is your question \u2013 we\u2019re running down those legacy assets as rapidly as we can. We are pleased to have that deadweight capital pushed out of the business. Mike Mayo : And then my last question \u2013 your ROE target is for a 9% ROE, and this quarter you\u2019re still below that. Can you either re-affirm or give us a time frame when you think you\u2019ll achieve your ROE target? I\u2019m not seeing return on tangible common equity \u2013 if you can give that to us, too. Ruth Porat : Right. So on the ROE, we\u2019re looking at an ROE in excess of cost of capital. We\u2019re talking about a 10% ROE. I appreciate you\u2019re looking at the building blocks we provided last quarter. We did see progress across our businesses, and our view is that the upside continues to come from the bank. It\u2019s in its early days, and given the opportunity with the bank and moving again from over-weighted in cash to deployment into loans as well as AFFs, there\u2019s a real benefit there, the continued focus on expense management and then the ongoing higher return to capital. That 9% number is obviously without higher capital returns. We\u2019re pleased to have doubled our dividend, doubled our share repurchase program, and as James said, our intent is to continue increasing return to capital over time. Mike Mayo : So just to be clear, so now your target\u2014since you\u2019re able to return capital now, your target is now 10% return on common equity? Ruth Porat : Our target has consistently been 10%. What we tried to break out last quarter was what it would be without higher return to capital, and then the return to capital takes it above and beyond that. But we continue to be focused on 10% return on capital as kind of the next stop along the way. Mike Mayo : Okay, and this quarter return on tangible common equity was what? Ruth Porat : Nine-point-three\u20149.8, I apologize Mike. Nine-point-eight. Mike Mayo : Okay, 9.8. Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chubak with Nomura. Steve Chubak : Good morning. I wanted to discuss your 10% FIC ROE target for a moment. Clearly the progress you\u2019ve made in mitigating RWAs has been nothing short of extraordinary, which has driven required capital levels down pretty meaningfully. What I\u2019m wondering is given the tough treatment for derivatives under the modified SLR approach, even when we contemplate some of the future benefits from various forms of mitigation, whether it\u2019s CDS maturity matching, SACCR model approval, et cetera, it appears that required capital for FIC under the modified SLR calculation could still be pretty materially above that under the risk-based framework. So essentially, I just wanted to clarify that the 10% FIC ROE target which you\u2019ve highlighted in the past is still achievable whether one evaluates under a leveraged or a risk-based lens. Ruth Porat : Yes, and we look at our businesses under a risk-based and leverage-based capital lens now. It\u2019s the current leverage-based capital rule; but again, we have the added lens of what\u2019s at the SLR and business unit leaders have their balance sheet under that SLR lens, and that\u2019s helping really put a spotlight on the opportunities for mitigation in the areas where mitigation is absolutely key. So as you pointed out in your question, there are additional work streams that can added to that, which we discussed last quarter, with the inclusion now of net long CDS, so that opens up an added work stream. So we do see a good path forward to greater than 5% under the SLR, including higher return to capital; and yes, we hold ourselves accountable for that greater of risk-based capital and leverage-based capital. Steve Chubak : Okay, thanks. That\u2019s really helpful. One of the things I wanted to inquire about was the Fed had clearly stated its plan to consider applying additional capital surcharges on wholesale borrowings. The details that have been disclosed thus far regarding the methodology or the potential approach remain somewhat murky, but I wanted to see if you had any additional thoughts or insights regarding how that rule-making could potentially shake out. Ruth Porat : So you\u2019re right \u2013 the rule is\u2014the discussion at this point is unclear. I think the terms that have been used, such as short term wholesale funding is one phrase. We talk a lot about the difference between short-term wholesale funding and durable funding, and we\u2019ve invested quite meaningfully, as we\u2019ve talked about on many calls, to term out our secured book, and that\u2019s built in durability that has been evident in all sorts of periods of market stress, market stress in Europe. We think that liquidity durability is important. You know, our LCR, we\u2019re well north of the 100% requirement in large part because of all that we\u2019ve done, all that we\u2019ve invested. I mean, it doesn\u2019t come for free \u2013 it\u2019s expensive to term it out and get that durability, but we have an LCR that\u2019s higher than 100% for that reason and we\u2019re very supportive of the Federal Reserve\u2019s focus on CLAR, the mirror test of CCAR but focused on liquidity, given all that we\u2019ve done to build in what is a very durable approach to liquidity and funding. So don\u2019t know which way it goes because some terms are being used in a sort of broad way; but again, given what we\u2019ve done with our capital stack, we feel that we\u2019ve built in a lot of the durability that is what regulators are looking for. Steve Chubak : Okay, and I guess one more question on the SLR proposal. Parsing out the language in the Fed\u2019s document, it highlighted two key size criteria for identifying systemically important banks, one being GAAP assets in excess of $700 billion and AUC in excess of $10 trillion. Based on your interpretation of the Fed proposal, do you believe that the GSIV (ph) classification can potentially be avoided for those banks which operate below those designated thresholds, and specifically would you consider optimizing your balance sheet size if it enabled you to potentially bypass the tougher 5% leverage rule, or is that simply not a viable strategic option given growth initiatives at the bank and other potential opportunities that will drive future balance sheet growth? Ruth Porat : Well, given our suite of businesses and the strength of these businesses, we don\u2019t see going below $700 billion as practical. In particular, we see the opportunity to mitigate a number of the items, as I\u2019ve already discussed, both the gross up in the denominator and reduce some of the deductions in the numerator, which are accretive to the SLR. If you look at some of the\u2014the relationship across our various businesses, so for example as I talked about on prior calls, within our investment banking franchise, quarter after quarter after quarter, we\u2019ve had about $500 million of fixed income underwriting, and that\u2019s a service that our clients want, it\u2019s accretive to the overall relationship, it\u2019s accretive to the bottom line for the firm, and it does require that we have a corporate credit capability \u2013 you know, origination and distribution. So there are a lot of linkages between the businesses, increasingly so with the wealth management business, and our view is that when we look to the single most important thing, which is how do we drive ROE for this firm given there is a path to increase the SLR that enables us to keep the suite of products as we\u2019ve defined them and as we\u2019ve reshaped what we\u2019re doing in fixed income, our judgment is that the best way to drive ROE is with this suite of products, and we don\u2019t see how that would take us lower than $700 billion of assets. Steve Chubak : Okay, understood. And just one final one on the numerator upside you had discussed regarding the SLR. We really appreciate the helpful detail in terms of the individual components that you disaggregated driving the 80 basis point build in the SLR over\u2014towards that 5% goal. I was hoping you could at least clarify the level of incremental preferred issuance that\u2019s assumed to help close that gap, just to get some clarify on those which will impact future earnings versus those which will have\u2014essentially be earnings neutral. Ruth Porat : Sure. So the\u2014as you saw, we did about $2 billion of preferred last year \u2013 that was in two transactions. We will continue to optimize our capital stack and do think that preferred plays a valuable role in that, so we\u2019re going to continue to leg into more over time. I think when you\u2014you know, the two that we did last year, you can see that we tried to size them\u2014modestly size them or appropriately size them, whatever word you want to use for it, and we\u2019ll continue to leg into more of time. So that is another addition to the numerator. I would say that what we\u2019re quite pleased about is the pace with which we\u2019ve been able to mitigate a number of those numerator deductions, and that investment basket has within it a couple of opportunities to continue to mitigate some of the numerator drag. Steve Chubak : That\u2019s great. Thank you for taking my questions, and congrats on a strong quarter. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Can you update us on the expense efforts? Obviously good revenue this quarter, so expenses were higher; but it sounded like in the past that there\u2019s still some opportunities within FIC to manage the expense base. I was hoping for an update either on FIC expenses or just overall expenses. Ruth Porat : So we\u2019re very much on track for the expense target ratio that we laid out at the end of 2012, going into 2013; and just as a reminder, at the time we had an 84% expense ratio, and with the $1.6 billion reduction, assuming revenue\u2019s constant so you don\u2019t have to adjust for the noise around activity-based revenues, we said we would get to a 79% expense ratio, excluding elevated legal expenses and, if there any write-offs, any write-offs, and that would be by the end of 2014. This quarter, we\u2019re at a 75% expense ratio excluding DVA, so I think what that underscores is expense\u2014you know, very much part of the DNA of all of our business leaders. We have the balance of the year to continue focusing on expense reduction, but it\u2019s built into programs across all of the various businesses and we\u2019re constantly looking for ways to add to the program. It doesn\u2019t end this year; it keeps going. It\u2019s just business as usual at this point, but we\u2019re pleased that we\u2019re at a 75% expense ratio relative to that 79% with still more time to get to the end of the year, when we said we would hit that number. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, and if the revenue environment improves, a little bit tougher from here in, say, the markets businesses, do you feel like you can still maintain the expense ratio around here, or still look back towards a 79% goal? Ruth Porat : So what we indicated was that we would be at a 79\u2014back at the end of 2012 when we laid out the $1.6 billion, we said a 79% expense ratio assuming revenues were flat to 2012. Again, depending on where the world goes, I think what we\u2019ve evidenced over the last many years here is that we don\u2019t stand still, but we\u2019re pleased with the way we\u2019re starting off the year. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Outside of the core expenses, it didn\u2019t seem like there was any unusual litigation this quarter. I know it\u2019s really hard to tell looking forward, but any thoughts on how we should be modeling out litigation expense from here? Ruth Porat : Well, you sort of answered the question \u2013 it is lumpy, as you\u2019ve seen. Our view is that litigation does remain a headwind for the industry. We\u2019re pleased to have FHFA behind us, but legal can be lumpy, as you\u2019ve seen. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just switching to the wealth management, the 19% PBT was in line with what we had for this quarter. Just any updates on how you feel about the 22 to 25% target by the end of next year? Ruth Porat : We still feel very good about that, and I\u2019ll hold that as something that we are looking to deliver. As you know, that doesn\u2019t assume any benefit from rates in the environment. We\u2019ve got a number of factors that are taking that higher. I think one of the important ones really is what we\u2019re continuing to do with lending product and the benefit from the growth in lending, and you can see the ongoing momentum there. What we\u2019re pleased about is we\u2019ve always said we have a bit of a tailwind given we\u2019re underpenetrated with our clients, and what we\u2019re seeing is as FAs starting working with their clients with lending product, they continue to further penetrate their client base and we see much more of a take-up. So that is an important element of it, along with, back to your prior question, the continued focus on expense management. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. All right, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of American Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier : Thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe a follow up on the wealth management business. You mentioned some seasonality in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter, I think fewer days. Maybe just a little color on the comp \u2013 Matt just asked about the margin, about how that impacts it, and just the outlook as we kind of go throughout the year, just assuming less seasonality. Ruth Porat : So as you said, seasonality comes from a couple of things. One is several fewer trading days relative to the fourth quarter. There\u2019s also seasonality on the comp line because FICA is a first quarter event, so when we compare our 19% quarter this year to our 17% quarter last year, that\u2019s really isolating the difference in quarterly seasonality and a nice pick-up from the 17% last year to the 19% this year. What we also saw in the first quarter this year was some lower issuance activity, in particular in closed end funds, and what\u2019s of greatest interest within the wealth management system is U.S. new issue product, and in particular closed in funds, and that was just a bit lower. We had a nice underwriting calendar but it was more skewed outside of the U.S. and very little in closed end fund activity. So as we\u2019re looking forward to the second quarter, we have a couple tailwinds going into the second quarter. Asset management fees will be modestly higher given the starting S&P level, and we\u2019re clearly focused on the transaction volume which is a function of the environment and the new issue calendar; but the pipeline is stronger in the U.S. It\u2019s clearly too early to tell, but it\u2019s stronger in the U.S. And then in aggregate, expenses should be a bit lower given the comp point I made \u2013 FICA being a first quarter event, and non-comps do tend to be a little bit higher in the second quarter but overall should result in an improved margin here. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks. And then just as a follow-up, just on the trading side, whether it\u2019s on equities or fixed income, anything lumpy this quarter, and then any color\u2014I know it\u2019s still early, but on the fixed income side in terms of the OTC markets transitioning on to SEF, like any color there. Thanks. Ruth Porat : So as it relates\u2014nothing really lumpy to note. I mean, we had\u2014there was a good volume of activity, prime brokerage activity with portfolio rebalancing, just given volatility in equity markets; and then in terms of the impact of SEF on the market, we really think the lower volumes last quarter were related to broader market events, and in particular lower volumes in macro, as I\u2019ve already commented on, given all that was going on globally, and markets lack conviction \u2013 they traded in a tight range. Spread product did better, but macro was weaker, and we think it\u2019s very tough to disaggregate the extent to which, if at all, that was really SEF-related. We think that it was swamped by what was going on in macro. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Good morning. Just a quick follow-up on the expense question. I just want to check \u2013 if you think about your closest competitor on an apples-to-apples basis, they\u2019re at around a 70% expense ratio. You guys are 75% in the strongest quarter, a target of 79%. Do you think this is an interim target and you can get more as you move forward as revenues get better, and/or you still have some more expense leverage elsewhere? Can you just kind of walk through that? Ruth Porat : Well, I obviously can\u2019t comment on any other peers, and we each have different business mixes. You know, I\u2019m often asked the question about our comp ratio, as an example, and the comp ratio in wealth management is off of a formulaic grid so it starts higher than their institutional securities business. And is it trending lower? Yes, it absolutely is trending lower. We\u2019ve talked about that quite a bit. It will continue to benefit from the growth in lending product, but you\u2019ve got some real apples-to-oranges comparisons if you just start with that line. As it relates to our non-comp expenses, we\u2019re continuing to see benefit across the franchise, the ability to use technology more broadly across the franchise as an example, and so we are focused on the items that we identified internally as part of the 2014 plan, as I said. We\u2019re continuing to add to it because it\u2019s part of the DNA within all of the business unit leaders to look for opportunities to be efficient, whether it\u2019s working across divisions or in any other approach to the business. But just going back to my comp differential, I\u2019d say part of it is also business mix. And to be clear, those business mixes also have different capital requirements, and there are a whole host of different elements that go along with it. So when we talk about ROE, it\u2019s revenue, expenses and capital. Jim Mitchell : Fair enough. I was just talking about the institutional business, but I hear your point. Maybe just quickly another question on the dividend. I think James had mentioned looking at a payout that would approximately or get close to the net income of the wealth management business, but as that business grows, it seems like if you were to approach that level of dividend payout, you\u2019d exceed the sort of 30% soft cap with the Fed. Do you think that is doable? James Gorman : I don\u2019t want to get into sort of hard projections, but what we\u2019re indicating is that with our business mix now, with half the firm\u2019s business essentially coming from a relatively stable annuitized set of businesses in wealth and asset management, one thinks about your dividend payout a little bit differently as it relates to your ability to afford it coming from things that you know are fairly predictable. Obviously when you aggregate it all, you come up against what appropriate payout levels are at a regulated level, and that\u2019s a different question. We\u2019re simply indicating we believe we have capacity, given our business mix. Jim Mitchell : Okay \u2013 no, that\u2019s helpful. One last quickie \u2013 on the physical oil sale, you mentioned or sort of gave a guide on the revenue impact. What would be the net income impact? I assume it\u2019s a lot smaller. Ruth Porat : In terms of the businesses that we are looking to sell, as I indicated last quarter, one of the things that was quite intriguing was precisely that, is the more modest PBT and we\u2019re reducing risk-weighted assets pretty meaningfully. Jim Mitchell : So it\u2019s ROE-accretive? Ruth Porat : Yeah, and that\u2019s over\u2014obviously over time. You have to transition these things. Jim Mitchell : Sure, right. Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Devin Ryan : Hey, good morning. How are you? I just have a couple follow ups on investment banking. So I guess first with respect to M&A, announced activity in North America has actually recovered since August levels 2007, but you guys have been noting on the last couple calls here that EMEA more recently has been feeling better. I just wanted to get some thoughts \u2013 does it feel like we\u2019re still on a distressed asset sale cycle in Europe, or are you starting to see more traditional strategic M&A accelerating there, which I think would be necessary to see a real recovery in activity in that region. Ruth Porat : Well, we\u2019ve seen some broadening across industries of activity, and what we still haven\u2019t seen is a real growth in the number of deals, but if you look at the dollar volume in EMEA, it\u2019s up, and the acquirer activity out of EMEA, cross-border activity is up. So again, it\u2019s early days but what\u2019s very positive is whenever a negative trend reverses itself. And comparable to GDP growth in EMEA is still modest, but it\u2019s gone from negative to positive and we\u2019re starting to see the knock-on benefit to some of the activity levels. James Gorman : And I would just add the largest economy and the economy that\u2019s doing best over there is Germany, and having made a couple of trips recently, I think the corporate CEOs are still quite conservative in their views, so there will be a tipping point here. Obviously with what\u2019s going on with Russia and the Ukraine, that\u2019s putting a damper particularly on the German CEO view until we get better clarity there, but I think there will be a tipping point and we\u2019re not there yet. There have been isolated transactions across the U.K., Spain and other places. Devin Ryan : Great. Appreciate that color. And then fixed income underwriting results have obviously also remained really resilient, and I know it\u2019s still an attractive rate environment but are you starting to see a mix shift there at all in terms of what products are really driving this strength? Has there been any change in mix? Ruth Porat : There has in the sense that it\u2019s been much more of a refinancing story, and now we\u2019re starting to see the benefit of the higher levels of M&A. In the first quarter, I think what was notable was there were a lot of deals across investment grade, high yield, leveraged loans. It wasn\u2019t as though there were some really big, chunky items that drove the quarter. It was a balance across the various products. But what you\u2019re starting to see is much more of this is event-related, and we think given the pipeline in M&A, that bodes well for continuation of strong debt underwriting, notwithstanding the fact that we\u2019ve had a long string here of strong quarters with debt underwriting. Devin Ryan : Okay. I guess just with respect to how that ties in with FIC results, there was a flurry of activity in corporate issuance in March, so I\u2019m just trying to get a better understanding around the strong results within credit and maybe how much of that was a function of issuance really starting to pick up towards the tail end of the quarter. Any color around maybe how credit specifically progressed throughout the first quarter. Ruth Porat : Credit on the fixed income side was pretty consistent throughout the quarter. I think if you go back a couple of quarters ago when there was more volatility in credit markets, what you saw was notwithstanding a strong new issue calendar, it was pretty much buy and hold and you didn\u2019t see the follow-through to secondary trading. You\u2019re seeing more of that follow-through to secondary trading now, and hopefully that continues, in particular given the volume of what we would expect would continue to be new issue product on the fixed income side, assuming the M&A pipeline continues to hold up and we see the execution continuing as it has these first couple of weeks in the quarter. Devin Ryan : Great, thank you. Celeste Brown : Thank you so much for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking to you at the end of the second quarter.",

    "content": "\ufeff David Russo : The following slides will likely look familiar to those of who you have joined us for this call in prior quarters. Our approach to funding, capital and liquidity management has not changed, and we remain committed to preserving the durability of our balance sheet consistent with the framework we've discussed on prior calls. As such, we'll discuss the remaining slides briefly to allow more time for your questions. Beginning with Slide 14, Morgan Stanley invests in durable funding to provide ample stability and flexibility in all markets. We continue to focus on balance sheet durability and believe that ephemeral sources of funding such as commercial paper are not appropriate for banks. Slide 15 illustrates the asset liability funding model that we've shown you before, aligning more liquid assets with shorter term liabilities and less liquid assets with longer term liabilities. Please turn to Slide 16, which shows our long-term debt maturity profile. We continue to issue globally across multiple channels in order to support a diversified investor base. I'll now turn the call over to Tom Wipf to discuss secured funding. Tom Wipf : Slide 17; as we've discussed with you before, our four pillars of secured funding ensured durability and stability in our secured funding book. First, WAM provides appropriate time based on asset fundability. Second, roll down targets limit total liabilities maturing in any given period and give us a smooth maturity profile. Third, concentration targets increase investor diversification and limit reliance on any single investor. And finally, we've build spare capacity as an additional risk mitigate against sudden shocks in the market that could reduce rollover weights. Please turn to Slide 18. Our approach to secured funding is consistent with our approach to long-term debt. We follow asset-based model to obtain the appropriate term consistent with the fundability of the underlying assets in the secured market. Our assets are reviewed daily according to our rules-based fundability criteria and are re-categorized real-time based on their liquidity characteristics in the prevailing market environment. We look at assets down to [Q-suite] (ph) level in four categories of fundability; Super Green, Green, Amber and Red. Those categories indicate the availability of secured funding for that asset class. The fully-loaded cost of this funding is allocated to the businesses at an asset and a desk level. There has been some industry discussion about minimum haircut requirements as regulators consider changes to the wholesale funding markets. As you might expect, we're very supportive of the application of market-wide haircuts and believe that the safety and soundness that they will provide to the system more than offset any potential drag on market liquidity. Turning to Slide 19; pillar one, longer WAM provides appropriate flexibility to manage the liquidity horizon of assets. In aggregate the WAM of the entire secured funding book excluding Super Green assets continues to exceed our target of 120 days. This accomplished two key goals. First, it increases the durability of funding. And second, it reduces the liquidity reserve requirements needed as a contingency for loss of secured funding. On Slide 20, we highlight a recent study by the federal reserve bank of New York on weighted average maturity in the U.S. secured funding markets. Although overall WAM has increased broadly across the industry improvement is widely dispersed across dealers with 25% of the population having a WAM of 26 days or less. Morgan Stanley is a leader with WAM of greater than 120 days which puts us well above the 75th percentile in the study. We believe that having appropriate WAM is an essential requirement for durable funding. Turning to Slide 21; pillar two and pillar three, monthly maturity targets and investor concentration targets both of which reduced refinancing risk. Pillar two establishes a monthly maturity target which gives us a smooth maturity profile within the secured book thereby reducing roll over risk. Pillar three sets investor concentration targets to increase investor diversification limiting reliance on any single investor. The highlight or focus on pillar three, at the bottom of the slide we've broken out the number of term investors in the secured book. We have a significant and diverse pool of investors with strong geographic diversification. Turning to Slide 22, pillar four, spear capacity. Spear capacity eliminates the need to access markets for the first 30 days of a stress event and reduces our needs for the 60 days thereafter. It also provides ample flexibility to accommodate surges and market based client demand during periods of greater activity. Spear capacity represents total secured funding liabilities in excess of our inventory. In other words, our spear capacity has created excess contractual term funding, which allows us to have a durable funding profile in both stressed and favorable market environments. Besides our spear capacity using a number of conservative assumptions about theoretically what could occur in a stress environment. These assumptions are not Morgan Stanley specific and are more diverse than market conditions during observed stress periods. We collateralized spear capacity liability of super green assets, but we can contractually substitute them with less liquid assets. Now, I'll turn the call back to David to discuss liquidity. David Russo : Turning to Slide 23, the net outcome of all we've talked about is durable liquidity. We divide our liquidity reserve into two buckets, bank and non-bank. Our bank liquidity declined in the second quarter of 2014 primarily driven by the deployment of excess cash from deposits into our loans, which is consistent with the bank's strategy we have discussed previously. Please turn to Slide 24. We continue to focus on liquidity at both the parent and legal entity level. Our approach at the legal entity level is consistent with the increased focus across the industry on subsidiary liquidity. As you may recall we run our liquidity stress test at the legal entity level first supporting a bottoms-up approach. This ensures efficient liquidity at each legal entity while also maintaining ample reserves at the parent. Turning to Slide 25, our pro forma Basel LCR remains well in excess of 100%. Our strong liquidity coverage ratio is an outcome of our prudent approach to liquidity risk management including the extension of the weighted average maturity of secured funding, the size and quality of our liquidity reserve, the composition of our funding stack and the size and composition of our unfunded lending portfolio. Slide 26 provides detail on our deposit base and its LCR characteristics. Our Bank Deposit Program or BDP represents a 109 billion of our total firm deposits. The BDP deposits are sourced from firm's wealth management clients and represent the working capital in client accounts. These deposits are stable over economic cycles and observed periods of stress and we view them as a source of durable funding. The slide provides detail on the nature of our BDP deposits, 100% are interest-bearing, approximately 75% are insures, which enhances the stability of the deposits in times of market or idiosyncratic stress, and 80% qualify as LCR liquidity value. We will receive approximately 20 billion of additional deposits from Citi our former JV partner by July 2015 with similar characteristics to the BDP deposits we already have on our balance sheet. Given the nature of these deposits we would also expect them to grow roughly inline with total client assets over time. Please turn to Slide 27; our final topic, capital management. We continue to have strong capital ratios as measured under Basel three. Our pro forma Basel three common equity tier one ratio under the fully faced in advanced approach was approximately 12.1% at June 30th, reflecting our best estimate under the final Federal Reserve rules. Our strong capital ratios are supported by a high quality capital stack which is illustrated on slide 28. We are focused on optimizing our capital stack and issued approximately 1.7 billion of preferred stock in 2013 and 1.8 billion in the first half of 2014. We have approximately 4.9 billion of trust preferred securities outstanding and view them as valuable tier one and tier two capital, which phase out over an extended period of time. With regards to subordinated debt, we have issued 4 billion since the beginning of 2013 and believe it represents valuable Tier two capital. On slide 29 we have provided our various capital and leverage ratios under the relevant regulatory regimes. We continue to have strong risk based capital ratios and are on a clear path to an SLR of greater than 5% in 2015. Thank you. And we'll now take your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of James Strecker with Wells Fargo. James Strecker : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for having the call. Just a quick question, I didn't see an update on the 2014 funding plan, obviously you all made a lot of progress in the first half. By our math, it actually looks like (indiscernible) essentially be done, obviously there is an opportunity to be opportunistic, but in spreads where they are, but just kind of want to get your thoughts there. David Russo : Yes. The second half of 2014 should look similar to the first half of 2014 in size. This outlook is that unsecured debt outstanding should be approximately unchanged overall on the year. And this is a revision from the last time we spoke; it reflects the dynamic nature of our balance sheet. James Strecker : Okay. Thanks for that color. And then maybe just kind of going down the stack a little bit to Tier one and Tier two needs. You guys still haven't -- very modestly needs to be fair, but still maybe a billion more in Tier one and maybe 2 billion in Tier two to hit 150-200 bips of Basel III RWAs respectively. Is that the right way to look at it? I know you talked about getting SLR compliant next year , but is there any desire to maybe accelerate that preferred issuance to get there a little bit sooner? David Russo : I think it's premature to say what an ultimate optimal amount is. Over the past one and a half years we have been optimizing our capital stack with respective preferred subject. As we mentioned, we did the 1.8 billion of preferred earlier this year. And that really reflects us pulling forward the full year plan based on the outsized demand that we received. So we'll continue to assess opportunities we preferred over time. With respect to subject, the same thing, we will just continue to look at optimizing this over time. James Strecker : Okay, great. Thanks for that, David. Maybe one for Ruth if I could, the situation in Ukraine and Russia continues to get a little bit more unsettling day-by-day. Is that having any negative drag on what's been a pretty strong performance in EMEA recently? Ruth Porat : No. It ends up the pick up in activities that we saw in Europe has been quite broad-based. And when we look at the investment banking pipeline, it continues to be strong. The trends that drove the M&A pick up are compelling. We've talked about them quite a bit, the upsize in deal size which really placed our sweet spot more cross-border activity, more corporate engagement, corporate activity. So at this point what we are really seeing is a focus by corporate clients to proceed with deals that are strategically compelling and the velocity of deals have picked up by which I mean the assessment phase moving through pipeline to completion we see on the back of that financing activity that's coming. We are also separately us healthy and actually increasing financing pipeline. So at this point I have not seen any spill over, clearly, backdrop is always important. But at this point it's continuing to be quite healthy. James Strecker : Okay, great. Thanks, everyone. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Smalley with UBS. Robert Smalley : Hi, thanks very much. A couple of quick questions on funding side, I'm looking at slide 20 when we -- importance of durability. And you are talking about the WAM being greater than 120 days versus 78 as if that study pointed out. How much does Morgan Stanley pay up for that extension? Do you feel like you are paying up for that? And given where rates are and that we have a lot of real compression around rates, would that change in a rising rate environment when we might get a steeper front-end? David Russo : So first it will just cost -- certainly a significant cost, but durability of funding is our first principle and durability is not cheap. So you can clearly see that the numbers as you go out the curve, well, for us the question isn't about cost. Morgan Stanley and some of our peers have chosen to invest to achieve that durability and some others haven't. When we think about a rising rate environment our focus is going to be across the assets that we fund. So although we look at that overall, our main goal is it continues to be durability. Robert Smalley : Okay. Could you give us some idea of the relative cost of that if you run that? David Russo : Not at this point. I think what we like to do is we could focus across the four pillars, goal being durability and again you can see the numbers even if you look at the curve out from one day out to 120 days or greater. Robert Smalley : Okay. That makes sense. And in terms of your acceptance in this part of the marketplace, I know certainly -- obviously we have seen spreads come in across all fixed income classes. How was the perception among the counter party credit community, they are usually the last ones to change their mind about things. And when you look at how your haircut in terms of counter party risk, is it coming back to the way that you yourselves haircut other similar type of firms? David Russo : We look at our haircuts based on the assets. That's been a focus we have for a long time. But certainly we have been within the market for many years. Robert Smalley : Okay. One last question, I was going through some notes the other day and several quarters ago you've talked about a goal of deposits plus shareholders equity equaling 50% of the funding stack. You are getting there pretty quickly. Is that still a goal? Or is that something that you would look to exceed over time? David Russo : Yes. Robert Smalley : That was my problem for asking two questions at the same time. So that's still a goal and so that's kind of a medium-term goal in the next year or two. And then after that you will look opportunistically to go past the 50%. David Russo : Yes. There are additional opportunities for growth in the deposit base. Deposits that can be measured as a percent of total client assets; and as you mentioned in the prepared comments, as those grow, deposits could grow as well. Robert Smalley : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of (indiscernible) with Citigroup. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks again for hosting the call. Just a question on Slide 23, the liquidity reserve mix; the interest-bearing deposits with banks is down to 11% from 20% while securities available for sale increased from 26% to 34% from the last six months or so. I was just curious to see if you are at the right mix there or how we should think about this going forward? David Russo : We will always be focused on ultra high quality assets in our liquidity pool. And there were times when we believe that it's a better investment to put it in overnight deposit at a bank. The other times we think it's more appropriate to put it in something more like a treasury security. In this case I think what we are seeing is a transfer of fewer deposits at banks and increased holdings of treasury securities. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And just one other question, thanks for the extra detail on the equity sales and trading. And just the growth there, I was curious if you could talk a little bit about the areas maybe with the biggest improvements. And then additionally is this a mix of getting closer with client relationships or these other banks pulling back it is where you are seeing the growth there? Ruth Porat : It's really a little of both, where we run the franchise, they often talk about our nine box strategy. We focus across product, the three boxes being cash derivatives and prime brokerage. And then across region Americas, EMEA and Asia, and within each box we look to go very deep with clients. And then very importantly, we talk about adjacencies across the various boxes. So the deeper we go with clients in TB, our view is the deeper we would expect to see them going across cash derivatives and globally with us. And it's really that attention at a quite granular level with our clients on the back of all the investments that we've made in the franchise that has enabled us to have a leading position. And we do think that we are benefiting on the margin from some players downsizing in certain areas that they have been in. but fundamentally the strength has been a very consistent one for many years and that does build on the back of what has been a lot of investments in the equity franchise. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you again. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of David Trone with Prudential. David Trone : Hi. On the SLR ratio, what's the bridged, again, if you could remind us in getting above the 5% mark and the timing on that? Ruth Porat : We are looking to -- we've gone from 4.2% in the end of the first quarter to 4.6% at the end of the second quarter. The key driver for that was really an enumerator this quarter from earnings, the preferred issuance multiplied in fact with DTAs and the investment capacity deduction. Then the balance of the driver, we expect to be above -- it will be above 5% in 2015. And we've a number of work streams that will really continue to move that ratio up above the 5% in 2015. Obviously the numerator in earnings will continue to be an important contributor, but across the denominator the work streams include things like focusing on compression activity where that pace continues to be strong. We've accomplished a lot year-to-date. We've got a strong pipeline and ongoing engagement with banks on both sides of the Atlantic. So we do think that compression will be one key opportunity, obviously the run down in risk-weighted assets that I noted, continues to help the denominator because much of that is in areas (indiscernible). And then, the net long CDS sold was added to the calculation of the ratio. And we're focused on again mitigating the impact of that addition. So, across the spectrum we have work streams. Again to look at opportunities to reduce some of the elements of the SLR without impacting what we're doing from a client franchise. And with that said, we think there are ample opportunities. What that does is result in the 5% number in 2015, well ahead of the 2018 requirement. David Trone : Are we talking about early part of 2015 or \u2026 Ruth Porat : Yes. We've said in 2015 and I think the important point was the last point of my sentence which is the requirement is a 2018 requirement. We're well on our way, and we've got good set of work steams across the various components to achieve that requirement in 2015. David Trone : Got it. And then the bank; is that above or -- the plan to be above the 6% mark similar? Ruth Porat : Yes. David Trone : Okay, going to. Ruth Porat : I'm sorry. To be clear, yes, the bank is above the requirement now. We've \u2026 David Trone : It's above the requirement? Okay. Ruth Porat : Yes, above the requirement now. We capitalize the banks to support loan growth in the banks. And so, both with respect to capital and liquidity, we're in a very strong position with our banks. And again, that's very much consistent with the notion that in 2009 when we created the joint venture with Citi we knew that at some point we'd contractually start receiving these deposits as we bought out the joint venture stake, and we wanted to build the infrastructure in all of the requirements to support very prudent consistent loan growth in appropriately capitalized set of entities. So we have built that early along with credit risk management and all of the other processes required to support again prudent loan growth in the bank. David Trone : And lastly on the trending sale, the commodity business to Rosneft; is that going to be impacted by the new set of sanctions? Ruth Porat : Well, given all this going on from a deal perspective, this is obviously uncharted territory, but we do continue to work towards closing in the back half of the year, and it does remain subject to regulatory approval. David Trone : Is there a break-up fee? Ruth Porat : We're -- yes, we'll give the updates if there are. As I said we're working on closing towards the back half of the year, and there is regulatory approval and we'll give updates if there are updates -- when there are updates. David Trone : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pri de Silva with CreditSights. Pri de Silva : Following up on David's question on the SLR, SLR seems to be the main primary capital constraint for Morgan Stanley as well as couple of your peers. How do you think about the size of the balance sheet in terms of your capital management needs and the desire to return capital to shareholders? Ruth Porat : We moved to greater than 5% in 2015. It reflects the opportunities we have with both the numerator and the denominator. And as I said, one of the important points is that we're looking at the move to greater than 5%, again, with increasing returns of capital that are consistent with supporting our client franchise. We're very strong with these capital measures. We have a clear path to achieve the SLR well ahead of the requirement. And we have ample capacity to put balance sheet and capital behind clients and client demand. And so, in our view when you break it down to the items that I've already delineated, we have ample opportunity. To the extent it makes sense to have any changes in balance sheet whether higher or lower, that's really driven by client activity in our perspective on the opportunity set for the firm. And one of the key elements that we really look to is delivering for clients as we're driving a higher ROE for the firm and the elements that we're focused on with respect to the SLR are substantial. They take us to this higher level, but again, the decisions on cash balance sheet will be driven by client activity and our perspective on that. Pri de Silva : Thanks, Ruth, and that's helpful. The last thing I have, which is a rather outbound question, how do you look at the FAA ALM risk in develop management business? David Russo : We continue to run a traditional asset liability model in our banks, and I'm assuming you're really talking about the lending activities in the banks, and we have a large deposit base against that. We'll appropriately size our AFS portfolio, we've discussed in the past, both to invest our excess cash from the growing deposit base as well as looking at the fixed rate characteristics of it against the various interest rate characteristics of the lending portfolio will be very prudent and it's a very traditional model. Pri de Silva : Okay, thank you. Operator : And there seem to be no further questions at this time. Celeste Brown We really appreciate you joining us on our Friday morning during the summer, and look forward to speaking to you all of you very soon.",

Hylton - Chief Financial Officer Analysts : Bill Katz - Citigroup Ken Worthington - JPMorgan Michael Kim - Sandler O\u2019Neill Dan Fannon - Jefferies & Company Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Chris Shutler - William Blair Andrew Donnantuono - KBW Operator : Good morning, my name is Kirk and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Eaton Vance Corp Third Quarter Fiscal Earnings Call and webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer. (Operator Instructions). Mr. Dan Cataldo you may begin your conference. Daniel C. Cataldo: Thank you, and welcome everyone to our third quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call and webcast. Here this morning are Tom Faust; Chairman and CEO of Eaton Vance Corp and Laurie Hylton, our CFO. We will first comment on the quarter and then we will take your questions. The full earnings release and the chart we will refer to during the call are available on our website eatonvance.com under the heading press releases. Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainties in our business including but not limited to those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings including our 2013 Annual report and Form 10-K are available on our website on request at no charge. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom. Thomas E. Faust: Good morning. Eaton Vance had adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.63 in the third fiscal quarter, an increase of 21% from $0.52 in the year ago quarter and a new record high. On a sequential quarter basis, adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 7% from $0.59 in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. The strong earnings comparisons reflect solid revenue growth, good control over discretionary spending and lower share count. In the third quarter, we were again active on the capital management front, taking advantage of what we view as an attractive purchase range for our stock. We repurchased 2.5 million shares of stock for $93 million in cash essentially matching what we did in the second quarter. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2014, we have repurchased and retired 6 million shares for a total of $228 million. With $547 million of cash and short term debt securities held at July 31, we have ample ability to continue an active share repurchase program while maintaining financial strength and flexibility. We ended the quarter with $288.2 billion in consolidated assets under management up 7% from a year ago and up roughly 1% from the end of the prior quarter. Net flows for the third fiscal quarter were negative $2 billion. Outflows in the quarter were concentrated in three areas, floating rate income with net outflows of $1.4 billion, high yield with net outflows of $1.1 billion and large cap value equity with net outflows of $1 billion. After several quarter of strong net inflows, retail bank loans flows turned negative in the third quarter consistent with overall industry trends and reflecting the decision by one of our largest advisory program partners to reduce their allocation to the bank owned asset class. Without the associated $1.5 billion of withdrawals, net flows into our floating rate income strategies would have been positive in the third quarter as continuing strong institutional flows more than offset weakness in retail. Although no one has more experience with retail loan funds than Eaton Vance, we struggle to understand the accelerated redemptions being seen today in the loan category. Loan prices are stable, credit conditions are benign and yields remain quite attractive in relation to other fixed income, sorry other floating rate instruments. Unlike holders of the fixed rate instruments, investors in floating rate bank loans do not face a loss of principle value as interest rates rise, and like investors in foreign bonds, floating rate bank loans price in U.S. dollars are not subject to currency risks. Those seeking to explain loan funds outflows may point to a liquidity concerns, the idea that the loan asset class is not sufficiently liquid to support wide spread fund withdrawals. Throughout our 25-year record as a bank loan manager and nearly 14 years of experience managing daily liquid loan funds, we\u2019ve always been able to meet withdrawal demand as they arise including during periods of significant financial distress. While there could be no absolutes with this or any other asset class, we are confident that we have the pieces in place to continue meeting our funds liquidity needs through good times and bad, attesting to the continuing attractiveness of banks loans as an asset class, our institutional flows remains solidly positive. In the third quarter, we closed on a new $500 million collateralized loan obligation entity and had 900 million of other net inflows into institutional loan strategies. Although we can\u2019t predict when sentiment will again turn positive for retail loan fund products, we remain bullish on the bank loan asset class and our prospects for growth there as a proven industry leader. In parallel with the weakness in bank loan fund flows, flows into high yield bond funds industry wide have also turned decisively negative in recent weeks. Our high yield bonds have seen only modest net outflows about $100 million in the third quarter. During the quarter we did lose $900 million high yield sub advisory relationship as the sponsor decided to bring management in-house. Despite this disappointing account loss, we continue to maintain a large and vibrant high yield business under the direction of long time group leader Mike Weilheimer. At July 31, our high yield assets under management totaled $6.4 billion. As I mentioned, large cap value equity was the third major source of outflows in the quarter with $1 billion of net withdrawals. This represents a slight easing of the pace of outflows from the first half of the year and comes amid the transition in leadership of our value team to Eddie Perkin following the retirement of former lead manager Mike Mach in June. As those who follow the company closely will know Eddie joined the Eaton Vance management as Chief Equity Investment Officer at the end of April, following a successful career at Goldman Sachs asset management. Although Eddie is just getting started as head of EVM\u2019s Equity Group, I am pleased to report that early investment performance is very strong. For the first three months of Eddie\u2019s tenure, the Class I shares of our large cap value, focus value, focus growth, core stock, dividend builder and balance funds are ranked in the top quintile of their respective Morningstar categories. For the year to date through the end of July, all of these funds and a number of other EVM managed equity funds rank in either the first or second quintile of their peer groups. With new leadership and renewed energy and focus our EVM equity business is turning the corner and positioned for improved business contribution. 2014 is also proving to be a strong performance year for many of our income and alternative strategies. For the year-to-date through 7/31 the Class I shares of our bonds, government obligations, short duration government income, diversified currency income and global macro advantage funds all rank in the top quintile of their Morningstar peer groups. Performance has been particularly strong for our national municipal funds with our high-yield muni, national municipal income, AMT free municipal income, muni opportunities and TAS long term funds all having top decile class share performance rankings for the year-to-date. Relative to many national and state-specific peer fund our muni strategies that have benefited from having little or no exposure to Puerto Rican credits. With seven national and 14 single state muni funds having atleast one class of shares rated four or five stars by Morningstar, we see our muni bond fund business is offering significant near term growth opportunities. Flows into Eaton Vance Municipal income funds turned modestly positive in the third quarter, a notable improvement over the preceding four quarters. Global income is another area where we are seeing better performance and improved flows. This franchise includes our global macro absolute return, diversified currency and emerging market income strategies, which in total represent almost 9 billion in managed assets. While net flows were negative in the quarter in the range of $375 million, that\u2019s a significant improvement from the $2.6 billion of net outflows in the first half of the fiscal year. Another area of improving flows is parametrics emerging market equity strategy. Net inflows in the third quarter were almost $400 million, up from $200 million in the second quarter and less than $100 in the first quarter. The stronger flows are being driven by favorable relative investment performance as evidenced by our flagship funds excellent long-term record and five-star overall Morningstar rating. At period end, parametrics EM assets totaled just over $22 billion. To round off the discussion of flows, I want to give you an update on the four emerging investment franchises identified last quarter as having significant potential to contribute to our future growth. You may recall that these are our two Richard Bernstein sub advised funds, the Parametric Clifton defensive equity strategy, latter municipal bonds, separate accounts and a multi sector income strategy. During the third quarter, total assets in these four franchises grew $1.4 billion or 31% to $7.7 billion. The Eaton Vance Richard Bernstein Equity Strategy and All Asset Strategy Funds were introduced in October 2010 and September 2011 respectively. The funds are sub advised by Richard Bernstein Advisors and lead man is Rich Bernstein the former long time market strategist that met all ends. Both funds compete in large and growing asset classes, employ a distinctive top down investment approach and have gained broad intermediary acceptance in a relatively short time. In the first nine months of fiscal 2014, the funds have had over $700 million of net inflows, installed managed assets more than doubled to $1.5 billion. This September we plan to launch a third fund sub advised by RBA, The Eaton Vance Richard Bernstein Market Opportunities Fund. The new fund will employ the same type down macro driven approach of the current funds but with a broader investment mandate, it includes the ability to hold both long and short positions. The Parametric Clifton and defensive equity strategy applies the transparent rules based equity options over overlay to a portfolio of equity and cash investments. Institutions are using defensive equity as a low cost alternative to hedge funds and other hedged equity strategies seeking to generate alpha from a systematic program of writing put in call options. When we purchased Clifton at the end of 2012, assets in the strategies were approximately $560 million just over a year and half later defensive equity assets have grown to $2.1 million with a strong pipeline of new business opportunities. Our Laddered Municipal Bond separate account product was developed by our TABS group in New York, and in less than three years managed assets have grown to over $2.8 billion with half of that growth coming in the last nine months. Sales continue to accelerate and the market opportunity here remains enormous. Over $1 trillion of municipal bonds are today held directly by individual investors with little of no portfolio over sight. As the potential pitfall of holding unmanaged municipal bonds become apparent to more and more investors and advisors, we see big growth potential. We have the early lead in this market and don\u2019t intend to relinquish it. Our multi-sector income strategy is the lead managed by Kathleen Gaffney who joined Eaton Vance as co-head of investment grade fixed income in October 2012 after 28 years with Loomis Sayles. Eaton Vance bonds fund was introduced at the end of January 2013 as a mutual fund vehicle for the multi sector strategy. Over the life of the fund in the last 12 months, the fund ranks among the top performer in its Morningstar category with its class I shares beating the peer group average by over 750 basis point on a one year basis at July 31. In the third quarter, assets increased from 637 million to 1.25 billion, a 97% increase in just three months. As the strategies track record continues to build the fund is gaining broader acceptance on intermediary platforms. Over the coming months we also expect to start funding institutional separate account mandates, a huge untapped opportunity for this franchise. I want to close with an update on our exchange rate of managed funds or ETMF imitative. As many of you know, ETMFs or proposed new type of open end fund that seek to provide the performance and tax advantage of exchange traded funds to active investment strategies while maintaining the confidentiality of portfolio trading information. Unlike ETFs, ETMFs would not disclose their portfolio holdings on a daily basis. ETMFs would be brought and sold on an exchange utilizing a new trading protocol called NAV base trading. Our navigate fund solutions subsidiary hold the series of patterns that we seek to commercialize by licensing them to fund sponsor by Eaton Vance and other fund groups. Since our last earnings report we have continued to work towards regulatory approval and commercial loans. On July 30, we filed registration statements for 18 initial ETMFs to be offered by Eaton Vance. While we can\u2019t predict the outcome of the regulatory process, we remain confident that if approved, ETMFs have the potential to transform our actively managed strategies or deliver the fund investors in the U.S. with potentially quite significant financial implications for Eaton Vance. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Laurie to discuss the quarterly financial results in more detail. Laurie G. Hylton:  Thank you and good morning. Tom summarized for reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.63 for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to $0.52 for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and $0.59 for the second quarter of this year. This represents an increase of 21% as compared to the third quarter of last year and an increase of 7% sequentially. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.63 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, $0.18 in third quarter of fiscal 2013, and $0.59 in the second quarter this fiscal year. AS you can see an attachment II to our press release, adjustments from reported GAAP earnings in the third quarter of last year include non-recurring cost associated with retiring 250 million of our 6.5% senior notes due in 2017, a charge to settle the state tax matter, instruction cost associated with the closed end fund offering. We\u2019re pleased to report that our third quarter operating results were strong in every respect. Operating income increased 10% year-over-year and 5% sequentially on revenue growth of 5% and 4% respectively. Prudent cost management and lower variable compensation cost drove our operating margin up to 35.7% from 33.9% in the third quarter of last year and 35.4% last quarter. On the strength of those operating results, adjusted net income increased 17% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 21% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, reflecting the growth in adjusted net income and a decrease in outstanding shares as a result of stepped up share repurchases over the last several quarters. Revenue increased 5% year-over-year reflecting a 6% increase in investment advisory and administrative fees, partially offset by modest declines in distribution and service fee revenues. Looking specifically at investment advisory administrative fees, the 6% increase year-over-year reflects a 10% increase in average assets under management offset by a decline in our effective fee rate. The decline in our effective fee rate from 44 basis points in the third quarter of last year to 43 basis points this quarter can be primarily attributed to the growth in lower fee implementation services mandate and the corresponding increase in implementation services asset as a percentage of total assets under management. Revenue increased 4% sequentially, primarily reflecting the impact of having three additional days in the third quarter compared to the second, and a 2% increase in average assets under management. We feel the day count drag on both revenue and our effective fee rate in the second quarter each year as more than half our investment advisory and administrative fee revenue and all of our distribution and service fee revenue is calculated on the basis of the number of calendar days in the quarter. Day count drove our effective investment advisory administrative fee rate up from 42 to 43 basis points sequentially. Performance fees did not materially affect effective fee rates for any of the periods presented contributing 928,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to 952,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 and 850,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. We anticipate that our effective investment advisory and administrative fee rate for active equity strategies will remain at approximately 65 basis points. Fixed income strategies at approximately 45 basis points Floating rate income strategy is at approximately 55 basis points, alternative strategy is in the low to mid 60s and implementation services is at approximately 10 basis points for the remainder of this fiscal year. As always, our future overall effective fee rate will be impacted to the extent that there are meaningful changes in product mix. Shifting from revenue to expense, operating expenses were up 2% year-over-year reflecting low single digit percentage increases in our largest expense category including compensation, distribution related expenses and other discretionary spending. Operating expenses increased 3% sequentially reflecting similar single digit percentage increases in the same categories. Compensation expense increased 2% year-over-year primarily due to increases in base salaries and benefits and stock based compensation, partially offset by decreases in operating income basis and as in sales base incentive compensation. The increases in base salaries and stock based compensation were driven primarily by a 7% increase in average head count and retirement during the third quarter of fiscal 2014 respectively. The decrease in operating income base incentives reflects adjustments to operating income base approval rate across the company, while the decrease in sales based incentive compensation primarily reflects the decrease in compensation eligible retail sales. Sequentially, we saw a 3% increase in comp expense driven by similar increases in base comp and benefits and stock based compensation partially offset by decreases in operating income based incentives. The sequential increase in base salaries and benefits primarily reflects the additional number of payroll dates with headcount growth related to permanent employees limited to 1%. As in the year-over-year comparison, the increase in stock based compensation primarily reflects retirements during the third quarter of fiscal 2014 while the decrease in operating income base incentives reflects adjustments to accrual rates across the company. Distribution service fee expense increased marginally both year-over-year and sequentially reflecting the increase in assets under management subject to these fees. Fund related expenses were up 14% year-over-year and 11% sequentially primarily reflecting an increase in sub advisory expenses driven by growth and sponsored funds managed by unaffiliated sub advisors. Other operating expenses were up 4% both year-over-year and sequentially primarily reflecting increases in information technology spend related to investment management systems project partially offset by a decrease in recruiting and legal professional services. Net income and gains on seed capital investments contributed roughly a penny to earnings in the third and second quarters of fiscal 2014 while reducing earnings by approximately $0.02 in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. When quantifying the impact of our seed capital investments on earnings each quarter, we take into consideration our pro rata share of the gains, losses and other investment income earned on investments and sponsored products, with accounted and for as consolidated funds, separate accounts or equity method investments as well as the gains and losses recognized and derivative yields to hedge these investments. We then report the per share impact net of non controlling interest expense and income taxes. Equity net income of affiliates decreased sequentially primarily reflecting a decrease in net income and gains recognized on sponsored products accounted for under the equity method. Our 49% interest in Hexavest, which is reported net of tax and the amortization of intangibles in equity and net income affiliates contributed approximately $0.02 per diluted share for all periods presented. Excluding the affects of CLO entity earnings in markets in all periods presented and the state tax settlement in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, our effective tax rate for the third quarter fiscal 2014 was 38.5% compared to 38% in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, and 37.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. We currently anticipate that our effective tax rate adjusted for CLO earnings and losses will be approximately 38% for the remainder of the fiscal year. In terms of capital management as Tom mentioned, we repurchased 2.5 million shares of nonvoting common stock for approximately $92.6 million this quarter. When combined with prior quarters repurchases this brought both our average diluted share count and shares outstanding down by 2% sequentially. Even with the significant increases in share repurchases, we finished the quarter holding just over $540 million of cash and short-term debt securities and approximately $260 million in seed capital investment. Our outstanding debt consists of $250 million of 6.5% senior notes due in 2017 and $325 million of 3.625% senior notes due in 2023. We have a $300 million line of credit, which is currently undrawn. Given our strong cash flow, liquidity and overall financial condition, we believe we\u2019re well positioned to continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. With our stock trading and what we view as attractive range. We expect to continue to be active repurchasers as we move into the fourth quarter. This concludes our prepared comments. And at this point, we\u2019d like to take any questions you may have. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citigroup. Your line is open. Bill Katz - Citigroup: Hey, guys. Thank you and good morning everyone. Just Tom, you mentioned that on the retail side, I guess maybe you sound a little confounded, my words, about what you're seeing there. And I appreciate that. What was the reason that the distributor gave you for the allocation shift? And then what might be the risk of other distributors following suit? Seems like it always seems to be some consistency across the distribution platforms around those kinds of things? Thomas E. Faust: Just to clarify, Bill, you\u2019re asking about bank loan funds. Bill Katz - Citigroup: Yes, I apologize, yes, yes. Thomas E. Faust: Okay. So I think as you probably know platforms or advisory programs are increasing part of the mutual fund business where there is centralized decision making to some degree anyway with respect to asset allocation changes. So what happened in the quarter to us was that one of those -- one of the largest platforms, I think the largest in terms of exposure to our bank loan strategies, made an asset allocation change. They didn\u2019t speak directly to me. I don\u2019t think they would typically give a lot of color on the reason for the change. It was not a complete withdrawal, but it was a meaningful reduction in their exposure to us. We understand that the reallocation was not to another bank loan manager but it was from bank loans to some other asset class whether that\u2019s stocks or bonds or alternative I can\u2019t really give you any color on that. As I mentioned, this is our \u2013 this was our largest single platform exposure. We certainly have other large investors in our bank loan strategies, but nothing of a similar character that\u2019s of a similar size. Bill Katz - Citigroup: Okay. And then maybe a second follow-up question just staying on the flow discussion for a moment, this is a combined question; just looking at the supplement for Hexavest, it seems like the flow story there has slowed in aggregate. Maybe you can just update on what might be driving that dynamic? And then on the implementation services, that too seems to have slowed of late. Is that just timing lumpiness or is there anything else going on there just in terms of penetration of that opportunity set? Thomas E. Faust:  So, I\u2019ll just take those in the sequence you ask. First on Hexavest, flows there\u2019s there have definitely slowed. Hexavest is just to remind people is a top-down global equity manager with about $17 billion in assets under management, which we owned 49% interest, they\u2019re based in Montreal. So it\u2019s a relatively small team. I think 40, 50 people focused on a global equity strategy. They have historically been relatively strong performance -- performers during the periods of market weakness. They have been relatively cautious on the markets over the last couple of years, obviously that\u2019s been position that hasn\u2019t helped their relative performance. So they are in a mode where they\u2019ve lagged their benchmark for the last couple of years. They\u2019re not losing business, because people view them as a defensive manager. But they\u2019re not in a position to attract significant new flows, because they are relatively weak relative performance. They do have a pipeline. There are ongoing discussions with major prospects. But we would expect the growth rate there likely to be moderate until they start showing improved relative performance, which based on their current positioning would likely be during a period of weaker market conditions than we\u2019ve seen over the last year and a half or so. In terms of Clifton\u2019s implementation services business, as you mentioned there is a lumpiness to that business. What we report as flows reflects really two things. One is client\u2019s gains and loss. And the other is allocation or shifts and exposures or changes in position sizes for existing clients. The second of those factors that changes in exposure by existing clients, is largely driven by factors that have nothing to with Clifton or the services they provide, just simply how much cash were they holding or how they\u2019re using Clifton within their portfolios. That have some noise in it and it\u2019s quite hard for to predict. The first factor which is net clients gain, there\u2019s a very positive story. Clifton is well ahead of their projections for their business for the year-to-date. Not only in defensive equity which is one of the growth strategies that we\u2019ve highlighted, but also in their core overlay services business. So they continue to grow and add quite significant new clients. They are in the process of expanding their sales force. They\u2019re well ahead of budgets in terms of new sales and new revenue acquisition for the year-to-date. So, that acquisition is certainly going very well and with growth substantially ahead of plan. Bill Katz - Citigroup: Thank you, one last one. Thank you for taking my questions this morning. As you think about counterbalancing your platform with the four emergent segments that you see some very good growth of low numbers versus a bit of recovery for the legacy business how do you think about marketing spend and what might be the impact on G&A as we look forward? Thomas E. Faust: I don\u2019t think we see significant changes. Most of our sales and marketing expense tense to be commission based. Sales incentives we pay and so it will go up or down with the volume of gross sales and to some degree with the mix of sales among different products. But we don\u2019t see a significant change in mix of sales or rate of sales, expenditure relative to the volume of sales activity. Bill Katz - Citigroup: Okay. Thanks guys, appreciate it. Thomas E. Faust: Thank you. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington - JPMorgan: Hi. Good morning. Maybe to follow-up on Bill's and the sales force, can you talk about maybe how you\u2019re positioning the overall sales force? You just mentioned that Hexavest is expanding its sales presence. Can you talk about how the sales team is evolving as you're growing both bigger but also adding new products? Are you growing the team, are you trying to get into not just new clients but maybe new channels as well? What are you doing on the sales side? Thomas E. Faust: Yeah. The biggest change over the last year for us is the one that you touched on, which is the change at Parametric. As you may know prior to the acquisition of Clifton Group at the end of 2012, Parametric\u2019s institutional products were represented by Eaton Vance institutional sales team. When we acquired Clifton we made the decision to move to a separate sales force for Parametric in the North American institutional market where the initial sales team were the members of the Clifton team. We have added to that team over the last year, pretty aggressively, initially there were a total of three sales client service and consultant relations people, over the last year or little over a year that\u2019s grown to I\u2019d say, probably about eight people, four sales -- four field sales people, but backing that up with the consultant relations people and client service people. So, three to let\u2019s say eight or nine people on that team with the expectation for continued growth. On the retail side, the biggest change over the last year has been the addition of our wealth strategies group, which is a -- I\u2019ll say five person or six -- I think six person team based here in Boston, but focused on strategies for high net worth investors in the retail channel, both drawn from Parametric, but also from Eaton Vance. So those are the two major changes really focusing on growth opportunities we see for Parametric now combined with Clifton on the institutional side, plus wealth strategies, opportunities we see within retail for both traditional Eaton Vance strategies, as well as Parametric strategies. Ken Worthington - JPMorgan: Great. Thanks. And then as a follow-up just on tax managed investing. To what extent is that seem becoming more visible with your customers. I\u2019d like to talk beyond Parametric, as Parametric is doing quite well, but you got a big business beyond that. We saw a kind of muni sales turn positive, that maybe an element of it. Are you seeing it on the core equity franchises well? Or is performance still just not good enough even though its getting better to kind of bring those clients in, but I really want to know just thematically is tax managed investing picking up and if so to what magnitude? Thomas E. Faust: Yeah. So I think three part to our tax managed franchise. One is Parametric which is a range of index replications strategies where given a benchmark or given an index, they will, with a high degree of tracking, seek to match that on a pretax basis. And then through separate accounts they are actively managed to harvest losses, they\u2019ll look to outperform an ETF or non-tax managed strategy on an after tax basis by systematically harvesting tax losses. That\u2019s a big business for them. It\u2019s one of their foundational businesses. When we first acquired Parametric in 2003 that was their dominant business, and that has continued to grow. Sales are strong as you might imagine we and others are aggressively making the case that in an environment where capital gains, taxes are in a range depending on where you live in the U.S. 25% to 33% for high net worth investors that there is a significant demand for tax efficient strategies and particularly strategies that can systematically throw off capital losses. There are challenges to that business, one is that in a -- what has been a pretty strong equity market, the opportunities to realized capital losses maybe more limited than in an up and down market. But we\u2019re dealing with that and continuing to deliver the high tax efficiency that we see. So number one is the Parametric another equity strategies. Number two, which you touched on is munis where we are going gangbusters in terms of our muni separate account business in the form of our latter strategies where assets have grown from essentially zero to $2.8 billion over the last three years with very strong current growth. Also as you mentioned, our muni fund business, which is a very important business for us over $20 billion in muni fund asset turned positive inflows in the current quarter. And we\u2019ve got a very broad lineup of high performing strategies. We\u2019ve traditionally offered funds that have the high end of peer group in terms of current yield and we also have the differentiating feature today that our funds have. As a general rule, little or no Puerto Rico exposure, which has become a hot button issue among investors in the muni sector. I think as many people are probably aware Puerto Rican bonds are tax free in most if not all states through the U.S. so they\u2019re frequently held in size in state specific muni funds. Our fund as a role have limited exposure to that and that\u2019s benefited our performance and it\u2019s been a key differentiating feature that our sales guys are certainly pointing out to potential investors. And then third piece for our tax managed business is based here in Boston, which is that Eaton Vance actively managed, tax managed equity funds. We\u2019ve seen a little improvement there, but not much and I think it\u2019s for the reason that you cited, Ken which is that performance while it\u2019s better, it\u2019s still not to a point where we can compete on a performance basis with other managers. I would also add that this group, the heyday of us raising assets in tax managed equities within the late 90s and certainly since then, the awareness and the competitiveness of ETFs and index funds versus equity strategies has grown and people\u2019s broad recognition of the tax advances of the exchange rate structure are significantly greater today than they were in the late 90s. So we don\u2019t have great expectations for recovery there. We certainly believe that as our equity performance improves we will see improved flows in tax managed aggregate active equities, but we really see that the primary growth opportunities there is primarily on the Parametric side and on the muni side. Ken Worthington - JPMorgan: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kim from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open. Michael Kim - Sandler O\u2019Neill: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. First just as institutional fixed income investors continue to migrate in favor of more flexible mandates. Just wondering how that dynamic potentially sets up for the multi-sector bond strategy as you increasingly market that capability to those investors? I know you mentioned expecting to fund some mandates here shortly, but just any additional color on sort of the opportunity set there would be helpful? Thanks. Thomas E. Faust: Yeah. We certainly see that as a big opportunity. We observe the same thing that income investors have migrated from core fixed income to core plus to increasingly we\u2019re seeing interest in multi-sector which is moving out a little further on the risk spectrum, which is broadly where our Kathleen Gaffney's multi-sector income strategy operates. We certainly expect to be more active there. Kathleen\u2019s track record at Eaton Vance dates back to end of October of 2012, so we\u2019re coming up on two years of that working with the team here, when she came to Eaton Vance she brought with her a big Rolodex of contacts in the industry, but many took appropriately a weight and see attitude. She is coming to a new place and working with a new team. But we\u2019d like to think that as we hit the second anniversary of her being in the new location, working with the new team that given the really tremendous investment success that we\u2019ve achieved, that we will start wining some institutional mandates and that can become a significant increment to the growth of that franchise. And so, we\u2019re quite excited, quite thrilled with how successfully that\u2019s going as I mentioned retail assets approximately doubled to $1.2 billion or so in the most recent quarter. We certainly view that as really just getting started and since the big opportunities from here both continuing in retail but also institutionally. And I might add institutional opportunities we see not only in the U.S. but potentially also around the world. Michael Kim - Sandler O\u2019Neill: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, in terms of capital management, seems like you\u2019re seed capital portfolio continues to vintage. So just wondering, looking forward, are you looking to recycle that capital into newer strategies or might there be an opportunity to remain proactive on the share repurchase front with some of that excess capital if you will? Thomas E. Faust: We certainly see opportunities to continue the repurchase program. We have a handful of things that might be uses of seed capital in our traditional fund line up. I might tell you also that, we filed registration statements for 18 new ETMFs and if and when those get approved, they may also be a source of seed capital, but I guess we don\u2019t from where we sit today see major changes there and expect that the primary use of our free cash flow will be to return to shareholders as oppose to expanding our seed capital activity. Michael Kim - Sandler O\u2019Neill: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Fannon - Jefferies & Company: Thanks. I guess just following up on the bank loan comments, and just want to characterize the institutional demand was very strong this past quarter and it seems per your commentary that\u2019s continuing. I guess is there any change in the redemption trend or is that -- I\u2019m just looking at your \u2013 we see the growth sales in aggregate and the growth redemptions, it seems like the redemption pickup is all retail. Is the gross sales acceleration all coming institutionally or is that the right way to think about it? Thomas E. Faust: I think that\u2019s right. We are -- I\u2019d say, we are in a -- if you put aside the $1.5 billion of withdrawals that we had from this program reallocation that I talked about, that mostly hit in I want to say the first half of June. Since then flows have been relatively stable in bank loans. We are seeing more redemptions than we would like. Gross sales are lower than we would like. But my own view, what do I know? My own view is that this will pass. And if you ask investors why are they redeeming bank loans? I don\u2019t think people can you really great reason. And my guess is that as the world evolves and there become other things to worry about that we will see lessening of bank loan redemption. Whether or not we\u2019ll see a pick up in sales? I think as maybe another matter. There was a huge pickup as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll recall in the first half of last year when there was a big surge of fear that the rates were going up and how does the income investor protect themselves or herself from loss of principal value in a period of rising interest rates. Bank loans seem like a great solution. Rates went up. Rates have been drifting down. My guess is that the next time that there\u2019s any kind of an upward shock in rates than we will again say a pickup in retail demand for bank loans. I don\u2019t know when that will be. I suspect somewhere out there in the next several quarters that will happen, but we certainly can\u2019t forecast that. We don\u2019t foresee that over the next couple of quarters. So our presumption is that we will see continued retail outflows, I\u2019d like at a moderating pace through the balance of the year and we\u2019d like to think to be offset largely by continued institutional demand. Let me just repeat my statement that I made in my prepared remarks, which was that, if you take out that $1.5 billion reallocation that we would been positive in bank loans for the quarter. Can\u2019t guarantee we\u2019ll be positive next quarter, but we certainly see the prospect for improved net flows because we don\u2019t anticipate anything like that in terms of single assets reallocation by any of our current bank loan clients. Dan Fannon - Jefferies & Company: Great. That's helpful. Just thinking about the fee rates in aggregate going forward, and if I look at your emerging franchises page which has the four funds that are gathering momentum and just looking forward beyond what you said for next quarter but thinking out a little bit further and where you're seeing some redemptions versus where these funds are inflowing, is it reasonable still to assume a stable fee rate in aggregate going forward based on these types of products growing versus where you're seeing redemptions today? Thomas E. Faust: I think as of long-term trend I would expect average fee rates for us to be moving down over coming quarters and coming years. I would say the same for our industry. We are -- our business as it grows and matures has become more competitive and that shows up principally in lower fees. We face those same pressures as everyone else. An additional dynamic we have is that Parametric which is \u2013 which is currently and has been the fastest growing part of Eaton Vance is a lower fee business than most of the other things that we do. I would expect Parametric to continue to grow faster than the rest of the Eaton Vance and that put additional pressure on us. So I think within asset classes, I would say we would see perhaps small downward pressure on fees consistent with overall industry trend. As our mix grows more in the direction of Parametric and particularly more in the direction of implementation services we could see additional fee rate declines. We don\u2019t necessarily view lower fees as a bad thing. We want to provide good value to our customers. If we can operate effectively with attractive margins at a lower fee rate that\u2019s business that we\u2019ll take any day. One of the things that most attractive to us about our Parametric franchise particularly as it is grown and now encompasses the former Clifton business, is while its low fee it is still a very nicely attractive business in terms of margin. So there\u2019s a tendency to think sometimes that low fee equates to low margin in our business. If the business is operating efficiently, if it\u2019s the kinds of strategies the kinds of thing that Clifton does or that the Parametric has done away from Clifton, we think we can earn very attractive margins and very attractive rates of returns at low fee rates. Dan Fannon - Jefferies & Company: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cynthia Mayer from Bank of America. Your line is open. Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning. Question on comp, you mentioned I think you made an adjustment to operating income basic rules. I just wondering if you could give some color on what drew the change, is that flow related or performance related or related to a particular part of the business. And also maybe a little bit on the likely impact of the change? So should we assume 3Q is representative of incentive based comp going forward? Laurie G. Hylton: Yeah. I think, Cynthia, the adjustments that we made were sort of minor adjustments across all of our subsidiaries as we were looking ahead to where we anticipated we were going to be making payouts at the end of the fiscal year. As you know operating income is up, but we want to ensure that we were making some rationale decisions around a given where we anticipate we\u2019re going to paying out at each of the subsidiaries, and therefore made a decision to bring things down modestly this quarter. To that end we do anticipate that the numbers you\u2019ve seen in the third quarter will likely be representative for what you would see in the fourth keeping in mind that the other significant component of variable compensation obviously is driven by sales, so that gets push around to the extent that there is an uptick in sales in the fourth quarter. Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So then, I guess with the new fiscal year, would you reset that again? Laurie G. Hylton: We do look at the accrual rates at the beginning of each fiscal year. I think there might be some modest changes, but I wouldn\u2019t anticipate anything significant in the first quarter. Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just the follow-up on the fee rate discussion, which is if you look at the floating rate maybe moving a little bit more to institutional versus retail. Would that effect the overall fee rate for floating rate or our CLOs and other institutional products sort of similar fee rate? Thomas E. Faust: Somewhat lower on average, but not grossly so. Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. And then if you guys have ending share count, that would be really helpful? I'll call back and get that if you prefer? Laurie G. Hylton: Just hold on. Ending shares were $118.7 million. Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks a lot. Laurie G. Hylton: You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler from William Blair. Your line is open. Chris Shutler - William Blair : Hey, guys, good morning. With the multi-sector bond fund, I think, Tom, you said that you're making progress getting onto with a retail distribution platforms. Maybe just a little bit more color there to the extent that you can provide it? Thomas E. Faust: There\u2019s not a whole lot to say. That market tense to have requirements in terms of asset size, manager tenure, track record. And what\u2019s been remarkable about the success we\u2019ve achieved with our bond fund in the multi sector strategy is that we\u2019ve really raised a lot of assets and gathered a lot of interest and attention really without having those things. So we began our fiscal year at the end of October with I think $75 million in assets in the strategy, that\u2019s now $1.2 billion or $1.3 billion something in that range. I can\u2019t point specifically to you know we\u2019re going to get on XYZ platform on a particular day, but I understand generally how things work which is that as a strategy proves itself overtime and its assets grow that can be a logical step. So I don\u2019t want to over promise that that\u2019s about to happen tomorrow, I would couch that more as we would anticipate as the strategy matures and as assets grow that presents additional growth opportunity that today we really haven\u2019t been able to take advantage of. Chris Shutler - William Blair : Okay. And then secondly on the global macro absolute return obviously good to see the outflows there moderate a bit, but it does look like performance is still of a challenge even in the short term, so just any update there and how you see the flow outlook going forward? Thanks. Thomas E. Faust: We\u2019re having a pretty good year in performance, and I think we\u2019re up about 4% for the I shares of our global macro strategy with LIBOR roundly zero, we think that\u2019s pretty good. That\u2019s our benchmark, we try and have performance of 300 to 400 basis points over our benchmark on an annual basis, that\u2019s consistent with the historical performance record of this strategy relative to many peer fund and the global macro category and there are not a lot and they vary pretty significantly but relative to our peers we think we\u2019re doing quite well. So I think what happened to us in flows was that 2013 was a year in which a lot of asset classes had very high returns, like made a lot of money in stocks. We had modestly negative returns, gross returns were a few basis points positive, net returns were negative with generally in the range of zero to 1%. That didn\u2019t really excite people, when equities are going up 30% why do you need to diversify into a global macro or similar types of esoteric strategies. We have done a couple of things since then. One is returns are better. We\u2019re making money. And the other is I think we\u2019re in a period of maybe a bit more cautious environment for equities and other asset classes and the principal reason for investing in global macro three or four years ago is the same today, which is it being a source of diversification and potentially non-core related returns. We have in our global macro strategy very little exposure to U.S. equities, very little exposure to global equity, very little exposure to global interest rates and very little exposure to the movement of the dollar versus established currency box like the euro and the yen. That\u2019s a pretty special asset class that provides that level of diversification. But with that diversification people want return, and we didn\u2019t deliver that last year. But we feel like with returns being in a positive and acceptable range, that we expect not only to see the outflows to continue to diminish, but I wouldn\u2019t give up hope of within not very many months that this becomes a growth business for us again. Chris Shutler - William Blair : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is open. Andrew Donnantuono : Hi this is actually Andrew Donnantuono filling in for Rob. Thanks for taking our questions. Just firstly, just a small one, could you just tell us how maybe we should be thinking about performance fees in fiscal fourth quarter. I know historically there\u2019s been a little bit of a jump there relative to you know fiscal two and three, you know if not quantify that if you could just kind of give us a sense of how we should think about performance fees in the upcoming quarters? Thomas E. Faust: Performance fees are, I guess you\u2019d say notoriously hard to model because performance and access performance is hard to model. I think you\u2019re right that the fourth quarter has been a period when we\u2019ve seen generally a little bit of an uptick in performance fees. We have a major account that is a parametrics account that has a performance fee component that\u2019s relative significant. The fees are as I remember the performance fee is on a rolling three year basis, periods is not done but we\u2019re ahead of the benchmark, so we could see an uptick in performance fees in the fourth quarter but its not something as I said to be terribly meaningful to the company as a whole. Andrew Donnantuono : Okay. Great, thanks and then just kind of shifting gears to just a very high level question, just trying to get a sense of as you\u2019re kind of cumulative institutional pipeline maybe outside of some of the emerging franchise businesses that you\u2019ve highlighted. You know would you characterize kind of where you\u2019re sit now versus recent quarters, you know as far as institutional pipeline goes and maybe where you have seen if any kinds of spikes in RPF activity of late, any color you might have there would be very helpful. Thomas E. Faust: Yeah so our visible pipeline and by pipeline we mean this is a one not funded business, is roundly $3 billion or so. That\u2019s a range of different areas that includes bank loans, it includes emerging market equities and includes a fair bit of growth at traditional Clifton\u2019s strategies both defensive equity and overlaid business there are some institutional cash management in that to recall that we started an institutional cash management business in 2013 and we\u2019re building a pipeline there and expect to see some of them hit maybe in the fourth quarter it might extend into the early part of fiscal 2015. But the places where we\u2019re seeing the activity or probably the obvious ones bank loan being high on that list, emerging market equities, multi-sector high yield, I guess those are probably the ones I would highlight as being most significant. Andrew Donnantuono : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you, Mr. Cataldo. Daniel C. Cataldo: Great. Thank you and thanks for joining us this morning and we look forward to reporting back to you at the end of our fourth fiscal quarter in November. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

These filings including our 2013 annual report and Form 10-K are available on our website on request at no charge. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Faust : Good morning. October 31st mark the end of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014. In a number of important respects, this was a year of transition and investment for Eaton Vance. We hired Eddie Perkin to lead Eaton Vance Management\u2019s Equity Group and had one of our best equity performance years in recent history. We shifted the leadership responsibilities with our Municipal Income Group and here again, had one of the best performance periods we have had in recent years. At Parametric, we completed the transition to an Integrated Institutional Sales and Marketing Group covering all Parametric\u2019s strategies and saw nearly 30% annual growth in the businesses of the former Clifton Group acquired at the end of 2012. Within our broader sales organization, we focused attention on developing four major emerging growth franchises for which we see significant near-term and long-term potential, multi-sector income, municipal bond latters, Clifton Defensive Equity and Richard Bernstein-subadvised funds. Across these strategies we saw managed assets increase from $3.3 billion to $9.2 billion in fiscal 2014, a gain of approximately 175%. And finally, perhaps, most significant of all, we advanced our exchange traded managed fund initiative to the brink of SEC approval. As many of you are aware, on November 6th and 7th, we announced three landmark developments for exchange traded managed funds. The SEC is issuing notice of its intent to grant Eaton Vance exemptive relief to permit the offering of exchange traded managed funds, SEC approval of the new NASDAQ rule governing the listing and trading of exchange traded managed funds and finally, the selection of NextShares as the branding of exchange traded managed funds. When -- when CEOs described recently completed fiscal years as periods of transition and investment, it usually means that the company's business and financial results did not need expectations. I am pleased to report that was not the case for Eaton Vance in 2014. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.48 for fiscal 2014 as a whole and $0.68 in the fourth quarter were both new records of 19% and 24%, respectively, over the year ago periods. And thanks to solid revenue growth and diligent cost control, our fiscal year operating margins advanced year-over-year from 33.4% to 35.8%. On the capital management front, over the course of fiscal 2014, we spent $322 million to repurchase and retire 8.5 million shares of stock, including 2.5 million shares repurchased in the fourth quarter at the cost of $94 million. The average cost of shares repurchased during the fiscal year was $37.86 a share. In addition to maintaining an active share repurchase program, we also increased our quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter by 14% to $0.25 a share. The increase marks the 34th consecutive year that the company has raised its regular quarterly dividend, which is growing at a compound annual rate of 18% over that period. We finished the year on very sound financial footing, with $541 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term debt securities held and a seed investment portfolio of $274 million. This compares to outstanding debt of $575 million, $250 million of which comes due in 2017 and the balance in 2023. Turning to our business results, we finished the year with record managed assets of $297.7 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Thanks to the strong fourth quarter for Parametrics Customize Exposure Management business, we finished the year with consolidated net inflows of $2.8 billion, our 19th consecutive year of positive net flows. Looking at just the fourth quarter, we had consolidated net inflows of $6.8 billion, which breaks down a $7.8 billion of exposure management inflows and $1 million -- $1 billion of net outflows from other strategies. In addition to exposure management, we saw positive quarterly net flows for municipal income, multi-sector income, tax managed core, emerging markets equities and defensive equity. Quarterly outflows were concentrated in large-cap value, floating rate income, global income and Atlanta Capital equities. While our overall net flows outside exposure management were negative in the fourth quarter, we did see about $1 billion of improvement from the third quarter for reasons I will discuss shortly, we expect to continue this improving trend in fiscal 2015. Returning to a full year view, our fiscal 2014 flow headwinds came primarily from three areas, large-cap value with $5 billion of net outflows, global income which had net outflows of $3.4 billion and Atlanta Capital with net outflows of $2.3 billion. Bank loan flows were positive $900 million for the fiscal year as a whole, but were minus $1.4 billion in the third quarter and a somewhat better minus $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Municipal income net flows started the year poorly, but got progressively better as the year advanced, minus $1 billion in the first quarter, plus $100 million in the second quarter, plus $450 million in the third quarter and plus $700 million in the fourth quarter. Looking forward to fiscal 2014, there are number of reasons why I'm upbeat about our flow prospects. To begin, I don't believe we will see the same magnitude of net outflows from the franchisor that hampered our 2014 flow results and I expect the number of our other franchise to make meaningful contributions to net flows. Much of my optimism is based on our significantly improving investment performance across equity, income and alternative investment areas, including a number of strategies that are now fully competitive in categories garnering significant flows across the industry. Overall, 72% of our fund assets are in funds that have Morningstar ratings of four or five stars for at least one class of shares. One area where we've seen dramatic improvement is an equity fund performance. Over the past year, 75% of our equity fund assets have beaten their Lipper peer group averages. Eddie Perkin took over leadership of our Equity Group this spring and has implemented a series of process enhancements that I am confident will continue to payoff with solid performance overtime. Our fixed income and alternative funds have also had impressive performance, with over 90% of fund assets beating their Lipper peer group averages. Municipal bond funds continued to garner investment flows across the industry and we're fully participating in this trend, financial advisors or investors are taking note of our excellent performance across the Board in munis, including 21 national and single state municipal bond funds now rated four or five stars. As I mentioned earlier, global income strategies were significant drag on net inflows in 2014, particularly in the first half of the year. We have every expectation that this will reverse in fiscal 2015. The investment performance of our suite of global income products has turned sharply upward, offering returns that beat the performance of many competitors to whom we have been losing share. With better numbers it should be our turn to shine in 2015. Among the funds included in our global income franchise is Short Duration Strategic Income Fund, which competes in the Morningstar Short-Term Bond Fund Category. Short-term bond is one of the top-selling asset classes in the industry and our performance here is excellent. The Class A and Class I shares of this fund are in the top 5% of their Morningstar peer group over one, five and three years and are both rated five stars. While hardly a new story, it's a story that we\u2019re increasingly introducing to financial advisors as a focus opportunity. In addition to the improved investment performance and established franchises, this year we made great progress building out the four emerging franchises that I mentioned previously, growing assets nearly $6 billion, or 175%. While it will be difficult to keep these growth rates on a percentage basis, we continue to believe that each of these four new franchises can grow at accelerated rates through 2015 and beyond. To the extent we see opportunities to expand our product offerings within each of these emerging franchises, we are doing it. We recently launched a sister product to the Eaton Vance Bond Fund for the variable annuity market and also recently launched the Eaton Vance Bond Fund II. Like our flagship Bond Fund, Bond Fund II is managed by a team led by Kathleen Gaffney. However, Bond Fund II will not make significant equity investments. We believe this more pure approach could further broaden the appeal of this high-performing rapidly developing franchise. Although Bond Fund II was launched just this month, Kathleen and her team have been managing a separate account under the same strategy for over year and have achieved an excellent investment performance record. We also continue to build out the product lineup within the Richard Bernstein-subadvised franchise, which includes the four-star Morningstar-rated equity strategy and all asset strategy funds. In September, we launched the Richard Bernstein Market Opportunities Fund a long, short all asset fund and we also just started representing the Richard Bernstein-advised ETF models in the major wire houses. Turning to the floating-rate franchise, retail net outflows continued in the fourth quarter for both us and our industry. Consistent with the last quarter, our negative retail flows were partially offset by positive net flows from institutional clients. We believe that the negative retail settlement will abate when the retail market refocuses on the prospects of higher interest rates. Institutional investors clearly recognized the value proposition and protection against interest rate risk that floating-rate loans can provide. We are hopeful that retail investors will return to this understanding sooner rather than later in 2015. Before I turn to the topic of NextShares, I want to spend a moment reviewing results for our Seattle-based subsidiary, Parametric, which continues to be a growth engine inside Eaton Vance. In fiscal 2014, Parametric's managed assets grew 16% to $136 billion, a 10% organic growth rate, contributing meaningfully to our consolidated earnings as well. I know Parametric\u2019s businesses can be confusing, but you should think of them as offering two broad product lines, engineered alpha strategies which comprised $34.6 billion of their $136 billion of AUM and implementation services, which represent the balance. In 2014, engineered alpha strategies led by emerging markets and defensive equities generated net flows of $1.4 billion or an organic growth rate of 5%. Implementation services is made up of our capabilities, tax-managed core, centralized portfolio management, specialty index, and customized exposure management, led by exposure management and Parametric\u2019s implementation services business with the fastest growing part of Eaton Vance in fiscal 2014, with organic growth of 12%. While not generating as high as management fee as our other strategies about 11 basis points on average, implementation services operate at attractive margins and Parametric is among the market leaders across the range of its implementation service capabilities. Heading into 2015, the pipeline for a number of Parametric engineered alpha and implementation services strategies is looking very strong. I'll close with an update on our NextShares exchange traded managed fund\u2019s initiative. As many of you know, NextShares is our proposed new type of open-end fund, combining features and benefits of actively managed mutual funds and ETFs. Like active mutual funds, NextShares seek to outperform their benchmark index and peer funds by applying the managers\u2019 investment insights and research judgments. Like ETFs, NextShares will utilize an exchange traded structure with built-in performance and tax-advantages. Differed from ETFs, NextShares would not disclose their portfolio holdings on a daily basis to preserve the confidentiality of trading information. NextShares will be bought and sold on an exchange utilizing a new trading protocol called NAV-based trading in which all bids, offers and trade executions are directly linked to the fund\u2019s next end-of-day net asset value. This new trading approach should ensure that NextShares can be bought and sold with trading costs that are consistently low and fully transparent in a manner not available for ETFs. As mentioned previously, there were two favorable regulatory developments for NextShares earlier this month, which we believe should position us to introduce the first of this pioneering new fund type in the second quarter of next year. As previously disclosed, our Navigate Fund Solutions subsidiary holds a series of NextShares related patents that we are seeking to commercialize by licensing to Eaton Vance and other fund groups. Our focus with NextShares over the coming months is threefold, first completing the regulatory approval process, second ensuring market readiness for the launch of the first NextShares funds just targeted for the second quarter of next year, and third signing other fund groups as Navigate license fees and supporting them through the regulatory process. Over the 2.5 week since receiving our SEC news, we have been extremely pleased with the marketplace response and the widespread interest expressed by other fund companies. We continue to view NextShares as a significant advance in the evolution of fund investing, a forward leap for active management and a major opportunity for Eaton Vance. With that, I will turn the call over to Laurie to discuss the quarterly financial results in more detail. Laurie Hylton : Thank you, and good morning. As Tom mentioned, we are reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.68 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, compared to $0.55 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and $0.63 for the third quarter of this fiscal year. This represents an increase of 24% over the fourth quarter of last year and an increase of 8% sequentially. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.66 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, $0.45 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and $0.63 in the third quarter of this fiscal year. As you can see in attachment two to our press release, adjustments from reported GAAP earnings in the fourth quarters of fiscal 2014 and 2013 primarily reflect changes in the estimated redemption value of non-controlling interest in our affiliate that are redeemable at other than fair value. Results for the full fiscal year were also strong with adjusted earnings per diluted share increasing 19% to $2.48 in fiscal 2014 from $2.08 a year ago. The $0.04 of adjustments from our $2.44 at fiscal 2014 GAAP earnings per diluted share again primarily reflects changes in the estimated redemption value of non-controlling interest in our affiliates. Operating income in the fourth quarter increased to 11% year-over-year and 6% sequentially on modest revenue growth. Prudent cost management and lower variable compensation costs drove our operating margin up to 37.8% in the fourth quarter fiscal 2014 from 35.1% in the fourth quarter of last year and 35.7% last quarter. On the strength of those operating results, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter increased 19% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Results for fiscal 2014 as a whole mirrored our fourth quarter experience. Operating income increased 15% on revenue growth of 7%, with our operating margin improving to 35.8% for the full fiscal year from 33.4% a year ago. Adjusted net income was up 18% and adjusted earnings per diluted share were up 19%. Our fourth quarter revenue increased 3% year-over-year, reflecting a 4% increase in investment advisory administrative fees, partially offset by modest declines in distribution and service fee revenues. Looking specifically at investment advisory administrative fees, the 4% increase year-over-year reflects an 8% increase in average assets under management, offset by decline in our effective investment advisory fee rate. The decline in our effective investment advisory fee rates were 44 basis points in the fourth quarter of last year to 43 basis points this quarter, can be primarily attributed to strong growth in Parametric exposure management business, which operates at fee rates well below corporate averages. The impact of the change in product mix more than offset the increase in performance fees, which were $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and $3.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. We\u2019ve not seen any significant changes in our mandate level effective fee rates, either year-over-year or sequentially and would not anticipate that we would see any significant changes in those rates as we move into the new fiscal year. That said, product mix continues to be the most significant determine of our overall effective fee rate and as we've seen, any meaningful changes in product mix going forward could certainly impact our overall rate over time. Shifting from revenue to expense, operating expenses were down 1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting decreases in variable compensations and fund-related expenses, offset by fairly modest increases in distribution-related expenses and other discretionary spending. Operating expenses decreased 3% sequentially reflecting single digit percentage decreases in compensations, distribution and fund-related expenses, partially offset by a 2% increase in other discretionary spending. Compensation expense decreased 2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting decreases in sales and operating income based incentives and stock-based comp, partially offset by increases in base salaries and benefits due to a 5% increase in average headcount. The 6% decrease in compensation expense sequentially can be primarily attributed to decreases in operating income based incentives and stock-based compensation. Looking at the full fiscal year, sales-based incentives were down 15%, reflecting the decrease in retail sales. Operating income-based incentives were up 6% driven by the increase in operating income and fixed compensation cost, which primarily includes base benefits, taxes and stock-based compensation were up 7%, consistent with the 7% increase in average headcount for the year. Looking forward to the first quarter of fiscal 2015 will likely see a sequential increase in total compensation due to typical seasonal compensation pressures, base increases take effect, payroll tax clocks reset, 401(k) contributions are matched and accrual rates for operating income based incentive are expected to increase. As a result, I anticipate the total compensation in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 would represent closer to 32% to 33% of revenue, as we saw in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, as opposed to the 30% we reported this quarter. This increase will obviously have a dampening effect on our sequential operating trends as well. Distribution and service fee expenses increased marginally in the fourth quarter over the same period a year ago and were largely flat sequentially, reflecting relative stability and assets under management subject to these fees. Fund-related expenses were down 13% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially, reflecting lower fund subsidies and other fund-related expenses, partially offset by an increase in sub-advisory expenses driven by growth in sponsored funds managed by unaffiliated subadvisors. Other operating expenses were up 3% in the fourth quarter over the same period a year ago and up 2% sequentially, primarily reflecting increases in travel and information technology spending related to investment management systems projects. Gross and other operating expenses was limited to 6% percent for the full fiscal year, reflecting increases in same spending categories. I would note that our overall cost structure includes approximately $4 million of costs in fiscal 2014, or roughly $0.02 of adjusted earnings per diluted share that we would attribute to our efforts to garner SEC approval on bring NextShares to market. Although we\u2019ve not finalized our NextShares spending plans for fiscal 2015, I would anticipate that our spending on this initiative will approximately double from the $4 million spend in fiscal 2014. Net income and gains on seed capital investments contributed roughly a penny to earnings in each of the last two quarters of fiscal 2014, with no impact on earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. When quantifying the impact of our new seed capital investments on earnings each quarter, we take into consideration our pro rata share of the gains, losses and other investment income earned on investments in sponsored products whether accounted for as consolidated funds, separate accounts or equity method investments as well as the gains and losses recognized on derivatives used to hedge these investments. We then report the per share impact net of non-controlling interest expense and income taxes. Changes in quarterly equity of net income of affiliates both year-over-year and sequentially reflect changes in net income and gains recognized on sponsored products accounted for under the equity method. Our 49% interest in Hexavest, which is reported net of tax and the amortization of intangibles in equity and net income affiliates contributed approximately $0.02 per diluted share for all quarterly periods presented. Excluding the affects of CLO entity earnings and losses, our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was 36.7% 38.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, and 39.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. We currently anticipate that our effective tax rate adjusted for CLO earnings and losses will be approximately 38%, as we move into the new fiscal year. In terms of capital management, we repurchased 2.5 million shares of non-voting common stock for approximately $94.1 million in the fourth quarter. When combined with prior quarters repurchases, this brought both our average diluted share count and ending shares outstanding for the fourth quarter down by 3%, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Even with the significant share repurchases, we finished the fiscal year holding just over $540 million of cash and short-term debt securities and approximately $274 million in seed capital investment. Cash balances will go down in the first quarter, as we pay out operating income based incentives and fund our annual profit-sharing contribution. Our outstanding debt consists of $250 million of 6.5% senior notes due in 2017 and $325 million of 3.625% senior notes due in 2023. We also have a new $300 million, five-year line of credit, which we entered into in October to replace our previous three-year line that was due to expire in fiscal 2015. The line is currently undrawn. Given our strong cash flow, liquidity and overall financial condition, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This concludes our prepared comments. At this point, we\u2019d like to take any question you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is open. Robert Lee : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Laurie Hylton : Good morning. Tom Faust : Rob, good morning. Robert Lee : Hi. Tom, I have a question on the ETMF. I\u2019m just trying to -- if I think ahead a couple quarters and you have your products up and running mid-year, call it, how do you envision your sales force, your wholesalers marketing that? If you have just as an example, let's say you have one of the Richard Bernstein products in an ETMF form, are you expecting that your own marketing people will be shifting their focus to that versus say a more traditional structure? I mean, how do you think about managing that internally as you ramp up -- not a competing structure, but a different structure? Tom Faust : Yeah. Okay. I think that\u2019s pretty straight forward. We offer most of our mutual fund products almost all of them in a multi-class structure where we have institutional share classroom where there is no front or back end sales load and no 12b-1 distribution fees. We also have A shares, which have typically a 25 basis point distribution service fee and sometimes offered with a front end load, then more commonly that is waived. And then our third most common class of shares is C shares which has a 100 -- no front end load, 1% CDSC, if redeemed within 12 months but ongoing 1% of distribution and service payment. Where we see NextShares is fitting in, as being competitive with what we call Class I or institutional class shares. That represents about two thirds of our business today in terms of flows. So what I would expect is that, if the example is the Richard Bernstein -- if the Eaton Vance Richard Bernstein Equity Strategy Fund that we would offer, we would continue to offer the mutual fund with multiple share classes and alongside that, we would offer the new NextShares version of that same strategy. I would expect little or no movement of assets from the Class C shares, potential sales of Class C shares from the mutual fund to the NextShares version, maybe some but probably not much Class A activity would move to the new version. But I think it is reasonable to expect that significant percentage of what would've been the Class I shares sales of the mutual fund to shift to NextShares which we expect to have a lower expense ratio. We expect also to have incrementally higher returns in addition to the lower expenses based on the way the funds are structured and the way the funds are effectively sheltered from the cost of accommodating inflows and outflows and the expected higher tax efficiency. So we would expect that that much of the activity in terms of new sales will shift from the mutual fund to the NextShares version of the same strategy. We will not stop marketing the mutual fund. There will be some customers that would take a wait-and-see attitude to see how this new type of fund structure shakes out. But we expect to certainly to put a significant focus on selling the new version alongside the existing product. Of the 18th strategies that we have announced as where we intend to offer NextShares, 17 of those are effectively clones of existing top Eaton Vance mutual funds. We expect from a compensation perspective, which maybe you are getting towards your question, also to compensate our wholesalers on a similar basis, not exactly the same, similar. Although NextShares will be exchange traded products and where we will not be able to track gross sales on the same basis that we\u2019re able to track mutual fund sales. We do expect through most, if not all, broker-dealer systems to get data that would allow us to track growth in the fund assets on a territory-by-territory basis. And we use that -- we use that as the way to compensate our salespeople. Robert Lee : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Just maybe as a follow-up for Laurie, I appreciate the color on comp as we look forward. Just trying to get maybe a little bit more granular feel. So if we think that 32% to 33% range next quarter, how much -- how should we be thinking that the piece of that is kind of the seasonal impact that will -- as we think through next year that will kind of fade away, all else equal. Is it $5 million, is it one or two points in that. Just trying to get a feel for how we should think of that comp ratio at this point for the full year, next year? Laurie Hylton : Yes, Rob. We generally speaking in the first quarter have fixed compensation costs that kick in. I think I referenced specifically on the call. But I think that you are probably somewhere in the tune to $1.5 million to maybe $2 million in total. And those are the things that we talked about in terms of -- we've got pace increases, we\u2019ve got 401(k) matching that happens in the first quarter, payroll clocks reset, all of that, all of that happens. Likely, we are hopeful there will also be some impact from variables compensation as we hopefully see growth sales pick up again in the first quarter. I can\u2019t quantify what that\u2019s going to look like as we don\u2019t know what the growth sales picture will look like. And then we also picked 10-Q in the first quarter, reset our operating income based bonus accruals. So we wouldn\u2019t anticipate those are going to pick up significantly but we would anticipate there will be some pick up. I don\u2019t have specific numbers to give you at this point. I think I would prefer not to give that kind of guidance. But I would anticipate that in total our compensation as a percentage of revenue will pick up by one or two percentage points in the first quarter. Robert Lee : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open. Chris Shutler : Hey guys. Good morning. On the floating rate assets, looks like the issue in the quarter was just the lower gross sales. But maybe just to confirm, there were no large kind of platform issues like last quarter. And then what do you think ultimately need to happen for the retail side there to stabilize? Tom Faust : Yeah. So there were no -- you're correct, there were no big platform reallocations. I think the thing we\u2019re seeing as you observed were continued steady positive flows on the institutional side and maybe a diminishing of retail interest has expressed more in lower gross sales than higher redemption. What I think is happening now is that institutional investors are perhaps more mindful of the fact that the 10 point interest rates are going to go off and that when that happens, there's a significant performance -- portfolio benefit are being diversified of not having only fixed rate income assets but also having floating-rate income assets. That was a lesson that retail investors were sharply reminded of in the first half of 2013 when our rates started to move up pretty quickly since rates have comeback down that less than it\u2019s moved to the back up of -- I suspect many retail investors mind. But nonetheless like the institutional investors that continue to put money into this asset class, my own view is that it's inevitable that at some point we will start to see upward movement in interest rates. And so what I think will be required to get retail flows into bank loans moving again in a significant way upward from where they are today is something some catalyst that causes either investors or financial visors to be reminded that yes there is interest rate risk and that the best defense against interest rate risk is moving a significant portion of the client assets from fixed rate to floating rate. I don\u2019t have a crystal ball as to when that\u2019s going to happen, but I think it will happen. It could happen soon depending on what happens with the economy. But I think that\u2019s likely to be the trigger. Chris Shutler : All right. Thanks, Tom. And then on multi-sector bond, just hoping to get an update there in terms of progress on getting onto additional retail platforms and just the -- how the institutional pipeline looks for that product? Tom Faust : So you\u2019re talking about our bond fund? Chris Shutler : Correct. Dan Cataldo : Yes, so we have, Chris, start over the past few quarters about appending funding that we expect to see in the near future. We\u2019re still waiting for that. So we\u2019re optimistic we will see that. I know institutional group has been talking to the clients and the consultants about the product. And as we\u2019ve said in prior quarters, many of the institutions do want to wait to see the three-year performance record, not all. I mean we don't need to hit three years to have the conversation. So we're hopeful that as Kathleen keeps up her excellent performance that we will continue to gain traction there. And I do believe we have pretty broad coverage on the retail platforms at this point for the municipal bond fund. I think an interesting thing to keep an eye out for there is our progress on the Eaton Vance Bond Fund II. As Tom mentioned that product is more pure play on multi-sector income without an allocation to equity than we did hear from the market, particularly institutional that that would be something that they're looking for. So still everything was very positive there. And we would expect to not only build out the -- increase the assets in bond fund but also build out the franchise with them. These are the products. Chris Shutler : All right. Thanks Dan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Tom, if you could expand a little bit more on the initial feedback you've heard on the ETMF product. And maybe how we should think about the potential signing up of licensee clients, is that something you will be announcing we should hear from? Is it going to come after the second quarter once it's officially announced or we should potentially get some of that ahead of the official launch? Tom Faust : Yeah. Now we would expect -- we will see activity, I would hope significant activity well before that launch in the second quarter. We are quite busy, Stephen Clarke, who runs this initiative for us. I know yesterday was traveling and had meetings with four different fund companies, he told me and spoke to a fifth via conference call. So there's a lot of activity, lots of interest in the space. In some cases, this is a relatively new store. We might have had one or two preliminary meetings but we didn't really get fund committees attention until we got this positive news from the SEC a couple weeks ago. So in some cases, its people moving quickly from a relatively undeveloped state of understanding of the potential opportunity here. In quite a few other cases, however, we've been talking seriously for a number of months, in some cases over a year where we think those companies can move quickly to do two things one -- two things that we\u2019re asking fund companies to do. One is to sign a term sheet with us, which effectively puts in place the broad outlines of our potential agreement on the economic terms of our licensing arrangement. And the second equally important is to file exemptive applications getting themselves in line with the SEC. As we mentioned, couple of weeks ago when we have the call on announcing the next year news, the process that the SEC has prescribed for how licensee can -- should file an exemptive application is designed to be extremely efficient, that is essentially what a licensee has to do, is represent that they will agree to abide by the terms and conditions of the Eaton Vance exemptive order. So rather than the process of filing exemptive order be a potentially multi-month process involving extensive use of outside counsel and producing a document that might be 40 to 60 pages. This is a simplified process that would certainly be done in-house at little or no cost that involves up four to six page document that more or less says, these are the fund that we would initially propose to introduce. We would like this really to apply to both those funds, as well as future funds, we might introduce in the future. And all of these funds would rely on the terms and conditions of the Eaton Vance order. So we view that as extremely important in the development. The SEC embracing this approach in the timeline for not only signing up licensees because it's not a big commitment of resources for them to sign a term sheet and get inline with the SEC. And then second, even more important, this also should greatly speed up the timeframe in which other fund companies are bringing out products to market. So we are very busy. We would expect us to sign up firms possibly this month but we think there's a good chance as certainly before the end of our first fiscal quarter, which is at the end of January that we\u2019ll have announcement. Some of these may come to light by virtue of a press release announced either by us or by the fund company that\u2019s the licensee or it may just be in the form of an exemptive application that gets filed, that would indicate that they are filing for relief and are licensing Eaton Vance technology and are relying on the terms and conditions of our order. So we\u2019re very busy there and certainly, quite hopeful that there will be significant activity over the coming weeks. Dan Fannon : Great. And I think you mentioned on the previous call a study that you guys had done and wondering if that's been released about the cash drag. I think that's what it's focused on and the impact that has on performance. If I think about it in a down market, isn't the cash drag a helpful component to performance? Tom Faust : Sure. So there is the study, which we\u2019ve concluded and are releasing on a selective basis primarily, focused on getting that in the hands of potential licensees. The study identifies four primary costs of mutual funds that would either be eliminated or substantially eliminated by moving to the structure. One of those, the most straightforward is probably, one distribution fees which of course don't exist for institutional share classes but across all fund classes, I think average something like 40 basis points on an equal weighted basis and around 15 basis points asset weighted. So no 12b-1 distribution fees for NextShares. If you're comparing NextShares to the institutional share class of mutual funds that cost savings effectively doesn\u2019t apply but what does apply is three other cost savings. The first of which is significantly reduce if not illuminated transfer agent fees that\u2019s a cost of roundly 15 basis points and maybe a little bit more than that for the average fund. The second cost is the one you mentioned which is cash drag, which is variable for different funds depending on how much cash they hold, but also variable of course depending on whether markets are moving up or down over a particular period. And the third avoided cost as we describe it is the cost of the incremental trading that a fund incurs to accommodate cash inflows and cash outflows. And this is for memory, but that cost, as I recall, its about 20 to 25 basis points for typical fund. So the study identified -- which focuses on the broad universe of equity funds over the period 2007 to 2013, identifies the total of I believe 62 basis points of non-12b-1 costs for a typical fund that would be -- that should be avoidable by shifting to this structure, which roundly 15 basis points is transfer agent expenses, 20 to 25 basis points, I believe is the flow-related trading costs and the balance would be cash drag. The study also looks at, if you take historical mutual fund performance and adjust that to remove these cost factors, how does that compared to benchmark ETFs that have the same index over that period in it. And not surprisingly, that if you pull out enough cost that makes a dramatic impact on the percentage of fund -- percentage of active funds that outperformed in a way that I think that will be potentially a very significant in longer-term affecting the balance of active versus passive in the market if this new lower cost structure is widely adopted. The study does not focus on. Though this is an area of significant interest that both for us and potential licensees. This study does not attempt to quantify two things. One is the benefits of fixed income funds, which we also think would be significant and also the benefit in terms of tax savings and both of those are areas of potential future research that we\u2019re started to think about. But the work that we've done is on equity funds. It covers a broad universe of funds over a long period, both up market and down market, and we think is going to be quite instructive to fund companies, as they think about the potential benefits to their shareholders from adopting this new structure. Dan Fannon : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Bill Katz : Hey. Thank you very much taking my questions. So, Tom, just want to follow-up on the discussion with the pipeline for possible licensee applications. Number of your peers sort of come out and expressed some cautionary remarks and a couple of broker dealers look at the complexity of it. So to try and get a sense of maybe triangulate against that versus your optimism? In the conversations you're having with different potential folks that sign-up, can you range the assets that you're speaking about here either in the typical size, average size or some way to get a real sense of maybe the near-term addressable market? Tom Faust : I didn\u2019t follow that. What do you mean range the assets? Bill Katz : What size coming -- I just talking the companies may have $500 billion of assets, that might be looking to do this $25 billion. Just try to get a sense of the foreseeable revenue opportunity on licensing? Tom Faust : We\u2019re talking to companies of, I guess, I would say, all but the smallest sizes, with significant interest expressed from large to middle to small size company, that we don\u2019t see any differentiation in level of interest by fund company size. From our perspective, the entire market is potentially available to us as a potential licenses. We are not aware of significant pushback from fund companies on for the -- about things that you\u2019re talking about? Bill Katz : Got you. Okay. The second question is, you did a nice job of highlighting some of your newer areas? You said about $9 billion some of the emerging franchises? When you speak to the laggards a little bit? Could you range what -- how much in assets you have there between retail institutional and then within that where do you feel most confident in the turn? Tom Faust : So we talked about, let just say, so that, the areas that we identified as laggards for the year, one would be large-cap value, second would be global income and third, Atlanta Capital, I think those were the three areas. Laurie Hylton : Yeah. Tom Faust : So I mean, I can just speak on each of these, large-cap value we didn\u2019t really talk much about in any detail. This is now. We have about $8.5 billion in large-cap value assets of which some thing like $4.5 billion I think is in the large-cap value mutual fund sort of the flagship product there. You probably recall that at one point that was over $30 billion. So we\u2019ve seen outflows for quite a long time now. We\u2019ve seen those outflows have continued this year. Recall that we went through a transition this year where Mike Mach, long time head of that team retired. Eddie Perkin came in and we have new leadership of that team. We have significantly improved performance. We are having a solid year in that. But the way we view the redemptions we are getting now is, people that view the change in leadership of the team as perhaps the last straw. And we expect that, if we can continue to put up good performance numbers that the outflows there will abate, given that that fund is now a little over 1% of our overall assets and that the overall strategy is a little less than 3% of our assets. It\u2019s -- the ability of large-cap values to pull down our overall flow results as it did in fiscal 2012 and 2013, its just not there anymore. We don't have enough assets in the strategy for that to exert a very significant pull on the company. And we are optimistic based on the improvement in performance in the fact that Eddie is been here since, I guess, almost seven months now that the news of a change in leadership is now well known in the marketplace. On the Global Income side, we talked a little bit about that in my prepared remarks, which is that the trend over the year has been significantly better. We had a pretty lousy first quarter due to disappointment in performance of our Global Macro Absolute Return Fund. The good news is that we are having a strong year there through the end of October. Global Macro Absolute Return Fund is up on a one year basis 3.7% and up 2.9% year to date. The more aggressive version of the strategy, the Global Macro Absolute Return Fund, Class I shares are up just under 7% on a one year basis and just under 6%, year-to-date. And those are very competitive numbers within this asset class. We were put in the penalty box a year ago because we had negative returns, we didn\u2019t kill people, but we lost I think maybe 40 or 50 basis points or so on the Class I shares. So performance numbers are better. We're seeing improved trends there and we also have some products there that are managed by that team where we think we are on the verge of significantly better flows that will highlight our short-term strategic income fund, which is now a five-star fund and which has got top performance over multiple periods as a fund that has been a modest contributor to flows where we expect to see potentially quite significant inflows next year. A third strategy, I would point to as a potential growth area in Global Income is emerging market debt where we've got a couple of different strategies within that category, both with very solid performance and this is an asset class that continues to attract assets and where we think we\u2019ve got significant growth potential. I mean, if I had to guess I would guess that next year that we\u2019ll see continued outflows from large-cap value though at a reduced level from where we were today. If I had to guess, I would predict that Global Income, we have a decent shot of turning to positive flows in total and potentially of quite significant flows. The third area that I mentioned as a source of outflow for the year is Atlanta Capital Management and that encompasses - primarily, Atlanta Capital has three areas -- growth equities, core equities and fixed income. All of them were in net redemption for the year. The biggest source of that was their growth product, which is largely based on a performance. But they had an important client in the first half of the year that shifted away from active management that hurt the overall flow results there. But they've been -- Atlanta Capital is focused on quality investing. This has been a difficult period, not just 2014 but the last few years for quality investing. They\u2019ve lagged their benchmark and that\u2019s hurt them. They had a good performance month in October for what that\u2019s worth, which helps them on a year-by-year basis. But they are sticking to their knitting and working hard and not really in a position to say whether next year is likely to get better or worse there, but I don't see a significant risk that it's going to get a lot worse. But on overall basis those are the franchises that hurt us in the year. And as we said, we are optimistic than on balance, those will get better, which will help us on an overall basis also as we grow some of these emerging franchises. We also had a couple of areas that I didn\u2019t realty talk about that -- but for performance reasons, we are pretty optimistic about going into the New Year. One of those in particular, I would highlight would be high-yield bonds where we have really a terrific track record over multiple periods having a great year, but also really excellent long-term performance as well. Another area that I would highlight where we saw growth this year but at a reduced level that I think could certainly accelerate is Parametric\u2019s Emerging Market equity strategy. You may recall at the beginning of this year, there was pretty strong negative sentiment about emerging market equities and as that's abated over the year. And a lot of people have come to the view that emerging market equities maybe one of the best sources of value across the global equity markets. We've seen increased interest there. So strong performance, they've had over many years with a systematic structured strategy and we are saying we think a pickup in interest there that should point to stronger flows for them in 2015. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you for the great perspective. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi. Still morning, so good morning. Do you need to see the NextShare products and if so, how much would you expect to contribute? Tom Faust : Our understanding is that the exchange has a minimum of 1 million shares to list a new fund. We're thinking this hasn\u2019t been finalized but we\u2019re thinking of an initial value of $20 a share, so $20 million of seed capital. We haven't really gotten fully into how we would finance that, but 20 times -- 18 is not insignificant -- $20 million times 18 is a not an insignificant amount of money. We could conceivably finance that internally if we thought that makes sense. But we would be open to other avenues of financing that as well. Ken Worthington : Great. And then I think you implied that you\u2019ll be compensating wholesalers on a net basis for NextShares rather than a gross basis? Have you ever compensated your sales force on a net basis for any product before and if so how did that work out? And is it challenging to make net compensation as attractive for wholesalers as gross? Tom Faust : I didn\u2019t say that we were going to be compensating them on net sales. I said we are going to be measuring the growth in assets of the strategy on a basis that looks at essentially the book value of the position in account. So, we're quite aware of the complexities of compensating wholesalers on net basis that\u2019s not been our traditional approach. But we do think that as we move into exchange-traded products, it will likely become more important to use NextShares -- to use net sales. Sorry, too confusing here, to use net sales as a primary determinant .But it won't -- certainly it won't be the only determinant of sales force compensation going forward. Ken Worthington : Okay. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Carrier : Thanks. Laurie, just two number of questions, just on both the distribution and service revenue and expenses, a little bit more of a stepdown sequentially and just wanted to see if there was anything different besides mix there? And then on the performance fees, just when we look at either the sequential and then the year-over-year trend, obviously a relatively good quarter. So when we think about going forward, any shift in terms of the products that are generating the fees in terms of assets basis or performance on some of these products? Laurie Hylton : Hi, Michael. In terms of the distribution service fees, there really was no seismic shift, there is just a question of asset mix. Those are just a straight basis points on assets that are subject to those fees. There is no magic there. In terms of the performance fees, we have only a handful of institutional accounts that have significant performance fees. One of the largest is in the fourth quarter of each year. So we see this activity in the fourth quarter and then there is minimal activity in the rest of the fiscal year. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks. And just as a follow-up. Tom, recently the SEC has been looking for the entire industry on some of the potential issues down the road on fixed income products or illiquid products and trying to figure out what they might do in terms of increased regulation or increased cash balances. Just wanted to get your sense on, obviously it\u2019s very recent and we got a ways to go in before anything is proposed. But just want to get your sense on the risk that you see? And then more importantly, is it just more of a lower return for certain products for investors or would there be any negative impact for the industry in terms of keeping the assets or assets going elsewhere? Tom Faust : I\u2019m aware that the SEC is interested in the topic of liquidity and the fixed income markets and interested in particularly how that affects funds that offer daily redemption privileges and maybe also particularly how that affects ETFs that offer intraday pricing and intraday price-based liquidity. And we've spoken to the SEC on these topics. I've not heard either directly or indirectly or maybe I have missed this that there is a proposal that would require fixed income funds to maintain a cash reserve. I would find that very surprising if that\u2019s currently under consideration at the SEC, but I\u2019m not aware of that. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greggory Warren with Morningstar. Your line is open. Greggory Warren : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You guys mentioned earlier in the call that you\u2019ve seen some interest from other asset managers out there. I\u2019m just kind of curious, has any of this interest come from parties that were more or less pursuing kind of their blind trust structure that BlackRock and Precidian were pushing for the SEC, in particular I'm thinking State Street, Invesco, Capital Group, American Funds? Tom Faust : I won\u2019t speak to specific fund companies that wouldn\u2019t be appropriate. But I can say that certainly there are companies that we\u2019re talking to that were looking at or considering alternative models. So the kinds of things that we\u2019re offering, which is the ability to present active strategies in a structure that preserves the confidentiality of current funds trading information while still capturing the potential cost efficiencies and tax efficiencies and exchange traded structure. Those same things would have attracted people to Precidian as attract us, as attract people to us. So it\u2019s not surprising to us that the people that might have been interested in that structure would also have an interest in talking to us about our structure. Greggory Warren : Okay. And I guess maybe just as a follow-up there. In your conversations with the SEC, did you ever get a sense that they didn't necessarily want to have one firm having a monopoly over this? Is there potential that maybe -- I know T. Rowe Price has filing up and that\u2019s not necessarily blind trust filing, but whether or not the SEC was looking for potentially other mousetraps to offer if they were settled on just one? Tom Faust : We've made it clear that we don't intend to have a monopoly here. Our goal is to license this technology broadly across the industry. We expect not only Eaton Vance but essentially all comers in our industry to have access to this technology at what we think will be reasonable licensing fees to make available to their customers. I would point out this is not the first, but it is the second approved the way that an active manager can offer exchange traded products. There is the fully transparent version that was approved in 2008 and there is now the NAV-based version that we believe we\u2019re on the verge of approval of in 2014. I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate whether they will or will not be other versions that might be approved at some point in the future. Greggory Warren : Right, okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : That\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks. Tom Faust : Okay, great. Thank you for joining us this morning. We hope you all have a happy and safe Thanksgiving. And enjoy the holidays. And we look forward to reporting back to you at the close of our first fiscal quarter in February. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Kathleen McCabe : Good morning. This is Kathleen McCabe, Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements which reflect management's current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. The presentation may also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our SEC filings at www.morganstanley.com for a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of Morgan Stanley. This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or instrument. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Office James Gorman. James Gorman : Thank you, Kathleen, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on what is the last earnings call from our favorite CFO, Ruth Porat. I will now give you some highlights for the first quarter results and mark to market our execution against the strategic plan that we provided an update of in January. We begin this year on a solid footing with all businesses contributing to our performance. Excluding DVA, this was the strongest quarter in firm revenue and PBT in many years. In fact, it was the second best quarter in revenue, ex-DVA, in the firm's 80 year history. Key highlights include the following. Equity showed continued leadership. We delivered strong performance across products and regions both quarter over quarter and year over year. Fixed income delivered a stronger quarter consistent with our strategy. Investment Banking performed solidly and the pipeline remains healthy. Wealth Management achieved record revenue, record revenue per financial advisor and delivered a pretax margin of 22%. Investment Management results were steady but there's more to be done as this business remains an important part of our growth opportunity. Most significantly we took a meaningful step toward achieving our state of return on equity target, delivering in this quarter an ROE of 10.1%. This ROE excludes the affect of the net discrete tax benefit and DVA. On a reported basis, as you'll have seen, the ROE for the quarter was actually 14.2%. This performance reflects our strategic plan and demonstrates the business' flexibility to respond to increased client activity and market movements. While the firm has clearly made progress, there remains work to be done in achieving the six-point plan we laid out in January. An update of which I'll briefly provide today. First, we continue to improve our wealth management margin, which reached 22% for the quarter. The business is also benefiting from additional factors described during our last call. Secondly, we'll continue to execute on our bank strategy through deploying our deposits and again delivering prudent loan growth across Wealth Management and institutional securities. Third, fixed income and commodities saw its strongest revenue quarter in three years, as volumes returned to the market with increased volatility. This quarter was important evidence of the execution of our strategy to significantly reduce the capital required to support the fixed income business, while maintaining the appropriately sized global footprint to meet our client\u2019s needs. Needless to say, we must see this play out for more than one quarter. Fourth, we're just beginning to realize the benefit of lower funding costs as we refinance the debt post crisis. This provides us with a tailwind across the businesses. We maintained our focus on expense management discipline and showed strong progress in the first quarter, delivering an overall expense ratio of 72%, excluding DVA. This level reflects an Institutional Securities compensation ratio of 38% and that ratio is consistent with our stated target of being at or below 39%. Finally, with respect to steadily increasing capital returns to shareholders, we were pleased to receive a non-objection from the Federal Reserve on our 2015 capital plan to increase our dividend to $0.15 per quarter and a repurchase up to $3.1 billion of common stock for the five quarters beginning in the second quarter of this year. We hope to maintain this trend of increasing dividends and share repurchases in future cycles, subject of course to regulatory approval. In aggregate, we continue to execute against the benchmarks previously established and will remain focused on them for the duration of 2015. Before closing I would like to note several organization changes we recently made. These changes, where we moved executives across the firm, reflect our strong desire to build a very deep bench of senior management for the years ahead. And finally, I would like to thank our CFO Ruth Porat for her partnership, friendship and commitment to Morgan Stanley and to me personally. She has been an extraordinarily highly valued part of my team for the five years and a tremendous asset to this firm since her arrival. We indeed have been lucky to have her. We are delighted to appoint as CFO, Jon Pruzan, a 20 year veteran of our investment banking division at the end of this month, and I wish John luck in this new role. I will now turn the call over to Ruth to discuss the quarter in detail. Ruth Porat : Thank you, James, and good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures. Results for the first-quarter include a net discrete tax benefit of $564 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, primarily associated with the repatriation of non-US earnings at a lower cost than originally estimated. In addition, the impact of DVA in the quarter was a positive $125 million, with $100 million in fixed income sales and trading and $25 million in equity sales and trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues were $9.8 billion, up 30% versus the fourth quarter. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders, excluding DVA, were $2.2 billion. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share, excluding DVA, were $1.14 after preferred dividends. On a GAAP basis, including the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues for the quarter were $9.9 billion. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $2.3 billion. Reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $1.18 after preferred dividends. Reported return on equity from continuing operations was 14.2% in the first quarter, excluding both DVA and the net discrete tax benefit, our ROE for the quarter was 10.1%. Book value at the end of the quarter was $33.80 per share and tangible book value was $28.91 per share. Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $829 billion at March 31, up from $802 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Deposits as of quarter end were $136 billion, up $2 billion versus Q4. Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $195 billion, compared with $193 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Turning to capital. Although our calculations are not final, our common equity tier 1 transitional ratio will be approximately 13.1% and our tier 1 capital ratio under this regime will be approximately 14.7%. Basel III transitional risk weighted assets are expected to be approximately $440 billion at March 31. Reflecting our best estimate of the final Federal Reserve rules, our pro forma common equity tier 1 ratio using the Basel III, fully phased-in advanced approach was 11.6% at March 31, up from 10.7% in the fourth quarter. Our pro forma standardized ratio was 11.6%, up from 10.9% in the fourth quarter. Pro forma, fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $449 billion. Pro forma, fully phased-in Basel III standardized RWAs are expected to be approximately $446 billion. We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio under the US final rule to be approximately 5.1% at March 31, up from 4.7% at the end of 4Q. All of these estimates are preliminary and are subject to revision. Turning to expenses. Our total expenses this quarter were $7.1 billion, down 34% versus the fourth quarter. Compensation expense was $4.5 billion in the quarter, down 11%, driven primarily by the change in compensation structure discussed in the fourth quarter, partly offset by increased compensation related to higher revenue. Non-compensation expense was $2.5 billion for the quarter, down 55% quarter over quarter driven by decreased legal expense as well as continued expense discipline. Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In Institutional Securities, revenues excluding DVA were $5.3 billion, up 45% sequentially after excluding the implementation charge for FDA in 4Q. Non-interest expense was $3.6 billion, down 49% versus the fourth quarter due to legal expenses and the compensation expense adjustment occurred in the prior quarter. Compensation expense was $2 billion for the first quarter, down 17% versus the fourth quarter reflecting the impact of the change in compensation structure I just noted. Excluding DVA, the compensation ratio was 38%, down quarter over quarter and down approximately 300 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the change in compensation structure and operating leverage in the business. Non-compensation expense was $1.6 billion, down 65% versus the fourth quarter, driven by significantly lower legal expense in the quarter. Including the impact of DVA, revenues were $5.5 billion. In investment banking, revenues of $1.2 billion were down - last quarter. According to Thomson-Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked at number one in global IPOs and number three in global equity and global announced M&A at the end of the first quarter. Notable transactions included, in advisory Morgan Stanley acted as sole financial advisor to AbbVie in its acquisition of Pharmacyclics for an aggregate value of $20 billion. AbbVie obtained financing for Morgan Stanley and MUFG. In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley as joint global coordinator, lead left book runner and stabilization agents, priced a $3.7 billion follow-on offering for Citizens Financial Group. This was the largest financial institutions follow-on offering since 2012. In debt underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as active book runner for Coca-Cola in its EUR8.5 billion senior unsecured notes, offering the largest euro transaction for a US issuer on record and the second largest euro transaction of all time. Advisory revenues of $471 million decreased 3% versus our fourth-quarter results, driven by lower revenues in EMEA and Asia. Underwriting revenues of $702 million decreased 13% versus our fourth quarter results, driven by equity underwriting revenues of $307 million, down 11% versus 4Q reflecting fewer IPOs and lower revenues from EMEA and Asia. Fixed income underwriting revenues of $395 million, down 15% versus the fourth quarter, primarily due to decreases in non-investment grade loans and high-yield bonds that more than offset increases in investment grade activity. Equity sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, were $2.3 billion, up 40% compared to last quarter. Results reflected broad-based gains across products and regions. Cash equities saw increased volume and share gain. Derivatives revenues were higher across regions. Prime brokerage revenues increased, driven by an uptick in balances and client activity. Fixed income and commodities sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, were $1.9 billion, up significantly versus the fourth quarter. Commodities results were up meaningfully versus the fourth quarter, benefiting from structured transactions, improved client flow and extreme weather. Fixed Income revenues increased quarter over quarter driven by increased contribution across regions, with particular strength in macro products and EMEA. Average trading VaR for the first quarter was $47 million, flat to the fourth quarter. Turning to wealth management. Revenues were $3.8 billion in the first quarter, up 1% sequentially. Asset management revenues of $2.1 billion were relatively flat with the last quarter. Transaction revenues were down 3% compared to last quarter consisting primarily of commissions of $526 million, down 8% to the prior quarter driven in part by fewer trading days as well as activity levels. Investment banking related fees of $192 million, up 11% versus last quarter primarily reflecting a revenue-sharing arrangement with Institutional Securities related to municipal securities. And trading revenues of $232 million, a slight uptick versus the fourth quarter. Net interest revenue increased 10% to $689 million, driven primarily by investment portfolio returns as well as continued growth in lending products. Non-interest expense was $3 billion, down 3% versus last quarter. Non-compensation expense was $754 million, down 3% from last quarter. Compensation expense was $2.2 billion, down 3% versus the fourth quarter, in part due to the change in compensation structure last quarter as well as a revenue mix change, with growth in non-compensable revenues this quarter. The compensation ratio was 58%, down versus the fourth quarter. The TBT margin was 22%, profit before tax was $855 million. Total client assets were $2 trillion. Global fee-based asset inflows were $13.3 billion, fee-based assets under management increased to $803 billion at quarter end, representing 39% of client assets. Global representatives were 15,915, down 1% to the fourth quarter. Deposits in our bank deposit program were $135 billion, down $3 billion versus the fourth quarter. Approximately $130 billion were held in Morgan Stanley banks. Wealth management lending balances continued to grow, reflecting the ongoing execution of our bank strategy. Investment management revenues of $669 million were up 14% sequentially. In traditional asset management, revenues of $439 million were up 2% versus the fourth quarter. In Merchant Banking and real estate investing, revenues of $230 million were up compared with the fourth quarter driven by higher investment gain. Non-interest expenses were $482 million, down 19% from the fourth quarter due to the change in compensation structure discussed last quarter. Compensation expense was $273 million in the quarter reflecting a compensation ratio of 41%. Non-compensation expense was $209 million, down 2% from the fourth quarter. Profit before tax was $187 million in the first quarter. NCI was $17 million versus $12 million last quarter. Total assets under management increased to $406 billion driven by market appreciation. Turning now to our outlook. In the first quarter the firm benefited from growing investor and corporate interest in global opportunities, with higher activity levels in the US complemented by a meaningful pickup in activity in Europe and Asia. In investment banking, the M&A backlog is higher than a year ago, supported by the trends we have discussed previously; robust cross-border activity, activism and larger transactions across industries. The underwriting pipeline similarly remains healthy, increasingly driven by acquisition activity. In sales and trading, we continue to benefit from the breadth of our strong, global franchise with renewed client interest in European and Asian markets, reflecting the varying stages of global recovery and the impact of central bank actions across product. The obvious factors that affect these results going forward are global events and the nature of volatility. Our Wealth Management clients remain well engaged with their financial advisors. The key catalyst for higher activity is the level of US new issue activity, with the pipeline up versus Q1. Q1 levels also reflected client caution in anticipation of Federal Reserve rate moves which should play out throughout the year. We are pleased to have achieved this starting point of our 22% to 25% margin target in a lower transaction environment, underscoring the great operating leverage in this business. The outlook for our bank remains strong given the lending pipeline in our wealth management and institutional securities businesses. This enables us to continue to benefit from earnings upside, even without the benefit of rising rates. Our goal with the roadmap we introduced several years ago was to address your many questions and be transparent through metrics and goalposts, so that our progress could be measured. We had early confidence that the transformation of Morgan Stanley's business and balance sheet would deliver returns to all of our stakeholders, and I am proud that the levers we articulated are increasingly evident. Beyond the business outlook we expect to benefit from lower funding costs and the impact of capital returns to shareholders. Although the path to a sustainable acceptable ROE is not a straight line from here, I am confident that the road is a clear one. I will miss working with you and I'm grateful for the strong support and for the analysts on the call for your very constructive guidance and analysis. Thank you. It was a privilege to be in this role at this moment in Morgan Stanley's history. I thank my partner and boss, James Gorman, for the opportunity, but far more important for what our great team has accomplished. We will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Guy Moszkowski : Good morning, Ruth and James. Ruth Porat : Good morning. James Gorman : Morning. Guy Moszkowski : First question I guess, is if you could give us a little bit more color on fixed income and commodities. Given that it seems like you've had a pretty high hurdle to deal with commodities not only having done well in the first quarter of last year, but also you having sold TransMontaigne. Can you give us a little bit more color on how you managed to see revenue there actually up year-on-year? Ruth Porat : Certainly. We had strong contribution from around the globe. Strength in EMEA across products with meaningfully higher client volumes. The bigger driver was strength in macro rates and FX were up nicely year over year; and, importantly, that's not withstanding a meaningfully lower balance sheet, and RWAs and fixed income were also lower; they were actually at $174 billion. So through our target, we're keeping our target at $108 billion; but this really goes to what we've talked about over many quarters. Our focus is on centralized resource management, so nice performance there. Credit was up from a weak fourth quarter, although not at last year's levels. And then as you noted in commodities, Q1 is seasonally strong. And even with the sale of TMG, TransMontaigne, in last year's results we were up. And the performance was across the board. It was physical client flows, structured transactions for clients. So we saw strength across the board there. Guy Moszkowski : Are you still looking to sell those storage and other physical businesses? Ruth Porat : Well, as you've heard us say many times, we're committed to selling oil merchanting; and we'll let you know when we have something to say. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. Great. And maybe a little bit of color on the reduction in the RWA in thick in the quarter. Can you give us a sense for how much of that was from runoff of some of the legacy positions that you've talked about in the past that don't generate revenue? Ruth Porat : So included both active and passive mitigation. There was some benefit from market move as well. It was really all three. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. That's helpful. And then final question on moves in the capital account. There's a lot of moving parts it seems like this quarter. We know that overall capital was kind of flat. But we can see in the average allocations that you provide that you moved or retained more capital in the institutional securities business. And I was wondering if you could give us a little sense for, given the RWA movement, what's going on there? Ruth Porat : So, you actually answered in your question. There were some ins and outs. But obviously given it is an average calculation, there are timing implications that flow through. And you can see, therefore, more capital moved up to ISG. Guy Moszkowski : So we shouldn't necessarily expect that to remain in ISG as we move through the quarters of the year or is there something to do with continued regulatory changes that would drive those capital levels a little bit higher? Ruth Porat : Well, over time it will. I mean, the required capital calculation is based on the capital regime in place today at any point time. So that does continue to be on a transitional basis. Over time, you'll see a reduction in some of the phased introductions. So it will change over time, and more of that parent capital would be allocated across the businesses, but more of it going to ISG over time. But of course, that's a couple year period on the phase in. Guy Moszkowski : Got it. Okay. Thanks very much for taking the questions and obviously for your service and your tremendous clarity of vision and explanation of everything over the last several years. We've appreciated working with you. Ruth Porat : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi. First question for James. You have a 10% ROE target. You certainly achieved that in the first quarter. What is your target time frame to achieve the 10% ROE for the year? James Gorman : Well, Mike, first of all, appreciate you noting the first quarter. We have, as you know, resisted giving you a formal time frame because obviously, the ROE is an output and it's a function of returns, both revenue and expenses, as well as it is of capital accretive over time and what our capital plans are. So we have resisted trying to put a formal date on it. I can assure you everybody in this building would want it sooner rather than later. And the fact that we achieved it in a good environment but not an extraordinary environment in the first quarter and before many of the tailwinds that we have behind us are fully baked in, was very comforting. We're not going to give you a formal date on this. We are intent on achieving a 10% ROE year over year and beyond that in the outgoing years. So we're off to a good start here in 2015, and let's hope we keep it up. Mike Mayo : What is the 10.1% on a tangible basis? James Gorman : It's 11.9, is that right Ruth? Ruth Porat : Yes it is. Various numbers are we reported 14.2% translates to 16.6% on tangible. And so adjusting up for DVA and discrete tax benefits, equivalent ROTE rate of 11.9%. Mike Mayo : And then a separate question. Your VaR stayed flatten from the fourth quarter when your VaR peers actually went up. What's your thought process there, did you leave money on the table, is that a lower risk profile? What's going on? Ruth Porat : So, VaR is heavily weighted to changes in current market volatility. And as you know our VaR was flat, but what we're focused on is our VaR was flat on performance. We were very active with clients. We were able to achieve VaR efficiency. We reduced balance sheet in certain areas that were less constructive. We reallocated by client activity. We have capacity to take VaR up. But you can see in the results, we had strong performance with flat VaR. James Gorman : I think the key to this is we did not dial up risk to generate these earnings. Whether we left money on the table if things had turned out differently, some people might have said we left losses on the table. In this situation, we didn't dial up the risk. We delivered the earnings. But obviously we have a very successful trading business in parts of this firm. And they will react to the market volatility as I said. Mike Mayo : And then lastly, Ruth, you're yet one more banking executive to lead the industry. Any last comment about the regulation in the banking industry? Ruth Porat : Well, I think that fundamental regulatory change was needed with the backdrop of 2008, and it was implemented. And I think there's been meaningful improvement in the stability and resiliency of the industry as a result with all that's been done. The higher capital levels, liquidity stress testing, recovery plans, resolution plans, governance -- all the changes in business activity. I think if I look back over the last five years, some made those changes kicking and screaming. I think we were of the view that it was clear where it was going and it was needed and are proud of the changes we've made. I think at this point given how much has been accomplished, it is time to pause, digest and assess. It will be good to have a timeout and see the impact on markets and see where there was an undershoot and an overshoot. And hopefully that's what we see going forward. I think the main point is the industry is substantially more resilient, and that's a big accomplishment. It's a lot of work to get here for all of us. It may mean lower returns but it means a more resilient industry; and that's a positive place to be. Mike Mayo : Thank you. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. Ruth, you mentioned in your commentary on SIC about structure transactions being a contributor. I'm curious if that is only in commodities or if that was in other parts of the business and how big of a driver. And more importantly is that a sustainable appetite by clients, because we've all been waiting for that for a while. Ruth Porat : I'm glad you asked that. It was a comment specific to commodities. In commodities, it was a combination of structured activity, the physical and trading activity. The majority of client facing flow in structured business, it was in the backdrop of what's gone on in the oil markets, it was good to see the volume of structured transactions. But as I said, I'm not going to do a forecast on. Glenn Schorr : Okay. And does that mean \u2013 I don't want to put words in your mouth, but was the commodities contribution of the quarter larger than normal times just because of some of the things you mentioned plus the weather? Ruth Porat : Well, commodities as you know well, is stronger in the first quarter. And so it was up some versus last quarter. But the bigger driver was the strength in macro with rates and foreign exchange up nicely year over year. Glenn Schorr : Okay, cool. And then RWA down 4% for the firm sequentially, I think you said 6% in SIC. It's good; it's welcome. Is that not a number that we want to straightline, right? Ruth Porat : I'm sorry, the number\u2026 Glenn Schorr : Can it fall at that pace on an annualized basis? Ruth Porat : So, two parts to that question. At 6% sync [ph] I noted that it's down to $174 billion; and we're retaining the target at $180 billion. We're very focused on RWA efficiency, and we've indicated there's another $25 billion that runs off post 2015. And we're going to be very clinical and flexible in the way we allocate that capital across the franchise in a way that optimizes returns. But to your question, would we want you to straight line from there, I think I've answered that. Glenn Schorr : Cool. Last one, easy one, share count was flat year on year, but you got a higher authorization. That's just math, right? We can count on maybe 2% shrinkage this year in the share count? Ruth Porat : Yes, the main thing is we got a higher authorization and that we start executing on the share repurchase as we come out of the second quarter. And we expect to execute that radically over the time period. Glenn Schorr : Thanks for everything, Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Couple of quick ones here. Cap Markets, the equity strength. How much of that, I know you highlighted across regions, and you gave some great color, Ruth, on some of the various components. How much of a tailwind was Europe this quarter, just given some of the strength and on the back of QE there? Ruth Porat : Well as we've talked about on many quarters, we run the business with a nine box strategy product across the top cash derivatives in PB and then regions, Americas, EMEA and Asia. In the first quarter, every box was strong. The big theme, as I said, was increased investor interest outside of the US, and particularly US investors in the rest of the world. We clearly saw a pick up in client engagement in the EU on the back of the CB actions, but we also saw cash share gains in Asia with a pickup in client activity on the Asia growth opportunity and relative value there. We had nice frets to the business. The key question is the ongoing macro backdrop, as I said, and the nature of volatility. This quarter was characterized by LV trending volatility and a lot worked well. It was the best quarter in a long time. Looking forward, we'd anchor the outlook to what we've see over the last few years. But there were a lot of good things going on around the globe. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that color. And then thinking about Wealth Management here, can you give maybe a little color? It's early, but on any potential impact from the Department of Labor proposal? Ruth Porat : So, respect to the DOL proposal, it's still in the comment period' there are a number of open items to address. Based on our best interpretation of the proposal at this point, we don't expect a meaningful impact on our business. We do expect some changes in activity, and we do expect more compliance-related costs. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And then I know the loan growth environment is sort of tough. But sequential loan growth slowed somewhat, and it looked like PLA slowed more than mortgage. Was there anything driving that, and should we ratchet down expectations for loan growth? Or was that more sort of like a single quarter type of a slowdown there? Ruth Porat : Yes. Loan growth is still very much on plan, consistent with what James went through on the fourth quarter. We talked a lot about prudent loan grow. There is some seasonality with PLA in mortgages in the first quarter. But we have a healthy and diversified pipeline and expect it to continue to deliver steady prudent loan growth. The main point to talk about is two sizable franchises with diversified assets. We have ample opportunities for loan growth. Brennan Hawken : Terrific. Last one from me. Any chance to quantify the legal charge in both overall firm and in the securities business? Ruth Porat : No, we commented that non-comp expense was up a bit here due in part to legal; but we're not breaking it out. Brennan Hawken : Okay. James Gorman : The main takeaway on that is that the big legal stuff relating to the crisis we feel is behind us. We are dealing with some of the one-off smaller events as we move forward here. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for that, James. Congrats to you, Ruth. Best of luck on your switch over to the left coast there. Ruth Porat : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier : Ruth, one more on equities. And not really focused on the quarter but if I look over the last four or six quarters, it seems like the traction of the progress has just been continuous. And it's been pretty consistent across products, across geographies. I just want to get a sense, when you look at what's going on in the equity business and when you look at some of the pressures on the business and on the regulatory environment with clients, are you seeing more market share in areas where you guys are differentiating versus the customers or versus competitors? And is there any nuance between the high touch, the low touch or anything else? It just seems like the consistency in the traction has been very consistent across the past two years. Ruth Porat : So we are of the view, and I've talked about this on prior calls, of the view that we're benefiting from a lot of investments in the business over many years. So it's back to early technology investments in the business that enable us to execute on behalf of clients in all market environments and do so on a cost efficient basis, where we're driving returns for stakeholders as well. It goes to the quality and content of the team, so that it very much is high tech, high touch and the breadth of the franchise. Talk about the nine box strategy because it's so core to way the team runs it, and with this maniacal focus within each box. But then as we talked about over many years now, a focus on what are the adjacencies, so that has we go deeper with clients in certain areas they go deeper with us. It is a very tightly run business, but its delivering results. James Gorman : I'd just add to that, Mike, that remember coming out of the financial crisis our prime brokerage business clearly took a hit. And that is being rebuilt. I think over time, essentially gained share. The strength of that business has been a real additive. And secondly, these businesses do well in a large part because of the quality of the leadership team running them. And we've had a very stable and strong, deep leadership team running now [ph] these business for several years, and I think that makes a difference. Michael Carrier : Okay. That's helpful. You have set out the ROE target, and you hit around that area this quarter. And, James, it sounds like when you talked about dialing up the risk, it wasn't one of those quarters where everything worked. There was obviously good progress, but it could've been better. I just want to get a sense of when you guys look at some of the things that can improve in terms of the Wealth Management pretax margin, things that you have control of, it still seems a little surprising when I think about a 10% ROE and then I look at your business. 20% is fixed income, and then 80% is equities, banking and wealth management and investment management. Things that we generally think of a higher ROE. When I think about going over the next couple quarters, years, besides the things that you have control of, are there other things on the capital side or the balance sheet side that will continue to boost that ROE? I know the ROTE is higher; it's around 12% versus the 10%. I just wanted to get your sense on what will be the drivers to improve that, besides the margin in the wealth management business. James Gorman : Well, let me take a cut at that, and I'm sure Ruth will add on. Firstly, I think a lot of folks really haven't given much attention to the E part of this equation. When we started as a team five years ago, our E was around $40 billion; it's now around $68 billion, I think. So if we were still operating with the same equity we had five years ago, our ROE would actually be in the order of magnitude of 15%, our ROET well above that. So we've been through a major repositioning of this firm in the regulatory environment. The key has been to put ourselves in a position where we had enough capital, where we wouldn't be going, needing to go out and raise capital, accrete excess capital and so on. And ultimately, the test of that would be successful CCAR capital distributions. We've now had three years where we've lifted our dividend from $0.20 to $0.40, now $0.60 a year. Lifted our buyback from 500 to 1 billion to now 2.5 billion, and we expect to increase capital actions in the years ahead. The E part of this equation, I think, deserves a little bit of attention. On the R side, two things are going on. One, we have a very, very focused non-comp expense program we've had in process for a few years, which has a huge team here, led by Charlie Chasen here. They are very focused on that. We're not going to let go or let hold of the non-comp side. And on the comps side, it's pretty clear. We said the ISG comp to revenue ratio would be below 40%, and indeed it was. And we're bringing down the comp to revenue ratio for the other businesses as we build scale. Then you look at where the opportunities are, and they are many, frankly. We're not yet in a global economy which is by any means robust. The Wealth Management full transition to the managed product hasn't yet occurred. The bank loan products, we've still got tremendous capacity there. We haven't seen the interest rate hike, which we're going to get at some point in the future. The M&A and ECM businesses clearly will pick up as the global economies pickup, and I could go on with a long list. I'm giving a long answer because it's a complicated, multifaceted thing. But I would look at all of those, starting with the move to non-comp, the comp to revenue commitments, capital plans and then follow with the particular revenue drivers in each of the businesses that exist today and are likely to exist in the changing, high rate environment going forward. Michael Carrier : Okay. Makes sense. Thanks a lot. James Gorman : Sure. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Christian Bolu : Good morning, James. Good morning, Ruth. James Gorman : Morning. Christian Bolu : James, on the regulatory environment, the SEC seems to be focused on the potential abuse of fee-based accounts, so-called reverse churning. Given Morgan Stanley's fee-based accounts have more than doubled since 2009, I'd be curious as to what kind of controls or checks you have in place to ensure the proper use of fee-based accounts at Morgan Stanley James Gorman : Well, this is one of those questions which, depending on the environment, you could ask it one way or the other. A lot of people spend their time complaining about the churning on transaction type accounts, which is why the fee-based industry has really evolved. Where clients, certain clients, have wanted the certainty of knowing they pay one fee, and with that they either do none or as much transaction activity as they want to do. So it seems to me it would be a very natural market segmentation. There will be some clients for example, people with large restricted stock positions, which that would probably not be something they want to do. But from many others who want a more advice driven relationship, it obviously is. Whether its transaction activity or fee-based activity, we have an enormous compliance operation in our wealth management division, driven down to the branch level. Both at the personal touch level and also at the model-driven level, where we look for exceptions, which looks at suitability, concentration risk and all the other things that you would expect to make sure that the clients are properly served at the pricing that they're getting. Christian Bolu : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. A question on the tax strategy. I think tax benefit seems to be recurrent theme quarter after quarter. At a very high level, could you explain the firm's tax strategy and how we should conceptually think about any tax benefits going forward. Ruth Porat : Well, this quarter was the result of a legal entity simplification consistent with resolution. We would still guide you to around 30% as the effective tax rate on a go-forward basis. Christian Bolu : Okay, there's no wide tax strategy or anything in that nature we should think about? Ruth Porat : No. As I said, this was legal entity simplification; and I guide you at 30%. Christian Bolu : Okay. A couple of cleanup questions. On the M&A backlog, I believe you said it was up year over year. How does a look on a link quarter basis? Ruth Porat : It is up year-over-year and that is the way we've been looking at it. Christian Bolu : Okay. And then on the funding cost benefits, how should we think about the allocation between FIC and equities? Ruth Porat : So, as we've talked about a number of calls, we allocate funding, balance sheet, liquidity based down to the product level. And it's really based on the asset mix, and so that's the real driver of it. We haven't broken that out, but it's going to benefit across sales and trading. And it's a nice tailwind that is increasingly building through 2016 year. Christian Bolu : Okay. Thank you. And just lastly, like the sentiments of my peers, it's been a pleasure working with you, Ruth. You're definitely going to be missed. Ruth Porat : Thank you very much. Christian Bolu : Thank you. James Gorman : I feel like all of you are going to start selling tick stocks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Steven Chubak : Certainly pleased to see the ISG comp leverage really show through in the quarter in light of the revenue strength. I was just wondering how we should think about the comp leverage versus the full-year target of 39%, assuming you can actually deliver revenue growth for the full year? Ruth Porat : So when we set the comp ratio, it's with a full-year outlook. So the 38% is the full-year outlook. Again, that's all things equal. That's the way it's set. We remain very committed to rewarding those who drive returns. And we think with the steps we've taken on comp structure and the operating leverage in the business, this is a full-year outlook -- again, all things equal. Steven Chubak : Okay. And then maybe switching over to the capital side for a moment. We're certainly pleased to see the significant build in the leverage ratio in the quarter. When parsing the individual components of that ratio, it looks like the improvement was really driven by a reduction in SLR add-ons more so than anything else. And I was just wondering if you could speak to what the current level is of those SLR add-ons, and maybe how we should be thinking about sources of future mitigation potential. Ruth Porat : Well from the benefit this quarter was really both numerator and denominator. You're absolutely right; in the denominator, we have work streams against all the various gross ups, and we had reductions in net long CDS sold. And we're benefiting from compression activity, which I would say industry wide has become more business as usual, which we think is a real positive. We were early on that, and it's good to see it has been broadly embraced. The numerator clearly benefited from earnings in our preferred issuance early in the quarter. So we remain focused on all of the items that are possible and logical for mitigation. Compression, as I said, but across the board, remain focused on ensuring that if we're using balance sheet, where we're using balance sheet. It continues to provide the kind of returns commensurate with the capital that's being required here. And so it's, again, a deep focus; but it's both a numerator and a denominator benefit. Steven Chubak : Okay. Thanks, Ruth. And then just lastly on the Wealth Management side and specifically the new long-term deposit target of $200 billion, which Greg spoke to at a recent investor conference. In the past you've highlighted some metrics where maybe your under penetrated relative to peers to help drive future growth. And was hoping, in the context of this specific target, whether you could highlight any specific metrics which would support that additional growth towards that $200 billion. Ruth Porat : Well, we've talked about, I say it so often, I'm sure you're tired of hearing it, but we're focused on prudent loan growth across both wealth management and institutional securities. We do believe we have meaningful upside from here, given the scale of the client base and the relative penetration, in particular in wealth management. We've talked about that. The $200 billion deposit target is really married to our expected loan demand over the next several years. And so the execution plan on deposit growth, as we looked at what is the loan potential given these two large franchises, the expectation for deposit growth was two phases. The contractual on boarding from city, and as I think you know, that ends this quarter, the second quarter of 2015, but we are in an excess deposit position. Our loan to deposit ratio is at 51%. And even if we load in standby liquidity to support loans, the ratio is at 74%. So we do have a nice runway before we need additional deposits to support loan growth. And then as we've talked about on the fourth-quarter call and as Greg commented on, we have substantial organic deposit growth opportunity given our client base. We still have a large portion of cash held away. But it's really calculated with a lens to what is the loan growth opportunity across Wealth Management and institutional securities. And we see quite of bit of opportunity from here against which we will execute over time, prudently, leading with credit risk management. Steven Chubak : Okay. Thanks, Ruth. That's really helpful. And congrats on the new role and best of luck at future opportunity. Ruth Porat : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matthew O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Ruth Porat : Good morning. Matthew O'Connor: You had mentioned earlier about long-term debt cost coming down and I think implied you're still early on in that process. Maybe if you could just size how much benefit you've had so far from that and try and shape how much opportunity is still in front of us. Ruth Porat : Well, as we indicated from peak financing costs to end of 2016, it's down about 25%. And the benefit comes in as we refinance debt that was issued post crisis, given our credit spreads are meaningfully tighter. And so as we see more of that we refinance, the greater the benefits. That's why it lags in over time. Matthew O'Connor: And do you have what the blended rate of your long-term debt is, the $155 billion? Ruth Porat : I don't have that with me. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. Ruth Porat : It's in the filings, I don't have it with me. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. But just I mean, conceptually, are we halfway through - your spreads have been coming in quite a bit, market rates have been coming down, even just the past year here so. I think there's still additional opportunity to bring those rates down. Ruth Porat : There is a decent opportunity. Some of the debt that we refinanced was put on pre-crisis, and so we've only recently begun to tap into that portion of it that was put on post crisis. At a certain point, it was actually more of a headwind. It's been turning recently to become a tailwind, and that's why we called it out when we did. We delayed to call it out and at the point at which we were starting, not to refinance the early 2000 debt, but what was put on post crisis. That's why it's a delayed benefit here. Delayed posts are the contraction we've seen in our credit spreads. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. That makes sense. All right, thank you. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. James Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Just maybe a follow-up on the capital question. You are substantially above on your common equity tier 1 ratio; but on the SLR, you're just slightly above the minimum. How do you think about the interplay of the leverage versus the common equity, to a point where you can start to return even more of the common equity to maximize returns? Is there a lot more to go on the denominator in the leverage ratio, or does it mean potentially more preferred to maximize shareholder returns? How do you think about that dynamic over time, and what kind of a cushion do you think you need on the SLR? Ruth Porat : So, I've already answered part of it in response to an earlier question which is, we've talked frequently about the way to maximize return and capital over the longer term is to have steady increases. No discontinuous moves in the request for return of capital. And we're very pleased to have the ability this year, at the $3.1 billion share repurchase over the five quarter period and the dividends up 50%. So when we look at the requirement, there are clearly a number of them. Interest rate capital, it's SLR, it's the CCAR process itself, it's how you think about the stress losses. SLR obviously was not in CCAR in the last round. But we have a forward-looking lens as we think about the business, where we consider all of those factors. And as we looked to optimize the opportunity across the franchise, both from a returns perspective and the ability to return capital, we look through each one of those lenses. At this point though, as I said, SLR hasn't been included in the CCAR that would govern how much we can return. But that obviously hasn't stopped us implementing strong work streams to mitigate the gross up in the denominator, as we've already talked about on this call. We look at all. You have to look at all; you can't just tip to one versus the other. Again, it's with a lens that we want to ensure we're providing balance sheet capital behind client activity and doing it in the most constructive way. But it's complicated. There's no question with the multiplicity of requirements. But that's what we've been managing against. James Mitchell : So hear but on the CCAR, your constraining factors were more of the tier 1 ratio's, right, the leverage the total capital? So I'm just trying to get a sense. Do you think there's a lot more to do on the denominator side or do you think it would make more sense to issue more preferred to deal with that? Or do you think you have enough time to make more efficiencies on the balance sheet side? That's what I'm just trying to get at Ruth Porat : Okay, sorry. On that, part of it is the CCAR process itself. We were pleased this year that on one input to the overall calculation, PP&R, the estimate by the Federal Reserve increased. We believe that reflects the greater consistency we have in earnings. We put a lot of effort behind trying to clarify that, and we're pleased that it picked up. And when you look at what were some of the things that took the total capital calculation lower, the leverage lower, there was a difference between estimates firm and Federal Reserve on balance sheet growth or RWAs over the period. And our view is that the test is a learning process, even though there's not that much transparency in it and that it's really about addressing some of those elements of it. So that's one component, trying to narrow the gap between the Federal Reserve's estimate and the firm's estimate on things like balance sheet growth. You know, is the fair value firm and we don't see that kind of balance sheet growth. And then on the second part of it, of course ensuring we are being very clinical and direct on balance sheet use in other elements of it. We look at all preferred and sub debt as ways to optimize capital over time, and we'll continue to do so. We've been doing that for the last couple of years. James Gorman : Just think about where we've come from. The SLR, we're at about 4.2%; a year ago, we were at 5.1%. With some of the actions we took, we intentionally depleted our capital in the last several months, including the charge relating to the Attorney General action, Department of Justice, and the charge related to our deferrals. The good news is we're above 5% now. We have several years to stave up 5%. We have several years to work the balance sheet and, as necessary, use preferred securities. So we have a long runway to keep this in motion, and we're pretty confident we can stay above 5% and do the things that Ruth talked about. James Mitchell : Absolutely. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Devin Ryan : Just a couple quick follow ups here. So on the bank and strong loan demand, is it reasonable to think that you could skew more towards loans than you presented? I think you've given roughly 60% loans as a percent of assets by 2016 end. Is that the optimal mix; or, if the demand is there, could we see that mix look more lending heavy? Ruth Porat : Just 13 weeks ago, James refreshed our outlook on the six-point plan and provided we added another year on the bank outlook to give you a sense of the asset mix. And the real point of doing that was so that you could model, when you expect a rate increase. We're giving you our outlook on asset mix, and there's no updates there on what was reviewed last quarter. Devin Ryan : Okay. All right, great. And then just coming back to the strength in EMEA in the quarter. It sounds like that was more trading heavy in the trading businesses. Were there any specific areas that really experienced improvement? Does that tone of activity still feel good, and do you see that spilling into other businesses? Ruth Porat : I've indicated it was in both equities and in fixed income in macro products. But as I noted, it was not just Europe. We saw a focus on the opportunity in Asia as well. It's an early start to the quarter here. As we typically say at this point, a couple of weeks is not a quarter. Devin Ryan : Okay. Thanks very much. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Burnell : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Ruth, I wanted to focus one more question on the debt opportunity and specifically on the legacy trust to preferreds that you have outstanding. I think your plan previously was to potentially redeem most, if not all, of those this year. I'm wondering what the timing is on that based on your CCAR results this past go around? Ruth Porat : We did include the redemption of trust in CCAR because it's expensive relative to where it stands today. The rules are complicated, but we do remain focused on eliminating the drag. That was the piece we withdrew. We did not change our requested return of capital. The $3.1 billion share repurchase and the dividend increase of 50% weren't altered. And we're pleased to attest qualitatively. Matt Burnell : Okay. And then just in terms of investment banking trends, obviously very strong quarter across the franchise in trading. To James's earlier point, you're not hitting on all cylinders, and banking within ISG was a little bit less strong. Can you give us some color as to your outlook as to the potential opportunities or strengths within EMEA and Asia, specifically within the banking business? James Gorman : I think firstly, just looking at the banking franchise, it's a terrific franchise. We actually had a strong quarter; some others had very strong quarters, all power to them. We have a good pipeline. Obviously, it's a lumpier business in any 13-week period than some of the other businesses, so you're going to expect a little more bouncing around. No concerns there. We are seeing a pickup in Europe. Asia has been slow. Japan was a little slow earlier in the year, but we're starting to see some cross-border activity there. Well-positioned strong franchises in Japan and China. So I think the outlook remains very firm. Matt Burnell : Okay. Thanks very much. Ruth Porat : Thank you. James Gorman : I think that brings this call to an end. I just wanted to take a moment to thank our dear friend Ruth, wish her well. I'm also sorry to see the analysts are now moving to the West Coast, following her. We'll have to pick up some others over here. But on a more serious note, she's been a great partner. Has sat in the office next to me for five years, and done a terrific job in helping get this firm back from the depths of the financial crisis. And it takes a great team. Ruth had a great team working with her. She followed also a terrific CFO, who helped us navigate the crisis during extraordinarily stressful period, Tom Kelleher. And she now precedes another new CFO, as I said John Pruzan, who I think will also be terrific. And throughout it all, we've had a deputy CFO that many of you have not heard on these calls, but has been in many of the meetings. Paul Wirth has been an extraordinary able and steady hand now through the last three CFOs we've had at this firm, so great team. Thank you Ruth. We wish you well. And don't forget us. We're going to leave Ruth with something to remind her of Morgan Stanley, not that she would ever forget us. But we wish her the best. Thanks, everybody, for a good call. Ruth Porat : Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation.",

My name is Shannon and I will be your conference moderator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Eaton Vance Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Cataldo, Treasurer. Mr. Cataldo, you may begin. Dan Cataldo : Thank you and welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings call and webcast. Here this morning are Tom Faust, Chairman and CEO of Eaton Vance, and Laurie Hylton, our CFO. We will first comment on the quarter and then we will take your questions. The full earnings release and charts we will refer to during the call are available on our website, eatonvance.com under the heading, Press Releases. Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainties in our business including, but not limited to those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings, including our 2014 Annual Report and Form 10-K are available on our website on request at no charge. I will now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Faust : Good morning and thank you for joining us. April 30 marked the close of our second fiscal quarter and the midpoint of our fiscal 2015. We finished the quarter with record assets under management, had one of our strongest quarters of net flows in company history and made progress advancing our NextShares, actively managed exchange traded product initiative toward market introduction. We reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.58 for the second quarter, down $0.03 from the preceding quarter and down $0.01 from the year ago quarter. Because our second fiscal quarter has three fewer days than the other fiscal quarters, we experienced a seasonal decline in revenue and earnings every second quarter. Relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we estimate that the day count effect lowered earnings by about $0.025 per diluted share, accounting for most of the sequential earnings decline. Also contributing to sequentially lower earnings was a decline of about $0.01 per diluted share in net income and gains on our seed capital portfolio. On a year-over-year comparative basis, the penny drop in adjusted earnings per diluted share was more than accounted for by lower performance fees received and a decline in net investment income and gains on our seed capital portfolio. Flat management fee revenues year-over-year reflect a 7% increase in average consolidated assets under management and an offsetting decline in average fee rates. As our AUM growth has been led by lower fee products. Laurie will provide more detail on the company's fee rates by product in her remarks shortly. Net flows of $6.8 billion in the second quarter are the third highest quarterly flow results in company history and represent a 9% annualized internal growth rate. As in most recent quarters, Parametric Exposure Management business led the way with $4.3 billion of second quarter net inflows. Assets in this franchise now total $62 billion, up from $32 billion at the time Parametric acquired Clifton Group at the end of 2012. Yes. This is low fee business, and yes, its growth has caused our average effective fee rate to go down, but this is good business for us. Not only is Exposure Management nicely profitable, but its growth has been built on establishing relationships of trust with many of the largest institutional investors in the United States, these institutions use Parametric as extensions of their internal staff to implement portfolio overlays to address cash drag, manage duration and currency exposures and to enhance overall portfolio efficiency. We not only foresee continued strong growth for Parametric and Exposure Management, but also view this as a gateway to broader relationships with these important institutions. Excluding Exposure Management, net flows in the second quarter were $2.4 billion. That is our best consolidated for results outside of Exposure Management since the third quarter of fiscal 2013, equating to a 4% annualized organic growth rate. Among investment categories, fixed income led the way with $2.6 billion in net inflows. Within fixed income, leading contributors to organic growth included institutional cash management, ladder municipal bonds, multi-strategy income and high-yield bonds, each of which contributed over $400 million to quarterly inflows. Within multi-strategy income, worth highlighting was the strong growth of our short duration strategic income fund, which saw net inflows of $0.5 billion in the second quarter versus net inflows of $130 million in the first quarter. Short duration strategic income is the five-star rated $2.5 billion mutual fund, whose Class A shares currently ranked in the top-5% of peer funds in the Morningstar short-term bond category for the year-to-date and over the past one, three, five and 10 years. This is one of the largest categories in the mutual fund industry with over $280 billion of net assets and annual sales of $75 billion, according to current ICI data. Given our top of class performance, small market share and differentiated profile within the category, we believe, we are poised for accelerating growth over coming quarters in this fund. The largest competing funds in the category are 5 to 10 times our current size and none of them match our track record. Also worth noting in the fixed income category is the continued development of our ladder municipal bond franchise, Eaton Vance muni laddered separate accounts had second quarter net inflows of $750 million and ended the quarter with managed assets of $4.6 billion. During the quarter, we established our first laddered muni bond mutual fund by converting an existing municipal income fund and then rolled out a second and third ladder muni fund in early May. With both, separate accounts and mutual funds now available, we have by far the broadest menu of letter muni offerings, plus unrivaled analytics and customization. We are convinced that this is going to be a huge market, potentially hundreds of billions of dollars and we are in the early lead. Our portfolio implementation category generated $1.6 billion in second-quarter net inflows. As a reminder, portfolio implementation consists of Parametric's tax managed core, centralized portfolio management and specialty index offerings. Tax managed core is the largest and fastest-growing of these businesses with $1.3 billion of second-quarter net inflows and ending assets of nearly 26 billion. In tax managed core, Parametric seeks to max the pre-tax returns of client specified benchmarks and to adding incremental return on an after-tax basis through systematic harvesting of tax losses and deferral of gains. Rapid development of Parametric's TMC business is being driven by the growing embrace of index-based strategies among financial advisors and financial offices and family offices, heightened sensitivity to investment tax effects in today's high-tax environment and expanded sales resources being devoted by us to this opportunity. With a 23-basis point average management fee, tax managed core is the highest earning product in our portfolio implementation category. Like muni ladders, we view tax managed core as an open-ended growth opportunity still in an early stage of development. In the alternatives category, we had net outflows of approximately $290 million, essentially flat versus the first quarter, but much improved from net outflows of $1.2 billion in the year ago quarter. Flow results in the current quarter were hampered by $390 million of withdrawals from global macro sub advisory mandates that we do not expect recur. Our two largest retail funds in the alternatives category, Global Macro Absolute Return and Global Macro Absolute Return Advantage, together generated positive net flows of $160 million this quarter, up from net inflows of $40 million in the first quarter of this year and net outflows of $630 million in last year second quarter, with continued demand for liquid alt strategies and our funds' competitive performance profile, we expect the positive contribution from these funds to continue. In equities, second-quarter net outflows of approximately $470 million compared to $560 million of net outflows in the first quarter and $1.35 billion of net outflows in last year's second quarter. The improvement is attributable to Eaton Vance Management equities, which remains our largest equity group. Despite net outflows over the past several years. EVM equities is led by Eddie Perkin, who has been on the job year for about a year. Under Eddie's leadership, we have seen a marked improvement in investment performance and a company flow improvements. Over the past five quarters, net outflows from EVM equities have fallen from $1.5 billion to $1.3 billion to $1.2 billion to $500 million and now $280 million in the current quarter, with Eaton Vance large-cap value Class-I, now in the top quintile of peer funds over the past year and ahead of the peer group average over the past three years, flow pressures there have abated. With several top-performing EVM equity funds now beginning to attract marketing attention, a return to positive net flows appears to be a realistic near-term goal for this group. You may have seen the press release we issued earlier this month announcing the expansion of EVM's global equity team. Christopher Dyer and Aidan Farrell will join our London office next month from Goldman Sachs Asset Management to serve as Director, Global Equity and Global Small Cap Portfolio Manager, respectively. In floating-rate income, net outflows decreased to $1 billion in the second quarter from $2.7 billion in the first quarter, driven primarily by lower retail loan fund redemptions. The fact that the loan asset class has been in net redemptions remains perplexing to us in light of what we believe is a very attractive environment for investing in floating-rate bank loans. Credit quality is strong across the landscape of loan issuers Federal Reserve is signaling its intent to begin raising short-term interest rates later this year and floating-rate loan products offer attractive yields at a time when investors continue to look for income. Since bottoming out in December, our bank loan flows have been on an improving trend. In fact, our loan flows are net positive for the month of May to-date. While the favorable momentum we are seeing in our bank loan flows could certainly reverse, we view that as unlikely given the compelling attractions of the asset class and our leading reputation as a bank loan manager. Across our franchises, our persistent theme is improving flows driven by strong investment performance. As of April 30th, we had 41 mutual funds with at least one share class with an overall Morningstar rating of four-star or five-star, including a diverse lineup of equity, fixed income, floating rate income, alternative and multi-asset strategies. Coming out of the first fiscal quarter, we said we were quite optimistic about our business prospects for the remainder of 2015. We believed improving investment performance and favorable demand trends in major areas of Eaton Vance capability would enable us to achieve faster growth. Sitting here one quarter later, much of what we had hoped for in the second quarter did happen, enabling us to report healthy organic growth for the quarter. Looking ahead to the balance of the fiscal year, there are continuing reasons for optimism across our business as we see favorable demand trends and a robust institutional pipeline. By the end of the summer, we expect to fund three new multi-sector income mandates totaling over $1 billion. At Parametric, we have pending potential mandates totaling several billion dollars in managed options, centralized portfolio management, exposure management and specially index implementation that we expect to fund in a similar timeframe. One cross current that will affect reported third-quarter flows is the loss this month of $3.4 billion Parametric emerging market equity mandate with a large sovereign wealth fund. While disappointing, we view this as a one-time event with little bearing on our other business prospects and growth opportunities. Before I turn the call over to Laurie to discuss our financials, I would like to give an update on our NextShares initiative. As a reminder, NextShares are a new type of actively managed fund designed to provide better performance for investors. As exchange traded products, NextShares have built-in cost and tax efficiencies, and unlike conventional ETFs, NextShares protect the confidentiality of fund trading information and provide buyers and sellers of shares with transparency in control of their trading costs. NextShares offer significant advantages over both, mutual funds and ETFs as vehicles for active investment strategies. Our NextShares business plan includes both, introducing a family of Eaton Vance sponsored NextShares funds and licensing the underlying intellectual property in providing related services to other fund groups to enable them to offer their own NextShares funds. Eaton Vance received SEC exemptive relief to NextShares funds in December 2014. On the regulatory front, during April, we filed amended registration statement for the 18 initial Eaton Vance NextShares funds and NASDAQ with the SEC and request to list and trade each of those 18 funds. These are two necessary and expected steps in the process of bringing are NextShares funds to market, essentially the final regulatory hurdles to be overcome. We also continue to make progress building out the consortium of fund sponsors that will offer NextShares funds. Today our Navigate Fund Solutions subsidiary has entered into preliminary license and service agreements with 10 fund sponsors, including Eaton Vance, which on a combined basis manage over $500 billion of mutual fund assets and offer approximate 200 funds currently rated four stars or five stars by Morningstar. Of these six companies have announced initiatives to offer, NextShares, American Beacon, Eaton Vance, Gabelli, Hartford, Pioneer and Victory Capital Management. We continue to engage in active discussions with other fund companies and expect to announce additional agreements over the coming weeks. In addition to working with fund companies, we are also engaged in discussions with broker-dealers, market data providers, exchange traded products service providers, market makers and our partners at NASDAQ to prepare for the launch of NextShares. As we move toward completing the build out of the initial consortium of fund sponsors offering NextShares, a growing focus is working with broker-dealers to gain their support and to ensure that they will be ready to offer NextShares fonts to their clients from time of launch. At the beginning of April, NASDAQ released to the broker-dealer community the technical specifications for trading NextShares. With this information, broker-dealers can determine the enhancements to the trading systems that will be needed to accommodate NextShares. We are now starting to hear back from broker-dealers about the scope and cost of this is the modification requirements. One broker-dealer has provided us with an estimate of $200,000 which is consistent with expectations of our in-house experts. While not inconsequential, we certainly do not believe system conversion cost will be a stumbling block for broker-dealers that are otherwise motivated to offer NextShares the biggest issue for broker-dealers is how NextShares fit within the context of their overall fund business. We are making the case to them that NextShares are not only superior products their customers, but also good for broker-dealers. Leveling the playing field between active and passive, serves the best interests of broker-dealers as well as investors and active fund sponsors. Conditional upon the timing of final regulatory approvals and market readiness, we continue to anticipate introducing an initial NextShares funds in the second half of 2015. Although the success of our NextShares initiative is far from assured we are pleased by the market acceptance of the potential investor benefits of NextShares and it is willing to embrace this is the logical evolution of the structure of actively managed funds. We look forward to reporting further progress in future communications. With that, I will turn the call over to Laurie to discuss the quarterly financial results in more detail. Laurie Hylton : Thank you and good morning. As Tom mentioned, we are reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.58 for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to $0.59 for the second quarter fiscal 2014 and $0.61 for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.58 per diluted share in the second quarter fiscal 2015, $0.59 in the second quarter fiscal 2014 and $0.24 in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. As you can see in attachment two to our press release adjustments from reported GAAP earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, primarily reflect a one-time payment made to terminate closed end fund service and additional compensation arrangements. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we made a $73 million one-time payment to terminate service and additional compensation arrangements with the major distribution partner that were in place for certain closed end funds. The arrangements required us to make quarterly payment based on the managed assets of these funds. The $73 million payment was recorded at distribution expense in the first quarter of 2015. Terminating the arrangements reduces distribution expense by roughly $.07 per diluted share annually. Excluding the effect of the one-time payment, our operating margin remained flat at 34.8% in the second quarter fiscal 2015, compared to the first quarter fiscal 2015 and declined from 35.4% in the second quarter fiscal 2014. Second quarter total revenue decreased 1%, sequentially, and year-over-year, primarily reflecting a decrease in distribution and service fee revenues. The sequential and year-over-year decrease in distribution service fees reflects the continuing shift in managed assets away from fund share classes in which distribution and service fees are paid. Investment advisory and administrative fees were flat sequentially and year-over-year, despite the increase in assets under management, reflecting a lower blended effective fee rate due primarily to changes in product mix. Also contributing to the sequential decline in effective fee rate were three fewer fee days in the second quarter. Contributing to the year-over-year fee rate decline was a reduction in performance fees received of approximately $1 million. Going forward, our overall effective management fee rates will continue to be driven primarily by the mix of business among mandates with different fee levels with swings in performance fees in the number of fee days in the quarter also contributing to short-term variability. In second quarter fiscal 2015, we realized average effective management fee rates of 64 basis points in equity, 62 basis points in alternatives, 52 basis points in floating-rate income and 43 basis points in fixed income. Portfolio implementation, which includes Parametric's tax managed core specialty index and centralized portfolio management services, had an average effective fee rate of 17 basis points in the second quarter. Parametric exposure management business had an average effective fee rate of five basis points in the quarter. So long as exposure management, portfolio implementation and other lower fee mandates continue to grow faster than the company as a whole, you can expect our overall average fee rate to continue trending downward. The key to achieving overall growth in management fee revenues in the face of declining average fee rates will be avoiding outright declines in our higher fee businesses. Given the upturn in flows, we are seeing across these businesses, we believe, we are well-positioned for resumed growth in management fee revenues. Shifting from revenue to expense, compensation expense increased 5% compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting headcount-driven increases in base compensation, employee benefits and stock based compensation, partially offset by a decreases in operating income based bonus accruals. Sequentially, however, compensation expense remained largely flat. Headcount growth, which is approximately 4% year-over-year, was 1%, sequentially. Compensation expense as a percent of revenue came in 34% for the quarter, in line with last quarter. Although, we are not in a position to specifically quantify it at this point, I would anticipate that there will be some additional compensation related pressure in the next several quarters as we continue to build our global equity team in London and add staff in support of our NextShares initiatives. Distribution related costs, including distribution and service fee expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commission, but excluding the $79 million first quarter payment to determine closed end fund arrangements, decreased 7% in the second quarter fiscal 2015 from the first quarter fiscal 2015, and 11% from the same quarter a year ago, reflecting lower closed end fund related payments and reduced intermediary and marketing support payments. Fund related expenses were up 6% year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in non-advisory expenses borne by the company on certain comingled institutional calming of funds, for which we are paid all-in management fees. Other operating expenses were up 5% in the second quarter versus the same period a year ago, and up 7% sequentially, primarily reflecting an increase in information technology and other corporate expenses. Expenses related to our next year's initiative totaled approximately $1.8 million in the second quarter fiscal 2015 compared to $1.3 million last quarter and are currently anticipated to scale up to roughly $8 million for fiscal 2015 as a whole. Net income and gains on seed capital investments had no impact on earnings in the second quarter fiscal 2015, compared to contribution of roughly a penny per share to earnings in both, the second quarter fiscal 2014 and the first quarter fiscal 2015. When quantifying the impact of our seed capital investments on earnings each quarter, we take into consideration our pro rata share to gains, losses and other investment income earned on investments and sponsored products, whether accounted for as consolidated funds, separate accounts or equity method investments as well as the gains and losses recognized on derivatives used to hedged these investments. We then report the per share impact net of non-controlling interest expense and income taxes. Changes in quarterly equity and net income of affiliates both, year-over-year and sequentially, reflect changes in net income and gains recognized on sponsored products accounted for under the equity method. Our 49% interest in Hexavest, which is reported net of tax and the amortization of intangibles in equity net income of affiliates, contributed approximately $0.02 per diluted share for all quarterly periods presented. Excluding the effect of CLO entity earnings and losses, our effective tax rate for the second quarter fiscal 2015 was 38%, 38.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 and 36.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We currently anticipate that our effective tax rate adjusted for CLO earnings and losses will be in the 38% range for fiscal 2015 as a whole. In terms of capital management, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of non-voting common stock for approximately $64 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. When combined with repurchases over the preceding three quarters, our average diluted share count for the first six months of fiscal 2015 was down 3.3% from the same period of fiscal 2014. We finished second fiscal quarter holding $382 million of cash and short-term debt securities and approximately $328 million in seed capital investment. Our outstanding debt consists of $250 million or 6.5% senior notes due in 2017 and $325 million or 3.625% senior notes due in 2023. We also have a $300 million five-year line of credit, which we entered into in October to replace our previous three-year line that was due to expire in fiscal 2015. The line is currently undrawn. Given our strong cash flow, liquidity and overall financial condition, we believe we are well positioned to continue return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This concludes our prepared comments. At this point, we would like to take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Andrew Nicholas : Hi. This is actually Andrew Nicholas filling in for Chris Shutler. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question just has to do with the $200,000 estimate for broker-dealer costs related technology specific to the next year's build out. I am curious if you can kind of walk us through whether or not there would be something that Eaton Vance would be willing to help pay for? If so does that change your $8 million next year spending estimate for fiscal 2015? Tom Faust : Yes. We have said and this was - you may have seen this and there were a couple news articles that came out last week on this topic, but we have said publicly that for broker-dealers that are at the front of the line that are early in embracing NextShares, where they have some level of what strike us as reasonable estimates of their internal costs to implement those systems that we will help pay for that. At the moment, I would say that is included in the current estimates. We have said approximate $8 million of spending this year. Clearly, we do not have a huge amount of room in that for paying lots of six-figure bills, which is where we think this will be, but for the right partner, for the right broker-dealer, we want to take this issue off the table by providing financial support that conversion. To me, this should not come as a big shock. There has been, I would say, pretty extensive involvement over the years of financial partnership and financial support between fund companies and broker-dealers. This is just one element of that that's new and different here, because there is really no precedent for up a product structure of this of this type, so just to repeat, yes, we do intend to offer selected broker-dealers who are motivated to be first movers that we will contribute to their development costs on converting their systems to accommodate trading in NextShares. It is our hope and expectation at this point that that will fit within our current budget numbers for the year, but for the right advisor, for the for the right broker-dealer firm, we would certainly be willing to make this worth their while and part of that is certainly the conversion economics. Andrew Nicholas : Great. Thank you. That is helpful. Then to switch gears a little bit, it was obviously a strong quarter for fixed income products, particularly on the institutional side. I was just wondering if you guys could add a little color there as to what strategies, particularly in institutional channel were strong. If there are any indications of those strategies continuing their strength through the rest of 2015? Thank you. Tom Faust : In the call slides, Slide #11, is listing and I think, this is in order of the leading areas of the contribution for the quarter. This is not just in fixed income, but several of these are fixed-income categories and I can comment on the ones that were in fixed income. I believe I said that, within fixed income we had at least $400 million of contribution from four areas. Those being cash management, Municipal ladders, multi-strategy income and high-yield; cash management, I believe was roughly $900 million. That was institutional business. Municipal ladders, I believe, I said a number of $750 million multi-strategy income. This is from memory. This was somewhere in the 4s, I believe, and most of that was that was in mutual funds high-yield income, again, from memory I believe also was in the 4s, also primarily for mutual fund business. The other part of question do we view those as potentially recurring, and I would say in all cases, yes, we do. The one of those that is the lumpiest would be cash management that those are the big mandates by assets. They tend to be relatively low fees, but that would be the one that is I would say that maybe speculative as to whether we have more of those coming in the next quarter. The other one is I think it is pretty likely that we have got a strong trend of current business with - it is not lumpy institutional business, but for the most part broad-based retail business. Andrew Nicholas : Thanks again. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Good morning. Tom Faust : Hi, Craig. Good morning. Craig Siegenthaler : Just to start I have a few questions here related to NextShares, so first one, can you help us frame the rest that NextShares would need delay the launch in Q1 or Q2. The reason I am asking I sounds like there is still a lot of work need to be get done in terms of getting the funds on a broker platforms, final SEC approvals and also the pluming. It just sounds like there was a lot to do over the next six months, so maybe you can help us think about that. Tom Faust : Yes. The first on the regulatory side, we do need a couple of approvals. We need approval of the registration statements on the individual funds and we also need what I'd call 19(b)(4) listing and trading approval of those. In the case of Eaton Vance funds, the filings have been made and we certainly do not control the timing of that, but we do not expect that to be a delay. NASDAQ has communicated publicly their intent to be ready to trade by October 1st so again that means third quarter is probably unlikely assuming they are going to push towards the end of that timeframe. Whether launching in the fourth quarter beyond SEC approval of our product and beyond NASDAQ's readiness, primarily hinges on two things. One of those is, our desire to launch this as part of a consortium of fund companies. At some point, we draw the line and say that the consortium is in place. If you are not going to be ready by a certain date, you are not going to be part of that particular group in terms of what we envision is some joint marketing efforts in conjunction with product launches. You are probably aware that three of the applicants, three of the other licensees, have now either received SEC exemptive relief or expected in the next couple of days they have got notice of relief in a couple of cases, we need more fund companies to apply for and receive exemptive relief. We need more fund companies to get a registration statements filed for individual funds to file 19(b)(4)s for those. There is a fair bit of work to be done there. Though that certainly could be done in time for a fourth quarter launched, can we have no 30 fund companies ready? I think, that is unlikely, but could we have, let us say, 6 to 12 fund companies ready to offer NextShares products before the end of the year, I think that is certainly possible still at this point. As you point out, there is still some a fair bit of work to be done for those other companies to get a final list of products out registration statements filed and then get the listing and trading approval, which assuming that this works the way we hope, that will be a very straightforward easy process, but again we do not control how that works. The last part is the broker-dealer part, which is the part that as I mentioned in my remarks, we are increasingly focusing on and there are really two parts of that as I think about it. One is, getting their systems up and running up and ready to accommodate this, we do not have a lot of data points and this will vary by broker-dealers, but the same firm that gave us the $200,000 systems accommodation cost estimates and also put a number of person months on that and that number as communicated to me anyway was seven, so seven person months is one person working for seven months, but more likely meaning a team of a few people working for a collective amount of person months totaling seven, so it is conceivable that can get done in two or three months at that particular broker-dealer. We would like to think that is representative of what it is for the broader market among broker-dealers. We do not know that for sure. We have got a couple of other data points, including the experience of our own staff that suggest that that is in a reasonable range, but that is not a number that's intimidating to the most broker-dealers as they think about technology projects or systems build. The bigger issue, I think, and really the thing that ultimately I think will drive this is, we need to I would say finish making the case to broker-dealers. We have been working on this, but finish making the case to broker-dealers that this is a compelling enough opportunity that relative to their other priorities in their business for not only technology projects, but other business initiatives that this is important enough to them that they want to make this a priority and that is important enough to them to want to take a lead in this. Over the next number of weeks, this is very much a focus of mine and our navigate team is, working with all these firms that we have got longstanding relationships with making the case to them that NextShares is good for their business. They all understand it is good for their clients and that this should be a priority for them. If we can make this case successfully in our firms, we can get this done and launch before the end of the year. I cannot promise that that will happen, but that certainly what we are shooting for. If that does not happen, this will happen sometime in early 2016, we would expect, but the nature of any exchange traded product like this is that it is bought and sold through a broker-dealer and we have to make sure that we have a sufficient number of broker-dealers that this is available to not just clients of one particular broker-dealer, but a broader range and we are making that case. I would say, I am optimistic that we can get there. In some cases, these are easy conversations in the sense that this would be incremental business. It is not disruptive versus things that they are doing today. In other cases, the analysis are a little more complicated where they are potentially losing one revenue stream and replacing it with other revenue streams or they are looking at the potential benefits of building their business by offering greater products versus a potential desire to not cannibalize what might be higher earning assets that they have on their books today. With our business today, our mutual fund business today at 75% or so of our of our flows being in funds that do not pay 12b-1 fees, distribution and service fees as they are called. That is not a huge issue for us. There are different companies that have a different mix. There are broker-dealers that have a different mix than that, but the vast majority of our business 12b-1 fees is not a significant issue in terms of converting from mutual funds to NextShares, but still there are other considerations beyond just 12b-1 fees. We make the case that it is not a good thing for broker-dealers to see their business convert rapidly to an overwhelming emphasis on passive products. We do not think that is the best choice for their customers and we do not think that is the best solution for them as financial advisors, so that is the case we are trying to make over the coming weeks. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks, Tom. Then final question, do you think there will be an acceleration in licensee sign-ups by July 1st just given that the early window, I think, is going to expire on July 1st and there were few reasons before really now to sign-up, but there now there is sort of a firm reason to sign-up. Tom Faust : I think that is right. We have been pretty transparent about our pricing on this and part of that pricing is that there is a 30% reduction in licensing and services free rate that would apply generally to firms that sign a preliminary agreement with us and then file an exemptive application by the end of June, so there is an incentive to do that. That 30% is about 1.5 basis points. To so some firms that may not be particularly motivating, but for many firms it is quite motivating and I think it is likely that we will see a significant of additional firms become early adopters and, because the process of filing for SEC exemptive relief is a public process, we should also see the identity of the firms that have signed with us today, but we are not yet public of that changing also over the next six weeks or so. The biggest thing for us in going from the current 10 companies that are under agreement to up 20-year or some excess of that, really I think it is getting comfort that this is something that the broker-dealers will support. I think we have come a long way in helping the broker-dealers understand that this is good for the business and something they should embrace. If we get in a position where major broker-dealers are in effect encouraging other fund companies to do this, because their publicly supporting this, I think, we are potentially in a position where we will see a quite rapid acceleration in the rate of adoption by fund companies. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks, Tom. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz of Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ryan Bailey : Hi. This is actually Ryan Bailey filling in for Bill. Our questions were also related to NextShares. We were kind of wondering without giving too much detail if you could size the licensees who have signed up, but have not been public yet. That is the first. Secondly, what are your thoughts on fixed income for the ETMF opportunity? We were wondering it seems like fixed income or the licensee so far had more than [ph], so wondering what the opportunity that is there? Tom Faust : Yes. We included in the release the number of $500 billion of mutual fund assets across the 10 companies, so that includes the six companies names which have been disclosed as well as the four that have not been so, I think you can probably do the math on figuring out what the average is and what the total is on that. Due to confidentiality agreements, we are not in a position really to try and size individual firms that have not been disclosed for obvious reasons. The way we think about NextShares generally and this is answering the part of your question related to fixed income. This is the only exchange traded structure that is fully compatible with active management and works fully for all asset classes. As I think your question acknowledges, there have been some limited uptake of fully transparent active ETFs as approved since 2008. I think currently there are about $20 billion roughly or so in that structure that compares to roundly $10 trillion in actively managed mutual funds, so it is a tiniest drop in the bucket. That is 0.2%. If you really drilled down and look inside that $20 trillion, the largest category by a significant amount is ultra short bond funds, which I think it is something like $6 billion or $7 billion out of the $20 billion. I think that is maybe an indication that we have had seen the most success there probably telling that that is not an area where at least some active managers are particularly worried about preserving their secrets sauce. This is one step or half a step away from a money market fund. In that range, we are seeing activity and some success in a fully transparent structure. A handful of other companies have been willing to be fully transparent as to their daily holdings in core fixed income, but that is still up a pretty small number of companies and it is also a relatively limited range of strategies. You are not seeing fully transparent high-yield bond funds, which I think would be similar to equities would be probably a bad idea. The way we look at this is, first, there is a benefit of having a single structure that covers all your strategies as opposed to we do this over here and we do this over there. NextShares can be that one structure in a way that a fully transparent ETF cannot. The other is, I think, it is still to be proven whether or not fund companies or even those that have announced and had initiatives in this area, whether the lack of concern about portfolio holdings disclosure really stands up at scale. As I think about it, there are three areas of concern. The one that tends to get the most focus is front running risk. The idea that if I put out my daily holdings disclosure every day then someone will be able to anticipate the pattern of my future trading and then trade ahead of me and then in their report, drive up my trading costs and reducing fund returns. The second and third are also very significant to investment managers. Those being the likelihood that if you make your holdings available on a daily basis, if you charge a fee that exceeds the cost of portfolio implementation, you are just inviting others to try and replicate your strategy at lower cost. If you are successful at scale, if you want to charge of full fee, I can guarantee there will be someone in our industry that will try and undercut you on price in your fully transparent strategy. The other one maybe which is slightly less obvious is the concern that if I am running out, let us, say a fixed income shop and I am very proud of the analysts I have and the work they do, I mean, in fact giving away the ultimate embodiment of their work which is the portfolio I own, if I make that available to all my competitors on a daily basis so. We have talk to a lot of fund companies. I have talked to a lots of fund companies CEOs personally and we do not get a lot of pushback that the model of full transparency is very limited in its application. Yes it may work for an enhanced cash product. It may work for some managers for core fixed income, but there is nobody out there that I am aware of that runs a large-scale fund business that thinks to that is an alternative to NextShares as the broad industry solution for how active managers can compete more effectively with passive by making structural changes. Ryan Bailey : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee of KBW. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Robert Lee : Great. Thank you. Good morning. Hey, maybe keeping with the NextShares theme, but this also I guess relates to capital management. I think of back in the fourth quarter when you first announced that the approval from the SEC, it came up about having to seed some of these products that potentially given I think you are going to market or plan to go to market with, I think, it is about a dozen products. Are you still thinking that seed demands at least initially could be a fairly hefty and should how should we be thinking that as we look later in the year that may or may not impact how are your thoughts around share repurchase or can you just recycle existing seed into those? Tom Faust : We filed for 18 funds. I think, we probably will not launch all 18 on the same day, but we do have the expectation that that number or something very close to that will be our initial products set. We probably we will be able to do that in such a way that some of the capital that we use for seed purposes gets recycle among those different products where the first way is get up to scale then we recycle some of the capital into following product. I do not think we have definitive answers to how big these funds will be in terms of seed capital requirements from our NASDAQ exchange requirements number right? What was it? Dan Cataldo : It was $200,000 or $2 million. Tom Faust : Yes. I think it is something like $2 million, so that is not a big number relative to our overall currency capital portfolio and I do not think ultimately it is going to be the determining number here. The determining number here is going to be what do we need to do to in a practical business sense to get these up and running. I think we are thinking about on the order of $20 million of fund that is a little bit premature, it may be different than that. We are at a point with $300 and some million seed capital portfolio. I think, it is likely that that portfolio away from NextShares we will be shrinking rather than growing over the next six months. That is certainly our intent in part, because we are looking at NextShares as a potential use of capital, but I guess we do not see this 20 times. Let us say, we did 20 times 10. Then recycled some of that capital and then also potentially pull down some of the other positions we have today. I think, we are looking at possibly, this is really just a guess at this point, but maybe $100 million to $200 million of seed capital requirement to get these funds up and running, netting some of the offsets from more over seed capital and some of the other things. It is a guess at this point. We do not really know that answer, but we certainly do not see a need to do an outside financing to make this work. We have not particularly explored this, so there are third-party sources of financing for seed capital for funds that we are aware of, so it won't necessarily all be funded off our own balance sheet. It is possible that there will be outside investors that could do this. Just as a reminder, we have roughly $380 million today in cash and short-term investments. Robert Lee : Great. Maybe a follow-up, two questions or two-part question maybe around flows, I mean, the first one is in fixed income, you obviously had a pretty meaningful step up in gross sales and I know you pointed out that there was a $900 million, I guess, in the cash management which I believe flows through there, but it was a pretty again a pretty decent step up. Is there anything else there they maybe we should think of it as, I do not know, maybe I will use non-recurring. Maybe that is not the right way to put it, maybe call it non-recurring or kind of one other big kind of chunky mandates that may have driven that besides cash management? Tom Faust : No. In fact, I would say if anything that was - the other thing we highlighted that went the other way was we had a roughly $400 million one-time withdrawal from - I guess, this is actually in the alternatives category, but it is from global macro. There was nothing else. You highlighted the one piece, the $900 million or so in cash management, the two fastest growing, I think, will likely be the two fastest growing parts of that over the next few quarters that were in this current number. One is the muni ladder business which was $750 million and I think every quarter that number has been growing. It is a broad-based business and we think we are in the very early innings of a very major business there. The second one I highlighted is the short duration strategic income fund that we got all the stars are aligned in terms of performance and yields and a very large category and it is getting a lot of sales attention it is a mutual fund asset, so you can follow the flows of that from standard mutual fund sources, but we expect that to continue to ramp up pretty nicely. The other one we did which was not much of a factor and this current quarter is our multi-sector income strategy and I highlighted that we have a pipeline of a roundly $1 billion of institutional accounts that we expect to fund. I mean they are supposed to fund. I think most of that supposed to fund within the next month or so, but even with some delays there we would expect to get most of that $1 billion in the third quarter, so if there is a one-time item that in cash in the second quarter, we expect some one-time items in multi-sector income with some visible wins one not funded opportunities that we expect all of that we expect to fund by the end of this month or 1st of June. Robert Lee : Yes. Maybe just one last question, thanks for indulging me. I just thought was the private fund assets if my numbers were correct, were up about 13% year-over-year. I am just kind of curious, is that the old exchange funds? Are you seeing any kind of resurgence in interest or demand for those? Tom Faust : A little bit. That would not be driving. I think that is probably slightly positive flows. We have had some more interest there. I think it is probably CITs [ph] that are the main driver of that business what asset classes are that? Laurie Hylton : Just looking. Dan Cataldo : Bob, the big drivers there are Laurie Hylton : Just okay. Tom Faust : Rob I think drivers there are comingled institutional product and the growth has been primarily in the emerging markets. You mentioned the exchange funds those have been growing as interest has picked up there. The other category of asset that shows up there is, CLOs and we have issued a couple of floating rate CLO, so I would say some combination of those products. Robert Lee : Great. Thanks for taking my questions guys and girls. Laurie Hylton : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Kenneth Lee : Hi. This is Kenneth Lee filling in for Eric. Just I think you touched upon this briefly, but I wanted to get a better sense on your continuing dialogue with fund companies on NextShares. Just to clarify, did you see that fund transparency is not a big concern among the fund companies you have been talking to? If so, would you says that the biggest pushback you have been receiving when speaking with potential partners. What is holding up potential partners from signing up? Thanks. Tom Faust : Maybe I did not understand you right, so I think I had said that the holdings transparency is a big concern, and that one of the attractive features about NextShares is that allows them to offer the benefits of an exchange traded product with better performance and better tax efficiency without requiring daily holdings disclosure. I think, maybe that is what you said. The question about why do not we have 100 fund companies as opposed to 10 or 20 as opposed to 10, is that basically the question? Kenneth Lee : Yes. Well, just in your dialogue like what could be preventing potential partners from signing up - fund transparency. Are there any other major issues that are\u2026 Tom Faust : Well, again, the transparency is not really an issue. That is an issue in our favor. No one says I am not going to do this, because I will only offer product that has daily transparency. No mutual fund company offers daily transparency, so that is a positive. Not a negative. Why do not we have more fund companies? I guess, I would offer maybe a handful of reasons. One is that fund companies are busy, executives are busy, generally, the bigger the company the more involved the decision-making process. We have been talking to fund companies really primarily since December. That is when we got our exemptive order approved, was early December. Typically a decision like this involves many parts of the organization and this is not just the marketing group, but it involves discussions with portfolio management, fund operations, legal, in most cases they are going to consult with their fund board before they commit to doing this, so it is a process to get this approved. I would say, in many companies also there is an issue of where this fits in with their other priorities, so I met with the CEO yesterday who is I think very interested in doing this likes the concept, at least that was what he told me, but he says over the next 6 to 12 months we are very focused on building out an international family of funds, funds that we can use its funds, we can sell outside the United States. It is not a vote against NextShares. He said we will probably be there if this is successful, but we have got other priorities, so that is the second reason. In some cases, there is something in-house that somehow in the exchange traded product world that is already in process. To the extent that they have hired a team or a person that is focused on building some kind of exchange traded product structure, whether it is a fully transparent fixed income or fund-to-funds or strategic data or all kind of different thing. To a little degree we run a file of some plan that is in the works internally, so we start to get slided behind that, because it has got external sponsorship in a way that perhaps we would not have on our own. The biggest issue is I say overwhelmingly is, what other broker-dealers say and come back to me when you have got major broker-dealers that are committed to this. I mean that is the biggest issue is why should I do this until my distribution partners have blessed this and said they are going to offer this? As I explained that everyone on both sides of this, it is a big chicken and egg issue, fund companies want to make sure broker-dealers are behind this, broker-dealers wanted to make sure that major fund companies are behind this. Really our challenge to get NextShares successfully to market is to breakthrough that chicken and egg by both, arguing to big fund companies that they should take the initiative in this and also arguing to big broker-dealers that they should take initiative to this. For this to work, that has to break one way or the other, and I think it is working. We have a very nice complement of initial fund companies that are signed up to launch this. We are engaged in serious dialogue with broker-dealers about how this fits in with their business and what we can do to help them get into this business, so it takes time nobody is more impatient for success here than I am. I can assure you of that, but overall I am quite pleased with our progress we have made. Just having been quite involved in a lot of discussions, particularly over the last three or four weeks, we have come a very long way in advancing peoples' understanding of what this, of what the investor benefit is and how this can fit in with the business plans of broker-dealers as well as fund companies. One of the things that makes that easier, is that we have seen tremendous growth over the course of this year in ETFs, and traditional broker-dealer advisor programs and that is a bit alarming to traditional active managers. It is also a bit alarming frankly to the broker-dealers themselves and that is the catalyst for people to think about solutions and this is the solution at hand to how do we respond to that as an industry and restore a fair competitive balance between active and passive to the benefit of investor returns. Kenneth Lee : Great. Thank you. That is very helpful. Tom Faust : Yes. Thank you. Operator : This concludes questions period for our call today. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Cataldo for closing remarks. Dan Cataldo : Great. Thank you and thank you very much for joining us this morning. If you do have follow-up questions, we will be available to take those. If we did not get to your questions, we apologize and we will do our best to get all questions answered. That said, thank you and have an enjoyable Memorial Day weekend. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Dan Cataldo, Treasurer. You many being your conference. Dan Cataldo : Great. Welcome to our 2015 fiscal third quarter earnings call and webcast. Here this morning are Tom Faust, Chairman and CEO of Eaton Vance, and Laurie Hylton, CFO of Eaton Vance Corp.  We will comment on the quarter and then we will take your questions. The full earnings release and charts we will refer to during the call are available on our website eatonvance.com under the heading Press Releases. Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainties in our business, including but not limited to those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings, including our 2014 Annual Report and Form 10-K are available on our website or upon request at no charge. I will now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Faust : Good morning. July 31, marked the close of our fiscal 2015 third quarter. These three months were period of considerable turmoil around the financial world, whether focusing on China, Greece, Puerto Rico, Russia, Energy markets, commodity prices generally, currency movements or the federal reserve, there was no shortage of new information for the markets to absorb. Though it all U.S. stock and bond markets traded with moderate volatility and ended the period roughly where they began.  We finished the quarter with a record $312.6 billion of consolidated assets in our management had $3.9 billion of consolidated net inflows and made progress on advancing a number of important corporate initiatives. But this was not our best quarter from an earnings perspective. We reported adjusted-earnings per diluted share of $0.57 for the third quarter, down $0.01 from the preceding quarter and down $0.06 from the year ago quarter. As noted in the press release, this quarter\u2019s earnings per diluted share were reduced $0.04 by compensation of other costs in connection with closing our New Jersey based affiliate Fox Asset Management and other compensation costs attributable to our clustering of retirements, terminations and additions to staff during the quarter.  Adjusting for inter period differences in these cost items, third quarter earnings per diluted share were up 3% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. The decline in earnings versus last year\u2019s third quarter reflects a 3% drop in revenue and higher compensation and other expenses. Laurie will provide more detail on our financials, including fee trends by product category in her remarks shortly. Net flows of $3.9 billion in the quarter represented 5% annualized internal growth rate. The quarterly flow results include two large flows for our Seattle base subsidiary Parametric, one negative and one positive.  First as discussed on our second quarter call back in May, Parametric lost a $3.4 billion emerging market equity mandate with a Sovereign Wealth client and in July Parametric began managing a new $5.8 billion centralized portfolio management or CPM assignment for a multi-manager mutual fund platform.  The $6.4 billion of portfolio implementation, that inflows we are reporting for the quarter includes not only that assignment but also over $800 million of net new inflows into Parametric tax managed custom separate accounts, a product category that continues to be very strong demand in both retail and wealth management channels.  As a reminder tax managed core accounts seek to match the pretax return of the client specified benchmark and add incremental return on an after tax basis through systematic tax, while its harvesting and deferral gains.  For the fiscal year to-date net flows into Parametric's tax managed core totaled $3.4 billion. Parametric's customer exposure management business had net outflows of $800 million in the third quarter as rebalancing is away from existing clients more than offset new client inflows. Even with this decline our exposure management business in nearly doubled in size in the 31 months since we acquired at the end of 2012. New business momentum and CEM remains strong with 2016 now coming into view is likely to be another good year.  Within Eaton Vance management we realized $1 billion of net inflows, our strongest growth quarter of the past two years. EVM positive flow results were driven by fixed income with $2.2 billion of new flows. Within fixed income we had over $500 million of net flows into each of high yield, multi strategy and municipal bond ladders.  Driving the growth of multi-strategy fixed income is the Eaton Vance short duration strategic income fund. This five star rated fund competes in one of the largest Morningstar categories, short term bond and has over $290 billion of net assets -- which has over $290 billion of net assets and nearly $75 billion of annual sales. For the calendar quarter ended June 30 we moved up to become the fourth best selling fund in the category with a 5% of share of new sales for the period.  The three funds ahead of us in sales were all many times our current $3 billion size and none of them matches our performance. As a top performer in a larger and growing fund category, we continue to view short duration strategic income as an exceptional growth opportunity for Eaton Vance.  In floating rate income net outflows of $500 million in the quarter or a significant improvement from the $6.2 billion of cumulative net flows over the preceding four quarters. The trend of our floating rate for us is actually better than the quarterly numbers suggest, since it includes $200 million of outflows related to schedule whine downs of CLOs we manage and $400 million plus of outflows from third party sponsored funds for which we manage a bank loan sleeve. Excluding those our bank loan business expressed modestly positive flows for the quarter. We continue to believe that the loan asset class is poised to gain favor with investors as short term interest rates start to rise. The fundamentals of the asset class remain very solid and year-to-date performance has been strong, better than both investment grade bonds as reflected in the Barclays Aggregate Index and high yield as measured by the BAML high yield index. While I am not predicting a return to positive floating rate flows in the fourth quarter, I do expect to see continued improvement in investor sentiment towards the floating rate asset class given strong performance in growing anticipation of near term fed action. In alternatives, we saw $150 million of net outflows in the third fiscal quarter, driven by nearly $200 million of redemptions from Eaton Vance Commodity Strategy Fund. It made a very challenging environment for commodities investing, the sub-advised funds net assets have fallen to just a $100 million. For our global macro franchise we saw net inflows of $150 million in the quarter, both Global Macro Absolute Return Fund and particularly at sister Global Macro Absolute Return Advantage Fund that produced quite strong relative and absolute performance over recent periods. As of July 31, Global Macro Advantage Class-I is the second best performer of 352 funds in the Morningstar non-traditional bond category for a one year performance and a top best outperformer over three years. Global Macro-I is also a top performer within its category over the past year.  The broader uncertainty across the global markets plays into the strength of these funds, which historically have provided low volatility, high risk adjusted returns and low colorations to U.S. equity and fixed income asset performance. Like short duration strategic income, they compete in a large fund category and compare favorably to the sales leaders in the terms of performance. A catalyst for the emergence of our high performing global macro absolute return advantage fund as a sales leader in its category may be reaching a five year track record, which comes at the end of this month.  Looking at our entire suite of income and alternative offerings, we are fortunate to have a broad range of high performing strategies, many at the lower end of the duration spectrum. We have included a slide in the presentation highlighting the top performing low duration funds we offer. Given where we are today in the bond market, we believe investors are increasingly looking for ways to generate income in their portfolios without taking significant interest rate risks. Few fund companies are as well positioned to offer than as Eaton Vance. In equities our flow challenge this quarter was to overcome the previously mentioned loss of a $3.4 billion Parametric emerging market equity mandate. Although we did not achieve positive flows for the quarter across equities overall, outside Parametric emerging markets we had net inflows of $500 million.  Equity performance remains a good story with the improving record of Eaton Vance management equity group particularly noteworthy. As of July 31, our large cap value fund Class-I was 125 basis points ahead of its Morningstar peer group average over the past year and also ahead of the category average over three and 10 years.  Although large cap value net flows were $200 million negative in the quarter, the asset we believe we have experienced here over the past four years is certainly showing signs of coming to an end. Favorable performance is driving a pick-up in sales for Eaton Vance Balance Fund and Eaton Vance Focus Growth Opportunities Fund, which we hope to build upon in coming quarters.  Our largest equity fund, Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap fund is having a terrific performance year as of July 31, its Class I shares were up over 12% year-to-date and it continues to rank as a performance leader in its category overall in time periods. In fact strong performance is widespread across our fund family. As of July 31 we offered 45 mutual funds with at least one share class having an overall Morningstar rating of four or five stars. This includes a diverse line of equity income alterative in multi asset strategies. As of July 31 71% of our fund assets were in funds beating their Morningstar peer group average over the past year.  Before turning the call over to Laurie, I would like to talk about two important strategic initiatives, the expansion of Eaton Vance Management Global Investment capabilities and the continued development of next year\u2019s exchange traded managed fund.  You may recall that last quarter we announced that Christopher Dyer and Aidan Farrell will be joining our London office as Director of Global Equity and Global Small Cap Portfolio Manager, respectively. Both Chris and Aidan come from Goldman Sachs Asset Management and are now on the job at Eaton Vance, working with colleagues in Boston and soon to be in London and elsewhere to oversee the management of global and international equity portfolios. Although it\u2019s still early days for this revamp and expanded team, I am confident this will prove to be an exceptional group of investors and the realization of a long term goal to make Eaton Vance management a relevant player in managing global equities. Although the costs in connection with this initiative were not insignificant, I am confident this will prove to be a highly worthwhile investment.  Turning to NextShares, the three months coinciding with our third fiscal quarter and the 19 days since have certainly been eventful. As a reminder NextShares are a new type of actively managed fund designed to provide better performance for investors. As exchange traded products NextShares will have built in cost and tax efficiencies, unlike conventional active ETFs NextShares will protect the confidentiality of fund trading information and provide buyer and sellers of shares with transparency and control of their trading costs.  Our NextShares business plan includes both introducing a family of Eaton Vance sponsored NextShares funds and licensing the underlying intellectual property in providing related services to other fund groups to enable them to offer NextShares. Since the beginning of May we have hit a number of milestones critical to the success of this initiative. In late June the SEC approved the listing and trading of 18 initial Eaton Vance NextShares funds on the NASDAQ exchange. With this approval, the only remaining regulatory step required for us to launch NextShares is clearing final disclosure language. On July 30 we filed with the SEC revised registration statements for each of the 18 funds.  Regarding licensees there are no 11 firms including Eaton Vance that have indicated there intent to offer NextShares funds by entering into preliminary agreement with Navigate and filing request for exemptive relief with the SEC. These 11 firms collectively manage approximately $500 billion in mutual fund assets and sponsor approximately 200 funds currently rated four of five stars by Morningstar. For the firms other than Eaton Vance the SEC has issued final exemptive applications permitting the offering of NextShares funds to five of them and give a notice of its intent to provide the request exceptive relief to the other five. Following the expedited filing and review process established for NextShares, the time from filing to notice of approval has averaged about a month.  We continue to be in active dialog with other fund companies. Just last week we signed a preliminary agreement with a major fund sponsor, which will become our largest to-date in terms of mutual fund assets. We expect them to file their SEC exceptive application within the next few weeks, at which time their identity will become public.  On the intermediary front you may have seen the press release issued yesterday by Envestnet Inc announcing their initiative to make NextShares available to financial advisors through their wealth management network. For those not familiar with Envestnet, they are a leading provider of unified wealth management technology and services to investment advisors, serving over 41,000 advisors, almost 3 million investor accounts and over $700 billion in total client assets.  They are an innovative high growth company whose mission is to help advisors deliver top quality investments services in the most cost and tax efficient way possible. It fits squarely with what NextShares seeks to provide. In many ways they are ideal partners for NextShares. Not only do they provide deep access to the rapidly growing ROA market, but their model based portfolio solutions cites that most, if not all of the implementation challenges of the NextShares. Adding NextShares to existing models and creating new NextShares based model doesn\u2019t require educating investment advisors about how to buy NextShares or tweaking systems to accommodate advisor enter NextShares trades.  To the advisor using a model portfolio that includes NextShares funds is no different than how they use models today. Following this approach implementing NextShares on a platform can be quick, easy and inexpensive. Eaton Vance has not been asked or made commitments to provide financial support of the investment initiative announced yesterday.  While excited to be working with Envestnet, we are also engaged in discussions with other intermediaries to support the offering of NextShares and hope to be in a position for other announcements soon. In those discussions one new avenue we are pursuing is making the case that as at Envestnet adding NextShares to model portfolios can be a quick and easy way to introduce the product without meaningful system enhancements or advisor training. Increasingly model portfolios are essential to help all types of financial advisors serve their clients. NextShares can fit there extremely well. In closing my remarks, I want to reiterate our target of launching the first NextShares funds by the end of this year. We are confident it will be ready by then and understand NASDAQ will also be ready. I do want to acknowledge however that other forces could push initial launch into early next year.  With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Laurie. Laurie Hylton : Thank you and good morning. As Tom mentioned, we are reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.57 for the third quarter fiscal 2015 compared to $0.63 for the third quarter fiscal 2014 and $0.58 for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Adjusted earnings for all quarterly periods presented was the same as reported GAAP earnings. As we noted in the release, costs associated with closing our Fox Asset Management, LLC subsidiary and other employee costs relating to retirement, terminations and new hires reduced earnings per diluted share by $0.04 and drove our operating margin down to 33% from 35% in the prior quarter. Employee costs relating to retirement, terminations and additions to staff reduced earnings per diluted share by $0.001 in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and $0.02 in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Third quarter total revenue decreased 3% year-over-year despite a 7% increase in average assets under management, primarily reflecting a decrease in our blended investment advisory and administrative fee rate and a decrease in assets subject to distribution and service fees. Sequentially total revenue increased by 1% reflecting the 2% increase in average assets under management, an incremental $1.6 million in third quarter performance fee and an increase in fee days in the quarter, partially offset by a modest decrease in our effective investment advisory and administrative fee rate. Performance fees for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $1.7 million compared to a little over $900,000 at third quarter last year and essentially zero in the prior quarter. Going forward, our effective investment advisory and administrative fee rate will continue to be driven primarily by the mix of business among mandates with different fee levels, with swings in performance fees and the number of fee days in the quarter also contributing to short term variability. In the third quarter of fiscal 2015 we realized average effective management fee rates of 65 basis points in its equity, 63 basis points in alternatives, 54 basis points in floating rate income and 43 basis points in fixed income; modestly above the prior fiscal quarter in most categories due to this increase in fee days in the quarter. Portfolio implementation, which includes Parametric's tax managed core specialty index and centralized portfolio management services had an average effect of fee rate of 15 basis points in the quarter in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to 17 basis points in the prior fiscal quarter, reflecting the impact of the large EPM win that funded in July. Parametric's exposure management business had an average effective fee rate of 5 basis points in the quarter, largely unchanged from the prior quarter. So long as exposure management, portfolio implementation and other low fee mandates continue to grow faster than the company as a whole, you can expect our overall average fee rate to continue trending downward. The key to achieving overall growth in management fee revenues in the face of declining average fee rates continues to be avoiding declines from the managed assets of our higher fee businesses. Shifting from revenue to expense, compensation expense increased 6% compared to the same quarter last year and 4% sequentially, reflecting headcount-driven increases in base compensation, employee benefits and stock based compensation, a modest increase in operating income based incentive accruals and incremental stock based compensation expense associated with retirements and terminations. Compensation expense as a percent of revenue increased to 35% for the quarter from 34% last quarter and 32% in the third quarter of last year. As I noted earlier, employee retirements, terminations and additions to staff to support growth initiatives collectively had a significant impact on the quarter, contributing approximately $5.8 million to compensation expense this quarter. Adjusting to remove these costs from the compared quarters, third quarter fiscal 2015 compensation expense would have increased 4% year-over-year, been flat in comparison with the prior quarter and would have equaled 33% of revenue. As we continue to build out our global equity team in London, add staff to support other initiatives and see more retirement, these costs won\u2019t go away, but are not expected to recur at levels similar to what we experienced in the third quarter. Distribution related costs, including distribution and service fee expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commission decreased 11% in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 from the third quarter of fiscal 2014, primarily reflecting lower closed end fund related payments and reduced asset based intermediary marketing support payments. Distribution related expenses increased modestly on a sequential quarter basis, reflecting an increase in marketing and advertising spend related to our next year\u2019s initiative. Fund related expenses were largely flat year-over-year and up 6% sequentially, primarily due to an increase in fund subsidies and other fund expenses, partially offset by a decrease in funds of advisory expenses. Other operating expenses were up 7% in the third quarter versus the same period a year ago and up 6% sequentially, primarily reflecting an increase in travel and certain professional services and other corporate expenses, including the acceleration of approximately $500,000 of amortization expense related to the closing of Fox.  Expenses related to our NextShares initiative totaled approximately $2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to $1.8 million last quarter and are expected to total approximately $8 million for fiscal 2015 as a whole. Net income and gains on seed capital investments had no impact on earnings in either the third quarter of fiscal 2015 or the prior sequential quarter, compared to a contribution of roughly $0.001 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. When quantifying the impact of our seed capital investments on earnings each quarter, we take into consideration our pro rata share of the gains, losses and other investment income earned on investments and sponsor products, whether accounted for as consolidated funds, separate accounts or equity method investment, as well as the gains and losses recognized on derivatives used to hedge those investments. We then report the per share impact of the net non-controlling interest expense and income taxes. Changes in quarterly equity net income of affiliate, both year-over-year and sequentially reflect changes in net income and gains recognized on sponsored products accounted for into the equity method. Our 49% interest in Hexavest, which has reported net of tax and the amortization of intangibles and equity in net income of affiliates, contributed approximately $0.02 per diluted share for all quarterly periods presented. Excluding the effect of CLO entity earnings and losses, our effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 was 38.9%, 38.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and 38% in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. We currently anticipate that our effective tax rate adjusted for CLO earnings and losses will be just north of 38% for fiscal 2015 as a whole. In terms of capital management, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of non-voting common stock for approximately $68.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. When combined with repurchases over the preceding three quarters, our average diluted share count for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 was down 3% from the same period in fiscal 2014. We finished the third fiscal quarter holding $433 million of cash and short-term debt securities and approximately $328 million in seed capital investment. Our outstanding debt consists of $250 million or 6.5% senior notes due in 2017 and $325 million or 3.625% senior notes due in 2023. We also have a $300 million five-year line of credit which is currently undrawn. Given our strong cash flow, liquidity and overall financial condition, we believe we are well positioned to continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This concludes our prepared comments. At this point, we\u2019d like to take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is open. Robert Lee : Great and good morning everyone. Kathy, I just have on expenses, can you just clarify, I mean you talked about the $0.04 of potential, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call it non-recurring. I mean should we think of that as non-recurring or I think you kind of suggested that some of that could be carrying forward. I\u2019m just trying to get a better feel for kind of the run rate of the comp. Laurie Hylton : Yes, I think we quantified it as a $5.8 million contribution to compensation expense this quarter and really what we\u2019re talking about are very specific quarterly impacts that are not necessarily recurring, but that will \u2013 if you got severance for example, you would anticipate that you won\u2019t have the same level of severance next quarter, but you\u2019ll likely have severance next quarter or signing bonus. So we\u2019re trying to sort of isolate the things that were sort of a deviation from what we would consider to be our run rate compensation and that\u2019s what we quantified in the $5.8 million this quarter and that really was breaking down into one-time events related to closing Fox and then certain employee retirements and termination that were very specific to this quarter. Robert Lee : Okay, great, thank. And then Tom, I don\u2019t know \u2013 I mean, obviously the portfolio implementation has been very strong. You cited some things with Parametric, but can you maybe update us on if you look across the business, kind of the institutional RFP activity, kind of maybe pipeline, kind of any color around where that stands and maybe drill down a little bit, particularly outside of the Parametric business, the progress you may or may not be seeing. Tom Faust : Yes, so institutional just maybe to step back, our key strategies that we offer institutionally, Parametric aside from their service and implementation oriented businesses, their primary strategy that they sell institutionally is emerging market equities. On the Eaton Vance side the primary strategies that we focus on currently include high yield bank loans, certain other flavors of equities, certain other flavors of fixed income in certain markets and also Hexavest as being a primary focus of ours on the equity side. I would say a few of things are not particularly working well at the moment, starting with Parametric emerging market equities. I think you\u2019re probably aware of the challenges that asset class has faced in terms of performance, so it\u2019s just institutions. Sophisticated though they may be, don\u2019t always allocate new assets to underperforming asset classes, which is where emerging market is at the moment, including lots of headlines about China.  We have in that strategy also suffered from a bit of under performance over second half of last year and the first part of this year. That has largely turned around, the key driver of that performance was an underweighting to China. The way that portfolio was built, we systematically underweight large market exposures in the interest of greater diversification and that really hurt us during that time period, but of course as the Chinese market has turned over, that\u2019s now working to our favor. On the Eaton Vance side, high yield is certainly an area where we funded a large institutional mandate during the quarter and where the pipeline and activity level is quite robust. I would say on bank loans we are still in this market environment where we kind of scratch our heads that we had net positive flows for us in normal institutional business, but we had a pretty significant allocation that I highlighted out of a sub advisory account that pulled the overall numbers down.  So long term mix. Our case there that we\u2019re making is that bank loans should be a core asset class and that they have diversification, benefits and returned characteristics that should make them a core holding and we\u2019ve had some success with that, but that\u2019s a long term build. I would say other areas, Hexavest, Hexavest is a top down oriented goal equity manager that has been bearish on the markets generally, that\u2019s been their investment point of view. Bearish has meant that they\u2019ve struggled to keep up with the markets, so last year they did outperform. They are just about equal to the markets currently based on the strong last couple of months as they\u2019ve experienced stronger relative performance, but it\u2019s been hard for them to really build a compelling performance track record, because they hold high cash levels at the moment consistent with their bearish views.  I would say similarly we\u2019re a little out of favor in terms of our multi sector income strategy run by Kathleen Gaffney. Great performance out of the box. She has been aggressive and has underperformed less aggressive managers for most of this year. We\u2019ll see how that resolves itself, but we\u2019re getting close to the point where she has a three year track record, which over the time of her experience here she\u2019s really had in total exceptional performance, though this year is not in particular good.  So to summarize I would say it\u2019s okay. We don\u2019t have a compelling pipeline, but we don\u2019t have a bear pipeline either and we don\u2019t certainly have visibility to significant institutional net outflows. Robert Lee : Great. And then maybe just one more question or a pair of questions on to our NextShares. First, assuming when you are ready to launch the Europe product, Euro advance NextShares products, do you anticipate that you\u2019ll have some other firms ready to go kind of at right the same time and then what are your current expectations around seed capital and need for those funds. Do you think it\u2019s going to be mainly reallocating existing seed or are we likely to see some increased use of cash or debt. I\u2019m just trying to get a kind of update on your thoughts around that. Tom Faust : Yes, first on the product introduction, our plan has been and continues to be to launch as part of a consortium of sponsors. We highlighted these companies \u2013 they are on our website that have filed. I mentioned them in my remarks, but there are 11 sponsors. I would say eight relatively large fund sponsors included in that group.  We\u2019re putting together what we\u2019re calling a consortium of sponsors. We have an initial meeting of that consortium that\u2019s been scheduled for next month and our goal would be to launch products in conjunction with other companies. Unfortunately we don\u2019t control the timing of what they do, so we don\u2019t have complete control over that, but it\u2019s our understanding that that\u2019s what everyone wants to do and it will come to market together and everyone sees the benefit of doing that. I would say for Envestnet and how they see NextShares fitting into what they are doing, what they want to do, there\u2019s two primary things; one is potentially introducing NextShares funds as a complement to an existing multi manager strategy, so that could be alongside of the mutual funds or with ETFs, but it could be all active, it could be all passive or it could be into a formerly all passive strategy. But we can blend and that doesn\u2019t necessarily require a consortium to be available, but they would also like to offer a range of NextShares only strategies and most likely they would not want that to come from any single advisor. So that needs to be offered in conjunction with a consortium of funds, introducing NextShares. In terms of seed capital, I would say that\u2019s not something that we have a definitive answer to. I think as you know the general primary requirement for seed capital and the mutual fund has been requirements that have been imposed by broker dealers to say if you want to be offered on our platform, you have to have some level of either track record of assets in the strategy. We have not gotten to the point in our discussions with major broker dealers where that\u2019s been fully decided. It\u2019s certainly one of the things that\u2019s important to us, is to make the case that if it\u2019s an existing proven strategy, there shouldn\u2019t be a requirement for that to be worth their attention that it have a certain amount of seed capital. I get for a new strategy that doesn\u2019t have a track record why that same logic would apply, but we would certainly make the case that we shouldn\u2019t need to put $25 million or $50 million into a fund just because that\u2019s an internal requirement. That would be something that we would expect to be part of a negotiation in terms of gaining access for NextShares on our particular dealers platform. From an exchange perspective the requirement is much, much lower than that. I don\u2019t know the specific number; maybe its $1 million or a couple of million dollars, something like that, but the primary broker dealer requirement, we would hope and expect that it wouldn\u2019t be the same as a brand in your mutual fund offering. Robert Lee : Great, I appreciate you taking my questions. Thank you. Tom Faust : Yes, thanks Rob. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Will Cuddy : Good morning. This is Will Cuddy filling in for Ken today. Thanks for taking our questions. So just some thoughts; Precidian file who refilled their application last week, what do you guys think of that new filed application? I guess there are some concerns raised in people. Tom Faust : Well, I guess I\u2019ll start by saying some people thought I spent too much time on this topic a couple of weeks ago, so I\u2019m not going to go into a whole lot of detail, but there are a couple of things I would assert.  First, since 2001 when the SEC put out what they call a concept release on actively managed ETFs, the possibility of this, their primary focus has been on how well will these trade? Will they trade at tight bid ask spreads and they are all premium discounts and particularly how they will trade during periods of market stress and volatility.  As I look at the Precidian filing, this version actually moves a step away from that and that it takes away information that would have been provided in the last iteration. So I guess why you could say that they made progress in addressing certain issues. To my thinking they possibly have moved away in the other thing.  I continue to believe and I\u2019m not going to decide this, we\u2019re not going to decide this, the SEC is going to decide this, but it remains my view that all of these various proposals and there are a couple of other ones in addition to the preceding ones, all of them are likely to face an uphill challenge.  The SEC is trying to look for evidence that these things will trade consistently well and it\u2019s hard to see that in the historical record of existing ETF and particularly existing active ETFs and knowing and understanding that these will trade less well, because they provide market markers with less information. I think it\u2019s going to be very hard for the SEC to get comfortable here, but again, I\u2019m not in a position to decide this. This is just one persons opinion.  And the other thing I would say and I think people sometimes lose sight of this, is that the specific Precidian proposal applies only to funds whose holdings consist entirely of two things, U.S. listed securities and cash and if you look that market for actively managed mutual funds today, that\u2019s about 3% of the fund market.  In other words 97% of active mutual funds hold something other than U.S. listed stocks and cash and its possible that they could address a larger market than that over time, but their specific filing as its in and this is the new version as in the old version is just U.S. equity funds and just U.S. equity funds that do not have any holdings outside the United States and any holdings other than cash and that\u2019s a very, very small potential market. So that\u2019s my view and I\u2019m sticking to it, but we don\u2019t get to decide. Will Cuddy : Okay, thank you for the view. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Will Katz from CitiGroup. Your line is open. Will Katz : Okay, thanks very much for taking my question just now. To just come back to maybe comp and margins on a go forward basis, could you frame out where you might be in terms of the European build out. It seems like you\u2019re in your earlier days for sure. Can you quantify maybe how much more incremental spend there might be and then how long it might take to get to scale. I guess the question is, when could you start to anticipate some kind of flows on the back of the investment spend? Tom Faust : Let me maybe talk about the scale. So scale in terms of spend that is having the team built out, we really expect that to happen probably in the current quarter or certainly by the end of the year. We\u2019ve hired some more people that have not been announced in terms of who they are, although that will be expected shortly. There are a couple of more open positions that we\u2019re likely to fill over time, but this is a major initiative for us. This is a multi-million dollar expense item that we thought was necessary and appropriate to expand our footprint as an equity manager to include a full-fledged robust global equity offering. Some of those expenses are of an ongoing nature, but some of them also are of a one-time nature and the two leaders of that team were onboarded in the current quarter. So any compensation we paid them of a one-time nature in terms of signing bonuses or the initial recognition of the value of an equity grant, those all hit in the current quarter. On a run rate basis those costs are going to go down.  Now over time we\u2019re going to have some new people that are going to come on, but the way we tried to frame the discussion of this topic is that we think that over coming quarters generally this category is going to go down. It won\u2019t go to zero, we got new people we\u2019re going to be hiring in the next quarter and maybe some more in the quarter after that, but you should expect to see substantially less than $0.04 a share of spending related to this and related topics; and remember the $0.04 was not just this. It was also the closing of Fox Asset Management, which is a business that we\u2019ve been supporting.  We acquired Fox in 2001. They haven\u2019t made money in quite some number of years and this over time, the money we spent to shut down that operation in the current quarter will help our earnings going forward, because they were just as not as an economic scale business. Now you are correct that the business we\u2019re creating in London is not at the moment generating incremental revenues equal to the incremental expenses. Sadly that\u2019s not the way our business works. We do think however that we are in a position to start winning new clients relatively soon. The people that run that team, Chris Dyer and Aiden Farrell are well known in the marketplace. Particularly Aiden is a recognized player in the global small cap world and that\u2019s an area where there has been generally strong demand for active management and also an area where due to capacity constraints on existing established market leaders, often there is an appetite for new managers.  But this is a \u2013 I mean I think your right to focus on this. This is an expense item that is not going to go away. The one-time cost will go away, but the cost to support that team. But as we look at it we look at the potential to bring in potentially over time multiple billion dollars of actively managed assets that doesn\u2019t exist today. But we look at the breakeven assets we need to support this team and we see this is a highly probable win for us, not guaranteed but highly probably to be a win for us.  Just looking at putting the pencil to paper in terms of what does it cost to support this team and what would it require in terms of incremental assets raised for this to be a positive. That\u2019s not the only reason we are doing it, but certainly making money is a key objective in terms of that initiative. Will Katz : Okay, that\u2019s helpful color. And then just a follow-up question on NextShares, and thanks for the extra color and congratulations on the Envestnet win; it\u2019s very interesting. Could you talk a little bit about that win in particular and just trying to reconcile like your conversation with, I know your comments are proceeding with the uphill battle, which I appreciate and negotiations with the broker dealers maybe do, maybe don\u2019t have to put some seed capital up against kind of from the track record.  From their perspective have they provided and how quickly they think they would push the NextShares portfolio and maybe some of the consortium of funds through their system. What kind of track record might they need, that\u2019s sort of part one and the second part is as you mentioned, you\u2019ve had some more negotiations with other broker dealers or other distributors. Could you maybe give a broad profile of the type you are interfacing with, where your most advanced on. Is it another sort of online player or is it more of a traditionally managed broker dealer that maybe we\u2019ll think about like a Merrill Lynch or Morgan Stanley. Thank you. Tom Faust : So just to clarify Bill, on your timing question, was that specific to Envestnet or was that more generally? Will Katz : I wouldn\u2019t say Envestnet, obviously you got that one. So it appears how fast you think that you might get some uptick from that platform. Tom Faust : As I understand and I\u2019ve been involved in some dissuasions with them, but not all, implementing new strategies on their models is a relatively straight forward process. I mean many of those models are overseen and built by their own in-house teams, there is a vetting process for that. But we are not talking about bringing out NextShares funds that are normal strategies.  We are talking about bringing out NextShares funds that effectively replicates the investment track record of \u2013 replicate the strategy of an existing mutual fund run by the same team, holding the same assets where it is a very small leap to say that if that same strategy can be offered in a lower cost structure and one that has potential tax advantages that they shouldn\u2019t be ready to adopt that.  But is I think consistent with the spirit of what was announced yesterday, that they are not going to take a wait and see attitude for us to see how these things perform. Buying any new strategy involves a bit of a leap of faith, but that leap of faith here I would argue is extremely small and that we are dealing with proven managers, proven strategies with proven track records in a structure that where I think most people would say that the potential benefits in terms of performance, lower costs, etc. are quite clear and doesn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t be too hard for people to get comfortable with.  So we don\u2019t have specific time commitments that I\u2019m aware of on the part of Envestnet. We don\u2019t have product approved yet, other companies don\u2019t have products approved yet. But everything from my understanding of what they\u2019ve said is that when these products are available that they will look to add them to their portfolios and when that proves to be ultimately will drive the timing of their implementation, that\u2019s my understanding. In terms of the types of intermediaries that we are talking too, I want to be careful there, because we are in discussion I said a couple of weeks ago, that we don\u2019t want to compromise some discussion that may be sensitive points. I guess I\u2019ll say advisors serving all market categories, we do not see the potential appeal of NextShares as limited to a particular distribution channel. For example, only registered investment advisor, or only independent advisors, or only broker dealers.  Our business is quite broad based. We have good distribution arrangements across all types of firms; warehouses, independent, banks registered investment advisors, and we are having discussions involving NextShares with all of them and I would say on an overall basis something like 75% of our mutual fund sales is in Class-I shares were there is no 12B fee paid, no front end load, no back end load and for that business it is a fairly straight forward transition from that to NextShares in terms of the business economics. So I think I guess I would count to you to think about NextShares fitting in everywhere that Class-I mutual funds fit in, in terms of distribution economics and that\u2019s almost the entire advisory channel, both advisory within broker dealers and advisory within independent advisors. All of those customers are primary using I Class mutual funds. Here we are offering something that has very similar economics, but potentially better performance in characteristics for investors. Will Katz : Okay, thank you Tom. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler from William Blair. Your line is open. Chris Shutler : Hey guys, good morning. First of the NextShares initiative, do you think that you will be profitable by the end of \u201916 in that or is it just too early to say. Tom Faust : Well, I would say unlikely. This is a long term initiative. Thinking about it you\u2019d have to kind of \u2013 the math isn\u2019t very hard. We\u2019ve talked about what our spending is. I think we\u2019ve also talked about what our fee rates would be. A little math and you can come up with what our average assets would have to be in 2016 to cover that spend. Maybe we\u2019ll get there, but we are not doing this because we expect to make a lot of money in 2016. We are doing this because we think this is a better product for investors and we think overtime that all the various slings and arrows that we\u2019ve taken along the way ought to be at some point rewarded to Eaton Vance shareholders for having done this. Chris Shutler : Yes, totally understand. And then on the Envestnet deal Tom, clearly as an effort it seems like on their part to bring down cost for advisors and then investors. But just curious, is there any other way that Envestnet benefits from offering NextShares relative to mutual funds? Tom Faust : I\u2019m not sure what you are getting it. Chris Shutler : No, I just didn\u2019t know if there is any kind of additional cost or revenue opportunity for them associated with that. I didn\u2019t think so, but I just want to make sure. Tom Faust : Yes, I think their business model is a pretty straightforward, transparent business model in which they charge fees for services to their customers and that one of the things they try and offer to those customers in exchange for those fees is access to the best products. And how they grow and how they compete is by offering a \u2013 I\u2019d say a relatively unconflicted, if not completely unconflicted set of tools and advise on making advisors better in what they are trying to offer their clients and offering NextShares which has we think compelling cost and tax advantages. It fits very well with how they business. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s more complicated than that. Chris Shutler : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Eric Berg : Thanks very much. One housekeeping question and one question related to NextShares. My first question relates to your flows. When you recorded $8.4 billion of gross outflows, just outflows in your equity area, does that include or exclude the loss of the sovereign business from Parametric. Dan Cataldo : It includes it Eric. Eric Berg : So the loss of the Parametric business that you referenced in your prepared remarks would be included in the equity asset outsource? Tom Faust : That\u2019s right, it\u2019s all during the month of when was that May I think. Dan Cataldo : Right in the middle of May, so Tom Faust : Yes, so it was in there. Eric Berg : Good. Here is a broader question about NextShares. I\u2019m hoping Tom you can build out on, expand on your comments that model based investing, if you could maybe sort of explain it for those people who I have a sense, but I think would helpful if you could explain what you mean by model based investing which has become so popular in this country and what is it about the model based investing at anything that has done by Envestnet affiliated advisors. Why would it be any different from model based investing at Merrill Lynch?  So sort of a two part question. What do you mean by model based investing and what is it about NextShares that make it easier to integrate NextShares into model based investing versus any other form of investing. Thank you. Tom Faust : Okay, let me see if I can explain this. So think about a financial advisors, traditional way you build portfolios, you\u2019ve got advisors sits across from Mr. and Mrs. Jones and they discuss what stocks or bonds or mutual funds or ETS or NextShares funds they are going to put in their portfolio and based on that discussion maybe with some ongoing consultation over time, an advisor will build and manage our portfolio for Mr. and Mrs. Jones that may have some of those and its essentially built on a one-off basis and maintained for Mr. and Mrs. Jones where the advisor is putting in one by one orders to buy individual securities and to sell offsetting amounts of individual securities, so we\u2019ll call that the traditional model, I mean the traditional approach, so that we don\u2019t confuse, sorry, so that\u2019s the traditional approach.  A model based approach would be to say \u2013 think about a financial advisor that doesn\u2019t have one customer that he or she is serving, but has a menu of customers. And for the interest of efficiency and risk control we\u2019ll put those different customers into different categories, where depending on where Mr. and Mrs. Jones fall relative to Mr. and Mrs. Smith, they might have different risk profiles. But rather than just simply doing this on \u2013 I\u2019ll assume the advisor is a he for this purpose, but rather than that advisor just on his own building and maintaining these multiple portfolios for multiple clients in a world where efficiency is increasingly demanded, there has developed what are called model based approaches to portfolio construction and management, where building on this application or building on this example, an advisor would potentially put the Smith\u2019s in one category, the Jones in another category and would either setup models that he himself would run, saying I\u2019m going to put this groups of clients in this model and this group of clients in this other model or perhaps the advisor says, you know what, I might be better off letting someone else who does this fulltime for a living figure out what sort of asset allocation is appropriate for clients of a different risk profile and what particular managers and strategies and structures I should own in that.  So models can be constructed and managed either by an individual advisor or by a team of advisors or by a firm or by a third party expert and there are all kinds of different model construction and oversight methodologies that are in wide practice today and it apples absolutely to all types of advisors, not just independent advisors, not just ROAs, not just warehouse advisors, but really across the board. This is a very common way for financial advisors to serve their clients and its certainly growing more popular because of the obvious efficiency advantages that it offers over a one by one every trade one at time kind of approach.  In terms of the relevance of this to NextShares and the ease of implementation of NextShares, what\u2019s different about NextShares versus a traditional ETF, if we\u2019ll use that as a benchmark is really only one thing, which is that when you buy NextShares fund, the price of that trade is not set until the end of the day and that involves perhaps of system changes, what a limited order means in that context, there is something slightly different, and there is a terminology that goes with that in terms of putting in orders and handling of orders. So if advisor were to work individually with the Jones\u2019s and the Smith putting in those orders, that advisor would have to be educated on the subtle distinctions that exist between how you enter an order for NextShares versus an order for an ETF and also the systems that are built to accommodate advisor would also have to some safeguards to make it difficult for the advisory to make mistakes. Imagine a world though where advisor doesn\u2019t enter orders. Imagine a world in which advisor says I\u2019m going to put these models together and I\u2019m going to turn over the implementation of that to some central group and that\u2019s really when investment would come in which is to say that they both build and manage and maintain models where effectively the trade order entry in the case of their particular models is done by a small team where they do only that.  So that any training or any systems modifications that have to be done to accommodate NextShares is done versus to serve a very small group of implementers two, three, four, five people as opposed to 41,000 people if we where to make this available to all the customers that Envestnet serves. So it\u2019s much, much, much easier. Much similar to say financial advisor, you are still involved in asset allocation and asset allocation, you are still involved in securities, and manager selection. But in terms of the specific implementation, through a model that\u2019s done by somebody else who focuses is on that as their job and that the beauty of this is that all the complexity of buying and selling NextShares, and I don\u2019t want to emphasize that. It\u2019s not huge, this is not inter amountable. I could I think teach anyone how to do this inside of five minutes. But all that goes away if you have a centrally implemented approach like models do and it is not just in Envestnet. It is pervasive across the industry. Eric Berg : Really clear and really helpful. Thank you very much. Tom Faust : All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Michael Carrier : Thanks. Laurie just a question on expenses. So you gave the color around comp, just on the other expenses it seems like it was a bit elevated. I think you mentioned, somewhat with the acceleration, the amortization related to Fox and then maybe a little bit of an uptick in next year, but I just wanted to get some outlook there.  And then when you think about the fee, like the mixed shift trend, when you think about some of these investments that are taking place right now. Where do you think the margin can kind of settle into maybe over the next year versus longer term obviously as you scale that international business, you can see some improvement. Laurie Hylton : Yes in terms of expenses outside of comp, I think that they were somewhat limited in terms of unusual events this quarter. I think to your point earlier we have roughly 500,000 in accelerated amortization associated with effectively closing down Fox. Outside of that we had some legal costs associated with our global initiatives and some incremental marketing associated with NextShares, which was already built into the 1 million estimate that we had give for the year, so not a lot of noise in terms of our other operating expenses.  Given the environment that we are in right now and recognizing that we\u2019ve got these significant growth initiatives and the markets been a little bit small to us and has taken away some revenue that we would certainly liked to keep, I am not going to attempt to forecast what margins going to look like next quarter. I will tell you that we are now going to out budgeting cycle and our initial review cycle and that we are doing everything we can to really, very carefully mange our expenses.  We are mindful the impact of these initiatives have on our margin, we are mindful of the fact that this is a difficult time to be making these investments but we are also \u2013 we feel very strongly that this is the time for us to do it, to position ourselves for the further. So I wish I had a crystal ball and could tell you exactly where the margin was going. I will tell you that we are being very, very careful about spend. Maintain it in the range that we are in but I cent tell you what it\u2019s going to look like for next year. Tom Faust : Okay, all right. I guess I was going to say that we have two major initiatives in NextShares and this Global expansion that are both multi-million expenses that annually, that we have taken on that have the effect of lower our earnings, lowering our margins today. But these are both investments that we think have huge potential, different types, but both investments of a similar scale that have the potential to have enormous payoff over time. So there is a short term pain with a potential, certainly for a long term gain in terms of our business. But you had another question Michael. Michael Carrier : Yes, okay that makes sense. And then just a quick one just on NextShares, so on the asset management side you celery make some good progress and then on the distribution side teams like yours, you\u2019re starting to gain some traction. When you think of the distribution platforms and in your conversations, like what is maybe the \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say delay, because there was no real expectation of when you would get them onboard.  But when you think about like the pushback, like technology investment that the platforms have to make, is it the liquidity of the funds, is it just the meetings that have to take place and they have to make the decision which doesn\u2019t happen overnight. Just trying to get a sense of like how you see that progressing and what are some of the push backs that you\u2019re getting from the distribution process. Tom Faust : I guess I would say the main \u2013 I think you hit upon what I would consider the key issues. Probably the biggest is focus, priorities, you got the department of labor out there with the fiduciary, a standard initiative. Where does this fit?  The top part about this is that it affects \u2013 if a broker dealer imagines this becoming meaningfully successful, it doesn\u2019t affect just one little part of their business. It\u2019s embracing next year\u2019s \u2013 potentially could be a pretty big deal decision for a broker dealer or anyone else providing intermediary services and that how it fits into their revenue model, what new revenues it would offer, what revenues might go away, it\u2019s fairly central to their business. It\u2019s not terribly complicated. You can easily identify sort of the pros and cons. All of these firms recognize that they exist to serve clients and that we get zero push back on the idea that this is a better product for clients than the alternatives of a mutual fund and in a very broad range applications, but it\u2019s really kind of getting people that are at a level of seniority in the organization that have a broad enough per view that they can see and think about how this impacts their business, getting them to focus on this, that\u2019s really the challenge for us.  We don\u2019t get pushed back at senior levels that people that say, this is bad for our customers or this is bad for our business to a person. They say that this is interesting to a person; they say this is disruptive, but its working this through a process and some of this is maybe reluctance to be first.  We\u2019re grateful to our friends at Envestnet for stepping up and willing to be first. We believe that as we make progress here, making further progress gets easier and easier and so we\u2019re working at it and we share the frustration of those that want to get this done tomorrow. I\u2019m certainly in that camp, but we have to work a process and have to be respectful that we\u2019re not the only thing that these firms have to think about.  These are generally large complex organizations and these are fairly interesting times where there are some major shifts going on in the offering and distribution of investment products, principally the shift that\u2019s ongoing from active mutual funds to ETFs. Every broker dealer that offers, that serves retail investors and offers funds is experiencing that. How does this fit into this? Does it help them or hurt them to introduce NextShares? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of debate about that, but what priorities should that get versus other possible initiatives that they might have. Michael Carrier : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Kim from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open. Michael Kim : Hey guys, good afternoon. So first, once some of these broker deals have sort of the infrastructure in place and are able to start trading the ETMF. Just based on your current roster of third party managers that have signed up to launch the funds, just curious to get your expectations for related AUM growth in the first one to three years. Tom Faust : Yes, we don\u2019t \u2013 I mean, so there are a lot of unknowns here, right. You\u2019re going to have to I think build your own model in terms of timing. I think we can give a lot of guidance on how big the market is, we can give a lot of guidance on what revenue and cost expectations might be, revenue in terms of fee rates, but the big question in this and the big modeling question is what\u2019s the uptick? When does it happen? How big is it?  I can make a case where this should be a very rapid conversion. If you look at what happened with passive investing, it took 20 years for ETF to get a 50% share of the passive business, but that was an environment where for the first eight or ten of those years there was extremely limited product offerings. The first half dozens of those years was essentially one or two funds available.  As I see it, given the historical pattern of acceptance of ETFs, the fact that people know what an ETF is, also the fact that there will be many, many fund companies out there talking about this, the fact that from the get go its approved for all asset classes. If this takes off, that\u2019s a big if; it should not take 20 years to get to a 50% market share.  So I don\u2019t have a great answer for you in terms of what AUM will be at the end of 2016 or 2017. I think if this takes off, it can take off relatively quickly, but we\u2019re not going to be where we hope to be by the end of 2016 or 2017. There\u2019s a lot of advisor education. There\u2019s a lot of money that\u2019s in strategies and products that will have to migrate to this. Everyone can believe this is a better mouse trap, but still that doesn\u2019t mean the assets will all move overnight. So sorry I can\u2019t help with the modeling questions. Michael Kim : No, I appreciate the color. And then just on the equity side of the business, just wondering if you could talk about sort of the dynamic between adverse demand trends across the industry, particularly as it relates to actively managed domestic strategies versus improving investment performance, track records as you look across your platform and maybe the opportunity to gain some market share. Tom Faust : Yes, I guess I would say and I\u2019m not particularly proud of this, but at the moment we don\u2019t have a whole lot to lose in terms of traditional active assets invested in U.S. equities. We had a one-time, a quite large cap value franchise that is \u2013 I think it\u2019s around the $8 billion today versus a peak of something like $34 billion. I would assume that to some degree the continued outflows we\u2019re seeing despite a pretty good performance record has to do with that broader trend from active to passive. So to some degree we\u2019re being hurt by that. It\u2019s harder to sell active strategies today than it was two or five or eight years ago, because I think there\u2019s a greater attitude of skepticism about the ability of active managers to sustain outperformers than would have been there prior to the long career now we\u2019ve had with our performance generally for passive over equity and large cap US equity. So I guess I see us, for our business where we sit today, the balance is far more to the opportunity side in large cap U.S. equities than it is to the risk side. We have a balanced fund. It has a five star rating for all time periods. It\u2019s a top \u2013 I believe top deciles performer, certainly a top quintile performer year-to-date one, three, five and ten. It\u2019s an enormous category. Balanced funds don\u2019t go there every month, but there\u2019s a large audience of potential investors for that fund. We can have a much bigger balanced fund than we did today in the $300 million range. There\u2019s no reason that even with the adverse trends in our business that that fund couldn\u2019t be some multiple of its currents size relatively quickly, just by taking share from other managers.  Our focused growth opportunity fund, also a strong performer, still relatively early in the slide. I think we hit our five year anniversary sometime in the next year I think, but it\u2019s got very strong performance, focus strategies appeal as a good application of active management, but our industry generally faces \u2013 I feel like a pretty huge threat. When I say our industry I really mean active managers in this case from passive. But the threat to Eaton Vance is relatively small, because that threat is greatest in large cap U.S. equity and that is today a pretty small part of our business. When I say that I\u2018m excluding specialty products like host and funds and exchange funds where we don\u2019t place the normal type of competition like we saw in large cap value for example. Michael Kim : Got it, okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mr. Cataldo. Dan Cataldo : Great. Thank you for joining us this morning and afternoon and we hope you enjoy the remaining days of summer and we look forward to reporting back to you this fall. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

This is Kathleen McCabe, Head of Investor Relations. During today\u2019s presentation, we will refer to our earnings release, financial supplement, and strategic update, copies of which are available at www.morganstanley.com. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release and the strategic update. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman. James Gorman : Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning, everyone. Given the amount of information we\u2019re going to cover on this call, we\u2019re happy to extend the Q&A a few minutes as needed to insure you get your questions in. In a minute, I\u2019ll take you through the 2016/2017 outlook and plan, but before I do so let me touch briefly on the fourth quarter. Clearly the difficult environment that began midsummer continued through the fourth quarter. Notwithstanding that, equity sales and trading and Investment Banking were strong, and Wealth Management and Investment Management were solid. We acted on those things within our control by initiating a major restructuring affect, conducting a large reduction in force in December, reducing our compensation-to-revenue ratio, launching a large scale firm-wide expense initiative, more on that later, significantly reducing RWAs impact to $136 billion, well below our target of $180 billion, and closing the sale of our oil merchanting business. Finally, we put in place the leadership team to drive the team forward over the next several years. On that, I look forward to having Colm join me as our President. He brings highly complimentary skills and will help take this firm to the next level. The previous appointments of Ted Pick as Global Head of Sales and Trading, Dan Simkowitz as Head of Investment Management and Jon Pruzan as CFO are hard evidence of our deep and talented bench. Finally, Sam Kellie-Smith, will run fixed income and commodities working for Ted. In light of these changes, it was expected that Greg Fleming would pursue opportunities away from Morgan Stanley. We thank Greg for all he is done, and wish him well for the future. Our bench in Wealth Management is particularly strong. Andy Saperstein and Shelley O\u2019Connor have over 40 years experience in that business. Shelley previously ran the field organization, a position Andy also previously held as well as running products. Colm will help oversee Wealth Management and of course it is a business have a very long history in. Building a first-class leadership team is among my most important responsibilities. I\u2019m delighted we made these decisions, and look forward to a period of stability with this team. Now our entire focus is on driving results. Please, if you will, turn to the slides that you can find on the Investor Relations website. After I go through these Jon will take you through the quarter in more detail then we\u2019ll both take your questions. Let\u2019s start with Slide number 3. As you can see, as a result of many changes, our business mix is much more balanced with complimentary franchises in Institutional Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management. In our Institutional Securities business, we have maintained our leadership positions in Investment Banking and equity sales and trading, as illustrated on Slide 4. In equity sales and trading, we\u2019re first among global peers as of the third quarter year-to-date. We\u2019ve built on the momentum of recent years under the leadership of Colm and Ted, with full year revenues ex-DVA of $8.1 billion, up 18% year-over-year. In banking, we continue to see strength and finished second in global announced M&A and number one in IPOs. Slide 5 recaps what we laid out last year and our results. In Wealth Management, we achieved a full-year profit margin of 22%, with pre-tax earnings of $3.3 billion, a record for this business. We expect to see further growth in Wealth Management. We grew our U.S. banks\u2019 net interest income by 46% year-over-year in a flat rate environment. However in fixed income and commodities, we failed to improve on our financial results. While we\u2019ve been reshaping fixed for several years, the volatile and shrinking revenue pool coupled with the steady increase in capital requirements led us to take further significant action at year end. Through our recently announced FIC restructuring, we will better align the capital and resources committed to the business with the opportunity we see. Through the year, our funding costs benefited from the realization of our funding tailwind, as the debt we issued was at much tighter spreads than the post-crisis debt that matured. We will continue to see benefit from the associated going forward. We maintained our focus on expense management and achieved a full-year ISG compensation ratio ex-DVA of 37%, below our stated goal of 39% or less. And finally, we increased our common dividend by 50% and increased our buyback from $1 billion to $2.5 billion. We intend to further increase capital return to shareholders in the years ahead, subject of course to regulatory approval. As you can on page 6, our ROE for 2015 excluding DVA and the discrete tax benefits were 7% on a capital base of $67 billion. We remain committed to our 10% ROE target. Obviously that gap is a function of both earnings and equity. On Slide 7 we layout the key elements of our plan for achieving returns of 10% or greater. These include capital sufficiency, expense efficiency, Wealth Management revenue growth and capital returns to shareholders. These of course are in addition to the continued improvements across Institutional Securities and Investment Management. Since 2012, we have made significant progress in derisking our balance sheet on flat assets. This is shown on Slide 8. We continued to accrete common equity, despite continued increase in capital returns to shareholders. We believe our robust equity base coupled with a derisk balance sheet and a transformed business mix, provides a strong foundation to support our current plan. As shown on Slide 9, our pro forma common equity Tier 1 ratio of 14.1% and pro forma supplemental leverage ratio of 5.8% are well in excess of their prospective requirements. Building a very strong capital base has been a critical part of our strategy, as evidenced by our ratios. By comparison in the first quarter of 2014, our pro forma common equity Tier 1 ratio under the advanced approach was 11.6% and our pro forma supplemental leverage ratio was just 4.2%. We await clarification on the impact in timing of the G-SIB buffer and CCAR. When that clarity is provided, we believe we will be near the end of supervisory changes and therefore our capital is appropriately sized to support our business going forward. Turning to fixed income and commodities on Slide 10. Notwithstanding considerable efforts to reduce the capital required to support FIC, further regulatory changes in recent years and a prolonged difficult environment led us to believe that much more radical actions were necessary. We have reset the long-term RWA target for FIC at $110 billion, and a setting an SLR exposure target of $250 billion. As a result, we are confident that going forward this business will require $5 billion to $8 billion less capital. Over time where possible, excess capital will be returned to shareholders. On Slide 11, we give more details on the FIC restructuring. Given the cyclical, and in some cases structural challenges facing fixed income, driven by the work Colm and Ted did at the end of last year, we took the decision to downside headcount by 25%, along with our ongoing balance sheet and capital focus. We took this action alongside the recent installation of a new management team with the objective of credibly sizing of the business going forward. Our emphasis will be where we have traditional strengths. We have competitive advantages in micro products, specifically in corporate credit connecting to our Investment Banking franchise, as well as the mortgage product and in macro product such as structured rates, and certain electronified FX product, which we will appropriately resource. Even closer integration with equities and banking within Institutional Securities, and in partnership with Wealth Management against our core client base, will allow us to enhance asset velocity and ultimately optimize wallet. Now let\u2019s turn to expense discipline, beginning on Slide 12. As a management team, our number priority is to control what we can control given market realities. In ISG, we previously set our compensation target of 39%, and finished the year at approximately 37%, partly a function of having fewer employees to support the business. We intend to stay at or below 37% in ISG and have also said 2017 targets for Wealth Management and Investment Management. Turning to Slide 13. In addition to our focus on compensation discipline, we have launched a major company-wide initiative called Project Streamline, an effort lead by our CFO Jon Pruzan, and COO Jim Rosenthal, which is designed to identify and implement significant infrastructure expense reductions by the end of 2017. Some of these initiatives are shown here. Now is the time to tackle head-on our infrastructure costs and maximize low-cost deployment of talent. We have too many legal entities, too much duplication of operations and processes, and too many employees based in high-cost centers doing work that can sensibly be done in lower cost centers. You will hear a lot more about Project Streamline in the coming quarters. The combination of these efforts will enable us to meaningfully improve our efficiency ratio as shown on Slide 14. Our target expense ratio ex-DVA in 2015 was 79% and we ended the year 77%. Expense management is critically important. As such we have set a net target ratio of 74% in 2017, which translates into $1 billion in expense reductions over the next two years. In setting this efficiency ratio, we have assumed flat revenues for 2016 and 2017. To be clear, we do not expect the revenue environment to apply, especially given ongoing growth initiatives like Lending and Wealth Management; however, we believe this assumption is appropriately conservative. Now let\u2019s turn to Wealth Management on Slide 15. We continue to see strong high quality loan demand on our Wealth Management client base. We have significantly reduced client penetration and increase client penetration in security space lending and residential lending over the last three years, but we remain substantially underpenetrated relative to our peers. For example, only 1.9% of our clients have a mortgage loan through Morgan Stanley. Increased penetration of all loans will drive $20 billion of lending growth through 2017. A highly scalable business like Wealth Management enables us to add sources of revenue with lower compensation payouts such as net interest growth. Slide 16 aggregates the medium-term opportunities in Wealth Management. To provide granularity, we lay out three areas where we see obvious potential of margin improvement assuming stable markets. From today\u2019s level of 22%, we see margin potential of 23% to 25% in 2017 through one loan and deposit growth, two expense discipline, and three normal course of business growth. In addition, it\u2019s worth reminding investors that when we completed the Smith Barney transaction, we put in place a retention program that amortized over nine years. That amortization will be completed in January 2019 and will add an additional 150 basis points of margin. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 17. As I have said earlier, we believe we are sufficiently capitalized. Subject to regulatory approval, we intend to increase our payout to shareholders in the coming years just as we have done in the last four years. Let me now turn to Slide 18, the final slide. This sets forth ROE targets for 2017. Over the past several years, our returns have been depressed by very high litigation expenses in penalties. The need to build a strong capital base resulting in material capital growth every year. The cost of integration of the largest acquisition in wealth management history. The challenging fixed income markets against which we\u2019ve carried outsized capital levels. The restructuring of our merchant bank and of course the enormous cost in capital brought about by the post-crisis regulatory environment. We see the next several years very differently. We\u2019ve identified one $1 billion of tangible expense savings. We believe the bank strategy will be a significant driver of earnings growth in wealth management and for the firm. We expect equities and IBD to remain strong and grow revenues assuming global economic growth. And we believe Investment Management is now positioned for growth. Most importantly we believe our capital is strong and our ongoing balance sheet reductions will free up more capital for distribution or where that is not possible, reinvestment into our high return businesses. As a result, we\u2019re setting a 2017 ROE target of 9% to 11%. This assumes no material new capital requirements, no outside new litigation expenses or penalties and a global economy, that evidences growth not turmoil. Either way, in a flat revenue environment, we will reduce run-rate expenses by $1 billion on an annual basis beginning in 2017. Let me now turn to Jon, who\u2019ll briefly touch on the fourth quarter. Then together we would take all of your questions. Jon Pruzan : Thanks, James. Good morning. I will keep my comments brief, so we have ample time for Q&A. The fourth quarter of 2015 proved to be a continuation of the third quarter in many ways with mid-quarter volatility and macro concerns driving clients to the side lines after relatively constructive markets early in the quarter. In a volatile environment, we benefited from the strength of our equities, investment banking and wealth management businesses. Against this backdrop, revenues were $7.7 billion in the fourth quarter, or $7.9 billion excluding DVA, up 7% versus 3Q 2015. Non-interest expenses for the quarter were $6.3 billion. Our effective tax rate was 34.5% for the quarter, driven by our geographic mix of earnings throughout the year. For the full year 2015, our tax rate excluding the discrete tax benefits from the first quarter was 32.5%. Now to the businesses. In a challenging environment for some of our institutional security business, overall revenues ex-DVA were $3.5 billion, up 2% quarter-on-quarter. Non-interest expense was down 11% versus the third quarter. Compensation expenses were $1.2 billion down 7% quarter-over-quarter. Excluding DVA, the ISG compensation ratio was down for the quarter, which brought our full year ratio to 37%. Non-compensation expenses were $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 13% driven by lower litigation costs. In investment banking, continued strength in our M&A business and better performance in equity underwriting helped to offset weakness in debt underwriting. For the quarter, we generated $1.2 billion in revenues up 3% sequentially. Advisory revenues for the quarter were strong at $516 million, but down 7% from the post 2008 high we achieved last quarter. Turning to underwriting, equity underwriting revenues were $352 million up 41% versus the third quarter, primarily reflecting increases in IPOs. We continued to see pressure from volatility in fixed income underwriting volumes and revenues were $346 million, down 7% versus the third quarter, driven by decreases in loan fees partially offset by investment grade bond fees. The fourth quarter was a continuation of the strength we have seen all year in equity sales and trading as clients remained active and we delivered across products and regions in a volatile market. Ex-DVA, revenues for the quarter were $1.8 billion up 3% sequentially. For the quarter, cash equity revenues were higher versus comparable quarters, as we gained share across regions. Our prime brokerage business continued to demonstrate leadership, with revenues up quarter-over-quarter as we stayed closely engaged with our clients. Derivative revenues were down quarter-over-quarter against challenging market conditions but up year-over-year. Fixed income and commodity sales and trading continue to under-perform in a difficult environment, characterized by spread widening in various products and lower levels of client activity. For the quarter revenues were $550 million, excluding DVA, down 6% versus the third quarter. Revenues in securitized products and credit continued to be negatively impacted by the environment. Rates revenues in the quarter were up sequentially, while FX was down driven by lower market volatility and lower client engagement. Commodity results were down quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by our oil merchanting business. We closed the sale of this business on November 1. Given the sale of our two large physical oil businesses, we would expect to see less seasonality in our first quarter FIC results going forward. Lastly, average trading VaR for the quarter was $46 million, down from $53 million last quarter, driven by a reduction in interest rates and credits spread as well as commodities. In our wealth management business, we continue to see steadiness, for the quarter and for the full-year 2015, we saw average revenues per day of approximately $60 million with no day below $50 million. Revenues for the quarter were $3.8 billion, excluding the impact of differed compensation plan investments in both periods revenues were approximately flat sequentially. In the quarter, we continued to benefit from our deposit deployment strategy with net interest income increasing 4% from fourth \u2013 third quarter and full-year net interest income of $3 billion up 26%. Funded lending balances in wealth management grew approximately $3 billion or 6% during the quarter and $12 billion or 31% year-over-year. Growth in NII helped offset some of the quarter\u2019s headwinds including the 5% decline in asset management revenues, which was a function of the third quarter\u2019s lower S&P level. We continued to see muted overall activity in transactional revenues, excluding the impact of DCP. On the expense side, compensation was up 6% quarter-over-quarter due largely to the offsetting impact of the expense associated with DCP investment James mentioned earlier. Non-compensation expenses were up 6% driven by typical 4Q seasonality. Our PBT margin for the quarter was 21% ex-severance down slightly versus 3Q 2015 though up year on year. For the full-year, PBT margin was 22% in wealth management. Deposits in our bank deposit program were $149 billion at year-end up $10 billion versus the third quarter reflecting normal seasonality in deposits as well as client\u2019s moving to cash in a volatile market. And in Investment Management revenues were $621 million up significantly quarter-over-quarter driven by traditional asset management, which was up 5% as well as stronger performance in merchant banking and real estate investing, where revenues were $211 million versus a loss in the third quarter. Performance in Investment Management will be impacted by the market levels and back drop. So far this quarter market industries around globe are down with many off to their worse start in history. If they remain down through the rest of the quarter we will see an impact in Investment Management performance, particular in our private investing businesses. Now turning to the balance sheet, total assets were $788 billion at December 31 down from $834 billion at the end of the third quarter. Average balance sheet was $814 billion down from $827 billion in 3Q as clients moved to the sidelines and activity slowed, particular in the second half of the quarter. Our global liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $203 billion, compared with a $191 billion at the end of the third quarter driven by typical seasonality in deposits. Pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $397 billion, down from $434 billion in the third quarter driven by reductions in market RWAs in a slower client environment. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 19 million shares, and our Board declared a $0.15 dividend per share. For the full-year, we repurchased $2.1 billion of common stock or 59 million shares.  Turning to outlook, in the first two weeks, we have seen a significant rise in volatility across market and asset classes and an intense focus on the China economy, market and currency as well as declining oil prices. We have had a reasonable start in sales and trading, as clients have been engaged as they try and navigate this period of volatility and keep their risk positions close to home. M&A has remained active. We are cautious however, as prolonged volatility is not conducive to M&A activity. The underwriting calendar has been challenged. The capital market\u2019s pipeline is healthy, but market volatility could delay new issues coming to market. And on the retail side, clients remain cautious. It\u2019s way too early to predict how the rest of the quarter unfolds and we are tightly managing our risk positions along with our clients. With that, we will open the line to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. James Gorman : [Indiscernible] Brennan Hawken : Just a quick one on the reduction, it\u2019s actually not a quick one. On [indiscernible] RWA and FIC that you laid out in the deck. So what should we think about as far as timing, obviously you laid out the year-end 2017? But is there a way to think about the curve over the next two years, as we progress. And how should we think about the revenue that would be tied to that capital and how it might be recycled throughout the organization if not returned to shareholders. James Gorman : Good opener, Brennan. Let me start by saying first, we\u2019ve laid out RWA targets, so there \u2013 for I think the last three years and going back I still remember a number like $392 billion or there about in around the third quarter of 2011 in FIC. So we are light years from that. And last year, we thought we had achieved $180 billion and as you can see, we ended materially lower than that.  On the exact timing of year-end and the trajectory year-end 2017, I can\u2019t really help you. We\u2019re going to do it opportunistically. We\u2019ll do with sort of minimum damage. We don\u2019t want to get rid of assets on a distressed basis. We have some natural roll off. So we feel very comfortable with these targets. And it\u2019s fair to say we haven\u2019t disappointed in the last few years. That hasn\u2019t been an issue in FIC.  As it relates to the capital with just arithmetically, if you run these numbers through the models, it does actually free up that much capital. It just means the business doesn\u2019t need that capital. Our view is that we were overcapitalized that our balance sheet was too big in the business given the revenue and business opportunity. We now \u2013 and we were over expensed frankly by taking out 25% of the head count and with that the expenses on compensation, the project streamline that would now work on some of the infrastructure pieces by now reducing the RWAs and the SLR Exposure. We will reduce the amount of capital tied up in that business. How that is redeployed is a really good question. Obviously, overtime we expect, we\u2019ll deliver that back to shareholder. That\u2019s the current plan. We don\u2019t control all of the pieces of that plan. We are a regulated institution. We have been through CCAR or SCAR I think five times. And every time we\u2019ve asked for a buyback or dividend. Our request has been met. It\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019ll continue to ask for buybacks and dividends. And where we can\u2019t use that capital if it\u2019s sort of track capital for some period of time which some of it maybe. There are clearly other businesses that can use the capital sensibly. We have very high return businesses in both Investment Management and Wealth Management. Clearly, we can use the capital to support our growth in those businesses. As indeed we have had very high returns in our equity franchise. So I don\u2019t know, is that helpful? But it\u2019s hard to lay out a more specific timeline for the balance sheet now that be already runoff than what we\u2019ve given here with the instate and with the year-end 2017. Brennan Hawken : That\u2019s fair, that\u2019s fair. Thanks, James. I guess is there any way that we could think about revenue or you could maybe help us to frame how to think about revenue, because obviously if you are going to take that much capital out, right. You are going to have a very different business. You talked about focusing on some of the strengths a few business lines maybe you could help us think about which businesses you are going to be deemphasizing and how much revenue you think realistically could come out as a result of that. And then finally, how that translates into margin for the business overall. James Gorman : Well, I don\u2019t think I can give you the margin translation at this point. And let me address some of the other issues and then I\u2019m sure, Jon may want to add to it and you\u2019ll be hearing a lot more from Ted on the leadership team, probably in the first quarter, one of the investment conferences. I think the basic position we are in was we had more balance sheet and more capital in the business than we were generating revenues on. So we don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be great revenue diminution from this point given where we finished 2015, which frankly as we said we are very candid that was disappointing. What we\u2019re doing is reducing the path of fixed income, where frankly we didn\u2019t see the revenue opportunity over the last 12 and 24 months. We\u2019ve always said as we said on the call we\u2019ve always had a good micro business, a good credit business that remains good. We\u2019ve been very good in the more sophisticated structure rates. We\u2019re reducing obviously our exposure and liquid rates. We\u2019ve never been a major FX trader and we\u2019ve focused on the major currencies there, not the not the non-G10 currencies. And then, regionally we sort of picked our shots through distressed and high yield in various other places around the globe where we think we need to be overemphasized relative to under. The net of it will be more of a U.S.-focused business, a slimmer business when it comes to some of the macro products. I don\u2019t know John if you want to add at this point anymore details on that. Jon Pruzan : Yes, the one thing I would add is just to give you a better sense of some of the things we are getting out of as James mentioned, most of that is not in the U.S. Things like sovereign CDS, some of the non-core European currencies, Asia distressed trading, some of the bespoke [ph] correlation products as well as all of the work we\u2019ve done on our commodities business in terms of the oil merchanting businesses as well as the announcement regarding our European power and gas last year. So a smaller footprint, less capital, less expenses and better margin. Brennan Hawken : Okay, great. James Gorman : And on a personal note, Brennan have to apologize I\u2019ve called you Brendan, I think, three earnings calls in a row, so my apologies. Brennan Hawken : No worries, James, that\u2019s all right I\u2019ve been called worse. And then finally another one here real quick. When we think about your ROE goal, right ultimately which you referenced early on in the deck many times as 10% and then, we think about 2017 showing the 9% to 11%, can you maybe square how that\u2019s a little bit different, just is it that the transition may not be complete by 2017. How is it we should think about that? James Gorman : You know, our goal remains to achieve returns above our cost of capital. Clearly whether our cost of capital is actually 10% right now, but let\u2019s take that for granted for the moment. Our goal is to achieve returns above that. Clearly we can\u2019t be that precise, I mean, this is a highly variable set of revenues that we have in these businesses as we are seeing in the markets today versus Friday, for example. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re expressing it as a range but you\u2019ll note the mid point of that range is indeed 10%. We aren\u2019t backing off of the goals, in fact for the first time we\u2019ve put a timeline against it and as we laid out what the key drivers of that. Obviously, it\u2019s with the appropriate caveat which you would expect if we have a major outsized litigation expense or penalties that are unforeseen if the markets completely collapse here if we have no revenue growth, if the Fed responded very differently to our capital plans than what we intended it gets harder. On the other side if we have stronger revenue growth, we meet our expense targets, we do our capital plan, we\u2019re confident about, certainly about the range and our target is the mid point of that range. Brennan Hawken : That\u2019s fair enough. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. James Gorman : Sure. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. I guess the follow-up on FICC. Just curious what you think the net of all of the moves might be in terms of how you think about your G-SIB buffer and then how it might factor in just in general to your ability to return that excess capital. I heard your comments about redeploying if you aren\u2019t allowed but it seems like your RWA reduction and then the costs that go along with it is kind of what builds the buffer but just curious to get some detail on that. James Gorman : In thinking about capital, I mean, problem number one is having enough capital. At 4.2 supplemental leverage ratio which was just I think the beginning of 2014. I\u2019m looking John is nodding 2014, clearly we weren\u2019t there. So problem number one has been solved we\u2019ve clearly got enough capital on any metric that you measure. Problem number two is then if you continue to accrete capital what is the sensible buyback dividend and total payout ratio that you\u2019ve put against that. And then opportunity number three is as you reshape the business mix and move to a less capital intensive parts of the business, you by definition are throwing off more capital than you\u2019ve had the day before you did that, what are you able to do with that capital? As to refer to Brennan\u2019s question this isn\u2019t going to happen tomorrow, Glenn, it\u2019s going to happen over as we said a couple of years so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to have a pool of capital to give back tomorrow. But we\u2019re setting ourselves up for increasing returns over the next several years at the same time let\u2019s make investments across the rest of the business.  So I don\u2019t know if that helps you, but where it relates to G-SIB buffer, we know what our buffer is. What we don\u2019t know is how the Federal Reserve through the CCAR process is adjusting its models once they put the CCAR buffer in my understanding is there will be adjustments to the models which will tamper that buffer to create a net number which is lower than the buffer for all of the banks. That\u2019s my current understanding. Obviously we have to see that play out. My understanding is the Federal Reserve had models which were by definition harder than they probably would have had in normal circumstance but that was driven by not having the G-SIB buffer put in place. Now that it\u2019s in place the models will be refined and the net impact is what we will be looking at. So the combined net impact of the G-SIB buffer with these capital reductions from the balance sheet with the amount of capital we are a accreting, we still accrete capital last year gives us a reasonably high degree of confidence that we\u2019re going to be seeing increasing capital returns in the years ahead. Glenn Schorr : From your lips, all right, just a follow-up on a quickie one on the corporate loan commitments, if you could give any color about the total or the funded loan book, how much of its energy reserves against that? How are you feeling about that book in general. James Gorman : In general, on the corporate loan book, I think, the focus areas have really been around energy and probably event, particularly in the single-B market. We have seen, on the energy complex we have seen credit migration in that portfolio and as a result, Glenn we\u2019ve increased our allowances. We seen an increase in some negative marks that we take through our \u2013 income statement, as well as increasing our hedges. And we would expect that pressure on that portfolio to persist for awhile. In terms of the total size of the portfolio, it\u2019s about $16 billion of both funded and unfunded, this is energy now. That\u2019s down from $17 billion in the third quarter. Of that $16 billion, I would say 60% is investment grade, or excuse me it\u2019s to investment grade counter parties and only about 30% of that $16 billion is funded. Another focus area within the energy portfolio has really been around E&P. In terms of our statistics that portfolio is about $4.4 billion broken down, $1.7 of that is funded to non-investment grade borrowers and about $2.7 billion is still unfunded. That unfunded piece is about two-thirds to investment grade borrowers. In terms of the reserves and the allowances remember of the $16 billion total energy book approximately 60% of that is held for investment, while 40% is fair value or held for sale. That other portion is mark-to-market and primarily flows through our other revenue line in the ISG in terms of the income statement and has been marked to the current environment. We will continue to monitor that portfolio very closely. We regularly stress test it. We\u2019re watching for signs of contagion and we\u2019re hedging accordingly and adjusting our hedges accordingly. So I think that\u2019s the color on the energy exposures. On the event again it\u2019s been we\u2019ve seen disruption in that marketplace since August. It\u2019s primarily been focused in the single B part of the market. We have had a handful of loans that got caught in that dislocation and downdraft but again, it is only a handful of loans, a few of which we distributed in the fourth quarter and a few of which we still hold. The losses related to both the syndicated loans as well as the ones that we still hold are also reflected in our fourth quarter results. The double-B and investment grade markets held in pretty well, although the pricing has widened. We see investors wanting to put capital to work in that market but they are being more selective. They are looking at higher quality names and extracting larger new issue concessions, but in terms of outlook we continue to under write new commitments predominantly in the double-B space and the investment grade space and that reflects the current environment. So again, those two areas of energy and event we\u2019ve been highly focused on and containing and managing that position as best we can. Outside of that we haven\u2019t really seen much contagion. Wealth management book still stays and looks pretty good. It remains stable, strong credit quality no real changes in those metrics, commercial real estate portfolio also haven\u2019t seen real signs of weakness. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thanks for that, a lot of detail. Good. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Guy Moszkowski : Good morning. Just to follow-up and stay on the topic of corporate credit. And more broadly then the sort of energy E&P type stuff that you talked about where you gave good color. In your experience what are the leading indicators of credit deterioration that you drilled down on broadly away from energy and the commodities [indiscernible], how are they looking right now and is there any reason that you can think of as to why this would be different this time? James Gorman : It\u2019s a good question in terms of relative and historical performance. I think we\u2019ve obviously been in a very benign credit environment for awhile. We are starting to see some pressure in the energy complex as I said across the other metrics, particularly for us given the health of our customer base. In the retail side we haven\u2019t seen much stress in those areas. We are increasing the allowance for loan losses, this quarter it\u2019s up to about $70 million, clearly a portion which is energy. So we are seeing a churn in the credit cycle. But again from our book in the way that we look at it, it\u2019s really been focused in, on the on the energy complex right now. Guy Moszkowski : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up question on wealth management. Looking at your Slide 16, the net interest income growth in a range of 75 basis points to 175 basis points of margin contribution, if \u2013 I think you\u2019ll remember that you\u2019ve baked in the forward curve to those assumptions. So where would we be in terms of that range if short-term interest rates stay where they are currently as opposed to actually incorporating the forward curve? James Gorman : I think the right way to think about that, those numbers, I would say, do not require any incremental rise in rates from where we are today. If the forward curve is realized, we will get some incremental benefit, but those margin targets don\u2019t require incremental rate movements. They do require growth in loans that we laid out on the prior page and we\u2019ve had very good momentum in that lending book but it doesn\u2019t require the forward curve to hit those margin targets. Guy Moszkowski : Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead Christian Bolu : Good morning. James Gorman : Good morning. Christian Bolu : So my first question is on the $1 billion cost saves. I\u2019m just trying to gauge what\u2019s incremental versus just rule off one-time as in 2015. So I guess the first question is how much litigation and severance costs did you incur in 2015? And then two, of that $1 billion in cost saves how much of that is roll off of the 2015 litigation and severance cost versus incremental business rationalization? Jon Pruzan : Again of that, $1 billion as James mentioned, that assumes no individual one time significant charges. There\u2019s obviously an element of litigation that\u2019s part of our business. We were happy to see the litigation expense go down in the fourth quarter, but in terms of breaking out those individual numbers, we have historically not done that but again it\u2019s \u2013 it does require no major single individual event. Christian Bolu : Okay, just so I\u2019m clear, because I think you put out the numbers in your Qs of just about $500 million of litigation costs through the third quarter and about $150 million in severance, so that\u2019s close to $700 million in cost\u2026 James Gorman : I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t understand the question. I apologize so again the $550 million number you\u2019re referencing was in the third quarter year-to-date as I said our litigation came down materially in the fourth quarter and the severance of the $150 million was across the firm in the fourth quarter, presumably we won\u2019t have the same level of severance so part of that severance would be embedded in that billion dollars. Christian Bolu : Okay, so what about the litigation are you assuming it\u2019s roughly the same going forward or you assume it comes down from that at least $555 million we had as of the third quarter. James Gorman : Yes, I think we believe that the most significant items related to the credit crisis are largely behind us. This quarter it was good to see litigation come down and so I think there is an embedded assumption along those lines but again it\u2019s a lumpy and unpredictable line item. Christian Bolu : Okay. And then my follow-up just on the lending \u2013 on balances I\u2019m just trying to reconcile the current target versus the prior target so you had \u2013 you expected $180 billion in total U.S. Bank assets by the end of 2016. Does that still stand and then how do we think of 2017? Jon Pruzan : In terms of the \u2013 what I would say is the slide in the deck is only in the wealth management segment so it\u2019s not a total lends on the bank. We\u2019ll be coming back to you with more detail throughout the year but in terms of the 2016 number that loan growth that you see out of wealth management would be consistent with those targets. Christian Bolu : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. James Gorman : Good morning. Steven Chubak : So, I appreciate the detailed guidance certainly as part of the broader strategic review. It\u2019s always quite helpful to us but some of the early feedback that I just wanted to relay suggests that there\u2019s investors are struggling and quite candidly we\u2019re struggling to reconcile the [indiscernible] to 9% to 11% ROE versus some of the different guidance components. And if we think about a backdrop where there\u2019s 4% annual revenue growth, a 74% efficiency ratio, 32% tax rate, and flat preferreds and non-controlling interest, it gets to you about $6 billion of net income to common and if I even take just the low end of that 9% to 11% ROE range, the implied common equity is about $66 billion which suggests payouts in excess of 100% over the next two years. So I just wanted to get an understanding as to of what elements or components of that analysis might be flawed or needs to be tweaked and how should we \u2013 and what capital return assumptions are embedded in that 9% to 11% ROE target range that you highlighted for 2017? Jon Pruzan : Let me try to take a swing at this one. So as we laid out on the page, first of all the compensation, the billion dollars plus of compensation and non-comp savings are assuming a flat revenue environment so if we get out two years and we\u2019re flat to today our ratio will be 74%. As James mentioned we do expect revenue growth throughout this period and therefore the efficiency ratio should be lower than the 74% because we do have operating leverage in the business. First and foremost, and so I think that is probably the biggest disconnect in your math. You can see in the revenue bucket or the modest revenue growth bucket we do have improvements in different business segments. And then in terms of the capital base, ideally, we believe we have sufficient capital, we had been accreting capital over the course of the last several years. We would expect to probably accrete a little bit more capital over the coming period. But we would like to try to slow \u2013 clearly slowdown the accretion of capital since we have \u2013 we believe we have the appropriate amount of capital for our current plan. Steven Chubak : Okay, thanks. And Jonathan, I think you spend a lot of time talking about capital and obviously it\u2019s going to be contingent on the feedback you get from regulators and presumably they would be inclined or incentivized to reward actions to reduce your systemic risk footprint or exposure system with more risk intensive activities, based on your discussions have you been given any indication that they would be perceptive to higher payouts for those that are willing to shrink more aggressively in those areas. James Gorman : I don\u2019t want to get ahead of predicting how regulators are going to think about this. We did what we think is right for our business. Our job is to generate returns to our business; however, arithmetically if you have met all of the capital targets by definition, if you change the structure of your business and throw off additional capital that you know by definition don\u2019t need that all will be available for returns. Do I think that there is going to be one-time major dividend in the next 12, 18 months. No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible but do I believe that we\u2019re going to be in a position where we increase our returns, absolutely. And you\u2019ve seen banks that have generated payouts above 100% for this reason, for that they are accreting more capital than they need for their business. That\u2019s before you get to banks that have actually restructured their business in the phase of the new business reality. So again I don\u2019t want to get ahead of them \u2013 that would not be a smart thing to do but I do think our strategy is pretty clear and it\u2019s certainly consistent with where the regulatory push has been. Steven Chubak : Right, that\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate you taking my questions. James Gorman : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi, your 9% to 11% ROE target, you have a timeframe on that for the first time ever, I appreciate it. But what is that on a tangible ROE basis? James Gorman : Mike, we\u2019ve got about little over $9.5 billion of goodwill and intangibles, so on our capital base, somewhere around 125 basis points, above those numbers just math. Mike Mayo : All right, so the target on a tangible basis is 10% to 12%? Jon Pruzan : We have an ROE target of 9% to 11%. Mike Mayo : Okay. Jon Pruzan : For all of our common equity. Mike Mayo : And what\u2019s the need behind this target, I mean is it just a target that sits there or is management paid off this? What\u2019s the follow through from this target to the organization? James Gorman : Not totally sure, I understand your question. All of our employees are bonus eligible paid in stock. The stock is generally performed somewhere in line with ROE and price to book so everybody is affected by that. The most senior management team I receive as part of their compensation performance units which are directly affected too by ROE and total shareholder return so that\u2019s very specific for the senior team. But we are not doing this to frankly drive up our personal comp. We\u2019re doing it because we think these businesses should be run with returns at or above 10% and nobody in this world predicted the last four or five years of what\u2019s gone in the markets and the amount of capital that would be required to support these businesses when I took this job our capital base was $40 billion, today it\u2019s $69 billion. We\u2019re in a tremendous E position and the challenge has been to get the R moving consistent with that rate of growth of the E. And what we\u2019ve done here is to frame it for investors because understandably they want to know what is a realistic timeframe just to Steven\u2019s question before what is a realistic timeframe, how do the pieces add up mathematically, to get you there. Are they believable, are they plausible and we thought it might going to be smart to layout what we think is a realistic timeframe that kind of range 9% to 11% 2017, the pieces are we are definitely taking out expenses, some of them are in the bag, if you will. And some of them are going to be driven by management processes that we put in place. We believe there is revenue growth across many parts of our business over a two year period and we believe we are sufficiently capitalized given the world that we operate in so if you add all those pieces together putting it in terms of a target to help investors have a framework rather than open ended seem to be the right transition point for Morgan Stanley. In the last several years we couldn\u2019t have done that because we couldn\u2019t address some of the issues on the right hand side of that slide. Mike Mayo : As a follow-up Slide 13, you addressed compensation by each of the three main business areas, but you didn\u2019t give any meat on the non-comp expenses. Can you just elaborate on any specifics there? James Gorman : I\u2019m sorry. Say that again. We addressed the compensation we didn\u2019t give meat on what? Mike Mayo : On the non-comp Slide 13, location strategy, leverage technology, consolidated processes, outsourcing. What sort of expense savings could you get from the non-comp areas? James Gorman : Well, I think what we wanted to frame was the total comp ratio. I\u2019m sorry the total efficiency ratio of 74% and embedded in that was $1 billion of expense savings, which will be function of comp and non-comp. We\u2019re not going to break those out in detail on this call, we are very confident about that as we\u2019re referencing with Steve and there a number of these things, which obviously just go away through reality like the severance costs. There is the elevated legal expenses we\u2019ve carried in the last several years, which we think is unlikely to be carried forward. There is the restructuring we did which frankly just changes the run rate of your salaries benefits, medical and the bonus pool for those individuals, and we\u2019ve already initiated a major effort under this project streamline and some of those pieces begin this week. We started with changing our so-called contingent employees or our consultants in far away markets where we\u2019ve achieved the objective of what that would be put to work. We\u2019ve now reduced some of those numbers. And all of those efforts are coming together. So you\u2019ll see a mix of \u2013 and over the next several quarters we\u2019ll give you much more details on the non-comp. So we\u2019re not going to break it out now. Mike Mayo : And then lastly any big restructuring or repositioning charge related to project streamline. James Gorman : No. No. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. James Gorman : Certainly not that\u2019s visible at this point not that\u2019s planned. Mike Mayo : Thanks. James Gorman : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Thanks guys. James, just on the FIC side of the business, post restructuring, I know it\u2019s tough to gauge but when you mentioned and you look at the revenue environment and kind of where your run rate now, you wouldn\u2019t expect much of a drop-off. Just wanted to understand is that relative to like the second half of 2015, like total 2015 or is there any way to gauge it from like a return on asset like what you expect in FIC going forward? James Gorman : No, I think of that in terms of the full year, obviously the second half but our revenue run rates of $500 million were incredibly low. But we look what the total market size is what our share is, and what our expected share is, and expected market size in the next couple of years and that\u2019s why we say we believe we\u2019re right-sized for revenue rate equivalent to 2015. We obviously \u2013 we\u2019ll be trying to do a lot better than that but we think that\u2019s a plausible outlook. Michael Carrier : Okay, all right. That\u2019s helpful. And then Jon, just on the \u2013 I guess you mentioned like with the weak markets some of the impact that you can see in investment management. So I guess just two things on that. Last quarter we saw that kind of negative accrual I think on the Asia private equity your Merchant Banking fund [ph], just what type of exposure unit in the investment management business have \u2013 those types of products so we can see those swings. And then in wealth management I feel like the transaction revenues have been pretty weak for a while and that\u2019s more of an industry trend but just wanted to figure out are we stabilizing here, meaning are there pressures there somewhat coming to a slowdown? Jon Pruzan : Sure, a couple of questions. I think on the investment management question the way I would try to think about it is there basically two major components of how we make business in that \u2013 how we make money in that business, one is just our fee revenues from managing money. And obviously that\u2019s going to be a rate \u2013 that\u2019s a rate times volume equation. So if the amount of money we\u2019re managing goes down that will be impacted by the markets that we\u2019re seeing but that outline is pretty stable. The second line as you said is the investment line. When I refer to the investment line I\u2019m talking about the segment reporting we do in our supplement, that number was negative $235 million last quarter we said that was predominately driven by our reversal of carry in our Asia PE fund or funds. This quarter it was $100 million that return to a positive number was driven by all of our \u2013 most of our investing businesses both private equity infrastructure and real estate that was more balanced. We said in the third quarter when we took the reversal of carry that that eliminated the vast majority \u2013 excuse me, the majority of the carry that we have accrued in our Asia PE businesses we obviously have a carry accrued in other businesses. And that\u2019s disclosed in the queue but the exposure at certainly in Asia has been reduced and the fund that was under stress in the third quarter had no material changes, had no material changes this quarter. That was the first part of your question. I think, the second on transactional revenues. Those numbers have been subdued. Clients are cautious, whether that\u2019s a floor or not is hard to tell given the volatility, but we think that those numbers hopefully have stabilized. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Matt Burnell : Good morning, thanks for taking my question. First of all, maybe for you, Jon on page 3 of the supplement, you break out the regional revenues, looks like if we don\u2019t adjust for DVA, the revenues are basically flat in the Americas up double-digit in EMEA and up high single-digit in Asia. How are you thinking about those \u2013 that revenue mix heading into 2016 given all your comments about some of the challenges emanating out of China and some of the growth challenges in Europe? Jon Pruzan : I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just turning to page 3. Before getting that page in front of me, I think the results this quarter, we did see Asia was down, but it continues to be a strong and important part of our business. We did see weakness in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter in Europe given the concerns and uncertainty around Brexit and some of the immigration issues, we still think that Europe although showing some signs of growth in certain areas, is going to be a fragile economy and the drivers of our business will be the U.S. and Asia. In terms of the third \u2013 page 3, again, don\u2019t have in front of me. Just this minute, but that you should also know is managed, the way we look at the business is on a managed basis, and so those revenues don\u2019t necessarily tied back to the tax rate that I talked about earlier regarding the geographic mix of earnings. Matt Burnell : Okay, thank you, and then a little closer to home, how are you thinking, it seems that you\u2019re assuming that lending both in the corporate side of things, as well as Within Wealth Management is going to continue at what appears to be roughly similar growth rate as you saw this year. But I guess I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about what appears to be a greater level of regulatory scrutiny both in areas like leverage lending, but also in commercial real estate which seem \u2013 which where you\u2019ve grown quite visibly over the last two years to three years as you\u2019ve pushed on your bank growth program. Jon Pruzan : So, Matt, I\u2019m not sure, I wouldn\u2019t agree with that statement, I think historically over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve seen good growth in both the ISG lending product as well as the Wealth Management lending product and those have been the key drivers along with deploying our deposits away from securities into these loans. Those have been the key drivers of the NII growth historically. I think going forward I would tell you that the primary driver of the lending growth is going to be Wealth Management. The growth assumptions in the ISG part of the business are much lower than they had been over the last couple of years as we built those portfolios up. So the key driver is going to be Wealth Management area. Matt Burnell : Okay. And then just ripping on that theme, James, you mentioned less than 2% of your Wealth Management clients have a mortgage with Morgan Stanley. What\u2019s your target over the next two years to get that ratio to? James Gorman : I don\u2019t have a target here. We could break out sort of mathematically how it separates and get back to, but I don\u2019t have a target off the top of my head. Obviously, it\u2019s very low single-digit, it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not in the \u2013 about 10%. You can see the numbers on the chart which just show mathematically what the total residential lending is $21 billion, up from $16 billion. So I guess that would imply we did about 2.4%. Matt Burnell : Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Devin Ryan : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. When we think about the 3% to 5% revenue growth with ROE target, yes, some items like NII should increase without the backdrop changing and hopefully will be above that. So on the other hand, investment banking has been operating at a high level as you highlighted, a choppy market could impact those businesses. So just thinking about, what type of investment banking revenues or environment during that 3% to 5% revenue growth, and sounds like you guys are a little more cautious on the near-term there. So is that fair? And then and how do you think about those businesses broadly relative to their cycle? Jon Pruzan : Sure, I think first I\u2019d highlighted that 2017 over the target I think. As you say the Wealth Management is being really driven by the lending growth and some of the other initiatives we have there. In terms of both equities and investment banking, listen, we think that we can continue to gain some share there. We have good shares in those businesses, but the backdrop is a constructive one, where the revenue pools are up modestly if we\u2019re in a situation where revenue pools for these products decline precipitously, these are \u2013 that\u2019s not just the backdrop that we set these assumptions. So a little bit of share gain and a little bit of revenue or pie growth. Devin Ryan : Okay, great, helpful. And then just within the Wealth Management comp target that improvement to less than 56%, is that and entirely driven by leverage off of higher margin revenues like NII or are there other core comp expense reductions that they can occur within GWN, the GWN that we should be thinking about? Jon Pruzan : Yes, I think it\u2019s a mix. I mean, clearly more a non-compensable revenues is helpful for that target. But as we\u2019ve said from a \u2013 for the totality of the firm, we are very focused on expenses and comp and there are some other levers that we can use here other than just the growing non-compensable line item. Devin Ryan : Okay. Thank you very much. James Gorman : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Chris Kotowski : Hi, yes, good morning. You\u2019ve mentioned how much you\u2019ve bought the fixed income RWAs down from $390 million to like $188 million at the end of last year and down to $136 million now. And I know you can\u2019t comment about this year\u2019s CCAR, but I guess, it just strikes me that given the huge progress you\u2019ve made on bringing down the fixed RWAs, it doesn\u2019t seem like the CCAR process got \u2013 was mitigated somehow. And I wonder if you can talk in a general way again not about this year\u2019s submission, but to what extent is \u2013 are the adverse CCAR results driven by the fixed income businesses or is it throughout the business. And in a \u2013 if the CCAR process this year were static with last year, would the reduction in RWAs that we\u2019ve seen this year have a positive impact on CCAR? James Gorman : Well, I can take out and Jon may want to add something. CCAR is a function, there are five different ratios under the normal scenario and then the severely adverse scenario, where we had an issue to the extent we did was on the total leverage ratio which we addressed with the top preferred securities. So I think was \u2013 CCAR was submitted last November, December I think. Jon Pruzan : January. James Gorman : The cycle got moved down this year, an extra three months to April. So the world we\u2019re in 15 months ago, our RWAs were significantly higher. They weren\u2019t where we finished the year at. So it\u2019s sort of an apples and oranges back then, we presented the firm as it was then. This April we\u2019ll be presenting a different firm, although there are various cutoff dates when balance sheet are set and so on. So I don\u2019t really want to get into and I know you didn\u2019t ask for a specific prediction on CCAR, but all we can do is put ourselves in a position where it\u2019s clear we have sufficient capital and any incremental changes we make to the business or any incremental earnings that we accrete by definition become excess capital, whether that flows on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Obviously, it\u2019s something to be considered, when we submit our thing in here from our regulators. Chris Kotowski : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead. Fiona Swaffield : Hi. Just had two areas. One was, you talked about funding benefits, I think it\u2019s $0.4 at the beginning, tailwind from now funding cost. I just wondered if you could talk a bit more about how much that was for 2015 and also where we would see it because I didn\u2019t notice the net interest income in IS was very strong in Q4. I didn\u2019t know if that\u2019s related, so if you could talk about that. And then the last area was really on Slide 16, on the deposit assumptions. I have thought that there was a big strategy to increase the deposits. I think I had a number in my head of $200 billion. Has that changed or is it that \u2013 just that you\u2019re not putting that or you\u2019re assuming there\u2019s a length within your 2017 kind of roll forward? Thanks. Jon Pruzan : Okay. so the \u2013 Fiona, the two parts of the question, I think on the funding question, there\u2019s obviously a lot of components that go into those lines including the size of our balance sheet, secured versus unsecured. What we said, just to give you some \u2013 to try to cuff it we did about $21 billion of new unsecured last year and those came in at rates that were significantly below where the historical debt had been issued, our average maturity or WAM on our unsecured stack now is about six years. So, we were sort of retiring five year debt and putting on slightly longer, but we saw our credit spreads were easily 100 tighter than where they were before. That process went out through \u2013 that process went on throughout the year. We obviously didn\u2019t refinance all of the debt on day one. So, we will continue to get the benefit from those funding savings as we annualize. And so that, I think addresses question number one. And question number two on the deposits, we will continue to grow our deposit base. I think what we would like to try to do this year and 2016, is try to optimize the deposits. We have different deposits that have different liquidity values. We think we can support the lending growth that we\u2019ve highlighted in the strategy \u2013 excuse me, in the strategy deck without growing our deposit base, but clearly that is a goal, and in 2017 that will be requirement to support our future lending growth. We\u2019ve talked about some of the digital strategy and cash management product that are \u2013 we\u2019re growing out, and that will support \u2013 that will hopefully drive the deposit growth in 2017 and beyond. Fiona Swaffield : Thanks. Can I just go back to the first thing, and what the explanation of net internet income in IS? Is quarter-on-quarter? Jon Pruzan : I\u2019m sorry\u2026 Fiona Swaffield : Institutional Securities? Jon Pruzan : Again, I\u2019ll come back to you on that one, Fiona. Fiona Swaffield : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over for any closing remarks. James Gorman : Now I think we have \u2013 this is probably our longest call. I\u2019m glad we got everybody\u2019s questions in and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of the first quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

LLC Operator : Good morning. My name is Chris and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Eaton Vance Corp First Fiscal Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Dan Cataldo, Treasurer. You may begin your conference. Daniel C. Cataldo - Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Thank you and good morning and welcome to our 2016 fiscal first quarter earnings call and webcast. Joining me this morning are Tom Faust, Chairman and CEO of Eaton Vance; and Laurie Hylton, our CFO. We will first comment on the quarter and then we will take your questions. The full earnings release and charts we will refer to during the call are available on our website, eatonvance.com, under the heading Press Releases. Today's presentation contains forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainties in our business, including but not limited to those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings, including our 2015 Annual Report and 10-K, are available on our website or on request at no charge. I'll now turn the call over to Tom. Thomas E. Faust - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. In our first quarter, we were reminded once again that the business of investing exposes both clients and investment managers to market risk. Over the course of the quarter, market price declines lowered our managed assets by $14.1 billion or 5% more than offsetting the quarter's $5.3 billion of consolidated net inflows. Principally reflecting adverse market effects, our first quarter revenue fell 7% from the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and 3% sequentially. Lower revenue combined with substantially unchanged ongoing expenses drove Eaton Vance's adjusted earnings per diluted share down to $0.51 in the quarter, a decline of 16% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. In terms of revenue and profit, the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was certainly nothing to write home about. While market effects adversely affected our financial results in the first quarter, in other respects, this was an outstanding period for us. As noted previously, we realized consolidated net inflows of $5.3 billion in the quarter, which equates to an annualized organic growth rate of 7%. As in most recent quarters, our internal growth was led by Parametric's portfolio implementation and exposure management franchises and Eaton Vance Management fixed income, which had a collective $7.4 billion of net inflows. Net inflows within fixed income were led by our high performing municipal bond and high yield franchises, with net flows of $800 million and $600 million, respectively. Also contributing positively to first quarter flows were our alternative mandates in EVM and Atlanta Capital managed equities. First quarter net outflows were concentrated primarily in two areas, floating rate bank loans and Parametric emerging market equities, which had net outflows of $1.5 billion and $500 million, respectively. In both cases, net outflows appear to be somewhat exacerbated by year-end tax loss selling and abated in the month of January. In addition to favorable net flows, the quarter also saw strong investment performance across a broad range of Eaton Vance and Parametric investment strategies. As indicated in slides 13 to 15 accompanying this call, we ended the quarter with 54 mutual funds rated 4 star or 5 stars by Morningstar for at least one class of shares, including 21 5-star rated funds. Our top performing funds include Value, Core, Growth, Small and SMID-Cap U.S. equities, Developed and Emerging Market International Equities, Balanced and multi-asset funds, Global Macro and Floating Rate, High-Yield Government Income and Strategic Income Funds as well as a wide assortment of National and Single State Municipal income funds. Given the large number of top-rated funds, it should not come as a surprise that high performance account for a significant percentage of our current mutual fund assets. As shown on slide 12, as of December 31, 52% of our mutual fund assets where in funds and share classes ranked in the top quartile of their Morningstar peer group for one year performance. 43% of our fund assets ranked in the first quartile on a three-year and five-year basis and 58% of fund assets were top quartile over 10 years. The superior performance of our fund line up was recognized in the annual Barron's/Lipper Best Fund Family Rankings released earlier this month. On a one-year basis, Eaton Vance ranked number one amongst 67 fund complexes for U.S. equity performance and number two overall for 2015 Fund Family performance. Since Barron's began its annual rankings in 1995, this is the third time Eaton Vance has finished either first or second, joining a small handful of fund sponsors with that distinction. Our 5-year and 10-year rankings were also strong at the 28th percentile of rated fund families over 5 years and at the 20th percentile over 10 years. This is the 4th year in a row and 12th of the past 13 years that our 10-year returns ranked in the top one-third of the fund sponsor universe. Our largest equity fund is Eaton Vance Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap Fund that has been a particularly strong performer, closing the fiscal quarter ranked the number one among more than 600 funds and share classes in the Morningstar Mid-Cap Growth category for one-year performance and also ranking top-decile for 3 years, 5 years, and 10 years. The fund's co-managers Chip Reed, Bill Bell, and Matt Hereford were named as finalists for Morningstar Domestic Equity Manager of the Year for 2015. Another investment team with exceptionally strong near-term performance is our 49% owned Montreal-based affiliate Hexavest, which manages primarily global equity mandates, following a distinctive top-down investment style. The past three months of market turmoil has given Hexavest an opportunity to demonstrate what they do best, which is to outperform in down markets. Over the three-month period ending January 31, the Eaton Vance Hexavest Global Equity Fund beat its benchmark by approximately 470 basis points and the average of its Morningstar category peers by roughly 440 basis points, placing the fund's Class I shares in the top quintile of its peer group on both a one-year and three-year basis. Hexavest reports that as of January 31, all of their institutional client accounts are now ahead of benchmark over the life of the mandate. On an overall basis, it's fair to say that our investment performance has never looked stronger than it does today. Not surprisingly, one of our key business objectives for 2016 is to translate the strong investment results we are seeing into strong net sales across our lineup of active strategies. Although active managers, as a whole, were not growing in most major asset classes, there remains a tremendous amount of money in motion each year, creating significant opportunities for high-performing managers to grow their business by gaining market share. Active management is increasingly a game of winners and losers, and our favorable performance positions Eaton Vance to be a winner. During the quarter, we made progress advancing a number of important strategic initiatives. We continue to build out our suite of custom beta separate account strategies and gained broader distribution access for these products. Over the past 12 months, we have grown managed assets and tax-managed core equity and laddered bond separate accounts from $27.3 billion to $34.2 billion, an increase of 25%. Our grouping of these and related strategies under the custom beta banner reflects their use in client portfolios to provide customized exposure to a range of markets, including a wide assortment of equity indexes and municipal and corporate fixed income. Value-added elements of the strategies include direct holdings of securities that can be highly customized to reflect client needs and preferences, the lot level tax management and the pass-through of realized losses and for the bond strategies laddered portfolio construction and initial and ongoing credit oversight. On the equity side, Parametric offers a range of strategies that track a client designated benchmark, but which can deviate from the benchmark holdings to reflect ongoing tax management, client specified responsible and impact investing screens and overlays, and our portfolio factor tilt that may include value quality momentum, dividend yield, and low volatility always established and maintained by the client. In many respects, this is an ideal product for meeting investor demand for equity index investing. Like an index fund, custom core provides low-cost benchmark based equity market exposure, but unlike an index fund, Parametric can potentially enhance returns through ongoing tax management and can deviate from the benchmark to reflect the wants and needs of the individual client. It's a compelling offering that's experiencing growing demand. In the first fiscal quarter, net inflow was into Parametric custom core strategies offered to the high net worth and retail managed account channels totaled $2.1 billion. Fees on these mandates averaged approximately 23 basis points, which is highest amongst product groups in our portfolio implementation category. On the fixed income side, our custom beta offerings currently consist of laddered municipal bond and corporate bond separate accounts. Corporate Ladders are a new product for us that began to pick up tracks in the first quarter with managed assets increasing more than 50% to $400 million, while more established laddered municipal bond separate account assets also grew strongly from $5.8 billion to $6.7 billion in the quarter, reflecting over $600 million of positive net flows and favorable market action. Here again, our custom beta products offer significant value over both bond index funds and unmanaged bonds held in a broker's account. For reporting purposes, laddered bond mandates are included in our fixed income category and accounts for a significant percentage of the category growth. Our custom beta products are well-suited for an environment in which a growing percentage of investors and advisers seek low-cost passive market exposures yet recognize the benefits that custom-built portfolios of directly held individual securities can offer over bought (10:52) beta index mutual funds and index ETFs. We continue to view this as a huge market opportunity that remains at an early stage of development. On both the equity and income sides, we have first-mover and scale advantages that position us well versus potential competitors. The second strategic initiative that continues to progress from an earlier stage of development is the build-out of EVM's global equity and global income capabilities. During the first quarter, we completed the build-out of our new London-based Global Equity Group, transitioned approximately $6 billion of global and international equity mandates to the team, and launched three new global and international equity mutual funds. On the fixed income side, we also continue to add to our global capabilities and to increase staffing in our London office. In April, we are taking new space in London that will increase our office footprint there by approximately two-thirds. By increasing our global investment capabilities, we seek to achieve two important business objectives : first, meeting the growing demand among U.S. investors for global and international investment solutions; and second, positioning ourselves to address markets outside the United States, which represent huge and relatively untapped potential for Eaton Vance. In other new product development, this quarter saw the introduction of the first ever Eaton Vance sponsored unit investment trusts. Our first three sponsored UITs raised nearly $50 million during their offering period, an impressive start for a new market entrant. We view this as an attractive business that fits well with our distribution strength and product development capabilities. While it will likely take time for this to develop into a meaningful part of our overall business, we are encouraged by the strong start. Finally, I want to report on the progress we are making with our NextShares exchange-traded managed fund initiative. In January, we announced plans for the first NextShares fund to list and begin trading on NASDAQ on Friday of this week, and for the fund to be available for public purchase through the online broker-dealers Folio Investing and Folio Institutional beginning next Monday, which is February 29. As announced, the first fund will be Eaton Vance Stock NextShares, which will seek long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of common stocks, following a research-driven, actively managed core investment style benchmarked to the S&P 500. The fund will utilize a master-feeder structure to invest in the same portfolio as used by Eaton Vance Stock Fund, an open-end mutual fund whose load-waived A-shares are currently rated 5-stars by Morningstar. This is the first of what we expect will be several NextShares fund launches this year, with the next scheduled for the month of March. I'm pleased to report that the Stock NextShares launch is on track and expected to take place on the announced timeframe. Getting to this point in the NextShares initiative has been a multi-year process with many twists and turns, and we certainly could not have gotten here without an extraordinary effort by many people both within and outside Eaton Vance. While the introduction of the first fund is a critical step in the development of NextShares, we still have a lot of work to do to get where we want to be. We have a broad consortium of 11 other fund sponsors that have already filed and received approval of their exemptive applications to offer their own families of NextShares funds. We will continue with our efforts to enlist more fund sponsors to become NextShares licensees and are hopeful that seeing a NextShares fund up and running will spur additional fund sponsors to consider entering into licensing agreements. Most critically, we need to broaden distribution by enlisting more broker-dealers to offer NextShares to their customers. While there are no breakthroughs to announce today, we continue to make progress in discussions with major firms and are encouraged by what we see and hear. In-depth discussions are now taking place with firms that have meaningful market share in each of our three primary distribution channels : wirehouse, independent, and RIA. One of the objectives of the staged rollout of NextShares is to demonstrate to broker-dealers that NextShares are straightforward to implement and trade and perform consistent with expectations. If we are successful in gaining broad distribution access, we continue to believe that NextShares have a very bright future with a potential to transform the delivery of active investment strategies to U.S. fund investors. Stay tuned as we expect continued positive developments with our NextShares initiative over the coming months. As we look forward to the remainder of the fiscal year, we see both significant opportunity and significant uncertainty. If macro headwinds and a difficult market environment continue to take their toll on our managed assets and revenue, we will be prepared to adjust our discretionary spending accordingly. However, we seek to avoid making decisions based on short-term market moves that could impede our ability to grow over the long term. In fact, the most opportune time to invest in our business is very often during periods of market disruption. Wherever the markets take us, we believe our line-up of high performing and value-added strategies, innovative new product offerings, and strong financial characteristics position Eaton Vance very well versus competitors. That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Laurie. Laurie G. Hylton - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer, VP: Thank you, Tom and good morning. We are reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.51 for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to $0.61 for the first quarter fiscal 2015 and $0.53 for the fourth quarter fiscal 2015. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.50 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, $0.24 in the first quarter fiscal 2015, and $0.53 in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year. As you can see in Attachment 2 to our press release, adjustments from reported GAAP earnings in the first quarter fiscal 2016 reflect changes in the estimated redemption value of non-controlling interest in our affiliates that are redeemable at other than fair value. Adjustments from reported GAAP earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 primarily reflect the payment of $73 million or approximately $0.37 per diluted share to end service and additional compensation arrangements for certain Eaton Vance closed-end funds. Although average managed assets of $308.3 billion for the quarter were up slightly from the $306.4 billion reported in the prior quarter and up 3.6% over the year-ago quarter, first quarter revenue decreased 3% sequentially and 7% year-over-year, reflecting shifts in asset mix in a down market. The shifts in managed asset mix reflects strong net inflows and lower fee strategies, such as portfolio implementation, exposure management and bond ladders, in a quarter when higher fee strategies, such as floating rate and emerging markets, were net outflows. Performance fees, which contributed approximately $2 million in the prior fiscal quarter, were negligible this quarter, creating an incremental headwind in terms of our sequential quarterly revenue comparison. As Tom noted earlier, market losses this quarter reduced assets under management by just over $14 billion, more than offsetting the $5.3 billion in net inflows. And the assets under management were $5.8 billion lower than average assets under management for the quarter, which will put additional pressure on revenue in the second quarter. Product mix continues to be the most significant determinant of our overall effective investment advisory and administrative fee rate. As you can see in Attachment 10 to our press release, our average annualized effective investment advisory and administrative fee rate, excluding performance fees, declined to 36.7 basis points in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 from 37.7 basis points in the fourth quarter fiscal 2015 and 40.6 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Although mandate level annualized effective fee rates were relatively stable, we did see some downward pressure on our effective equity and fixed income fee rates this quarter, primarily reflecting the loss of higher fee emerging market equity assets and the growth of lower-fee bond ladder managed assets, respectively. While our asset base remains highly diversified, we anticipate additional downward pressure on our overall average effective investment advisory and administrative fee rate, if growth in our custom core, exposure management, and bond ladder franchises continues to outpace that of our active equity and income franchises. As said, even if average fee rates continue to trend downward, we can achieve organic revenue growth by reducing outflows from higher fee strategies, which appears to be happening. Our operating margin decreased to 30.3% this quarter from 32.5% last quarter and 34.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, reflecting the impact of lower revenue in a period when total expenses were held largely flat in both sequential and year-over-year comparison after adjusting for the $73 million charge in the first quarter of last year to terminate certain closed-end fund service and additional compensation arrangements. Although variable expenses, such as distribution and service fee expenses, declined with the decrease in related distribution service fee revenue, compensation expense ticked up both sequentially and year-over-year. Sequentially, compensation expense increased 3%, largely due to seasonal compensation factors including fiscal year-end merit increases, as well as calendar employee benefit and payroll tax clock resets, partially offset by lower operating income-based bonus accruals and lower sales-based incentives. Year-over-year, compensation expense increased 2%, driven primarily by increases in head count at Parametric to support growth, adds to staff in our London office to support the build out of our global equity capabilities and incremental adds to staff to support our NextShares initiative. Year-over-year increases in base, benefit, stock-based comp, and other compensation expense to support these initiatives were partially offset by lower operating income-based accruals and sales-based incentives. Compensation as a percentage of revenue ticked up to 37% in the first quarter fiscal 2016, compared to 35% in the prior sequential quarter and 34% in the first quarter fiscal 2015. Given current market headwinds, second quarter compensation as a percent of revenue is forecasted to stay in the 37% range. Other operating expenses were up 12% in the first quarter versus the same period a year ago, primarily reflecting increases in information technology, certain professional services, and other corporate expenses. Other operating expenses declined modestly on a sequential basis. Expenses related to our NextShares initiative, which are included in multiple expense categories, including compensation expense and other operating expenses, totaled approximately $1.8 million for the first quarter fiscal 2016, compared to $1.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, and $2.3 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2015. As Tom highlighted earlier, fiscal discipline around both hiring and other discretionary spending will remain top of mind in fiscal 2016. Given the revenue headwinds we are facing, we remain committed to investing for growth despite these headwinds, but are certainly mindful of the current market environment and the associated profitability pressures we face. While we will be very careful with our spending going forward, we have no plans for staff cuts. That said, we are certainly aware of the levers that we can pull in terms of the timing of project launches and the hiring to support those markets remain unsettled. Net income and gains on seed capital investments contributed roughly $0.01 to earnings per diluted share in the first quarters of fiscal 2016 and 2015, and reduced earnings by $0.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter fiscal 2015. When quantifying the impact of our seed capital investments on earnings each quarter, we take into consideration pro-rata share of the gains, losses and other investment income earned on investments and sponsored products, whether accounted for as consolidated funds, separate accounts or equity method investments, as well as the gains and losses recognized on derivatives used to hedge these investments. We then report the per share impact of net non-controlling interest expense and income taxes. We continue to hedge our seed capital exposure to the extent we reasonably can, which allowed us to avoid significant investment losses this quarter in volatile markets. Changes in quarterly equity and net income of affiliates, both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily reflect changes in the company's position in 49% owned Hexavest. Our 49% interest in Hexavest, which is reported net of tax and the amortization of intangibles and equity and net income of affiliates, contributed approximately $0.02 per diluted share for all quarterly periods presented. Excluding the effect of CLO entity earnings and losses, our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was 38.4% as compared to 36.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, and 38.6% in the fourth quarter fiscal 2015. We currently anticipate that our effective tax rates adjusted for CLO earnings and losses will be approximately 38.5% for fiscal 2016 as a whole. It terms of capital management, we repurchased 2.3 million shares of Non-Voting Common Stock for approximately $73.3 million in the first quarter fiscal 2016. When combined with repurchases over the preceding three quarters, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 4% compared to the first quarter fiscal 2015. Shares outstanding of 115.2 million at the end of this quarter are down 3% from the 118.4 million reported a year ago, and down 1% from the 115.9 million reported on October 31, 2015. We finished the first fiscal quarter holding $419.1 million of cash and short-term debt securities and approximately $268.4 million in seed capital investment. Our outstanding debt consists of $250 million of 6.5% senior notes due in 2017, and $325 million of 3.625% senior notes due in 2023. We also have a $300 million five-year line of credit which is currently undrawn. Given our strong cash flow, liquidity, and overall financial condition, we believe we are well positioned to continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This concludes our prepared comments. At this point, we'd like to take any questions you may have. Operator : The first question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning. I guess, Laurie, I'd be first just on the expenses. I get the 37% comp for 2Q, just want to clarify that that represents like a mark of AUM as of yesterday or how that represents the current AUM? And then how you're thinking about maybe the NextShares spending into next year or into this year? Laurie G. Hylton - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer, VP: Yeah. In terms of the comp, we are looking at that in relation to the assets that we came out of at the end of the quarter assuming flat market. Now, obviously, if markets continue to be volatile, that could ratchet up. But approximately in terms of our compensation, about 40% of it is variable, 60% fixed. So, I think the 37% as it looks today, looks like a pretty good number for the second quarter, but, again, things might change. In terms of our NextShares spend, we were a little bit lighter this quarter. I would anticipate in the first quarter and the second quarter, we may be ramping up a little bit. I think we had given previous guidance that we anticipated our overall spend in 2016 would probably be in the $8 million to $10 million range. I don't think that we're moving off of that at this point. I'm looking at Tom, just making sure he's nodding his head. Thomas E. Faust - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I would say, yes. If there's any change of significance from the current run rate level, it would likely reflect significant progress with a distribution partner where we're contributing or helping them in their implementation cost. So that would be the only driver, but even there we don't see a major change from that, or we don't see a significant risk of change from the indicated guidance. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Great. And I guess as a follow-up just on that, can you talk about the conversations with the broker-dealer community? I assume the macro environment is not helping with that. But is there interest but just a matter of the dollar amount in expense or timing, I guess? Can you talk about what some of the pushback might be you're hearing from that segment? Thomas E. Faust - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's primarily priorities, resources, uncertainty, particularly related to the DOL initiative. We argue and I think this is right that, on balance, a world that is more tilted towards advisory solutions than brokerage solutions, which is likely the direction of the DOL initiative, is clearly favorable for NextShares. The uncertainty as to the effect of that and certainly as to the technology requirements of that is a somewhat chilling factor in NextShares. So, we've had major broker-dealers that say we find this interesting, but we really need to get our hands around this DOL initiative, what's going to be required both in terms of the rules themselves as well as the perhaps systems and business modifications that will flow from that. We need to get our hands around that before we do something that we view as discretionary. The DOL affects their core business every day. Arguably, this is an add-on. This is something new that they don't necessarily need to do. I would say in terms of our \u2013 more broadly, the conversations, I think there's a significant change that we expect to happen when we have a product in the market. I think my view was that that would not be all that significant. We've known this was going to happen. We don't expect any surprises. But there are significant constituencies out there in the broker-dealer world that where this is a big deal. The fact that we will have funds that are demonstrated to trade and to perform and they can watch those and see how they perform every day, a lot of the questions, a lot of the mystery of NextShares get taken out by when we're in the marketplace, which starts at the end of this week. So, we're not hearing objections, people that say this is a bad idea, I don't want to do this. What we're hearing overwhelmingly is, interesting concept, let's see how this develops, let's see how this fits into our timeframe. But we are \u2013 while saying that, I do want to reemphasize, we are making significant progress with major broker-dealers from all three major channels. And our view, which I think is right, is that you get one major in each category, it makes it much easier for others in that category to want to follow. They'll have business reasons, maybe even a business imperative to want to come in if one of their closest competitors is seeing any kind of movement in their business toward NextShares. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Your line is open. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. That was most of mine, actually. But the \u2013 I'm curious on the repurchase, looks like it ticked down a little bit and the price has obviously come down quite a bit. If you feel like there are any cash needs be it seeding NextShares or other seeding needs that could keep it at a lower rate against a much lower share price? Laurie G. Hylton - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer, VP: No. At this point, I think that we're very comfortable with our cash position and with our ability to continue to generate cash from operations. We don't generally give any guidance on what our intention is in terms of repurchases for the quarter outside of saying that we intend to be in the marketplace. So we're watching the markets like everyone else is. But at this point, we don't see any particular cash constraints that would keep us out of the market. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Great. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is open. Andrew McLaughlin - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. This is actually Andy McLaughlin for Rob Lee. Thanks for taking my question. I know you guys said you were going to expand the London office and we just wanted to kind of get some idea around timing and amount of those expenses going forward? Thomas E. Faust - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Those are pretty well reflected in the first quarter. The big hiring initiative there was in connection with our equity team that's now based in London, then we have one person in Tokyo and there are a handful of people in Boston connected to that team as well. That's done. The people there that were hired in that group, I think the last ones came first week of November, something like that. So, think of those numbers as effectively baked in. I did mention that we're taking some new space \u2013 expanded space in London, but that's a relatively small item. I think I said we're expanding by two-thirds. That means we're going to stay in the same building. We're going from half a floor or thereabouts to or two-thirds of a floor to a full floor. So, it's not enough to be meaningful. But it's a significant initiative for us that we are optimistic that we're going to be in a position to bring in international assets that will produce revenues to offset that incremental spending. I was over there last week and quite encouraged by the pipeline and the level of activity. Primarily, today, on the fixed income side, I'd say particularly high yield, but also we're starting to see some interest in equity products also as well. But, I would say, the hope would be that over the coming quarters that we'll see significant flows of international income assets and the beginning of flows on international equity assets. Andrew McLaughlin - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks for that color. And if I could just ask one follow-up question, kind of around flows, around floating rate and bank loan. Are you seeing institutional appetite there? And kind of as of late, given the environment outflows, are you seeing them improve or kind of slipping from last year? Just any insight you can provide on that. Thomas E. Faust - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, January was a significant \u2013 while still negative on an overall basis, January was an improvement from November and December. We would attribute that primarily to year-end effects, tax-lot selling or anything else that might be happening around the end of the year. I would say the flows have \u2013 they moderated a bit. It still befuddles us that we are seeing net outflows, we see bank loans as an incredibly attractive asset class today, really offering a compelling risk reward opportunity with floating rate income but from current levels, the opportunity for capital appreciation unless this credit cycle proves to be an unusually weak one. We're staring into the phase of a recession and recovery rates on defaulted loans or the rate of default itself is significantly worse than historical norms. People can \u2013 we'll have some credit effects. But we \u2013 from our point of view, those are more than priced in to current bank loan prices. So, my theory is that we saw a big growth in both our business and the mutual fund assets and bank loans going back to 2013, 2014, what was the big growth year? Daniel C. Cataldo - Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : 2013. Thomas E. Faust - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : 2013. And to some degree, we're still working through those assets. These are people that perhaps didn't really understand the asset class and what they were buying. At that point, there was \u2013 you might remember there was a significant fear that interest rates were going to go up sharply. That's the short end as well as the long end. And, obviously, that hasn't happened. And as that hasn't happened, we've been seeing as, again, this is my theory, a lot of those relatively new players in the asset class come out of the asset class. Demand on the institutional side remains solid. I wouldn't say it's spectacular, but it's certainly solid. People get \u2013 they've been through this asset class get that it's a significant diversifier. It has potentially no exposure to interest rate risk. These are dollar based loans. So, for a U.S. investor, there's essentially no exposure to currency risk, but it does have exposure to credit risk. But we've been doing this for many years going back to the late 1980s, more than 25 years, and we had experienced in knowing what a typical experience through a credit cycle is in terms of losses to credit events. All of that experience tells us that the asset class is compellingly attractive today. And we're certainly doing what we can to make that case to both current clients and potential clients. Andrew McLaughlin - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question is from Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Hey, guys. Good morning. First, maybe just to come back to the rollout for NextShares. Just wondering if you could maybe give us an update as it relates to seed capital needs going forward as you bring new funds to market? Any color there would be helpful. Thomas E. Faust - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We're \u2013 couple of answers. One answer from an exchange perspective, the amount of capital is quite minimum. Is it 2 \u2013 what is it, $1 million or something? Daniel C. Cataldo - Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Two Creation Units. Thomas E. Faust - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Two Creation Units, which is $1 million, so not significant. We do expect to have larger positions than that but from where we sit today, we don't see the need to build materially large positions in NextShares compared to our current seed capital portfolio which is \u2013 how much? Daniel C. Cataldo - Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : $268 million. Laurie G. Hylton - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer, VP: Yeah. Thomas E. Faust - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : $268 million. So we don't think it will likely that it will move the needle on that. Sometimes a driver of seed capital needs is minimum investment requirements that a particular broker-dealer may impose on a new strategy. For the most part, we would expect and hope that those requirements wouldn't apply to NextShares because these are not new strategies. In all cases, these are established strategies where we're just applying that same strategy in a lower cost more efficient vehicle, and we would expect in our work with broker-dealers that we should be able to convince them that there should be no requirement for significant Eaton Vance Investment in NextShares to validate those strategies. So, bottom line, we don't expect it to be a major factor, a major use of cash over the next year based on everything we know today. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Got it. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up. Just more broadly curious to hear in terms of what you're seeing for real-time demand trends across the institutional channel and how the pipeline looks in terms of the level of wins as well as the underlying mix of strategies beyond sort of the bank loan demand that you cited earlier? Thomas E. Faust - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. The opportunity for us is really to take advantage of the strong performance record that a lot of our strategies have today. I mentioned high yield as an area of significant activity. Honestly, I don't think that's reflective of a huge demand incrementally for new allocations to high yield more than the fact that more so it reflects the fact that there are other managers who have disappointed a client and there are searches that are driven by replacements and because we have one of the top track records and certainly a compelling story related to the size and strength and longevity of our team, we're in a position to compete very effectively for those transfers. When I was in London, I did meet actually with a potential new client who is attracted to the risk/reward characteristics of high yield today. They look at spreads in the marketplace and historical levels of the market and historical returns from current spread levels and they're looking at potentially adding to the asset class. I think that's probably the exception rather than the rule today. I mentioned Hexavest has had very strong performance of late that really, in many ways, validates their approach which has been one of general caution on the markets. They made up a lot of ground in the fourth quarter and now have very compelling performance and also particularly attractive performance on a risk-adjusted basis. We expect to see increased activity of Hexavest in searches. Atlanta Capital, again, another very high performing manager and are stable. They have a relatively new strategy. It's been offered institutionally for the last three or four years. It's called Select Equity that had some meaningful wins. That's approaching $500 million in assets, and the strategy that potentially if things go right, that is we have another quarter or two of favorable performance and we can get over that $500 million threshold that we put ourselves in a position to compete effectively for new business there. So, I would say those are three areas I would highlight away from bank loans and away from the more implementation and exposure-oriented parts of our business which continue to see very strong demand. But, again, our key charge to our sales organization currently is we need to figure out ways to translate high-performing investment strategies into strong business performance, and that applies both retail and institutional. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Got it. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : The next question is from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open. Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you and good morning. This is Adam Beatty, in for Mike. We wanted to get your thoughts on regulatory attention to fund composition and derivative exposure, particularly, I guess with respect to some of the overlay and factor-based strategies. Do you expect some additional scrutiny in those areas? And how would you manage that? Thanks. Thomas E. Faust - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So I think as you're referring to, there was an SEC proposal that came out late last year that would impose additional regulations and new limitations for mutual funds, or I should say, I believe its investment comp \u2013 registered investment companies in their use of different kinds of derivative. We have a number of strategies that are fairly intensive users of derivatives. Those fall generally into two categories : one is we have primarily on the closed-end fund side, we have equity funds that write call options in some cases in single stock options, in other cases it's index options, in some cases, they write options in connection with also selling or in some cases buying put options. So we have strategies that are primarily equity funds that have an options overlay. That's sort of one category of derivative intensive product that we offer in a registered investment fund format. The other broad category of products we have is in our Global Macro area where often the most efficient way to gain a desired market exposure is through the derivatives market. So a credit default swap or a forward position in a currency would probably be the two most typical ways of gaining exposure. How those \u2013 how this affects those businesses \u2013 how these proposed regulations affect these businesses is still up in the air. These regulations are being proposed. Eaton Vance is part of the ICI or Fund Industry Association and is participating in the development of the comment letter to be submitted by the ICI. We also expect to submit our own comment letter on this. We expect our comment letter to focus on, as you would expect, the areas of how we use derivatives. We believe the intent of that initiative is primarily to limit the use of derivatives for leverage purposes, which primarily is not how we use leverages; we're using in the case of writing call option that doesn't add market exposure to a fund arguably it takes away market exposure. And similarly with our derivative strategies on the Global Income side, often these could be replicated in a very similar way by operating in the cash markets. So, I guess, bottom line, we're monitoring this quite closely. We expect to have a comment submitted to the SEC. We're participating in industry comments. Depending on how things go, there could be changes in the implementation of some of our strategies that at the margin could increase fund cost, lower fund return. But there's nothing that would cause us to say that something we're doing today likely we couldn't do if these proposed regulations are implemented, rather, they may require us to do things in a somewhat different way. Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thank you, Tom. I appreciate the detail. And then, in particular on the factor-based strategies, it's interesting, if I hear you right, that they're not only customized but somewhat dynamic in terms of the allocation or exposure. The question is how close to the end use or retail investor would you see those types of dynamic decisions being made? Is it something that should always be intermediated by an FA or others, or would you see it being suitable in perhaps a robo-advisor context? Thank you. Thomas E. Faust - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So, we're not in the robo-advisor business. We do offer these custom beta strategies on a retail basis through relationships we have with broker/dealers, financial advisors generally with a minimum investment of about $250,000 in the strategy. So, we're not today placing these tools in the hands directly of retail investors that not necessarily would be a bad thing, but that's not our focus today. The range of customization that we offer down to the client or advisor level does vary by firm. In some cases, a firm, even some that use these strategies quite actively, give a limited ability for a financial advisor to choose a custom solution. While these are customizable, sometimes that customization sort of stops at the firm level. In other cases, the firm will allow customization down to the advisor group level within agreed upon constraints. But in no case currently do we provide customization down to the individual client level, at least in terms of retail clients. Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Interesting. Thank you for taking our questions. Operator : The next question is from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open. William V. Cuddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. This is Will Cuddy standing in for Ken. Thank you for taking our questions. So, a top topic in the news is a potential British exit from the EU. And you've mentioned the growth in your London office. How could like a British exit from the EU potentially affect your International businesses? Thomas E. Faust - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I guess, first, I would say not materially. We don't have a big International business. I was in London last week, and this is certainly a topic of discussion. I can pass on what I heard though the impact on our business rounds to zero because we don't have a big base of operations in the UK. We are moving from two-thirds of a floor to a full floor in a building there. But I think the concern there in the financial sector is that London could lose its status as a financial center of Europe, which is maybe somewhat arguable today, but probably not something that the French or the Germans are happy about. And my guess is that, if Britain is not part of the EU going forward that that could change with implications not only for markets but also for how and where investment managers like Eaton Vance staff to serve clients and meet market opportunities in Europe. Because we're really at the beginning stage of our development, we don't have a particular commitment to UK. If the new center of Europe is in Frankfurt or Paris or wherever, it wouldn't be a significant disruption to our business to pick up and move effectively. I think the bigger concern \u2013 the more likely concern, the most significant concern for Eaton Vance is just what does it do to the markets. We're in the business where our revenues go up or down with the markets. And to the extent that the possibility of a British exit from the EU is weighing on markets, the primary financial impact of that on Eaton Vance is that if that weighing on the markets cause the market prices to go down, our revenues go down. That's the way it works in the asset management business. So I would put it in the same category as other things that are bringing uncertainty and adding risk to global financial markets today is much more significant to us than the specifics of how we address markets in Europe. William V. Cuddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. So tying into Adam's question earlier with the custom beta and robo-advisors. A big pitch from robo-advisors have been the ability to tax manage assets. Do you see that as a potential threat or opportunity for you? And would you see a potential for partnering with one of these platforms? Thomas E. Faust - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Certainly something we're interested in. I don't believe it's accurate that today a core offering of most robo-advisors is individual holdings of securities and lot level tax management. I believe the \u2013 my understanding is the predominant model is that they invest in ETFs primarily and perhaps other pool vehicles as their primary way of gaining market exposure. I'm familiar that Wealthfront has an offering with individual securities. So I believe with that exception, the robo-advisor world is essentially a world of investing in ETFs and other fund vehicles as opposed to holding direct investments in securities primarily. Clearly, there's an interest here and a potential overlap with our capabilities. I don't think there's great market data on this, but we believe it's highly likely that our affiliate, Parametric, is today the largest player in what I'll call the tax-managed separate account business. We have the most \u2013 the largest account base. I'm sure we would claim that the most sophisticated technology and potentially could consider ramping that up to potentially bring down minimum investments and service clients through robo-advisors or other means on a broader basis than we're doing today. So I don't see it as a threat to our business, but I do see it as potentially an opportunity. And we're certainly open to discussions on additional ways to gain access for this product suite, which, as we've talked about in previous quarters and as I emphasized in my remarks today, continues to be a growing part of our business and something that really sets us apart from what I'll call other traditional active managers. William V. Cuddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you for taking our questions. Operator : The next question is from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open. Andrew Nicholas - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. This is actually Andrew Nicholas filling in for Chris. Just one question. You referred to additional NextShares product launches in March. I just want to confirm first that those would all be Eaton Vance products. And then, in any case, if there is an updated timeline for the rollout of other licensee funds. Thomas E. Faust - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So to-date the only fund sponsor that has approved fund registration statements is Eaton Vance. So, any near-term launches would be of Eaton Vance sponsored products. A key milestone for other licensees, the other 11 fund sponsors that have exemptive relief to offer NextShares and have entered into preliminary agreements with our affiliate to permit that, a key milestone for them was when Eaton Vance got our registration statement approvals in December. Because, by design, and I would say, by design from our end as well as from the SEC, that was intended to be a template that other fund sponsors could use. So, in other words, the language that was agreed to and negotiated by us and the SEC, that essentially can be plugged into registration statements for other fund sponsors. Certainly, one of our objectives including 18 registration statements in that initial filing was to make sure that we essentially covered all the bases in terms of asset classes and issues that might arise to make it easier for follow-on managers to expedite the process of their own \u2013 getting their own registration statement approval. We are certainly in contact with other fund companies. We understand that they are making progress towards filing registration statements relatively soon, but we can't \u2013 we obviously can't control the timing of that. But I would say here again, as with our conversations with broker-dealers and other fund companies, the fact that we have a product live with the market is a stimulus for action by the fund companies that have already entered into agreements with us and are trying to make decisions about the timing of their own launches (57:10). But again, also important to them is what does the distribution landscape look like. They're happy for the test phase of the development of NextShares to be dominated by Eaton Vance. They likely are primarily interested in the commercial development, which requires a broader range of distribution outlets than we have today. But we expect to see registrations filed by \u2013 for NextShares Fund by other sponsors in the coming weeks. Andrew Nicholas - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. That's all I had. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our time limit for any further questions, and I will now turn the call back over the Mr. Cataldo for any closing remarks. Daniel C. Cataldo - Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Great. Thank you for joining us and thank you for your continued interest in Eaton Vance and we look forward to reporting back to you in a few months for our second fiscal quarter end. Good-bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at www.morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman. James Gorman : Good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us. I\u2019ll make a few brief introductory remarks and then Jon will take you through the numbers and of course we both as always look forward to your questions. Our results this quarter reflect solid performance in an improved but obviously still relatively fragile environment. Our team had several objectives coming into the quarter as follows : managing the uncertain macroeconomic environment; continuing the momentum we are building in fixed income while preserving stability in our other businesses; maintaining expense discipline; and obtaining approval for our capital plan under CCAR. By and large, we met these objectives and despite the overall lack of commission in the market, we executed on our strategic plan and performed well in the areas of traditional strength. We saw continued stability and progress in our core businesses with each performing roughly in line with expectations given the environment. We made particular progress in fixed income and commodities where we generated approximately $1.3 billion in revenue, up significantly from the first quarter. Jon will take you through each of our businesses in a moment.  On expenses, we remain focused on our cost discipline but tactically and through project streamline. We're now a simpler organization and therefore must be leaner and more efficient in our spend. We discussed initiatives that are currently underway last month at our financials conference and are pleased with product streamlines progress to date. Our ROE for the quarter was 8.3% and demonstrated progress towards our 2017 target. Finally, we received the non-objection from the Federal Reserve on our 2016 capital plan. We believe this decision reflects the changes we undertook as well as our business mix stability. The approval enables us to increase our dividend to $0.20 per quarter and to repurchase up to $3.5 billion in common stock over the next 12 months commencing in the third quarter. CCARs outcome reinforces our aim to steadily increase the return of capital to shareholders over time and indeed it marks the fourth consecutive year in which we have done so. We were also asked to resubmit our plan due to certain deficiencies that the Federal Reserve found in our capital planning process. We're working extremely hard to ensure a successful resubmission towards the end of this year. On the macro environment a lot was going on. Britain's decision to leave the European Union created uncertainty that is likely to persist for some time as the market grapples with the political and economic paths forward. As we said publicly, we consider this outcome suboptimal, but it did indeed provide us with a live stress scenario as we endured record high volumes and spikes of volatility, our liquidity remains strong, our systems ran smoothly and our clients access the market quickly and in size. I will now turn over to Jon to discuss the quarter in detail and again look forward to your questions in a few minutes. Jonathan Pruzan : Good morning. As James said, the environment in the second quarter was an improvement over the first. However, we continue to see macro uncertainty and with that periods of heightened volatility. Geopolitical events including Brexit have kept market participants on the sidelines as they wait for clearer trends to emerge. Despite this backdrop, Morgan Stanley delivered solid results. For the quarter, we reported revenues of $8.9 billion versus $7.8 billion in 1Q. Non-interest expenses for the first quarter were $6.4 billion versus $6.1 billion last quarter. The increase is primarily driven by increased compensation expense on higher revenues. Profit before taxes for the quarter was $2.5 billion versus $1.7 billion in 1Q 2016 highlighting the operating leverage we have in the business model. Project streamline remains on track. In mid-June James highlighted some of the key initiatives that have been identified to meet our objective of reducing our cost base by $1 billion by 2017. These initiatives will continue to be carried out through the next 18 months but substantial progress has already been made. We continue to leverage our global centers of excellence to optimize workforce costs. We have hired 250 employees with our objective of hiring 1,250 employees through the end of 2017. Offsetting this headcount has come down in our metro higher cost locations. We're 50% complete with our objective to close four North American data centers and are on schedule to close the remaining two by 2017.  We continually seek ways to deploy technology to drive efficiencies and automation. To that end, we just rolled out a cloud based procurement platform which will drive future savings through more straight through processing and payments, and greater intelligence and purchasing decisions. We continue to show greater discipline around our non-essential travel and have achieved a 50% reduction through the first half of the year as compared to the first half of 2015.  Turning to Institutional Securities, revenues were $4.6 billion, up 23% quarter-on-quarter. Non-compensation expenses were $1.4 billion for the quarter, essentially flat to the first quarter. Streamline initiatives offset costs associated with rising revenues. Compensation expenses were $1.6 billion. Our ISG year-to-date compensation to net revenue ratio was 36%. We remain committed to our compensation ratio target of less than or equal to 37% we set out at the beginning of the year. In investment banking, we generated $1.1 billion in revenues, up 12% sequentially. Year-to-date we were number two globally and announced M&A, completed M&A, IPOs and equity and equity linked offerings. Advisory revenues for the quarter were $497 million, down 16% off of a strong 1Q. Dialogue and interest in strategic transactions remain strong but below the 2015 pace.  M&A announced volumes are running 20% to 25% below last year and we would expect that to persist. Equity underwriting revenues were $266 million, up 66% versus 1Q and debt underwriting revenues were $345 million, up 44% sequentially. Although we saw improvements in underwriting, activity remained below historical levels. As we have mentioned on past calls, we have a healthy pipeline of transactions waiting to be executed. Issuer confidence and investor appetite will be critical for the results in underwriting to improve. In equities, we remained our leadership position and expect to be number one globally with revenues of $2.1 billion, up 4% sequentially. Second quarter 2016 was a strong quarter across products and regions as we continue to work with our clients through uncertain times. Cash equities was up sequentially. Derivatives remained robust. Prime brokerage continues to be a steady performer and we improved the efficiency of our balance sheet. Fixed income and commodity sales and trading revenues were $1.3 billion, up 49% versus the first quarter. Revenues improved sequentially across credit, macro and commodities businesses. Our credit businesses benefited from a tightening of spreads. In particular, securitized products performed well against this backdrop. In macro, we provided support to our clients leading up to and through the Brexit referendum were prudent risk management contributed to higher revenue sequentially.  Commodities benefited from better credit performance and market conditions, specifically a stabilization in energy credits resulting in an increase in client activity. Fixed income RWAs were $124 billion and SLR exposure was $353 billion in the quarter. Other revenues were up versus first quarter, primarily driven by better credit performance for a held for investment and held for sale relationship loans.  Lastly, average trading VaR for the second quarter was $46 million, flat to last quarter. VaR was generally range found over the quarter inclusive of Brexit. Wealth management performed well in the second quarter with revenues of $3.8 billion, up 4% sequentially. Even though we have not seen a pickup in retail engagement, this business continues to provide stability against an uncertain macro backdrop.  Total client assets of $2 trillion increased 2%. Fee based assets hit a new high of $820 billion. And flows in the quarter were $12 billion, up from $5.9 billion in the first quarter. Net interest income was essentially flat sequentially, though up 12% year-over-year. Lending balances were up $3 billion quarter-over-quarter and $11 billion year-over-year. which has resulted in a significant increase in interest income.  This growth was partially offset by an increase in amortization as a result of a pickup in mortgage prepayment fees as rates declined. Our bank NII forecast that we shared in May remains unchanged and we are on pace with our bank growth target for 2016. Transactional revenues were $798 million this quarter, up 10% sequentially. This improvement was driven by mark to market gains on our deferred compensation plans and not a rebound in activity.  As mentioned before, transactional activity remains subdued. On expenses, compensation was up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our compensation ratio decreased to 56.5%, which reflects the benefit of our strategy to grow non-compensable revenues. Non-compensation expenses were essentially flat to 1Q. We continue to invest in digital and our infrastructure to ensure compliance with the DOL.  Our PBT margin for the quarter was 22.5%, up from 21.4% in 1Q 2016. We remain confident we will hit the 23% to 25% pretax margin target we set for 2017, despite the slower than expected pace of future interest rate increases. In investment management, revenues were $583 million, up 22% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues from asset management fees for the quarter were $517 million, essentially flat versus 1Q. AUM was also essentially flat at $406 billion, a continuation of the trend that we have seen over the last several quarters. Investment revenues in the quarter improved to $50 million versus a loss in 1Q 2016, driven by improved performance across a number of funds including private equity and real estate investments.  Investment revenues remained volatile as global markets and asset prices adjust to the changing political landscape and growth dynamic. Overall, expenses were up 7% quarter-over-quarter driven by higher compensation on investment gains.  Turning to the balance sheet, total assets were $829 billion at June 30, up from the $807 billion at March 31. This spot increase was driven by a high level of activity at the very end of June, primarily due to Brexit as we supported our clients. We have seen the balance sheet retreat from this high in the first few weeks of the third quarter.  Pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $365 billion, down from $385 billion in the first quarter. Our pro forma fully phased in advanced common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 15.8% versus 14.6% in the first quarter. Our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.1%, up from 6% in Q1. As James mentioned, during the second quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 23 million shares and our board declared a $0.20 dividend per share.  Last night, we announced that we will redeem all of the issued and outstanding TruPS by August 18, 2016. The TruPS carry a blended cost of 6.2%. We received approval to redeem these securities in this years\u2019 CCAR. Our tax rate in the second quarter was 33.5%. Going forward we continue to estimate a tax rate of 32%.  After a difficult start to 2016, the markets and improved in the second quarter. However, the world continues to experience significant geopolitical uncertainty and with that the potential for economic underperformance. The Brexit vote and upcoming US elections have only added to a cloudy outlook. It is too early to predict how the second half will play out. On the one hand, the political uncertainty casts a negative shadow over the markets, and will undoubtedly cause some corporations to pause over future Capex and other expansion plans and many investors, particularly individuals remain cautious. On the other hand, the movement in currencies and the improvement in commodity and some equity prices is leading many clients to begin to position for what might be a volatile second half.  Our pipelines remain healthy and our business is well positioned, but whether this translates into near term business is an open question. As the coming months unfold, we will remain nimble where we see client opportunities, while staying rigorous to our project streamline and other expense initiatives.  With that, we will open up the line to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski, with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Guy Moszkowski : Thank you, good morning. James Gorman : Good morning Guy. Guy Moszkowski : First just a question on fixed, obviously a very solid result, and you alluded to post Brexit activity, but generally, if you could comment on the ability to produce $1 billion plus quarterly revenue in say despite as you\u2019ve pointed out the sale of the oil merchanting and the 25% headcount reduction, at the end of last year, is there any warning on sustainability here that you want to issue and if not, maybe just give us a sense for how it is that you could have done a headcount reduction that wasn't as significant as it was and still see revenue in that kind of range. Jonathan Pruzan : Hey Guy, it\u2019s Jon. I\u2019ll try to tackle that. I think as you know when we laid out our plan in the beginning of the year, we talked about being a critical incredibly size fixed income business that was relevant to our clients, but also supported are other businesses. And what we said is that we were going to - the goal was to maintain our revenue footprint that we had had on an absolute basis in the last couple of years. Year-to-date, our performance is at around $2.1 billion to $2.2 million so it's in-line with that revenue footprint. We saw broad support and broad improvement across all the products actually in the second quarter. I highlighted SBG tightening spreads help, strong performance in agencies, FX was aided by the volatility we saw from Brexit, commodities clearly better credit performance we had a much more stable backdrop. Oil prices going from 38 to 48 versus the wild swings that we saw in the first quarter, so broadly a very strong performance. It is only one quarter. In the first quarter when people were talking about our performance we warned that it was only one quarter. We made a lot of changes that we think will help this business and this will take time, but we've been pleased with the progress that we have seen to date. Guy Moszkowski : So, should we conclude that\u2026 James Gorman : I\u2019d just\u2026 Guy Moszkowski : Sorry, go ahead. James Gorman : I\u2019d just add to it a little bit obvious FIC is sort of the topic of the day the year and the century, it would appear. Listen, my view was that there was a general overreaction to the underperformance of FIC and from the middle of last year through the first half of the first quarter and I saw very little downside risk to the business. When we\u2019re running at 500 million, 600 million a quarter I thought the downside risk is very small. The upside risk was actually quite high. And that's why we said, we thought on a relatively normalized basis, a billion dollar run rate a quarter was entirely reasonable. The headcount we took out at the end of last year actually many of our competitors have taken out headcount and dribs and drabs, so it wasn\u2019t remarkable against the context of what was going on in the market. We just did it at one point in time.  And clearly we were overstaffed at that point in time. And we came to a fundamental view at the end of last year to do two things, one is to realign the staff for what we thought was a $1 billion run rate business and maybe it's more and maybe we're not going to get ahead of ourselves obviously there's more this quarter. But we don't think it's materially less than that to be honest.  At the same time, the second thing we did was to align all of our sales and trading businesses together. And with that come lots of operational synergies, risk management synergies, overall management client coverage synergies with our SRM our senior relationship management program and I think that wasn't going to evidence itself in the days and weeks following the realignment, but we felt pretty confident in the months and years following it, it would and maybe we're starting to see some of that.  Thirdly just on the particular mix of our business, obviously we're more credit centric to macro, but we do have a very good FX business that benefited, you have seen a lot more volatility in rates and clearly the credit markets as Jon said recovered not just in the core fixed income business, but in commodities. So, the combination of all of these things said that yes it's a good number this quarter. Are we shocked by it? Not really. We weren\u2019t nearly shocked when everybody else seemed to be when we were doing $500 million, $600 million. And that's we're not going to get ahead of it. We set a $1 billion run rate and let's see how it plays out over not each individual quarter, but over the next couple of years. Guy Moszkowski : Okay that answers the question quite robustly thank you. Second big topic of the century in wealth management is that we keep hearing about is robo advice, clearly fees for advice is the core of your wealth management business proposition. A lot of talk about the application of robo advice to different size accounts, how do you intend to protect the franchise against revenue attrition from this type of incursion and are there ways that you can use these types of technologies to your advantage? Jonathan Pruzan : Guy, first of all, digital is far more than just robo. And as you\u2019ve heard us say in the past we've been spending significant energy and dollars into investing in our digital platforms in wealth management. As you know, we hired Naureen Hassan earlier this year to run that effort for us. We think that the right business model and the winning hand here is a combination of advice in FAs with technology. We\u2019ve been investing heavily in this area. We\u2019ve had some good early progress with some of our mobile apps with some recognition and awards, but there are really three areas that we\u2019ve been focused on.  One is around data and analytics so providing our clients with better data and analysis so they can more informed and better decisions. Secondly, efficiencies around automation; that will be helpful not only from an expense standpoint, but also giving FAs and clients more time to be together and not focus on paperwork and doing other things like that. And then lastly, most importantly, is how our clients interface with us.  We have 3.5 million households in our footprint. With many different investing needs, but also many different requirements and idiosyncratic wants and likes, and so we have been building out a broader platform in terms of how we interface with our clients whether that's video, whether that's in person with their FA, whether that's mobile, whether that's text, and we have been doing that for quite some time. So, we have been investing in this area. We've told you it's going to be important to the overall business. We believe secular trends here are for advice with technology. And that's the business that we\u2019re building. James Gorman : And again just to add to this one because it is a critical question, I think that one has to take into account that the wealth management market in this country is actually extremely diverse. In our own book of business, only 2% I think of our client assets are in households with less than $100,000. We have nearly $800 billion in households with $10 million or more. So you got to look at the segmentation. You got to look at the complexity of the client needs of which access through distinct technologies is a clear need, but it's by no means the only need for folks who\u2019ve got $10 million, $20 million, $50 million. Portfolio allocation superior product access to our underwriting calendar all of the other things, which we bring to the party including our intellectual capital through our research. So, it's a very important development the whole digital development in finance. In my view, it is the most important in the payment sector followed by the consumer credit sector followed by the wealth management sector. But we're making the investments. As Jon said through a digit team that we have hired and on arranged leadership and we have made the investments and will continue making them. Guy Moszkowski : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning James and Jon. James Gorman : Good morning. Brennan Hawken : One more on and FIC here, you hit on the increased volatility towards the end of the quarter leading into Brexit and then coming out of it. Do you think that that opportunity allowed you to over earn somewhat in FIC this quarter or at least present a more unusual and robust revenue opportunity, which is why you were able to punch above that $1 billion per quarter run rate, and as we think about that run rate seasonally, when we look into the back half, should we think about that being lower or is it going to be less seasonal because of the changes you made to the business? Jonathan Pruzan : Hi, Brennan. So, the way we would describe Brexit in the impact, I think in the first quarter if you recall and then through sort of the conference season we said that January and February were very challenging markets. March was more stable, a better backdrop for the businesses that we are in, and then April and May looked a lot like March. What we saw in June was sort of a continuation of that trend as we approach the Brexit referendum we saw people start to realize the potential impact of this outcome. And we saw more risk management and hedging activity. And then for the couple of days right before and right after we saw heightened volatility and significant volumes. I would tell you that broadly speaking one or two days does not make a quarter for us. It's a much more balanced business than it. Given also all the changes that we made particularly around the Oil Merchanting business and some of the other actions. We would expect less volatility than we've seen in the past. But we are obviously not going to print the billion dollars every quarter on the nose, so we're going to see fluctuations in that number. I wouldn't say that we over earned. I would say that the volume helped for a day or two, but again doesn't drive the overall performance of the quarter. And then, we've been pleased with the results. I don't think that the changes that we made restricted our ability to earn. We weren't constrained in terms of capacity or personnel. And it was a good quarter. Brennan Hawken : That's really terrific. And then on the seasonality front, how should we think about it just from a modeling perspective? Can you give us any help there? Jonathan Pruzan : I think it's a little early to call. I would historically tell you that August is generally been a pretty slow month, but we are seeing a lot of new trends this year that we've never seen before. So, I leave it up to you to make those determinations. Brennan Hawken : Okay. James Gorman : I would just caution it. From my long experience of doing these calls and discussing fixed income here and observing our competitors it's pretty hard to model quarter-to-quarter every 13 weeks what the fixed income markets are going to do. So good luck with that, but we take a slightly longer term view and again, our base case is billion dollar run rate a quarter we think is what the business should be producing in this time and environment and if it does better than that great, and that's kind of where we are at. Brennan Hawken : Thanks. Thanks for all that color. That's helpful. And then, a couple on the wealth management business, nice to see a recovery here in the margin. As you think about this business a bit longer term, as well and you think about some of the changes that are coming, from a regulatory perspective, how much do you anticipate your product shelf for commission accounts may be impacted? Could you give us a sense about whether that's going to shrink and maybe frame up how that might shrink and how that might have an impact on revenues, and then whether or not the uncertainty from the fiduciary rule is having any impact on the recruiting market from your perspective. Jonathan Pruzan : Okay. I think the way that I would try to answer that is a couple of things. One, as you said, we had a nice recovery in the margin that was both driven on the revenue and the expense side. We are confident in our 23% to 25% margin target that we put out there. When we put it out there, we had the draft to the DOL requirements, so we were informed when we put out the targets. I mentioned we have been investing for the ultimate implementation of that new rule. And we also saw this quarter some of the streamline initiatives that are ultimately going to help this business.  I think we are well positioned for that change. We have the largest advisory platform in the industry. We are making the investments in digital. We do believe as a model Brennan that we're going to have that our wealth clients want advice and they will pay for that advice. But the ultimate mix and shift of products that they want and that they need is going to be a function of time. But we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow this business going forward, even though we have seen lower levels of engagement given the uncertainty in the market. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And no color on the impact in the recruiting market? Jonathan Pruzan : You know, I think attrition is clearly running low, and it's been like that for a while. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen any real changes there. James Gorman : No, it's not going to be affect it. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA, your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi. Another question related to FIC. The debt underwriting year-over-year performed the worst for you guys versus peers. And the question is, is the reduction in FIC on the trading side impacting the debt underwriting side? Jonathan Pruzan : I wouldn't say that Mike. I think our debt underwriting business has been a good business for us. We generally perform better from a quarterly perspective, particularly in markets where we see a lot of the non-commoditized that business being robust. In any 13 week period, particularly in low velocity environments, you can get some SKU if you are not in some big deals around the event space. This quarter there were a couple of events that we didn't participate in on the financing because we were on the sell side from an M&A perspective. So that will impact the numbers on a quarterly basis, but again, we feel good about this business. I don't think any of the changes that we've made in fixed income are impairing our ability to do business here. And we are focused on it and we think it's a good business. Mike Mayo : Second question, retail clients on the sidelines due to Brexit, have they come off the sidelines what are you seeing among retail investors now? Jonathan Pruzan : I think Brexit is only one event. We've seen sort of subdued transactional revenues for quite some time if you remember it really started back in the summer when we saw some wild volatility in the US markets, but also in Asia and around the world. Those levels have remained low. They picked up a little bit this quarter. It was benefited from some mark to market in our deferred comp. So if you look at the core trends they remain still quite low and subdued. So, I would tell you that we put a good quarter despite the low level of engagement with that we\u2019re seeing. And we haven\u2019t really seen a material pick up just yet. James Gorman : I would just add from watching this stuff. I would say the downside risk on the transaction revenue at this point is low. As Jon said it was very subdued in the last several months. The upside risk is whatever it is, if currency engages. So, I don't mean there's a lot of downside from this point, on transaction and we would just see how the macro events that clearly move the investors psychology pretty significantly through this year and as we all know sadly there have been lot of things in the news. Mike Mayo : And then last question, you had a good quarter, but still just an ROE of 8.3%, I think I heard you reiterate the 9% to 11% target for 2017, so what's left. I guess you have $1 billion of targeted savings for project streamline. How much has been achieved of that and what\u2019s left just in general, how do you still get to that 9% to 11% ROE from here? James Gorman : Mike, I think we've had this question before. But, listen, it was an okay quarter. I don't, honesty I think it was good in bids. The ROE of 8.3% against the standards that we were shooting pricing was okay. It feels good in this environment, but the 8.3% also recall as Jon pointed out the tax rate was pretty high this quarter. And we had the preferred in there this quarter. So you've got a lot of things going on, is there upside from here? Obviously, we have a pretty concrete game plan on the quarter around going forward around what we can do in wealth management where rates ultimately will impact the pipeline that we have in the investment banking calendar, and I think the broader changes going on in the global investment banking industry. And I think Morgan Stanley is emerging from that pack if you will as one of the institutions that is strengthening at this point. So, but again, we are not speaking to the third quarter numbers here obviously. We are speaking to the outlook as you point out over next year and we stand by our 9% to 11% by the end of 2017. Mike Mayo : I'm sorry. Project streamline what you have left or what have you achieved? James Gorman : Yes, it\u2019s still going. There's some very tactical stuff going and Jon might want to talk about where we are in some of the broader project streamline. But we've had, I described the wind so far as being largely tactical stuff that it\u2019s easy to execute. The longer term infrastructure changes are progressing Jon\u2019s, it\u2019s all reporting into Jon now, so why don't I just let him talk about it. Jonathan Pruzan : Thanks. So Mike, you heard some of the comments in my script about some of the things that we\u2019re doing and the progress we are making. I think the best way to look at it is both comp and non-comp on the non-comp if you look at year-to-date results were down about $350 million versus last year. A good chunk of that related to these streamline initiatives and litigation. There is clearly a benefit unfortunately from a lower revenue number, but there is good progress in the non-comp side. On the comp side, also a reflection of revenues, but as you heard, the ISG comp ratio year to date is 36% versus I think it was 38% ex-DVA last year year-to-date. So good discipline on the comp and good discipline on the expenses and we're confident that we're going to be able to hit the $1 billion target. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. One last one on FIC. I know you're not going to give us the number, but I'm looking for anything directional on, profitability must have improved a lot given headcounts down 25%, RWA is down a lot and revenues are now well. I wonder if you could help on any soft comments about overall profitability? Jonathan Pruzan : I think you characterized it well. Glenn Schorr : No number. Okay. In the past you've had a lot of seasonality in your FIC numbers. Part of that was the commodities business and you have since sold Oil Merchanting, I\u2019m just curious, not for next quarter, but just as a general comment the pacing of that $4 billion a year target goal, whatever you want to call it. Will it be a little bit more balanced than in the past? Jonathan Pruzan : I think you highlight the most important factor. This is a volatile business, no doubt that we had incremental volatility given some of the commodities businesses that we were in, so we would expect less volatility, but again, I think we've answered what our goal is in our target for that business. Glenn Schorr : Okay Jon. The nice drop in RWA in the quarter is down 5%. 15% year-on-year, but GAAP assets had actually increased, I think in your prepared remarks you said something about supporting client activity related to Brexit, but just curious if you could expand on that a little bit, RWA following GAAP assets up more... Jonathan Pruzan : Unfortunately, it's just math. We continue to make progress on our initiatives to take out some of the high, higher density if you will RWA assets. At the end of the quarter, we saw a spike as you said supporting our clients, a lot of that was in sort of low intensity RWA assets and that sort of drives the discrepancy there. Glenn Schorr : Okay. So the trend of the RWA going down is what you should focus on anyway. And then, maybe last quickie is two quick number ones, in the past I think the difference between your our ROE and your ROTC is in the range of 130, 140 basis points, nothing should change that right, we should be about that same spread now, just because everybody else gives their return intangible I want, just wanted to do apples to apples. Jonathan Pruzan : Sure. Again, it's just math. We\u2019ve got about $9.5 million of average intangibles and goodwill and if you do the math you get that 130 basis points. Glenn Schorr : All right, awesome. Thanks Jon. Jonathan Pruzan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Christian Bolu : Great, good morning guys. So couple more questions on costs. The operating leverage in ISG was pretty impressive. Is that 35.5% comp ratio and remotely sustainable on a go-forward basis if FIC revenues are modestly weaker? And then, also if you can comment on any cost implications of FIC in the CCAR issues? Jonathan Pruzan : I will go first. I\u2019ll do them in reverse. So on CCAR as James mentioned, we do have to resubmit by the end of the year. That will take some resources both dollars and people. I think it's a little too early for us to try to size that and whether that has an impact on streamline, so we'll come back to you as we get more deeply engaged in that. We clearly have started to work and are focused on it and will dedicate the appropriate or required resources that we need to make sure that we are successful in our resubmission. On the second point, I think the target that we laid out is the 37% - ISG comp ratio year-to-date 36% I think looking over the total year is more important than any given quarter but we are also benefiting from the headcount changes that we made in the fourth quarter. And we do think that this is a sustainable ratio and that we will continue to pay for talent and be able to retain and attract talent going forward. Christian Bolu : Perfect, very helpful. I'm not sure if I caught this right, but on the cash equity business, did you say it was up sequentially, pretty surprising given industry volumes were lower just I was curious if you guys gaining share or any particular initiatives anything you can buck the general industry trends. Jonathan Pruzan : Yes, you did hear me correctly. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we were up. We had some improved new issue, volumes were up a little bit that was helpful and less volatility. So yes we were up. Christian Bolu : Okay, thank you. And then just very quick clean-up question, the trump redemption, what does that show up in the income statement? Jonathan Pruzan : We announced it last night. We're going to call it's going to be, there are two different call based but by the middle of August that will all be gone. As I said, they carry a $6.20 blended cost and you\u2019ll start to see that in the third quarter \u2013 just the lack of it in the third quarter. Christian Bolu : But just from an income statement geography perspective, where does that show up? Is that in the treatment revenues? Jonathan Pruzan : No, that's an interest expense. You will see it in that line, although again, it\u2019s $2.8 billion on a stack of $160 billion or certainly unsecured and then secured debt. So it will flow through that line. It\u2019s clearly helpful since the $6.20 we're issuing depending on tender issuing that closer to 3% to 3.5% at this point. The trucks have lost most of certainly all of their Tier 1 treatment and most of their Tier 2 treatment and that was going to continue to phase out so it's sort of expensive debt at this point which is why we obviously redeemed it. Christian Bolu : Okay great. Thank you very much and congrats on a strong quarter. Jonathan Pruzan : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Carrier : Thanks guys. Jon, maybe first question, just on the capital ratios you see Q1 up to 15.8, at least in the U.S. obviously at the extreme end. If we do get some opportunity as we get into next year that you get to release a chunk, when you think about where that ratio is, where your SLR is, and if you are able to release capital from a business mix standpoint, do you feel like you guys are where you need to be and the gist of it is if you are able to release the capital obviously you will see one can come down but your SLR will be somewhat impacted. And then just wanted to when you look at the business mix and how you're positioned for that potential opportunity, do you feel like you are situated in a relatively well? Jonathan Pruzan : I think despite, we clearly put together our business mix and our business model based on the best estimate of what the future is going to look like. We were very happy that we returned more capital this year versus last year, and we\u2019ve done it four years in a row. We're going to continue to try to do that. As you've heard James and I talk about, we are expecting some changes in CCAR. We expect to hear something in this half of the year about how the G-SIB is going to be incorporated into the stress test, how SLR is going to be incorporated into the stress test. So I think there is some unknowns out there in terms of which of these ratios will ultimately be the binding constraint, but I think the business mix that we put together is the right mix and if we have to adapt it we will but it is the right mix to generate 9 to 11 ROE that we are targeting. Michael Carrier : Okay that's helpful. And then just a quick one on the wealth management business if you will. You guys hit on cost and the margins, I think James you mentioned in terms of the transaction part of the business, they\u2019re relatively low just given retail engagement. On the flipside, it seems like for the industry we will see a continued trend and maybe an accelerating trend from commission based accounts into fee-based account. So just wanted to kind of balance the - what type of growth we could potentially see on that side which is maybe more annuity like versus the more volatile transaction side of business. And then, for the advisors, do you expect any consolidation in the industry and probably away from your type of platform but to other platforms and then some compensation pressure just given the different models out there? Jonathan Pruzan : So I\u2019ll try to tackle some of the components of that. We have, as you know, we\u2019ve seen a very good trend into fee-based accounts. We are currently at about 40% of our client assets are in fee-based, the 820 which is a new high for us. We saw acceleration of those flows in the second quarter. I think it's a little early to predict what GOL is going to do those flows. There is a scenario that would help accelerate those flows into the fee based businesses, but again it's really around client choice and we\u2019ll see how that plays out. We do believe again the secular trends and a lot of the driving force behind the merger, the acquisition of the Smith Barney platform was that people want advice, and they want and we needed to be of scale. And those are the two drivers that drove that transaction and we're still of the view that that is the longer term trend here. So it's still got time to play out. We feel good about the investments that we are making around the GOL but I think it\u2019s still little early to say. What we have said from a client perspective and a results perspective we do believe it's a manageable impact. James Gorman : And the industry will keep consolidating because this is a high fixed cost industry. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Matt Burnell : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just I guess an administrative question on the trust preferreds, will there be any charges related to the calling of the trust preferreds? Jonathan Pruzan : Yes, we highlighted in our fixed income call that on that redemption. There will be some write down of some amortized fees and we will take that. It's not a material number but there will be a charge for that. Matt Burnell : Okay, thank you. And then in terms of wealth management, the commission and fee line was down about 4% year-over-year. Even though you do have positive growth in fee-based client account assets, is there a mix shift going on particularly in the fee based client account asset portfolios that is causing a little bit of pressure on the asset management revenue line within wealth management? Jonathan Pruzan : It's sort of hard to parse through. I think the primary drivers are really the underwriting calendar and the subdued engagement levels that have been driving that activity. Matt Burnell : Okay. And then just finally from me, could you give us an update on the energy exposure and whether or not that has had any effect on the reported lending balances in the supplement? Jonathan Pruzan : Sure. So as I mentioned, better credit performance this quarter than last quarter. From a metric standpoint, we're down to about $30.5 billion in energy loans and commitments. That's down from $14.8 billion last quarter. That\u2019s being driven by pay downs, terminations and sales. The broad characteristics of that portfolio are generally the same, i.e. about 60% of that is to investment grade counterparties, about 30% of that is funded. In terms of the mix that we've given historically around held for investment versus fair value held for sale, the held for sale fair value portfolio is down a little bit. It\u2019s about a 35% that's obviously being driven by some of the sales that we have made in that portfolio.  E&P also a good story there, down to $3.5 billion from the $4.1 billion that we reported earlier. So we continue to make progress in reducing some of our exposures in that sector. Just as a proxy, last quarter we took about $127 million allowance for loan loss. We told you back then that a lot of that was being driven by our energy exposures. This quarter we took a $3 million allowance. So, clearly much better performance than last quarter. Matt Burnell : Sure, thank you for the detail. Just one follow-up Jon, you've got about 40% of the portfolio that\u2019s in fair value. How much of the benefit or how much was FIC results benefited from a lower mark-to-market on the energy portfolio specifically? Jonathan Pruzan : As I said, about 35% of that portfolio is fair value held for sale and that does flow through the revenue line item but I wouldn't say it was significant. Matt Burnell : Okay thank you very much. Jonathan Pruzan : I'm sorry. It\u2019s the other revenue line item. Matt Burnell : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Can you give an update on the bank effort in wealth management? You have continued good loan growth this quarter, deposits were down a little bit versus last quarter but still up nicely year-over-year. Just how you're feeling about the outlook for both loan and deposit growth going forward. Jonathan Pruzan : Sure. So as I mentioned, $3 billion of loan growth this quarter, $5 billion year-to-date, continued good growth there and I think we feel pretty good about that trend. As I mentioned, our NII guidance that we gave as part of the fixed income deck, we still feel good about that. On the deposit side, second quarter we usually see a dip that\u2019s being driven by the tax season. So at $150 billion, down $2 billion that was a primary driver. I think the investments that we are making into digital and some of the cash management products make us feel good about our ability to continue to grow broadly our deposit base and again I think the bank strategy has been a real bright spot for us and we would expect that to continue going forward. Matt O'Connor: Just a couple of number clarification questions. How much were the mark-to-market gains on the deferred comp and wealth management this quarter? And are there offsets on the expense side or is that \u2013 does not follow the bottom line? Jonathan Pruzan : Yes, there are definitely offsets on the expense side. It's generally the net impact is generally reasonably small, and we don't break out that number given the relative size. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just lastly, the premium amortization that was a drag within wealth management, what was that this quarter versus last quarter or recent periods? Jonathan Pruzan : Again, it was clear as rates drop this quarter, prepayment fees increased and that was the driver of it in the first quarter and rates were pretty stable. So again, that was what caused the NII to be flat this quarter. Matt O'Connor: Okay. But you won\u2019t give the magnitude of that? Jonathan Pruzan : No. Matt O'Connor: Okay. All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Jim Mitchell : Hi, good morning. May be we could just sort of dig into the RWA decline this quarter, I think you were down $20 billion, FIC was down $8 billion, so you actually had more outside of FIC. So when I think about high density RWA, I think typically that would be more in FIC. So just maybe help us understand where the RWA decline is coming outside of FIC and is there more of that to go? Jonathan Pruzan : I think the $20 billion, another way to think about it is about half of that came from credit RWAs and that was a combination of FIC mostly in the securitization area but also from event. Lending, our balances are down in that business given the light activity. And then the other half was really around the market RWAs which is a function of both the balance as well as the stress bar which was down a little bit. Jim Mitchell : Is that sustainable outside of FIC the stress bar and those kind of drivers or is there more to go I guess outside of FIC? Because we know your targets are FIC I'm just trying to get a sense of the non-FIC? Jonathan Pruzan : Again, on the non-FIC the event is going to be driven by activity level. So I think the RWA number that we used was, I don't even remember, in the mid 350s and that number I think is sustainable given what we see in the outlook. Jim Mitchell : Okay, so it's going to be episodic? Jonathan Pruzan : It will be but I wouldn\u2019t expect to see dramatic movements unless there is significant changes in volatility. I think the composition of our book as you said we are making some minor, we continue to bring down our FIC RWAs but we made a lot of progress there, so I would expect it to be pretty comparable. Jim Mitchell : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. In this year's CCAR exam, it looked like your leverage ratio was under the adversely stress scenario, but I was approaching the lower bound and obviously that might be exacerbated a bit by the capital return although maybe there's some [indiscernible]. But could you just clarify how you're thinking about leverage particularly as it relates to the regulatory regime? Jonathan Pruzan : Sure. I covered a little bit of this in one of my prior answers. I think what you have to remember we are managing multiple ratios. We have the risk weighted asset ratios, we have the leverage ratio, we have SLR, how that gets incorporated into CCAR is going to be important. But I think the critical point to recognize here is we did increase our capital return this year and our minimum ratios through the stress test actually improved across the board, both the Tier 1 and RWA ratios but also the leverage ratio was up about 30 basis points. So we continue to accumulate capital and that's really a reflection of the business mix in the de-risking that we\u2019ve undertaken. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. Thank you for that. Another project streamline question, are the costs being removed more or less coincident with the initiatives, or are the initiatives sort of proceeding it and over the many 200 or so that you\u2019ve identified, how many of them are in process and how far along what ending are we in in terms of the actual initiatives themselves? Jonathan Pruzan : I think these are being - these are proactive actions that we are taking, so I think we are driving this change. I mentioned the datacenters that we're closing, the workforce deployment strategy that we are implementing. So these are proactive steps that we are taking given the simplification of our business model. In terms of innings, I would say unclear. We are in the early stages, we made progress and we are confident on reaching our $1 billion target in 2017. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Jonathan Pruzan : Not a big baseball fan. Eric Wasserstrom : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Nomura. Your line is open. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. Jonathan Pruzan : Good morning. Steven Chubak : Jon, I wanted to follow-up regarding some the questions on capital. So first on the G-SIB surcharge, it looked like as of year-end, you are right on the cusp of the 3% threshold. And given the reduction that we've seen over the last couple of quarters and many of your more risk intensive assets, where do you believe the surcharge is today and how you are thinking about managing to that going forward given some of the opportunities not just to mitigate but potentially to even grow in some of the trading areas as competitors return? Jonathan Pruzan : As you said, our surcharge for 2016 is 3%. As we said in the past, we're going to continue to try to manage and mitigate that if we can. And so if there are opportunities to bring that number down or change that number, we will obviously take a hard look at it. Steven Chubak : Got it, okay. And then, one follow-up regarding some of the remarks you made to Eric\u2019s last question. Given that leverage was your binding constraint in the latest exam and that the Fed is incorporating as you noted a tougher SLR requirement, it still looks to us that even if we include the G-SIB surcharge in full pre-mitigation that the SLR or leverage could still be your binding constraint. And I just want to get a better sense as to whether the mitigation plans that you outlined are still on track I believe it was at the early part of the year and the strategic review on the SLR within FIC and are there other opportunities that you see to drive that lower given that that could actually prove to be the determinant of how much capital you need to hold? Jonathan Pruzan : Again, I think I tried to answer this question clearly not as well as people had liked. Until we actually see what the new requirements are in CCAR, that question is challenging. We do have initiatives in place in fixed income to bring down the SLR. We did build capital on a leverage ratio this year versus last year through the test how the SLR is incorporated will be a driver of some of the decisions we make going forward. And the buffer is as you know is on the risk weighted asset ratios, not on the leverage ratio. So I think we need to see a little bit more before we can be more precise. Steven Chubak : Thanks, Jon. And one follow-up for me on the wealth management side. James, actually at the Morgan Stanley financials conference, you made a comment regarding loan penetration levels among some of your retail clients. I think the numbers were 2% for mortgage and 16% for SBLs. The 16% number actually struck me a bit high and yet we continue to see really strong growth within that channel. As we think about modeling out the long term growth opportunity here, what should we think or what do you believe a reasonable penetration level that you can achieve across both of these channels to drive further growth? James Gorman : I don't know that I want to try and put out a penetration on this be it loans. I actually don't agree that it's a high number. It reflects the mix in the business as you move from single stock marginal lending to portfolio annuitized asset based lending. The SBL is going to go up and margin as you would think would go down, actually our margin book has been relatively stable, but the SBL is just a function. We have a lot of wealthy clients who have positions they don't want to liquidate, they want to invest in other things, they want to use money for lots of different sources and whether it's purchasing assets or whatever, so I'm not terribly surprised by it [indiscernible]. Steven Chubak : That's very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. James Gorman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's Q&A session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Jonathan Pruzan : I think we're good to everybody. Thank you. We will see you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation.",

Operator : Good morning. My name is Andrew and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Eaton Vance Corporation's Third Fiscal Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Dan Cataldo, Treasurer, you may begin your conference. Dan Cataldo : Great, thank you and good morning and welcome to our 2016 fiscal third quarter earnings call and webcast. Here this morning are Tom Faust, Chairman and CEO of Eaton Vance Corp; and Laurie Hylton, our CFO. We will first comment on the quarter and then we will take your questions. The full earnings release and charts we will refer to during the call are available on our website, eatonvance.com, under the heading Press Releases. Today's presentation contains forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainties in our business, including but not limited to those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings, including our 2015 Annual Report and Form 10-K, are available on our website or at request at no charge. I'll now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Faust : Good morning, and thank you, for joining us. Our fiscal third quarter ending July 31, was in many respects a strong period for Eaton Vance. The $0.56 of adjusted earnings per diluted share we reported for the quarter is an increase of 17% over the second quarter and just a penny shy of what we earned in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Our fiscal third quarter net inflows of $7.1 billion are the third best quarterly close in the company history and represented 9% annualized organic growth rate. Excluding Parametric\u2019s lower fee and more variable exposure management business, our net flows were $5.3 billion an 8% annualized internal growth rate and still among the highest four quarters in the company history. Reflecting the quarter\u2019s positive net flows and favorable market action during the period, our consolidated assets under management grew to a record $334.4 billion at July 31, a 5% increase over the prior quarter end and up 7% from the year earlier. Drilling down into our quarterly flow results, the biggest contributors were portfolio implementation with net inflows of $2.7 billion, fixed income with net inflows of $2.4 billion and exposure management with $1.8 million of net inflows. Within fixed income flow leaders included high-yield bond mandates, municipal and corporate ladders, and active muni strategies. Equity net inflows of $300 million were led by Parametric defensive equity, Atlanta Capital core equity and EVM balance in large-cap growth strategies. Alternative strategy net inflows of $200 million were driven by our two global macro mutual funds. Floating rate income strategies had net outflows of 500 million, while an improvement from net outflows of $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion in the two preceding quarters were still a long way from where we think our floating rates flows should be given a strong investment case for the floating rate bank loan asset class and our top performance record among leading bank loan managers. We believe floating rate bank loans now present one of the most compelling value propositions, among all our investment offerings. They are an attractive source of income and portfolio diversification, are not subject to rate driven price declines as interest rates move up and are senior unsecured in the issuance capital structure reducing exposure to credit risk. With LIBOR continuing to edge its way out we aren\u2019t far from short-term interest rate levels at which bank loan investors will start to see a pickup in distribution rates. In sum, we believe the conditions are falling into place for floating rate income to begin contributing favorably to our net flows. In addition to positive business and financial results, we continued to report strong performance from many of our leading investment strategies. At the end of July we had 58 funds with overall MorningStar ratings of four or five stars for at least one class of shares including 24 funds rated five stars. As measured by total return at July 31, 84% of our managed mutual fund assets ranked in the top half of their MorningStar peer group on a one-year basis and 79%, 74% and 72% in the top half over 3, 5 and 10 years respectively. Top quartile performance results were achieved by 39%, 55%, 48% and 52% of managed fund assets over 1, 3, 5, and 10 years respectively. One investment team with standout performance worth highlighting is Hexavest, the Montr\u00e9al-based global equity manager in which we acquired a 49% interest in 2012. At the end of July, Eaton Vance Hexavest global equity fund Class I was outperforming its MorningStar category average by over 950 basis points for one year and almost 270 basis points annually over three years. Hexavest's portfolios were exceptionally well-positioned going into and coming out of the Brexit vote in the UK building upon what was already a strong year. Prior to their affiliation with Eaton Vance, Hexavest made a name for itself by outperforming during periods of market disruption. Their performance over the past year demonstrates a continuing ability to do that on a recurring basis. We are confident that Hexavest's strong performance will provide a catalyst for renewed interest in this highly differentiated global equity manager. In our last quarterly call, I outlined some of the major challenges facing the asset management industry. These include a shift in investor demand from active to passive strategies, pressures on fees in both active and passive, a growing industry regulatory burden and rising costs of doing business. Unfortunately, nothing has changed over the last three months to lead me to believe that these challenges are going to abate anytime soon. Even with these headwinds however, the asset manager, asset management industry is big enough and diverse enough to permit some industry players to prosper. Last quarter I talked about the four initiatives we are undertaking to position Eaton Vance to be one or one of the winners in this new more challenging world of asset management. These are first, capitalizing on our industry-leading investment performance and distribution strengths to grow sales and gain market share in active strategies; second, becoming a more global company by building our investment and distribution capabilities outside the United States; third, extending the success we have had with our custom beta lineup of rules-based individually managed accounts to achieve this platform's major potential; and fourth, finishing the job to make NextShares as the vehicle of choice for investors in actively managed funds in the U.S. Let me take a few minutes to update you on where we are with each of these four initiatives. Regarding the first priority, building our actively managed investment business it is important to understand that this business is enormous and that huge sales opportunities continue to exist and there is no reason we cannot grow from our current market share of less than 1% even if the overall market continues to decline. Focusing just on actively managed long-term funds in the U.S. this is a $10.7 trillion AUM market with net sales in the range of $2.6 trillion annually. With net outflows in the first half of 2016 annualizing at a rate of about $170 billion, the market is contracting at a rate of approximately 1.5% a year, but the overall industry flow numbers don't tell the full story. There remain numerous asset classes where active strategies continue to compete effectively against passive alternatives and continue to attract positive flows. In many of those asset classes Eaton Vance is an established player with high-performing strategies. In fact, in the 15 top-selling MorningStar mutual fund categories, Eaton Vance today offers 20 four and five star rated funds. Even as the actively managed fund industry continues to contract, we see no reason why we can't grow our active business. In the third fiscal quarter we realized aggregate net inflows into active strategies of $1.1 billion which equates to 2.5% organic growth rate [indiscernible] we know we can do better. Our second area of strategic focus is becoming more global. Even though we see lots of room to grow our U.S. business, there are also major opportunities to power our investment capabilities internationally. In addition to owning 49% of Montr\u00e9al-based Hexavest, Eaton Vance operates internationally from our offices in London, Singapore and Sydney. Until recently, our presence outside the United States consisted primarily of sales and client service personnel. That is quickly changing however. By the end of this year we expect to have 26 EVM investment professionals located outside the United States up from just three at the end of 2014. Locating investors around the world not only puts us in closer touch with local market developments it also contributes immeasurably to accessing and serving local clients. On the distribution side, in July we announced a new leader for Eaton Vance's London-based global sales organization, TJ Halbertsma who will join us in September. As mentioned in the call last quarter we are also pursuing adding sales and client service personnel in Japan, our largest market outside the U.S. We see a world of opportunity in international markets and are investing to position Eaton Vance to capitalize. Our third major strategic initiative is what we call Custom Beta. As I described last quarter, custom beta encompasses rules based, separately managed account strategies offered to retail and high net worth investors. Our Custom Beta lineup includes Parametric tax managed and nontax managed custom core equities and EVM managed municipal bond and corporate bond ladders. While this is a comparatively low fee business, it is an area that we believe has vast potential as investors and advisors increasingly demonstrate a preference for passive management. Compared to index ETFs and index mutual funds our Custom Beta offerings give clients the ability to tailor their exposures to meet personal preferences and needs. For equity accounts the customization may include active tax management and portfolio tilts to reflect the client's responsible investing criteria or the client's other portfolio holdings. Unlike ETFs and mutual funds Custom Beta separate accounts can pass through harvested tax losses to offset client gains and other investments. For Custom Beta income accounts, the fixed income market exposures obtained through directly held municipal or corporate bonds in a ladder portfolio customized to fit the client's maturity and credit profile preferences. An added benefit of our Custom Beta offerings is that accounts can be funded in kind thereby helping reduce transition costs and taxes for the client. For both clients and advisors, our Custom Beta strategies offer compelling advantages over ETFs and index funds. In the third quarter, Custom Beta strategies attracted net inflows of $1.8 billion, which equates to a 19% organic growth rate. From a current AUM base of just under $42 billion we see huge growth opportunities in Custom Beta as we further build out our distribution network and product offering. Our fourth major strategic initiative is NextShares exchange traded managed funds. As a reminder, NextShares are a new type of fund that for the first time combined proprietary active management with the conveniences and potential performance and tax advantages of exchange traded. Our NextShares solution subsidiary holds patents in other intellectual property rights related to NextShares and is seeking to commercialize NextShares by entering into license and servicing agreements with Eaton Vance and other fund sponsors. The first three NextShares funds were launched by Eaton Vance and began trading on NASDAQ in February and March of this year. In the third fiscal quarter we made good progress in our efforts to gain broader distribution for NextShares. In May Interactive Brokers Group an automated global electronic broker and market maker announced plans to offer NextShares to retail investors and financial professionals through its investing and trading platforms. We expect Interactive Brokers to begin making NextShares available by the end of the summer. In July, UBS Financial Services announced plans to offer NextShares through its network of 7100 financial advisors in the United States. NextShares will initially be offered on the UBS brokerage platform in the first part of 2017 and then on its advisory platform later in the year. Constructive conversations with other major intermediaries continue and we hope to be in a position to announce additional distribution arrangements soon. Other NextShares developments of note in the quarter include adding UBS asset management to the stable of fund sponsors announcing their intent to offer NextShares and our announced agreement with the investment consulting firm NEPC for them to lead a selection process to identify potential managers to sub advise a series of new Eaton Vance sponsored NextShares funds. Conversations with other major fund sponsors about offering NextShares continue and we've certainly been boosted by the recent distribution announcements. The three NextShares funds we launched early this year now have four to five months of live investment and share trading experience, both of which have been consistent with expectations. All three NextShares funds are comfortably outperforming in the lowest cost share class of the corresponding mutual fund and their shares are trading at consistently tight bid as spreads and there are premium discounts to fund NAV. As expanded distribution comes on board, we expect to transition our NextShares initiative from a conceptual success into a significant business success. We continue to believe that NextShares have the potential to transform the delivery of actively managed funds in the U.S. At Eaton Vance's summer sales meeting earlier this month, the theme was Strategies for What's Next. I don't believe there is any investment manager that is better positioned for what's next in our industry than Eaton Vance. Our third quarter results demonstrate that we are on the right track and I see no reason why we can't continue to succeed as we make further progress advancing our key initiatives. That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Laurie. Laurie Hylton : Thank you, Tom and good morning. As detailed in our earnings release, in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.55 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.56. The $0.01 difference between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings reflects the add-back of closed-end fund structuring fees paid in the quarter. This quarter's adjusted earnings per diluted share were up 17% from the $0.48 we reported for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and down 2% from $0.57 in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Average managed assets of $324.9 billion for the third quarter were up 5% in comparison with the prior fiscal quarter, driving both revenue growth and margin improvement. Revenue increased by 6% sequentially reflecting higher average managed assets, two additional fee days in the quarter and approximately $2.7 million in performance fees. Excluding performance fees the average effected investment in bonds were administrative fee rates were substantially unchanged from the prior quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 14% sequentially, reflecting continuing tight control over discretionary spending and the operating leverage inherent in our business. All in all, a strong showing versus the previous quarter. Comparing third quarter results to the same period last year, the benefit of 5% growth in average managed assets was more than offset by declines in average fee rates. As you can see in attachment 10 to our press release, our average annualized effective investment advisory and administrative fee rate declined to 36 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 from 39 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Product mix continues to be the most significant determinant of our overall average fee rate, although fluctuations in the number of fee days in a quarter can also contribute to short-term variability. Within the fixed income category, lower average fee rates year-over-year primarily reflects strong growth of our comparatively low fee laddered municipal and corporate separately managed accounts. In the floating rate income category, lower average fee rates were primarily driven by net redemptions from bank loan funds. Performance fees, which are excluded from the calculation of our average effective fee rates, contributed $2.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to $1.7 million in the third quarter of last year. On an overall basis, our third quarter revenue was down 4% year-over-year and adjusted operating income was 7% lower. In the third quarter, we've realized 3% annualized internal revenue growth, as the revenue contribution from new sales during the quarter exceeded revenue loss from redemptions and other withdrawals. Despite continuing expected declines in average fee rates, we believe we can continue to sustain positive organic revenue growth, provided the withdrawals from our higher fee strategies don't accelerate. Turning to expenses. In the third quarter, our compensation expense was substantially unchanged from the second quarter fiscal 2016, and down 2% from the third quarter of fiscal 2015, driven by lower incentive compensation accruals and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. Compensation expense decreased to 36% of revenue this quarter from 38% last quarter, mostly as a function of the increase in revenue. Controlling our compensation costs and other discretionary spending, obviously remains top of mind as we move into the fourth quarter. Our third quarter distribution expense was up 12% sequentially and 1% year-over-year, and included $2.3 million of structuring fees paid in connection with our closed-end fund offering in May. Excluding these costs, distribution expense was up 4% from the prior quarter and down 6% from the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Other operating expenses were up 3% sequentially and 1% year-over-year, primarily reflecting increases in information technology spend related to corporate initiatives. In terms of specific initiatives spending, expenses related to NextShares totaled approximately $2.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to $1.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and $2 million in the third quarter of last year. Our operating margin improved to 31.3% in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 from 29.6% last quarter, reflecting both revenue expansion and fiscal discipline. Absent the $2.3 million in closed-end fund structuring fees paid in the third quarter, our operating margin for this quarter would have been 32%. We continue to see opportunities for modest margin expansion given higher managed asset levels and continuing tight control over discretionary spending. In the context of flat markets for the remainder of the fiscal year, we see the potential for an incremental bump in margin to something closer to 33% in the fourth quarter. As we repeatedly caution, however, approximately 45% to 50% of our tax total expenses are variable, driven by managed asset levels, gross sales or operating income. But there are number of factors that can dampened margins no matter how disciplined we remain in terms of our discretionary spending. Net income and gains on seed capital investments contributed $0.01 to earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, $0.02 in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and were negligible in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. When quantifying the impact of our seed capital investments on earnings each quarter, we take into consideration our pro rata share of the gains, losses and other investment income earned on investments and sponsored products, but are accounted for as consolidated funds, separate accounts or equity investments as well as the gains and losses recognized on derivatives used to hedge these investments. We then report the per share impact, net of noncontrolling interest expense and income taxes. We continue to hedge the market exposures of our seed capital portfolio to the extent practicable to minimize the effect on quarterly earnings. Excluding the effects of CLO entity earnings and losses, our effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 was 38.5% as compared to 38.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and 38.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. We currently anticipate that our effective tax rate adjusted for CLO earnings and losses will be approximately 38.5% for fiscal 2016 as a whole. In terms of capital management, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of nonvoting common stock for approximately $61 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Over the past four quarters, we have repurchased 8.7 million shares for $296.2 million, driving our average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter down by 4% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The 113.2 million of shares outstanding at the end of this quarter are down 3% from the 116.6 million reported a year ago, and down 1% from the 113.9 million reported on April 30, 2016. We finished the third fiscal quarter holding $476.4 million of cash in short-term debt securities and approximately $279 million in seed capital investments. Our outstanding debt consists of $250 million of 6.5% senior notes due in 2017 and $325 million of 3.625% senior notes due in 2023. We also have a $300 million 5-year line of credit, which is currently undrawn. Given our strong cash flow, liquidity and overall financial condition, we believe are well-positioned to continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This concludes our prepared comments. At this point, we'd like to take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi good morning. Sort of a higher-level question/observation. On Slide 3 of the deck, you show pretty substantial asset growth. Just looking over the last 5 years, it's up 77% since 2011. As we look at the EPS earnings is essentially unchanged. EPS in the first two quarters of 2011 is basically equivalent to the first three quarters of 2016. So you show and highlight great AUM growth, number of new initiatives. We are not seeing a great translation of the AUM growth into earnings growth. You've called out the mix shift a number of times. As we think about the look forward, how should we think about the way you monetize the asset growth so that we're getting better translation into earnings? And as we think about the opportunities to kind of manage both the costs as well as the investments, is there something to be said about you going from a period of investing into more harvesting? Is that maybe a concept we should think about to improve that translation? Tom Faust : Okay, this is Tom. I'll take a crack at responding. I guess, first thing to observe, starting on your comment about the AUM growth on Slide 3, recall that we did an acquisition in the early part of fiscal 2013. We bought the former Clifton group. How much did that add in assets? Dan Cataldo : $32 billion I think so. Tom Faust : $32 billion, so a big part of the jump in fiscal 2013 was from an acquisition. Everything since then is essentially organic growth. Clearly, the growth that we've achieved since, whatever starting point you want to choose has been higher on an asset base than it's based on a revenue base or an earnings base. With that Clifton acquisition, we really pretty substantially accelerated the move of our overall business toward what had been, primarily a, what I guess I would call, primarily a higher fee active business to more of a blend of active strategies and variations on passive strategy, generally with some customization. Because those come at lower price points than traditional active strategies and because those have grown over a period in which our active business has grown in some periods and shrunk in some business, probably grown modestly overall, I don't have that in front of me. Certainly, we haven't seen revenue growth over that time period that has matched the asset growth. So revenues are a function, no surprise of both changes in assets and changes in average fee rates, assets have grown nicely, fee rates have come down primarily reflecting mixed shift. Over that period, translating growth in revenues to growth in earnings, we've benefited from the fact that our share count has been moving down over that period, but we've also, as you point out, made significant and ongoing investments in some of these key initiatives that I described. NextShares, where we're spending roughly at a rate of $8 million to $10 million a year, our Custom Beta, which is really now in a mode where it's contributing nicely to profitability, our international efforts, which has involved essentially creating a fully staffed investment office in London what had previously been primarily a sales and service office. So those things don't come cheap. I wish I could tell you that we're on the verge of moving from an investment mode to a harvesting mode. I don't think that's likely accurate. We're certainly in a in a positive mode in our Custom Beta initiative. And but I don't \u2013 we're not we're not about to turn the corner and as far as I can tell in terms of NextShares moving to positive cash flow. We're still very optimistic about the potential there, but that won't be over the next couple of quarters that we turn positive there. And similarly the investment that we're making internationally is from a multi-year perspective. We hired - the biggest piece of that is we hired a global equity team a year ago, and we're in the process of building a track record. We've had \u2013 we've been able to move some assets from that team to that team rather from our U.S. operations, but we haven't as yet achieved significant inflows, because they're still building track record. So, we're making progress on many fronts. I wish, I could say that our earnings progress has matched our asset progress, but I feel like we\u2019re certainly advancing maybe on an overall basis relative to the industry and certainly we feel like we're advancing our long term potential through both the results that we\u2019re achieving and the steps we're taking to invest for our future. Ken Worthington : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. So, maybe if you could help us understand what's going on between both the distribution revenue line and the distribution expense line, they might normally move a little bit more in tandem, but distribution revenues are down 7%, expenses were up 1%? Just curious on how much of that is just kind of some seasonal stuff or just inter quarter stuff versus an actual trend of some fees going away with certain assets as being sold? Thanks. Tom Faust : Yes, so the biggest factor which we highlighted is there was a $2.3 million of distribution expense related to the closed-end fund that we offered in May. If you adjust for that, I don't know if there's anything else to really talk about of a special nature in the quarter. Dan Cataldo : I mean you did touch on a key point Glenn in that as the fund \u2013 the industry evolves and we sell less fund and shares with distribution and service fees, the revenue line \u2013 distribution service fee revenue line is going to go down. There will be a reduction in the distribution service fee expenses related to those share classes, but we continue to have distribution expenses outside of those that are related simply to the different share classes. And we do disclose in the 10-Q and 10-K the breakdown of the distribution expenses and that would be I think a good place to look to understand what part of the expenses are tied to distribution in service fee revenues versus what are just straight up distribution expenses. Glenn Schorr : Definitely we\u2019ll do, I appreciate that. Just may be a related one on an attachment 10 when you show the effect investment management advisory fee rates. At first glance I thought that the move towards more or the growth in the portfolio implementation exposure management funds would be the mix shift that would cause some of the fee pressure. But here it looks like there's some fee compression within just about every asset class. So, I'm curious on how much of that would you describe as a move into lower fee either funds or asset classes or has there been some actual price cuts across the franchises? Laurie Hylton : I think, the biggest move that you're seeing, Glenn, is in fixed income. And there we are seeing the move for the growth in some of our lower fee franchises and there we're really seeing the increase in our laddered munis and corporates and those are the significantly lower fee rates and our traditional fixed income and because it's growing faster than the rest of the fixed income portion of our complex you are going to see the compression there and that's really driving that. In terms of floating rate income, because we've had some weakness on the retail side, I think you're seeing support on the institutional side and the weakness on the retail side, and that's actually just sort of pushing the effective fee rate around a little bit because those are operating at different fee rate. Tom Faust : But I would say within mandates, forget mix, we're not getting any fee increases. And in some places we are lowering fees to match competition or to meet requests to do that, to be more competitive. And I think that's very consistent with broad industry trends. But for us, by far the biggest effect is really mix, both among categories and also to some extent within categories. Glenn Schorr : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks. This is Jeff Ambrose [ph] filling in for Mike. I just had a question on like the longer-term expense outlook. So if we assume flat market in your fiscal 2017, I guess where would you expect the core expense growth rate to shake out? Thanks. Laurie Hylton : I think, you have to keep in mind roughly 45% to 50% of our expenses are variable. So those are going to move with what's happening in terms of revenue and operating revenue and asset levels. In terms of our core, we've talked a little bit about the fact that we're doing everything we can to keep a very tight rein on our discretionary spend, but we clearly have got some significant initiatives that we have been making incremental investments in and we're likely to continue to do so for the next fiscal year, particularly the NextShares initiative. So, we're doing everything we can to keep our fixed and discretionary spending tight and not fees increases there. We're being extraordinarily cautious with headcount increases, but we do recognize that there are something\u2019s that are outside of our control because they're variable and some areas where we are going to need to continue to make investments because we believe that these are extremely important for the long-term viability of the company. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then just on like the high fee flows this quarter, the strong number there, and I guess, your outlook for those products, I guess, does your expectation for fee rate pressure, are they more favorable now given the strong close in the quarter in your outlook on what you're seeing there? Tom Faust : I'm going to say, generally, yes. I think, you're referring to the fact that I mentioned that our active business had positive net flows of a little over $1 billion or 2.5% organic growth rate. That's certainly an improvement from where we've been most of the last two years when outflows from primarily from bank loan funds have driven down and offset growth in other parts of our active business. Also last year, you may remember that emerging market equity strategies were pretty significant contributors to net outflows. That's essentially gone away as a negative. I think it was slightly positive in the year-to-date or at least the last couple of quarters. But bank loans are still a modest drag, and we continue to believe we're not on the verge of this happening as far as we can tell, but we continue to believe that bank loan flows will turn positive and as that happens, that's a pretty important swing factor for us in our overall growth rate and particularly our ability to grow our active business, and we've had great performance in bank loan strategies for the year-to-date. The asset class we think is positioned to be attractive with relatively high yield in a world where yield is very hard to find, still quite benign credit conditions, and because we're starting to see LIBOR creep up, we're closer and closer to the day when we'll start to see distribution rate increases in bank loan funds where you're not seeing that in a whole lot other fixed income asset classes. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi. Your line is open. Ryan Bailey : Good morning. This is actually Ryan Bailey filling in for Bill. Tom, you'd mentioned that conversations have been pretty strong with distributors following the UBS announcement. Wondering if you could give us some color around maybe some timelines for other distributors? Whether the DoL is still the major headwind to hold up? And how distributors are reacting to the fund's performance? Tom Faust : Yes. I can't be real specific. We don't, unfortunately, control the timing of when those conversations. We do think that we're, at least in a couple of cases, pretty close to having something to announce, but what pretty close means I can't be real specific about. You mentioned the Department of Labor, in the, let's call it six to 12 months leading up to the announcement back in April, I think it was of what the final group proposal was going to look like. There was definitely a chilling effect on our conversations with broker-dealers because they were uncertain as to the size, the scope, the nature of the change to their business that would come from the DoL fiduciary rule and particularly the amount of technology spend that they would have to undergo in connection with that. We're now I guess four or five months post knowing what the final rules are and I believe at this point there's a broad understanding, a broad consensus that NextShares fit in as a part or can be a part of the solution. Simply as a way to deliver active strategies in the lowest cost version that appeals to advisory accounts, which we expect to grow as a result of the DoL rule change that\u2019s certainly, the consensus view which we agree with. And we also think that there could be potential for NextShares to be part of the answer to traditional brokerage account because of the fact that NextShares are like ETFs but different from mutual funds effectively give broker-dealers the ability to set their own price so that they can level set distribution payments across the whole category of products in a way that they can't do today for mutual funds because essentially every mutual fund has its own somewhat varying pricing structure and while it doesn't permit them to make adjustments or add or subtract cost in addition to what the fund charges. So on balance, we think the Department of Labor has moved from a pretty significant headwind in the short run, six to 12 months ago to a long-term positive, clearly and perhaps also, a short term benefit as well in terms of as broker dealers are looking for ways to position their business for this very important change coming in 2017, there is quite a bit of interest in NextShares as part of the solution to that. Ryan Bailey : Great. And could you give us some sort of color around what percentage of the AUM in those funds are seed versus third-party claims? Tom Faust : I didn't follow that. Say it again? Dan Cataldo : It was just what percentage of the AUM of the funds are seed? The vast majority of AUM in the funds now are Eaton Vance Corp.'s seed. The only platform over which the funds are available currently are folio institutional and folio and we felt it important to launch through them, but didn't realistically expect to see significant flows through that single platform. Ryan Bailey : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open. Christopher Shutler : Hi guys, good morning. Tom, maybe first could you just give us an update on the institutional pipeline in August flows to date? Tom Faust : Dan, you want to take that? Dan Cataldo : Sure. The institutional pipeline is certainly solid in particularly in the disciplines that we've been had recent success in. And I would point to high yield as probably the leader there. We continue to get interest on and off in floating rate, which is consistent with what we've experienced over the past several quarters. There are some, I think, interesting developments, which could provide sources of new institutional flows. First and foremost, Tom mentioned the great success \u2013 performance success Hexavest had this year. That's starting to generate increase in opportunities for our institutional group. Another area which we've seen some very good interest is institutional muni bond sales into Japan, which is starting to generate some meaningful flows. So, to think about high-yield, Hexavest municipal bond into Japan, believe it or not, we're getting some bank loan interest as well as interest in our global macro absolute return strategy. So I'd say solid and steady. And I don't know, Tom if you would add anything to that. Tom Faust : Yes, just a couple of things. First, to clarify the Japanese muni opportunity, that is taxable muni bonds. So from their perspective, it's \u2013 these are infrastructure investments, but they're offered by state and local government entities in the U.S. but it's an area where we've had some initial success and as Dan said, we've got a nice pipeline there. The other thing I would highlight is, we've developed a multi-asset credit capability and are starting to launch that in the institutional markets and are getting a positive response, multi-asset credit in our product lines means a combination of high yield bonds, bank loans and to some degree also investment grade bonds. And so, the concept is rather than investing separately in those asset classes and making allocation decisions at the customer level, turn it over to a team that has got real strength and market leadership in all of those areas and included as part of the mandate responsibility to tilt from one asset class to the other depending on our assessment of risk and opportunity. Christopher Shutler : Okay, got it, thanks. And then just one follow-up on the floating rate category. Tom, where do you think that the, I guess the LIBOR floors on those products today on average where they're around 100 basis points or so I think, is that right? Tom Faust : That's right, yes. We're \u2013 that's on average around 100. LIBOR, I think three months LIBOR is around 80 basis points currently. Christopher Shutler : Like 80, 82. Tom Faust : So we're pretty close with \u2013 I think, there is some maybe, if I remember right, 20%, 25% of the market where we've already effectively cleared the floor rate, but the vast majority of the market is still in that 100 basis point range. So potentially, it seems likely with the next Fed increase that we'll start to see some potential increases in distribution rates there. The other thing that's happening that maybe doesn't get a lot of attention, I think, there was an article about it recently in the Wall Street Journal is that LIBOR has been creeping up relative to Fed funds rate or other short term interest rates, primarily reflecting changes in the money market world. So if prime money market funds are no longer buyers or if those funds are shrinking in relation to government funds because of changes in regulation, that is having an effect that these people think that's what's driving it, that's having an effect to drive up commercial paper rates, driving up LIBOR funding rates, which comes to the benefit of bank loan fund investors. Christopher Shutler : And do you think that those products, some of the products still being below the floor is a bigger issue or do you think it's generally concerned around credit conditions recognizing whether those are funded or not? Tom Faust : We're not really hearing much about credit. I think, it's - the perception, I think, wrongly is that bank loan funds are investments you want to buy when you think rates are moving up, and there's a perception that rates aren't moving up. So I think it's more of that than anything else. So I don't think many advisors are hearing from their clients. I think, rates are going up 50 basis points, how can I prepare for that. We're still in a mode where we had a huge surge of bank loan business, I think, about $15 billion in our fiscal 2013 where there was this expectation of rising interest rates. There was a lot of money that is flooded into the asset class on the expectation that rates were going to be going up. But rates didn't go up, and I think, since then, we've still been sort of digesting that period of quite significant growth not only for us but for other investors in the asset class, because people have - in some sense they bought this for an eventuality that didn't happen, and they've been peeling back exposures to go into other things. Mostly that money at this point is \u2013 the short-term aspect of that money is probably pretty well flushed out. To me the opportunity here is investors and look at the asset class is offering diversification benefit, it did offer the potential for yield with both the protection that you're not going to lose money because of rising rates, and you can potentially get a yield pickup if the Fed acts again. Christopher Shutler : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Fannon : Thanks. My questions are just clarification around the margin outlook for next quarter. I think, you said assuming flat market I just wanted to make sure that's from quarter end as of kind of these levels? And then also, within the quarter comp came in below kind of where we were looking for. I was wondering if there was any onetime in that line item in the period? Laurie Hylton : Oh, hi. Yes, we are talking about flat market off of the end of the quarter. And in terms of the... Dan Fannon : End of July. Laurie Hylton : End of July, yes end of this current fiscal quarter. In terms of anything that really came through this quarter, there really wasn't. There was nothing in particular that was driving it down. I think, as we are looking at it as a percent of revenue, we talked about it. The fact that it actually dropped as a percentage of revenue is more a function of the fact that revenue went up as opposed to anything significant happening on the comp side. So there really wasn\u2019t anything that was one-time in there. Tom Faust : I think we did have some maybe some one-time related employment costs either severance or hiring costs that might have pushed that number up over the last couple of quarters that didn't recur on the same basis in the third quarter. Laurie Hylton : Yes last quarter it was 121.5 and this quarter is 121.8. We really didn't have anything, so we're really flat. Tom Faust : Yes, okay I have already said that wasn\u2019t much of a factor. I stand corrected. Dan Fannon : Got it and then just, Tom you mentioned profitability of NextShares, and I think, you said a couple of quarters out. I guess what is the reasonable time period based on some of the announcements you have, the momentum and pipeline I think you've cited, I guess, do you expect the expense levels to ramp from here kind of over the next 12 months or is this a steady state for NextShares and expenses and now the revenues need to catch up and what is a reasonable kind of breakeven across over threshold time period? Tom Faust : Yes, just to be clear, I didn't predict that we'd turn positive in a couple of quarters. I'm predicting that as far as I can see, there's no possibility of turning positive in the next couple of quarters, if you get that distinction. So, the key to profitability here is primarily on the revenue side, which is a function of - it's going to be a function of AUM. I don't see significant changes on the expense side, certainly, don't see that dropping materially over the next 12 months. If we're going to make a success of this, and we're determined to make a success of this, we'll have to start seeing assets and revenues in NextShares funds. The biggest impediment to that was and is distribution access. The biggest single event I would say in the history of NextShares after initial approval has been UBS announcement that came during the quarter, and it falls upon us to capitalize on that by working with UBS to make sure that their fund companies that they work closely with understand the opportunity to offer NextShares at UBS, but also to make the case to other broker-dealers that for the same reason this makes sense for UBS, it also makes sense for them. So, it continues to be a chicken and egg game, where we're building distribution, making it more compelling for major fund companies to launch NextShares' initiatives. The more fund companies that launch NextShares' initiatives, the easier it is to gain more broker-dealers as sponsors of NextShares. So we're trying to push through that. We're spending money to do that. We're working hard to do that. Certainly, leverage - and looking to leverage our distribution relationships with the broker-dealers and our contracts with other firms that are under normal circumstances our competitors. It's moving forward, it's not moving forward as quickly as I would like, but we are making progress and the UBS development is hugely significant for our NextShares initiatives. Laurie Hylton : Dan, just adding one more thing on the comp question, we do provide breakouts on our comp categories in the Q at a pretty detailed level, and that will be coming out at the beginning of September. So I think you can look to that if you're looking for more information in terms of exactly what was happening within the comp category. Dan Fannon : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. This is actually Andy Magoff [ph] standing in for Rob Lee. Kind of two-part NextShares question, with NEPC agreement to create a sub-advisors spine, do you guys have any kind of timeframe where that is going to start to show up? And you kind of talked about NextShares expenses you had given guidance I think for fiscal 2016 of around $8 million. Judging by the fact that you said you are going to remain pretty confident, is it a good run rate for 2017 maybe around $8 million to $10 million? Tom Faust : I think that's a best guess a lot will depend on what happens we've said publicly that we will be willing to work with major distribution partners to help them offset some of their expenses in implementing NextShares if we get a lot of agreements next year and expenses hit, that number could be somewhat higher. But assuming something close to the status quo, we think that's a reasonable estimate. The NEPC agreement, I would say 2017 is a reasonable timeframe. It's a little hard to be more specific than that. We, I think, we've had one follow-on meeting with NEPC since the announcement. So they're fairly early in their process. We announced that, I believe, in July vacation season. So I don't know that a whole lot has happened. But certainly, as this year progresses we want to be in a position where we can identify and potentially wet the commercial opportunity that might exist with managers that are identified by any PC as potential sub-advisers for NextShares funds. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks. And if I could just ask one more question about the equity inflows in the quarter. Just any color as to the split between institution and retail in the quarter? And then any color on the pipeline going forward, just specifically forward equity? Sorry. Tom Faust : While these guys are looking for specific numbers, I can do some filibustering. On the retail side, which tends to be mostly funds business, the strongest selling products are the Atlantic Capital's, mid-cap fund which is a five star fund. It's closed the most classes of most investors but we'll continue to make it available to retirement platform potentially and because we've got such a strong track record there, that continues to see very nice inflows. We've also - on the Eaton Vance side, our balance fund and our growth fund are both seeing positive flows. That's, again, driven primarily by performance. Institutionally, one of our leading strategies, probably the largest institutional strategy in terms of current flows is that defensive equity strategy that's offered by Parametric, which at least as yet, is still only an institutional strategy. We may in the future offer that in a fund, but it's essentially a transparent rules-based alternative to hedge fund strategies with - like a market beta of about 0.4, 0.5 that has had very favorable performance relative to typical hedge funds at a much, much lower price point than hedge fund fee rates. Laurie Hylton : Just in terms of the breakout between institutional and retail, I think if you're looking at the equity category, where we really saw the strength this quarter was in the sort of what we call the private fund category where with the exchange funds, are private equity funds that are managed by Eaton Vance management. We saw some significant close there. And then, we also saw for the Fed's equity strategy, there is a co-mingle vehicle that is intended for institutional investors that also had some significant inflows. So they're modestly positive in terms of our open end strongly positive in terms of the private fund category and then a little bit weaker on the institutional side. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you so much. Operator : That is all the time we have for questions today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Cataldo for closing remarks. Dan Cataldo : Okay, great. Thank you, and thank you for joining us. We hope you enjoy the remaining weeks of summer and look forward to reporting back to you upon the close of our fiscal 2016 at the end of October and beginning of November. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call, you may now disconnect.",

My name is Rachel and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Eaton Vance Corporation's Fourth Fiscal Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Dan Cataldo, you may begin your conference. Dan Cataldo : Good morning and welcome to our 2016 fiscal fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. Here this morning are Tom Faust, Chairman and CEO of Eaton Vance Corp; and Laurie Hylton, our CFO. We will first comment on the quarter and then we will take your questions. The full earnings release and charts we will refer to during the call are available on our website, eatonvance.com, under the heading Press Releases. Today's presentation contains forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainties in our business, including but not limited to those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings, including our 2015 Annual Report and Form 10-K, are available on our website or at request at no charge. I'll now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Faust : Good morning, and thank you, for joining us. Today we\u2019re reporting adjusting earnings per diluted share as $2.13 for our fiscal year ended October 31, down 7% from $2.29 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2015. This year\u2019s lower earnings reflect a 4% decline in revenue and substantially unchanged adjusted operating expenses, due to the strong recovery in equity markets since the February vows and the company\u2019s positive internal growth, our earnings power improved meaningfully over the course of the fiscal year, setting up favorable earnings comparisons in fiscal 2017. As Laurie will detail in a few minutes, we earned $0.57 per diluted share in the fourth fiscal quarter, an increase of 8% from $0.53 of earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and about 2% from $0.56 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.  Income and net gains on seed capital investments contributed $0.01 to earnings per diluted share in the fourth and third quarter of fiscal 2016, and reduced earnings per diluted share by $0.01 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Performance fees contributed less than $0.005 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 versus the contribution of about $0.01 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and $0.015 in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. We finished fiscal 2016 with consolidated assets under management of $336.4 billion, up 8% from 12 months earlier and at 1% from the end of the third fiscal quarter. Consolidated net inflows of 4.8 billion in the fourth quarter equate to a 6% annualized internal growth rate, matching our organic growth rate for fiscal 2016 as a whole. Excluding our lower fee [ph] exposure management business, organic growth in assets under management was 3% for the fourth quarter and 5% for the fiscal year in total. While net flows and organic growth in AUM are standard measures of asset manager business performance, we find it increasingly important to understand and track organic revenue growth. Organic revenue growth as we define it represents the change in run rate management fee revenue resulting from net inflows and outflows taking into account the fee rate applicable to each dollar in or out. In the fourth quarter we realized organic revenue growth of 2%, a third consecutive quarter of positive organic revenue growth. For the fiscal year as a whole we had organic revenue growth of just over 1%.  [Technical Difficulty] Dan Cataldo : Okay this is Dan Cataldo, apparently our call got cut off so we apologize for that. We're not sure precisely where we were when it cut off, but Tom is going to go back and start with the update on our custom beta business and again we apologize for this and if there are any questions as a result please don't hesitate to let us know. Tom Faust : Hi, it's Tom again. So, my apologies if we don't pick up where things cut off, which we don't know exactly where the was, I talked about our four key growth initiatives and where we are with those in total and I had some specific comments about two of those, our customer beta and next year's initiative and so I'll pick up and just repeat what I may have said or I think I said at least to the group here, may have said publicly, but I'll start on custom beta. For those not familiar, this is suite of separately managed account strategies that combined the benefits of passive investing with the ability to customize portfolio to meet individual investor preferences and needs. Our custom beta lineup includes parametric core equities and EVM managed municipal bond and corporate bond ladders, compared to index ETS and index mutual funds, our custom beta offerings gives clients the ability to tailor their exposure to achieve better tax outcomes and to reflect clients specified responsible investing criteria factored tilts and portfolio exclusions. And like ETS and mutual funds, custom beta separate accounts can pass through harvested tax losses to offset client gains and other investments. Transition cost and taxes may also be reduced by funding positions in kind. Included in our presentation materials is the slide showing the growth of our custom beta strategies offered as retail and high network separate accounts over the past five years. As you can see our managed assets and custom beta strategies have grown rapidly year-by-year now approaching $45 billion. Fiscal 2016 net inflows of $9.2 billion represented 28% internal growth rate. Although custom beta fees are well below traditional active management this is a highly scalable business for which we see huge growth opportunities as we continue to build out the distribution network and product offerings. We recently launched a new website at custombeta.com which I encourage you to check out. Now turning to NextShares. I'll start by reminding that NextShares are new type of fund recently approved by the SEC that combines proprietary active management with the conveniences and potential performance and tax advantage of exchange for your products. Our NextShares solutions subsidiary holds patents and other intellectual property rights related to NextShares and is seeking to commercialize NextShares by entering into licensing and service agreements with fund companies. The first three NextShares funds were launched by Eaton Vance and began trading on NASDAQ in February and March of this year. Last month Waddell & Reed launched the first three NextShares funds by an advisor other than Eaton Vance. Also recently interactive brokers and automated global electronic broker and market maker began offering NextShares funds to retail investors and financial professionals through its investing and trading platforms. UBS continues to make good progress towards the goal announced in July of offering NextShares funds through its network of 7,100 financial advisors in the U.S. UBS\u2019s plan is to begin offering NextShares on its brokerage platform in the first part of 2017 and then on its advisory platform later in the year. Every indication is that UBS is on schedule and committed to making NextShares a meaningful part of its U.S. fund business their support helps to answer the one remaining question that stands in the way of NextShares gaining broader adoption by fund companies, which is, where can we get large scale distribution. Assuming that everything at UBS remains on track their support sets the stage for NextShares fund launches by a wide range of leading funds sponsors in 2017. The three NextShares funds we introduced earlier this year now have seven to eight months of live investment and share trading experience, both of which have been consistent with expectations. All three funds are outperforming each share class of the corresponding mutual fund and their shares are trading at consistently tight bid/ask spreads and narrow premium discounts to fund NAV. As the investment in trading advantage of NextShares are demonstrated over a broader range of funds and experience by growing number of investors, we expect to attract more broker dealers in an ever widening array of funds sponsors and fund strategies to the NextShares opportunity. While true innovation is never easy we continue to be excited about the potential of NextShares, 2017 promises to be year of significant progress. In other notable developments, last months we announced the execution of a definitive agreement for Eaton Vance to acquire the assets of Calvert investment management. Founded in 1976 and based in Bethesda, Maryland, Calvert is a recognized leader in responsibly investing with approximately 12.3 billion in assets under management as of September 30. The Calvert funds are one of the largest and most diversified families of responsibly invested mutual funds encompassing actively and passively managed equity, fixed income and asset allocations strategies manage in accordance with the Calvert principal\u2019s responsible investment. The investment performance for the Calvert funds is generally strong, 77% of assets and funds with MorningStar ratings of four or five stars as of September 30. Most of Calvert\u2019s investment strategies incorporate consideration of environmental sustainability and corporate governance or ESG issues. The Calvert sustainability research department is dedicated to the evaluation of companies based on the ESG factors most relevant to their businesses. Done well this analysis can provide value even to funds and accounts that are not managed towards a responsible investing mandate. Responsible investing is widely recognized is one of the leading trends in the asset management industry today, appealing to investors who seek both financial returns and positive societal impact from their investments. Responsible investing has been embraced by many of Eaton Vance\u2019s most important business partners, as two examples Morgan Stanly and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, have each announced major initiatives to support sustainable and positive impact investing. Given that particular appeal to younger investors, it seems highly likely that demand for responsible investing will continue to grow. As part of Eaton Vance we see tremendous potential to Calvert to expand its leadership position among responsible investment managers. By applying our management and distribution resources and oversight, we believe we can help Calvert become a meaningfully larger, better and more impactful company. The transaction is subject to fund shareholder approvals and other customer closing conditions and is scheduled to close on or about December 31 of this year. We look forward to welcoming Calvert to the Eaton Vance family. Since the purchase of our controlling interest in Atlanta Capital in 2001 and Parametric in 2003. Acquisitions of complimentary asset management business have been a key components of Eaton Vance business grow. In the acquisition of Calvert we have significant opportunities to further advance our growth objectives by helping Calvert achieve its full potential as a leader in responsible investing. That concludes my prepared remarks. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Laurie. Laurie Hylton : Thank you, Tom and good morning. As detailed in our earnings release, we\u2019re reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.13 for fiscal 2016 versus $2.29 a year ago. On a GAAP basis we earn $2.12 per diluted share in fiscal 2016 and $1.92 per diluted share in fiscal 2015. As you can see in attachment 2 to our press release, $0.01 adjustment to fiscal 2016 earnings per diluted share primarily reflects the closed-end fund structuring fees we paid in the third quarter for the 37% adjustment from recorded GAAP earnings in fiscal 2015 primarily reflects the onetime payment we made to terminate certain closed-end fund service and additional compensation arrangement. Excluding the payment adjusted operating income declined by 12% year-over-year and adjusted operating margins drop from 34% to 31% reflecting a 4% decline in revenue and operating expense that was substantially unchanged. Our fourth quarter results show modestly improved revenue in profits both year-over-year and sequentially. We\u2019re reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.57 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to $0.53 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, and $0.56 for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarters of fiscal 2016 and 2015 are the same as reported GAAP earnings. While the $0.01 adjustment from reported GAAP earnings at $0.55 in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 reflects the closed-end fund structuring fees we paid last quarter. Fourth quarter revenue was up 2% versus both the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and the third quarter of fiscal 2015. We maintained adjusted operating margins of 32% in the final quarter of the fiscal year, flat versus the prior quarter despite losing 2.9 billion in managed assets due to the October market decline. Although we've seen opportunity from modest margin expansion longer term we would anticipate that adjusted margins will likely stay in this range for the first half of fiscal 2017 given seasonal compensation pressures. As Tom mentioned asset growth in fiscal 2016 was strong, with average managed assets up 6% in comparison with the prior fiscal year reflecting strong net sales and positive market returns for the year. Revenue declined 4% year-over-year trailing asset growth as our effective management fee base continued to trend down. The decline in our average expected investment advisory administrative fee rate from 39 basis points in fiscal 2015 to 36 basis points in fiscal 2016 can be primarily attributed to significant growth in our comparatively lower fee, exposure management and portfolio implementation franchises. While strong growth in lower fee franchises will likely continue to exert pressure on our overall average effective fee rates going forward, growth of well performing actively managed strategies may provide some level of counter pressure and consider to the stabilization of average effective fee rates longer term. Comparing fourth quarter results to same quarter last year, 11% growth in average managed assets more than offset the decline in our average effective fee rates and reduction in quarterly performance fee, driving a 3% increase in investment, advisory and administrative fees. Sequentially, a 4% increase in average managed assets drove a 2% increase in investment advisory and administrative fees. Performance fees which are excluded from the calculation of our average effective fee rate contributed approximately 600,000 in the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 compared to 2.7 million in the third quarter fiscal 2016 and 2 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2015. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 we realized 2% annualized internal revenue growth on 6% annualized internal asset growth with the revenue contribution from new sales during the quarter exceeding the revenue loss from redemptions and other withdrawals. Despite the persistent pressure on average fee rates we believe we can continue to sustain positive annualized internal revenue growth provided that withdrawals from our higher fee strategies don't accelerate. Turning to expenses, compensation expense increased by just under 2% in fiscal 2016, primarily reflecting a 4% increase in headcount to support growth of Parametric, a new initiatives at Eaton Vance management, partially offset by a decrease in sales base and operating income base incentive. Compensation expense increased to 37% of revenue in fiscal 2016 from 34% in fiscal 2015 primarily driven by the decline in revenue. We anticipate that compensation as a percentage of revenue will stay in the 37% range in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 given traditional seasonal pressures associated with payroll tax clock resets, 401(k) funding, yearend base salary increases and stock based compensation acceleration associated with employee retirement. Controlling our compensation cost and other discretionary spending remains top of mind as we move into the new fiscal year. Distribution related costs including distribution and service fees expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commission decreased 27% in fiscal 2016, primarily reflecting the $73 million paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 to terminate certain close-end funds service and additional compensation arrangements. Excluding this payment distribution related cost decreased 6% year-over-year reflecting lower average managed assets and fund share classes subject to those fees. First quarter distribution related expenses were down 3% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. Funds related expenses which consists primarily a sub-advisory fees and fund expenses born on funds for which we earn an all-in fee were substantially unchanged in fiscal 2016. Other operating expenses were up 4% in fiscal 2016, primarily reflecting increases in information technology spending related to corporate initiatives. In terms of specific initiatives spending, expenses related to NextShares totaled approximately $8 million in fiscal 2016 versus approximately $7.4 million in fiscal 2015. Net income and gains on seed capital investments contributed $0.01 to earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter and third quarter of fiscal 2016, and reduced earnings per diluted share by $0.01 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Quantifying the impact of our seed capital investments on earnings each quarter, we take into consideration our pro rata share of the gains, losses and other investment income earned on investments and sponsored products, but are accounted for as consolidated funds, separate accounts or equity method investments, as well as the gains and losses recognized on derivatives used to hedge these investments. We then report the per share impact, net of non-controlling interest expense and income taxes. We continue to hedge the market exposures of our seed capital portfolio to the extent practicable to minimize the effect on quarterly earnings. Excluding the effects of CLO entity earnings and losses, our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was 38.3% versus 38.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and 38.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. In capital management we repurchased 1.2 million shares of non-voting common stock for approximately $47.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. When combined with repurchases over the preceding three quarters. We reduced our weighted average diluted shares outstanding by 4% for the fiscal year and our ending shares outstanding from a 115.9 million on October 31st 2015 to $114 million on October 31st 2016. We finished our fourth fiscal quarter holding $509.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term debt security and approximately $312.9 million in seed capital investments. Our outstanding debt consists of $250 million of 6.5% senior notes due in 2017 and $325 million of 3.625% senior notes due in 2023. We also have a $300 million 5-year line of credit, which is currently undrawn. Dan Cataldo : Okay, thanks Laurie. I think we have a good sense now as to where the call cut off earlier, so I think Tom\u2019s just going to make a few more comments and then we will open it up to questions. Tom Faust : Thanks, Dan. Apparently the one topic that we didn\u2019t cover, that we would like to cover now is the breakdown of our flows, just little color on the flows in the quarter. In our forward reporting I think it was observed by us and others that the trends we had in the fourth quarter were generally consistent with the third quarter perhaps the one exception was Parametrics portfolio implementation business where we had net outflows of about $100 million in the fourth quarter compared to $2.9 billion of net inflows in the prior quarter. All of this decline was attributable to institutional mandates for which the longer-term trends remain strongly positive, even with the down fourth quarter institutional portfolio manager -- institutional portfolio implementation mandates contributed over 4.5 billion to our fiscal 2016 net inflows. Our fourth quarter net inflows into fixed income of 1.7 billion were led by municipal and corporate bond ladders with support from active high yield and management muni strategies. Alternative strategies net inflows of all most 700 million were driven by sales of our two global macro mutual funds with strong performance records now over multiple periods and equity net inflows which will modestly positive had contributions from Parametric and Atlanta Capital managed strategies which were somewhat offset by net outflows from Eaton Vance managed equities. And floating rate bank loans we had net outflows of 600 million in the fourth quarter versus 500 million in the third quarter. The decision by one major intermediary to reallocate away from bank loans accounted for essentially all the fourth quarter net outflows, meaning that net flows from all other sources were substantially flat. While we continue to be subject to these types of lumpy single decision maker flows both positive or negative, market sentiment towards bank loan has clearly turned. After a long wait we\u2019re now seeing consistent daily net inflows into our retail bank loan strategies, no doubt influenced by the specter of rising interest rates. Following back to back years of bank loan net outflows totaling nearly 9 billion, we appeared to be entering a much more favorable environment for our floating rate income business. In a rising interest rate environment fix income investors often look to exit longer duration vehicles to minimize the impact of rising rates on their principle. Assuming that income generation continues to be a priority a logical alternative is frequently to invest in floating rates and lower duration income strategies. As shown in our list of four and five star rated funds, we offer not only a highly competitive lineup of floating rate bank loan funds, but also a range of top performing short duration taxable and municipal income funds that are positioned to gain assets in a rising rate environment. We\u2019re now starting to see a pickup in investor demand for these products. Relative to other income mangers, our leading position in bank loans and other floating rates and short duration strategies places us very favorable for business growth in a period of rising interest rates. So with that we will conclude our prepared remarks and open the floor to question and again our apologies for the interruption. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : May be a quick follow up to the floating rate conversation, I think at the last conference you mentioned, you took in a chunk of money, I think it\u2019s 15 billion in the last go around when rates are going round and it proceeded to flow out over the next three years as people kind of pulled on the idea. I guess I\u2019m curious of should we be expecting the same kind of things right now and is there any way to lock those clients and for longer duration? I feels different this time, if feels like it could be more sustained moving rates, but I\u2019m sure we said that before, so just curious the type of clients who -- that bought and sold last time and if there is any way to get them to be longer term commitments? Tom Faust : Interesting question I think 15 billion was roughly the amount of net inflows we had into bank loan mandates in fiscal 2013. And as you pointed out, I think we had modest growth in fiscal 2014 and then over the last two years we\u2019ve had net outflows totaling about 9 billion. Most of that volatility, not all of it, but most of it has been on the retail side. We have a mix of clients, some who presumably are using bank loans as a substitute for short term cash, many of which are making allocations to floating rate income assets as an alternatives to longer duration fixed income in effect trying to earn income, while at the same time avoiding I guess the principal value from -- that'll happen as rates go up. I wish I could say that our business has changed in such a way that I can promise that everyone that buys our bank on strategies is a long term investor. I would think the experience of last time will be, will somewhat inform investors' behavior this time. I would not expect to have to see that same level of you know 15 billion and followed by roughly two thirds of that going out over the next three years. It's hard to say though, markets are dynamic, expectations today look pretty convincing that rates are likely to move up but I would have said the same thing, probably did say the same thing in 2013 where certainly at that point all the pieces seemed to be in place for a period of rising interest rates, we had a falloff in the economy later in that year, really changed the expectations for where rates were going. No doubt the accommodated policy of the Fed and other central bank regulators around the world has contributed significantly to keeping rates low. But as we did see it, we're in an environment today where there are signs of inflation picking up, there are signals from the Fed that they're inclined to raise interest rates going forward or likely as soon as December, we think this puts us in a really outstanding position to grow our bank loan business in 2017. No doubt there will continue to be cycles of periods of inflows and periods of outflows and we're certainly confident that we're likely headed into a period of inflows in 2017 after a couple of years of seeing the market go the other way. Glenn Schorr : Fair enough, maybe just a related follow up on the muni side. Higher rates in the prospect of lower taxes usually is a bad thing on that front, just curious on what your expectations are for demand on the muni side? Tom Faust : I think that's right most muni mandates, most muni securities that are out there are longer duration, muni is typically issued with a 20 year term, 10 year call date is kind of the typical new issue. Our muni business is substantially diversified compared to where we were a few years ago, our latter business is certainly one of our fastest growing parts of our overall company where you have by the nature of that structure, perhaps less sensitivity to client interest rate expectations there. We also have a range of low duration and we have a floating rate muni fund where we\u2019ve started to see some inflows. So I would expect given we're more diversified in our muni exposure with a range of not only longer duration strategies but also laddered short duration and floating rate strategies, we were actually pretty well positioned for a period of rising rates muni have been on a -- the markets been on a great run in the last couple of years, we've seen nice inflows and to not only our, but many competitors funds and separate accounts there, may be that takes a pause. But I think we're pretty well positioned for that given strong performance across our line ups in a range of duration exposures there. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Fannon : Just a follow-up on the comments around the seasonal first half expenses and margins to be flat. I get these dynamics in the kind of fourth quarter -- I'm sorry the first quarter and kind of the reset of expenses for salaries and some of the onetime stuff, but you mentioned first half kind of pressure and so just kind of want to clarify your outlook versus the first quarter and then kind of the year for margins. Laurie Hylton : The significant portion of the pressure is in the first quarter, but it obviously trips over little bit into the second quarter as well. And there we\u2019re talking about things like payroll tax reset, so you reset and then over the course of the year that starts to follow off for us. The big part of the slide is in the first half, down into the third quarter and that goes as well for our 401(k) match which is as significant contributor to the increase in comp in the first quarter. So it's just -- there is some impact on the second quarter, it's largely a first quarter effect. Tom Faust : We do have the day count impact in the second quarter [multiple speakers], it's not -- that's not related to the seasonal expense pressures, but it does put pressure on the second quarter revenues. Dan Fannon : Great, and then just a follow up on NextShares, the annual expense, sticking with expenses the $8 million or so this past year, just curious as the outlook for that kind of next year, if there is any growth routine to that. And then also with the UBS partnership and their implementation, just curious as to how much I guess from the cost perspective a burden that is, or if that\u2019s been lower or higher than some of the numbers you've talked about previously in terms of getting them fully operable or if that\u2019s -- just kind of any update there to think about, incremental partners in the cost and maybe the challenges there? Laurie Hylton : Yes, I think we haven\u2019t spoken specifically about the exact amount of the cost associated with the UBS implementation, but I can comment and say that in terms of our total spend for next year we do think that it will uptick modestly, but only modestly. I think we're looking at something, this year we closed out with roughly $8 million of expenses associated directly with our NextShares initiatives. I think I would pushed that up to something around $10 million range in fiscal 2017 recognizing that we are getting a little bit more steam going in terms of the launch and would anticipate that it will have some uptick in expenses there. Dan Fannon : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Maybe first the follow-up on Glen's question about the impact of rising interest rates. So in taking about the floating rate got that talked about diverse [indiscernible] maybe can you take it a little more into the muni latter's, I can't quite tell what your expectations are? I know that product has been particularly good it's a little bit different, so how the rising rate environment may impact that and then you haven\u2019t talked about the global macros suite. I think in taper tantrum it was a little bit disappointing in terms of the defensiveness of that product. I don\u2019t know if the investment priorities would have changed for that fund following the performance in taper tantrum. So just as anything change since last time rates rose and what are your expectation for global macro? Tom Faust : Happy to take those Ken. Just on the -- I guess first starting on the global macro, this is an actively managed strategy, it is a country picking approach were we take long and short exposure to different countries and different market areas based on our view on currencies and rates and other investment factors in those countries. It\u2019s a little hard to say, how we\u2019re going to do in a particular environment, it\u2019s not like a bank loan strategy where, it\u2019s primarily a credit play without an interest rate exposure. So this is -- so the thing about it is, there is a long and short economies around the world often with lot of exposure to emerging markets on the debt side. Our performance has been good, one of the things that is consistently true about the strategy is its strength as a portfolio of diversifier, its return in good marketing environments and bad are consistently show low coloration with U.S. stocks and bonds, and that\u2019s really one of its key strength.  So I would point to the strength of the record over multiple time period, but particularly in the last couple of years, under the current management team and its consistent record as a portfolio diversifier and remind me again your second question Ken. Ken Worthington : Just on the muni latter\u2019s, you mentioned the diversity of the muni franchise, obviously muni retails probably under pressure with rising rates. But muni latters I don\u2019t have a good sense. Tom Faust : I guess the short answer is we\u2019ll see, we did not have a large muni latter business the last time rates moved up. What I would expect would be to have less interest rates sensitivity in that business, meaning in the flows of that business. Then you would see in a muni bond fund. One of the appeals of ladders is the portfolio construction where you get the transparency into what\u2019s happening there, you get the assurance that positions in the ladder will be rolling of in a very transparent rules based fashion.  We think and I think there is good history on this and advisor constructive ladders, and that the clients are more inclined to stay with a ladder type construction then with a fund where, really all they see month-is-months is the performance volatility that you get in a fund. Here while it\u2019s true you\u2019re going to have similar volatility in the underlying bonds, because of the nature of the portfolio construction and the mechanism with which that approached by the advisor and the client, we expect it will show less interest rates sensitivity than traditional muni funds. I would not be surprise though with changes in rate expectations for the mix of business there to shift somewhat. So for example the mix between 5 to 15 year ladders versus 1 to 10 year ladders. If your expectation is that rates might move up, likely we'll see shorter duration ladders, and we\u2019re really indifferent to that in terms of how we approach the business. Ken Worthington : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous, your line is open. Patrick Davitt : Back to the bank loan discussion, I appreciate the kind of broad guidance on what you've been seeing over recent days, but if you look at the kind of broader industry trend, the last couple of months, you saw a really-really big uptick at least in the retail data we can see which you don't appear to have benefited from. Obviously, we saw you benefit from it in 2013, so I'm just curious if you could dig in on maybe what's driving that apparent loss of market share. Tom Faust : Yes, we referenced in my prepared remarks and I don't whether this was the part that got cut off or not, but we referenced that the outflows that we experienced in the quarter that ended in October were essentially a function of one large intermediary making a decision to reallocate away from bank loans during the quarter. We believe we were most of their bank loan exposure and so there were roughly $600 million of flows and these came out of our -- these were fund, this was not an institutional account relationship. That's the factor we would point to on a net basis to account for our maybe apparent share loss during the period you're looking at. That was meaningful, the good news is it's done, we look at our flow results on a daily basis which are reported I guess monthly. So the data is out there, you can look at how we're doing, I would think if you would, if you look at the data over the last months you're probably seeing us doing better, that's what our internal numbers show. So we fully expect based on our performance where we are in terms of fee rates and our reputation as a long term leader in this space that if in fact there is a significant recovery in bank loan flows that we will fully participate in that. Patrick Davitt : Okay, I heard that, I think that\u2019s supposed to adjust for basically flat for the quarter and at least in September and October we saw in the industry flow, a significant uptick from the previous month. Dan Cataldo : Patrick, I'm looking at a breakdown of the flows between our different vehicles, and our opened end funds would have been solidly positive in the quarter had we not had this one particular outflow. So with kind of -- the other components during the quarter that you don't see is that we were negative in our institutional loan fund. So you don't see those flows publicly, but the combination of that and the allocation out that we saw is basically what drove the flat flows for the quarter. But absence that 600 million in outflows we were strongly positive in retail flows for the quarter. Tom Faust : It's probably worth saying that we're not taking it for granted, that we'll participate fully in inflows into bank loans that we're working hard to make that happen with quite active, quite aggressive marketing campaigns and roadshows in support of our bank loan business ongoing currently. Patrick Davitt : Thanks that helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Michael Carrier : Tom just on the portfolio implementation and flows, you mentioned that the outlooks still looks attractive despite the modest outflows in the quarter. Just wanted to get a sense when you think about the portfolio implementation and then exposure management. Like maybe how much visibility do you have in terms of pipeline and maybe better point would be just, when you think about the market size, the opportunity that you guys are targeting, like how big is that because obviously the growth in those areas have been strong? Tom Faust : Let me break that up into a couple of different areas. So what we call custom beta and the slide that appears on our deck doesn\u2019t conform exactly to our reporting of flows by investment mandate. So what we\u2019re calling custom beta and you can see in that slide, a strong long-term trend, most of that is in portfolio implementation, but the fixed income part is not that\u2019s in our fixed income category. So a pretty big chunk of the portfolio implementation category is what we\u2019re calling the equity portion of custom beta and that's showing in that slide. There is also in portfolio implementation a pretty large institutional business and that institutional business is more lumpy, like most institutional businesses and as we described the downturn in overall portfolio implementation flows in the quarter was really completely attributable to what we think are temporary factors effecting that institutional business. So and then I guess the third piece to talk about is exposure management which is the 100% institutional, also lumpy, it's been lumpy in a good way and we certainly expect that to continue. But I would say that if you look inside portfolio and implementation and exposure management together the retail and high net worth piece of that, we don\u2019t have good visibility on individual pieces of business generally, but it's a diversified business with very strong momentum, the underlying drivers of that which is then move to passive, which is the value add that we can provide in terms of tax and customization to reflect responsible investing criteria and other factors and the enhanced service offerings of those products and increase distribution. All of those things argue to us, very strongly that that business will continue to grow in a sustained way, and we think the potential of that custom beta business is very-very large. We have, as I said about $45 billion in assets, they are currently relative to the overall world of passive Management as expressed by ETF's or index funds, we\u2019re really just to drop in the bucket, but we think for taxable investors we've got very significant value add opportunities and even for non-taxable investors we think there are there are the reasons to choose a customized separate account as opposed to a fund for long-term index exposures. On the part of the business where we do tend to have some visibility which is the Institutional and here again I'm talking to both portfolio implementation and exposure management, we do have a pipeline, we kind of know what's coming that isn\u2019t always a perfect read, but we have a quite robust pipeline currently that makes us optimistic that we\u2019ll continue to grow there in 2017. This is a lumpy business, there will be period when things will go the other way, but long term we see all these areas as continuing to provide very strong undercurrents to Eaton Vance\u2019s growth picture. These are very competitively priced, high value added service were Parametric is a recognized market leader. Most of this business today, an overwhelming portion of that is in the U.S. We\u2019re starting to grow a bit outside the United States. Australia is a market that has good potential where Parametric has been successful, but we\u2019re starting to we think to see some potential for growth in Europe and Asia and other parts of the world. There is nothing that I see that suggests that we\u2019re close to a saturation point in this businesses, we\u2019ve some visibility that makes us confident that 2017 will be a good year, but beyond that it\u2019s really looking at the value proposition that we provide with these products and being confident that that will continue to attract investors longer term as opposed to having a sense of visible pipeline beyond the -- say the first half of next year. Michael Carrier : Okay that\u2019s helpful color. Just a small thing, when you talk about the margin and the seasonality in the first quarter and second quarter. It makes sense -- I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of, when we think about the market strength or weakness is there a like a certain market environment that that implies, and then just one small thing on the share account. Just given the tick up, just wanted to understand what\u2019s being driven by either grants versus stock price and then the policy on buybacks to either try to keep the share count flatter, do you have any update there? Laurie Hylton : So the first question in terms of margin and expectations, we\u2019re generally are talking about -- largely when I give that guidance, it\u2019s largely on flat markets. I do think that our comp as a percent of revenues is likely to hang out in that 36% to 37% range in 2017 and that\u2019s currently what we\u2019re -- how we\u2019re looking at the world. In terms of our share count, we bought back to fewer shares in the fourth quarter then we did in the third. We do have the increase in the stock price which does effect that sort of treasury stock calculation you have to do for diluted share is outstanding, so you got two pressures there. We do not have a stated policy in terms of repurchasing shares in order to offset dilution. I think that from a capital management prospective we look at our capital deployment more in terms of priorities. First to grow the business, so that would be in terms of funding organic efforts as well as potential acquisition, maintaining our dividend and then to the extent we think is appropriate entering the market to buy back shares.  We have been in the market buying back shares, we would anticipate we would continue to do so. But obviously we stepped back a little bit in the fourth quarter recognizing that we have some cash obligations coming up in relation to the Calvert purchase and obviously we\u2019ve got fourth quarter bonus et cetera. So I wanted to state we will continued to be in the market, but I -- we certainly don\u2019t have a stated policy that we\u2019re going to be out there to offset dilution. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open. Chris Shutler : Want a follow up on the back loan discussions. How do you feel about capacity in those strategies today, just thinking that if there is less robust new issuance in a rising rate environment, supply could become constrained and any thoughts there would be helpful? Tom Faust : Yes, I think we\u2019re at about 32 billion-ish in bank loan assets today, I think our peak was probably 45 billion-ish, when we were at that mid-45 range we were starting to talk about the possibility of a close or a pause in accepting new money. We don't see any particular pressures there today. It's certainly possible that if we see robust growth at some point, we'll close this, but I guess it would require a fairly sizeable growth in our business from current levels for us to really entertain those discussions. I was certainly [ph] talking a lot about in 2013 as the business was growing at a quite accelerated pace for a number of consecutive quarters. If that happens again, we will -- and if it proves to be the right thing for our clients, we will contemplate closing the strategy. But from our current size and giving the further build out of the bank loan asset class, we don't think we're anywhere close to that being a current concern. Chris Shutler : Okay, makes sense. And on NextShares, just wanted to get your updated thoughts, Tom, on how the conversations are going with kind of larger fund managers and are they telling you they want to see another one or two large distributors, what are kind of the gating factors to get them more engaged? Tom Faust : I think we're getting pretty close, in that, the gating factors were a couple of things. One, is this real, do these things work, are there performance advantages that come from the structure, will they trade acceptably. When we launched our first products back in February and March pretty much the focus was on demonstrating to the market both fund companies, broker dealers and others that this is real, that there is a performance advantage that can come from NextShares and that these things will trade in a fully transparent way with premiers and discounts that are acceptably narrow by market standards. That's been pretty much done, we haven't covered every asset class. But we intentionally chose the first three that covers a range of domestic and international and equity and fixed income strategy. The second requirement which is really the one you touched on in your question is the distribution access. When we launched those first funds the only distributor for NextShares was Folio Investing, which is a small online broker-dealer. Since then we've added Interactive Brokers, which is now up and running and available. You can buy the Eaton Vance and the [indiscernible] sponsored NextShares funds today both at Folio and at Interactive Brokers. The big announcement, the big development over the course of the summer was the announcement that UBS was planning to offer and is supporting its business partner's offering NextShares and I would guess of the Top 20 largest fund companies, none of them have either Folio or Interactive Brokers as one of their top five distribution partners. I would guess of those 20 companies a substantial majority have UBS as one of their largest distribution partners. The way things work in our business frequently is, demand drives product recreation and if UBS is engaging with its business partners to encourage them to offer NextShares, I think it's highly likely that will happen. The barriers to launching NextShares are pretty low, we provide significant technical support of the process the past to regulatory approval is well established and quite short at this point, we don\u2019t think it will take a lot of encouragement from UBS and potentially other broker dealers in 2017 to convince major fund companies to launch new products. We've had conversation over the last maybe two months about new share classes being offered being created and to be offered by fund companies in response to demand from broker dealers. If there is demand for NextShares from UBS and potentially other broker dealers, which I think we should expect to see major fund companies line up to launch strategies in that structure. We\u2019re working hard to make that happen certainly the commitment of UBS to this is a real game changer for us and puts us in a position where we see a much broader range of companies launching NextShares products in 2017. Chris Shutler : Alright. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is open. Robert Lee : I guess maybe to stick with NextShares as my first question, I'm just curious I mean there are any kind of I guess time pressure you face to try to kind of monetizes this I mean some of you have some underlying patents and whatnot, but patents to grant for certain period of time and then they kind of open up. So is there anything, because these were obviously developed before you bought it, you owned it for a few years before you got the approval and it's taking take some time to kind of monetize it in the marketplace, so do you feel comfortable that you have enough time to monetize this and kind of reap the benefits before there is some pressure on what's proprietary about it? Tom Faust : Good question, I would say our primary driver to get this done is the -- we're spending a fair bit of money. We're spending $8 million, Laurie said in the range of $10 million next year we think. That's the primary motivation from an economic standpoint. I would say it more broadly there is a real sense of mission that we have here, that this is a better way to invest and actively manage strategies and it's partly driven by that sense of mission that we continue to invest in this and continue to push hard to make NextShares a reality in the marketplace. As you pointed out there are part of the basis for this business is patents that were issued I believe initially in the 2005 or 2006 timeframe, those -- the patents right there will expire, but we've -- not surprisingly as we've invested in this business we've also invested in newer technology and have been working on additional patterns as well that we think our protection here will likely extend well beyond that 2026 period that you would normally expect given the 20 year cycle on patents application. So we think there is a significant enough window here to justify this as a quite attractive commercial proposition for Eaton Vance. But our enthusiasm for this is not unending, at some point if this is not going to work, the market will demonstrate that to us clearly. We\u2019re very focused on achieving success here, but are mindful that not all great ideas work. But we want to push this as hard as we can and we\u2019re very committed to doing that throughout 2017. Robert Lee : Great and maybe the follow as, question or two on Calvert, so expected to close hopefully by the end of the year. So where do you see kind of the initial opportunities with that as it -- how quickly can you kind of, for example, plug there funds into your distribution and we that as something than can happen relatively quickly or do you see there is more of an institutional opportunity? I mean how do you think about the path of accelerating there growth? Tom Faust : It\u2019s something we\u2019re very focused on. I would say first on the time of the closing, the key gating item is the approval of fund shareholders, so there is an approximately that\u2019s been sent out, there\u2019s the shareholder meeting that\u2019s been scheduled for I think December 16. There is some possibility that if they don\u2019t get to vote in time, that the closing gets pushed out somewhat, but certainly the early returns are supportive of the vote. But there is requirement in these things that at least 50% of the outstanding shares cast their vote and sometimes it\u2019s a challenge may be particularly at this time of the year to get people to cast their vote even if they don\u2019t necessarily have any objections to what\u2019s being proposed. On the distribution side we\u2019re very focused on that, one of the things that we have done is entered into an agreement between Eaton Vance distributors and Calvert for Eaton Vance to begin marketing, ever prior to the closing. So where we have an agreement in place, so Eaton Vance sales people will be out I think starting next week, actually starting this week, excuse me, talking about Calvert funds, making the case for why Calvert is a stronger and better company as part of Eaton Vance. The growth opportunities we see here really extend across a pretty wide range, Calvert\u2019s growth today is primarily on their equity index products, through working with people at Parametric we think they can potentially broaden the range of index strategies and continue to grow there, just with much greater distribution reach. And there fixed income side of business they got a number of high performing strategies including quite interestingly some short duration and also short duration products that are four and five star rated, that we think with given what\u2019s happening with rates and given the interest at getting a wider range investors have today and shortening up their fixed income portfolio, we think could be really exceptionally well positioned. It might probably be usefully to understand that Calvert has had three field sales people, all of them are based on the West Coast. They have had nobody covering the rest for the country and in fact they\u2019ve had a couple of phone reps covering the rest of the country. Eaton Vance will take what was three sales reps and replace that by something north of 75 sales reps. Now there are some other things as well, but we think that the amount of conversations that will take place in the warehouse channel and the independent channel and in the RA [ph] channel about Calvert's strategies and about responsible investing, will go up by I would say at least an order of magnitude as a result of this transaction. On the institutional side, we think there is some low hanging fruit. We have a wide range of high performing reputable strategies, primarily on the fixed income side where being able to offer a responsibly managed version of, for example the Eaton Vance high yield strategy or the Eaton Vance bank loan strategy or the Eaton Vance core bond plus strategy. Those were all things that we're focused on doing quite soon after closing where we think there is essentially untapped market demand there. While there's been a fair bit of movement of assets into responsibly invested and sustainably invested equity strategies in a growing range of companies that would claim to have at least some level of proficiency there. There isn't much happening to date on the fixed income side and we're actually taking inbound calls from clients and consultants who are interested in saying, hey can you offer XYZ strategy, high yield, bank loans, core bond plus, can you do that in a responsibly managed fashion in combination with Calvert. Our answer of course is yes, we expect to make those strategies a key part of our institutional focus right out of the box in 2017. So things are starting to happen on the retail side, this week on a preliminary basis we're getting our sales force exposed to these products, we're making sure that they're out there making the case to the advisors they work with that this is a good transaction, that what comes out of this is a stronger Calvert, not a diluted Calvert. But we're also very hopeful that we'll see meaningful flows on the institutional side in next year. Calvert has had very little sales and marketing resources to devote to institutional markets in recent years. They've really been a resource constraint organization and one of the key things we bring is the resource and reach into essentially all segments of the market both retail and institutional. Robert Lee : Great, thank you very much for the helpful color, appreciate it. Operator : There are no further questions at this time, I'll turn the call back over to Dan Cataldo. Dan Cataldo : Great and thank you, thank you all for joining us this morning. We wish you all a happy and safe thanksgiving and look forward to reporting back to you at the end of our first fiscal quarter, thank you.

Copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman. James Gorman : Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. At the beginning of 2016, we laid out several strategic priorities that we aim to achieve in 2017. The most important of which was to generate an ROE within the range of 9% to 11%. Other priorities included achieving a wealth management pre-tax margin of 23% to 25%, delivering on project streamline and improving results across our fixed income division. These priorities were consistent -- were contingent upon modest revenue growth, a continuation of our capital distribution plan and the absence of any outsized litigation expenses or penalties. 2017 has started well. We remain focused and continued to demonstrate strong expense discipline. Wealth management recorded a pre-tax margin well within our target range, and the fixed income division delivered revenues meaningfully north of our $1 billion average quarterly goal. These public markers, combined with continued strength in investment banking, leadership and equities and improved returns in investment management, all contributed to one of the strongest quarters in recent history. The net impact of these efforts was an ROE north of 10%, again well within the range related to 12 months ago. We\u2019re pleased to see the results of the many difficult decision and business growth initiatives best proved as we begin 2017. In addition, in the first quarter, the Federal Reserve announced that it did not object to our resubmitted 2016 capital plan. Separately, along with all our peers, we recently submitted our capital plan for the 2017 CCAR cycle. Strong capital return remains a critical element to our future success. All of that said, we live in uncertain times. You are well aware the political and geopolitical uncertainties that exist on the domestic front, as well as abroad. How this will impact markets during the rest of the year is too early to predict. We will remain nimble should the macro environment change materially. Notwithstanding these risks, given our business model and leading positions in several franchises,we expected continue to deliver appropritate returns in the absence of a major disruption. In addition to the obvious uncertainties, there are two notable policy areas that could meaningfully affect us in a positive way in the next several years; first, the potential for reduction of the domestic corporate tax rate. Almost all of our wealth management business and a significant part of our institutional securities businesses are based in the United States; secondly, the perspective regulatory changes. At the very least, it is hard to imagine the regulatory burden increasing from this point forward and some of the policy proposals being floated, make good common sense. Given Morgan Stanley\u2019s very strong capital and liquidity position potential modifications could substantially impact us over the coming years. I am sure, we\u2019ll talk a lot more about this at the rest of this call and in subsequent quarters. I will now turn over to Jon to discuss this particular quarter in greater detail. Jonathan Pruzan : Thank you, James and good morning. Results in the first quarter were strong, aided by an active new cycle, improved sentiment and solid economic data. Firm revenues of $9.7 billion were up 8% compared to Q4. In the first quarter, CBT was $2.8 billion, EPS was $1 and ROE was 10.7%. Our performance was buoyd by typical first quarter seasonality as well as momentum, following the U.S. elections. Importantly, we produced results characteristic of constructive markets and we controlled expenses, highlighting the operating leverage in our business. Our efficiency ratio improved to 71% this quarter. I will spend a minute on our expenses and project streamline before turning to the businesses. Compared to the fourth quarter, non-interest expenses of $6.9 billion were up approximately $160 million or 2%. This increase was driven by higher compensation expenses, which rose 9% sequentially due to higher revenues and the impact of mark-to-market on our deferred compensation plans across the firm. Non-compensation expenses were down approximately $220 million or 8% quarter-over-quarter. Recall, Q4 included elevated seasonal expenses and a provision in connection with the tax reporting issue. Given fourth quarter seasonality, the year-over-year comparison maybe more relevant when trying to understand the impact of project streamline. Year-over-year revenues were up $2 billion while non-compensation expenses increased by only $100 million over the same period. These results demonstrate our operating leverage and discipline. We remain well on our way to executing roughly 200 expense initiatives that we identified as part of project streamline. This is included; using robotic process automation to consolidate our technology support; rationalizing our North American data centers and to modern and environmentally sound centers that now host high density technologies; and introducing a cloud based procurement platform, which uses more straight through processing and payments; informing more intelligent purchasing decisions. We also continue to implement the workforce strategy we have shared with you last year. During the remainder of 2017, our focus will be on completing the remaining initiatives and more importantly, on keeping these costs permanently out of the expense base. Now to the businesses. Our Institutional Securities franchise performed well in Q1. Our businesses built on Q4 momentum and produced strong results with total net revenue of $5.2 billion, up 12% quarter-over-quarter. Non-compensation expenses were $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 7% sequentially driven by lower seasonal expenses, partially offset by higher execution related costs. Compensation expenses were $1.9 billion, reflecting an ISG compensation to net revenue ratio of approximately 36% consistent with our target of maintaining a ratio at or below 37%. In Investment Banking, we generated $1.4 billion in revenues, an 11% increase over the fourth quarter. The increase was driven by strong underwriting results across both debt and equity, partially offset by a decline in advisory revenues. Advisory revenues for the quarter were $496 million, down 21% versus a very strong fourth quarter. Clients remain engaged and interested in discussing strategic transactions, and pipelines are healthy. Turning to underwriting, continued investor optimism combined with stable capital markets characterized by low volatility and tighter credit spreads, translated into strong underwriting activity in the first quarter. While equity volumes are still well below peak levels, Q1 represented a more constructive new issue market with low overall volatility and fewer specific risk events. Against this backdrop and with a strong pipeline coming into the new year, equity underwriting revenues were $390 million, up 73% versus the fourth quarter. We expect activity levels to remain healthy, although upcoming events such as European elections and continued policy uncertainty, may affect issuance windows. Fixed income underwriting revenues increased 26% sequentially to $531 million, driven by strength in investment grade bond and high yield financing issuance in attractive credit environment. Our sales and trading business performed well as constructive market conditions witnessed in the fourth quarter carried into the first quarter. Revenue increased 10% on a sequential basis to $3.5 billion. In equities, we were number one in the U. S. and expect to retain our number one global position. Despite a decline in volumes, first quarter revenues were $2 billion, up 3% compared to the fourth quarter. Results were driven by strength in both derivatives and cash equities in a more stable trading environment. The first quarter results underscore the importance of our product breadth and geographic diversity. We saw strength in Europe and continued stability in the Americas, which was partially offset by weaker results in Asia. Despite various economic and political challenges, we remain committed to our global footprint. Fixed income revenues in the first quarter were $1.7 billion, up 17% versus a strong fourth quarter. A constructive trading environment and uptick in client activity, variability in interest rate expectations and a favorable credit environment, contributed to these results. In our credit businesses, we saw continuation of the increased market volumes that followed on the back of the U. S. elections. Steady client activity and favorable market conditions across products, drove strong performance. In particular, our securitized product business performed well, driven by spread tightening and strong demand. Our macro businesses witnessed a sequential decrease in revenues. While our rates business benefited from increased client activity related to repricing of interest rate expectations in the U. S., this was partially offset by a decline in foreign exchange. After a challenging environment in Q1 2016, this quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter with revenues in excess of our $1 billion target. The results have increased our confidence as the business has experienced good momentum, reinforcing that it is critically and credibly sized. Average trading VaR for the period was $44 million up versus a historically low level of $39 million last quarter. As we have discussed, the derisking of our balance sheet over the last several quarters has provided us with significant capacity to prudently raise VaR to support accretive client opportunities. In the first quarter, we saw both strong client demand and pockets of volatility, contributing to an increase in both spot and average trading VaR. Now turning to Wealth Management .In the first quarter, we reported record revenues of $4.1 billion, representing 2% sequential increase. The CBT margin at 24% was the highest since the Smith Barney acquisition and sale firmly within our 2017 target range. Importantly, drivers of this business are healthy. We witnessed increased fee-based asset flows, additional lending, better client engagement and eliminate FA attrition. Client assets reached $2.2 trillion, a record high, reflecting rising domestic and global equity industries. Fee based assets increased 6% to $927 billion, including net asset flows of $19 billion. This represents the highest fee based asset flows since 4Q14. Asset Management revenues were flat sequentially. Higher asset levels and positive flows were largely offset by the effect of fewer calendar days in the quarter. Net interest income was up modestly. The benefit of higher rates and loan balances in the first quarter was partially offset by the impact of lower prepayment amortization in the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, we have seen strong net interest income growth of 20% and we remain confident with the net interest income guidance we provided in February. We are positioned to continue to benefit from higher rates and lending growth. Bank lending balances were up $1 billion quarter-over-quarter. Transaction revenues of $823 million were up 6% from 4Q16. Higher mark-to- market gains on our deferred compensation plans had a meaningful impact on the sequential increase. Additionally, we witnessed a recovery in the underwriting calendar, especially in structured projects as issuers capitalize on increased retail demand for new issue product. Total expenses were flat versus 4Q as seasonally lower business development expenses were partially offset by higher compensation expenses. The compensation ratio of 57% was negatively impacted by seasonality and the impact of mark-to-market on our deferred compensation plans. Looking forward, we remain optimistic about the outlook for this business. The steady increase in fee based assets position us well to build our annuatized revenues. We continue to invest in our digital capabilities, which overtime, will encourage asset aggregation and increase FA and client engagement. We look forward to sharing more with you on this topic later this quarter. Finally, we are confident in the attractiveness of our platform and the opportunities that affords us to recruit and retain talent as the landscape continues to favor scale players. Investment management saw stable asset management fees and better investment results. Total net revenues were $609 million, up 22% quarter-over-quarter. AUM grew to $421 billion in the quarter. Market appreciation and equities and fixed income, and positive flows and alternative products, contributed to a modest uptick versus 4Q16. Asset management fees for the quarter were stable at $517 million. Investment revenues were $98 million, up $122 million compared to the fourth quarter, which was adversely impacted by the sales and markdowns of non-strategic third-party LP investments. Overall expenses were up 7% quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by compensation expenses attributable to higher carried interest. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot asset increased to $832 billion. As I mentioned earlier in the year, we had the capital capacity to increase our balance sheet if the client opportunities and returns justify the usage. Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $360 billion, down $10 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by lower operational risk RWAs. The reduction in RWAs contributed to a 70 basis point increased in our pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced common equity Tier 1 ratio of 16.6%, bringing it more in line with our pro forma fully phased in Basel III standardized common equity Tier 1 ratio. As the two ratios have almost converged, we will be disclosing both, going forward. Our pro forma fully phased in supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter increased to 6.4%. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $750 million of common stock or approximately 17 million shares, and our Board declared $0.20 dividend per share. Our tax rate in the first quarter was 29%. This includes $112 million tax benefit attributable to the employee share-based payment accounting change adopted in January. This accounting change is permanent, and will impact our quarterly and annual effective tax rate. Given our stock vesting schedule, the most meaningful impact will occur in the first quarter of each year when restricted stock units convert into common stock. If our stock appreciates over vesting period, we will have a benefit and if our stock depreciates between the grant and vesting date, we will have an expense. This change, along with the variability of our geographic mix of business, will make the tax rate somewhat more volatile. We expect our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in the 32% to 33% range. As James said in the opening, the strong results this quarter provide support that our strategy is working. The post election momentum continued into 2017 and provided a healthy backdrop for most of our businesses. Our M&A and underwriting pipelines remain healthy and macro events should continue to provide opportunities for our trading businesses. Our wealth business is performing well and has several tailwinds that have begun to materialize. Our investment management business have seen flows stabilize and better investing performance. However, questions around timing and achievability of the new administration\u2019s policy initiatives, resulted in more sporatic client activity towards the end of the first quarter. This was consistent with a broader theme that began to crystalize in late March. The contrast between the strength of the global economy and the unease around U. S. policy outcomes and potential geopolitical streams. We\u2019re cognizant that uncertainty can weigh on market physiology and activity levels. With that, we will open up the line to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open. Brennan Hawken : So really encouraging to see securities business put up another good quarter. And so now that it seems like it\u2019s pretty hard to argue, it\u2019s not very much unstable footing, the restructuring worked out very, very well with that really repositioning. What are you focused on from here, when you think about the potential for less hostile regulatory environment. Where that might provide opportunities versus how your franchise is positioned, how should we think about that, going forward? And how do you balance the idea of potentially getting better returns in that business versus returning capital to shareholders. Could you help us how you're thinking about that? James Gorman : Brandon, I think I'd have to write you a 10 page paper on that one, hell of an opener. Let me stop, because that's going to feed into, I suspect about two-thirds of the questions we get on this call. Firstly, just on the business, I mean; frankly, what we\u2019re focused on is to do it for full year not for one quarter. Obviously, happy with the way the quarter turned out. I think the team did a terrific job in navigating an environment that was clearly not consistent through the quarter. As Jon said, the back half of March was much tougher than the early part of the quarter. So number one, is just keep executing; manage our expenses in the businesses where we can keep up share, pick up share in the businesses where we\u2019re holding share, hold it; so that's number one. Number two, we are committed to returning capital in a meaningful and accelerating basis in the years ahead. And if we continue to accrete earnings of this level, there's no reason why we shouldn't keep doing that. And with that retire a number of shares that we're very focused on our share count. So the combination of dividend increases and further buybacks are critical to further driving the ROE performance of this firm. And not the only thing but they fully, given that drives the denominator, they\u2019re pretty important part of the answer. We just submitted the 2017 plan obviously, getting the resubmission on 2016 done successfully was critical. The 2017 plan is we've had I think four or five years of dividend and capital increases. And I think it's fair to say that we like that trajectory. I'm not going to get into what our ask was but between us and the federal reserve until we get the results. But we retained a lot of earnings last year and we like to keep driving our capital returns up. So let me just leave it at that. On the regulatory front, there's huge moving parts, I mean -- and on fiscal policy; first the corporate tax rate, as we said, we have a large business that is almost entirely in the U. S. and large parts of the rest of the firm are in the U. S. So anything on the corporate tax rate front is positive to Morgan Stanley, and it appears likely whether it\u2019s this year ultimately or next year, there will be movement on that rate. I suspect it will be a little more modest and some of the numbers that have been thrown out. But nonetheless, anything sub 30%, appears probable would be very positive. On the regulatory front, I think the weight of opinion is that while the U. S. financial system is demonstrably healthier than it was going into the crisis and in the years following, we\u2019ve reached a point where the amount of capital burden and regulatory burden on the system and some of the elements of that and some of the lack of transparency elements are right for real change, and that has been acknowledged all the way from board members of the federal reserves on down. And so as we said, it's too early to predict what regulatory changes occur. But let me give you just a very simple one. If the banks are able to submit their CCAR plan, get the results bad and then submit what they capital ask is, there'll be no guessing about how much capital you have or you don't have. It would be up to the boards of directors and the banks to figure out what the right capital ask is given how much capital they've got. Had Morgan Stanley done that last year? We would have had $2 billion of extra capital to adjudicate on with that board. That's a simple and to me very obvious fix to stop the guessing of what capital you\u2019ve had. I think there's a compelling argument to move a lot of these regulatory programs to every other year. We\u2019re six to seven years into it. I think the system has been build inside the banks, which make them much more predictable. And in terms of the CCAR, CLAR resolution planning processes, I'm not sure putting all of these on an annual cycle, which is very expensive, very time consuming, is terribly additive. The amount of response time you have to those is matter of months before you resubmit again. So we\u2019ll talk more may be on the call about some of the other specific things. But I think there are a number of very specific fixes that both relieve the expense and time consumption, now that the plans are relatively mature, without attracting all from the regulatory rigor that is necessary for strong and healthy banking system. And for those banks that are fully capitalized, which we clearly count ourselves among them, it provides them with an opportunity to return that excess capital to shareholders. Brennan Hawken : That\u2019s very helpful and really thorough. I know it was a pretty broad question, but thanks for that James. Taking in a little bit, we heard some -- there seems to be some momentum behind the SLR and may be some potential for changes there. Not asking you to predict what could change with that calculation. But just more broadly, if we do see SLR relief, what would you feel about as far as your PV business, how much further momentum do you feel like you can grow? And do you think that that should continue to provide a nice tailwind on to the equities business broadly, just given the non-box approach. James Gorman : I don\u2019t want to be evasive, Brennan. But I also don\u2019t want to presume. I think there are too many contingencies in there, if this and if that then what would happen. I think it's fair to say the denominator in SLR clearly should be adjusted. And I think there has been lot of discussion in the White House in treasury and across the various regulatory bodies about that. And making it A, more consistent with the Europeans, I think there is also an argument by the way bringing the ratio, which is currently 5% of capital to the growth that balance sheet to the European level, I suppose 3%. So there are some pretty significant differences between different jurisdictions. And I think harmonizing those makes sense. I think you will see an adjustment to the denominator, the total balance sheet under the, what I suspect will be the ultimate new SLR rules. But I don\u2019t want to predict, and I'm pretty sure Jon doesn\u2019t either, on how that might affect our equities business and what that implies about our prime, so it\u2019s a little early for that. We have a terrific equities business. We think our PB is the best on the street and obviously, that\u2019s a source of focus and growth for the firm. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. Jim Mitchell : May be a quick question on -- you guys seemingly loss but gave up little market share when you trim 25% of the workforce, but it's obviously a strong momentum. Since then as you my guess is picked up recaptured some of that market share. What have you guys been doing differently? And do you think that momentum in market share can continue given where you are currently? Jonathan Pruzan : Listen, we're been very pleased with the performance in that business, as you said. We had it, went through a major restructuring. We\u2019re now generating significantly more revenues and we had before that restructuring with lower expenses and less people. So the operating leverage in that business has been very good. Our market share and momentum in that business has been good. And I think we feel confident that we will continue to be relevant to our clients, support other ISG businesses. And the ultimate results will really be a function of the markets. In a growing market, we would expect to participate in that growth. And in the shrinking market, it becomes more challenging and we would try to defend our positions. Jim Mitchell : Maybe and just a follow-up on regulatory question. Seems like everything is moving your way except where there has been some discussions about new glassed eagle would look like. If it\u2019s similar to the ring fencing in the UK, is that something that concerns? Or how do you think about that that\u2019s your wild card? James Gorman : I get a little concerned when somebody tells me everything is moving our way. We have a lot of years where everything has not being moving our away. So it\u2019s nice that something is moving our away, and I\u2019ll leave it at that. I heard one of my peers say every time he hears about 21st century glassed eagle, he ask everybody around what the heck does that mean. I\u2019m not sure what it means, maybe there\u2019s a ring fencing along that sort of vickers rule in the UK. Again, we have a very different business model from the universal banks, but we do have a significant deposit business. And I am comfortable on a global competitive basis the more pure investment bank models would be least effective by that kind of structure or holding company structure with separate divisions with so called ring fences around them. But it\u2019s a little early. I don\u2019t really don\u2019t want to guess. I mean, I think there is and should be in zero appetite for reshooting glassed eagle itself, obviously. And happy to see that that seems to be the prevailing view. But whether we move to this ring fence model, I\u2019m pretty confident we can deal with that here at Morgan Stanley. But I don\u2019t want to predict whether we get them on our own. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Glenn Schorr : Maybe I\u2019ll try a little bit more color on FIG business, and obviously the great growth over the last four quarters. I guess I\u2019d like to get towards, and I appreciate you don\u2019t want to spell-out business-by-business underneath the covers. But maybe how diversified across products has the growth been, what your biggest business? Or how do you would define your identity? I think it\u2019s been great, we\u2019re just looking for more color. James Gorman : The best way to describe it is just look at the quarter-over-quarter results and describe the macro backdrop that we were operating under. We had really good performance in the Americas around our credit businesses, good environment there, both tightening spreads and activity levels, securitized products, as well as the credit complex more broadly. On the macro side, given what we\u2019ve going out with the Fed and the guessing game of when and how, we did see more activity. And our rates business was stronger in the quarter, that was offset by the FX business where we -- it's a smaller business for us, but it was still impacted really by really low volatility in that sector, as well as less client engagement. And then commodities, which is a smaller business for us now, performed well over the stable environment. So a reasonable amount of hedging activity, and client engagement there. So broadly speaking, a good quarter for the businesses and the strength was pretty much across all products, except for really FX. Glenn Schorr : That actually helps a lot, defined on the product that level. Geographically, do you have a stronger weighting in the Americas, or is it reasonably global diverse? James Gorman : Definitely, the global footprint is important. But basically in all of our ISG businesses, the Americas would be the biggest contributor. You see our revenue breakdowns, I know as a firm and the supplement which has about 70% of our revenues coming, give or take from the Americas. But we do have strong footprint in both EMEA and Asia and so we had good performance across the board. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Your line is now open. Steven Chubak : So want to kick things off with a question on CCAR in the capital stack, your CET1 ratio is clearly very strong. As we await the results for the upcoming CCAR exam, historically, leverage has tended to be a bit more constraining for you guys. And with the inclusion of the SLR in this upcoming test and also given the latest preferred issuance you announced, I was hoping you could just shed some light on how the introduction of the SLR constraint actually informs your thinking in terms of excess capital; and how we should expect you to manage the capital stack going forward, whether we should see some incremental pref issuance from here. Jonathan Pruzan : Sure. So as you said, first of all, in terms of our capital and how we think about it, a couple of quick things; one, in the beginning of '16, we said we were capital sufficient for the business mix and our risk profile. James did mention we accumulated capital over the course of the year. We have started to put some of that capital back into the businesses. We grew the balance sheet a bit here in the first quarter. It's the first time in a while that we've done that, but we saw a good client engagement and good return opportunities. CCAR is our binding constraint when it comes to capital. And as you highlight, the leverage ratio has historically for at least the last two years been what has been our lowest ratio post stress. SLR new this year, again the models aren't particularly transparent but we'll have to see what the results are when we get them back in June. But we have generally been more constrained around leverage than we have around the risk rate asset ratios because we've taken risk dramatically down -- our RWAs dramatically down, particularly in our fixed income business. So leverage still the constraint and then I think your last comment was on the stack. We did do a preferred issuance, it's been effective, a cost effective capital contributor. And we'll just obviously have to see what our results are and what the markets are going forward to determine how we manage that stack. James Gorman : I would just give, add something to that. I mean the constraints and the way that supplemental leverage ratio is going to play out, all presume but the current CCAR methodology and approach continues as is. And again, back to some of the -- what I would regard as practical fixes to CCAR, I give you one in addition to ones we kicked off this with. The banks are required to continue to presume they will distribute -- do their buybacks for nine quarters after we're in a billable scenario. So in our case, the buyback last year was 3.5 billion, nine quarters is approximately 7.7 billion. So you're carrying effectively 7.7 billion, but in theory you continue to payout to shareholders for nine quarters after in a billable scenario. Not only is that unlikely but there is a very easy fix for that. You could had the board sign a letter or give the federal reserve feeder right to eliminate the buyback program the moment we get into this kind of scenario, that would be a very easy fix. I understand the logic of holding banks whatever their dividend program is because in previous crisis some banks did not cut their dividends to try and evidence strength. But there is no bank board that we continue to buy back stock when their capital is being depleted. So that of itself creates an enormous capital access sitting inside these institutions before you get to which leverage ratio, which constraining ratio it bumps into. So fixes like that, which are pragmatic, sensible just obvious things that could be done to make the thing more transparent and more realistic about the way they real operates, I think is part of what I hope the new administration is going to be looking at it. And I think they should look at it because U. S. financial system should be operating on the same footing as financial systems around the world. Steven Chubak : And actually it\u2019s interesting, because certainly Trula Velez had advocated for some of those practical changes as part of his stress capital buffer approach. But also as part of some of those proposed changes that he outlined and this was back in September, did note that we want to include surcharges in the CCAR exam as well. And didn\u2019t know if you could just provide some thoughts as to whether you thought some of the changes that he outlined were in fact sensible, since he is no longer in that seat and there is -- it's unclear whether some of those changes he outlined will in fact be implemented. James Gorman : I don\u2019t want to speak for formal governor or Trula. Obviously, I read the speech and had this discussion many times. So I think that change in the second one was the balance sheets grow during the times of financial stress. I don\u2019t know how you have balance sheet growth and unless you do an acquisition. So again, it is clearly illogical to have balance sheet growth during a time of financial stress. The assets would depreciate in value and institutions will be shrinking not growing. So those two things, the buy back and balance sheet growth, drove up the capital levels. When you took those out I guess the view in that speech was you would simply replace that with a buffer. Well to me that\u2019s just whether it\u2019s balance sheet growth and holding buy back or buffer is kind of irrelevant. But the objective would seem to be in that case simply add a buffer of capital to the institutions. My question is why, why do they need that? If they're capitalized at the level where the global institutions are capitalized and some, it appears to me that that would be a perfectly proven place to start with. So I'm a big fan of commanizing the buy back and the balance sheet growth. I'm not a big fan of being taking that off the table, but simply replacing with a buffer. I don\u2019t think that makes good sense. Jonathan Pruzan : I think Steve one of the big challenges with all these questions is we just don\u2019t know, and there is no new guidance for 2018. We haven\u2019t gotten our 2017 results back, governor Trula did give a speech, but he is no longer in that seat, that seat is currently vacant. And until it gets filled then we get some more guidance, it's really just speculation at this point. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. Guy Moszkowski : So we\u2019ve talked a lot about capital, and I appreciate all the views on regulatory things that might change ahead or would make sense to change. I guess the question that I have been now that is what kind of visibility might there be to reducing excess capital over time, quite apart from regulatory change, which is of course hard to forecast at this point. Maybe you could give us some sense for the outlook in terms of further reduction in ISG\u2019s capital consumption. Just from runoff over the medium term of legacy positions like long dated derivative. I couldn\u2019t help, but notice, but you had $3 billion reduction and ISG\u2019s allocated equity during the quarter? Jonathan Pruzan : You did see our new -- the capital allocation for the year. As you know, we allocate once and then keep it steady for the current year. We did continue to derisk the balance sheet over the course of the year, and fixed income and then you can see the results that we brought down capital in that business. As I said before, we have capital capacity to grow that business. If the client opportunity there as well as the returns are there, I think we look at the sales in trading business now as one business and allocate resources to the business, and then try to optimize across the internal products, which were within that set. We increased our investment and the balance sheet this quarter, as I mentioned, in the sales and trading business. So we continue to see roll down of long-dated stuff, but I think at this point, it\u2019s not really material and it\u2019s not really part of the management of the business. Guy Moszkowski : And then just a follow-up question to something that James mentioned earlier, specifically with respect to the CCAR. That was an interesting proposal that came out of Congress, actually to change the CCAR to every other year. And obviously, I hear you in terms of the potential cost saves. But is that really true, would you have to maintain significant apparatus and personnel, and maintain the systems and everything and probably one in parallel, overtime. Do you really save that much money from only running it every year? And I guess to put it in context, have you guys thought about what -- how that might compare to say the savings that you might be able to generate from a meaningful reduction in the Volcker risk reporting? How do those two compare in terms of cost saves? James Gorman : Let me start-off with, forget about what the cost saves are, and just say what is the intended benefit of the CCAR process to determine if an institution has sufficient capital and the stability of the scenario. And if it has been sufficiently robust in testing its processes, its risk management, anticipating risks and arriving that conclusions. And it\u2019s a qualitative and quantitative aspect of it. My point is that it is an enormous task. In our case it\u2019s something like 25,000 pages, I think, Jon, we submit on an annual basis. And it takes an enormous effort by our regulators to digest; there are many, many meetings between the regulators and management; there are horizontal review teams across all of the fed reserve. And then eventually reporters produced pinning on whether you passed the quantitative and the qualitative by how much and various feedback relating to quantitative and qualitative. And then you resubmit again some months later. I just think the amount of time it takes to process all this information to meaningfully act on it, then the next annual submission appears very rapidly. So as a practical matter for an exercise of this rigor and substance, I think there would just be more value added in having people digest it for year and have really proper thoughtful responses over the longer time frame. Does it reduce the cost to the organization? Of course, it's just the time management from myself down through to the heads of risk, audit, finance, compliance, legal, all down through the organizations and the whole CCAR. And yes, it\u2019s a huge effort internally and with external consultants in the preparation of the 25,000 plus pages. Is that the primary driver of this? No, in my opinion, the primary driver should not be expense driven, it should be outcome driven. What is the right outcome to achieve the best result, which the regulators and frankly tax payers and the institutions and the shareholders want. And I think a more thoughtful outcome would be every other year, given the magnitude of it, so that's really my focus. It's not about money saving, does it have the additional outcome that expense would come down and distraction for an organization, sure. But that's not the objective. We all want a healthy and very safe and sound financial system, nobody is pushing against that. I think more time to digest changes and adjust to them for institutions of this complexity on a two year cycle would just make good common sense. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. Eric Wasserstrom : Jon, my question goes to the net interest income, I know you talked a bit about it. But I'm a little confused still on the sequential trends, particularly as it relates to the cost of funds, which intuitively would have seen to have moved higher given rate hikes, both in December and recently. So can you just help me understand what's occurring there? Jonathan Pruzan : Sure. I think if you're looking at the asset sensitivity or the net interest income in our wealth business, which is generally where most of the asset sensitivity is, a couple of things. We've grown that line item quite aggressively over the last several years over $2 billion in the last four year, including $500 million of growth last year. What I said in February is that we still expect to generate good growth in net interest income, albeit at a slightly slower pace. And we still feel good about the guidance that we've given you. What we've seen now that we've been through three, I guess, rate hikes in the last year and change, is that the model data has been higher than what's actually happened, in terms of the deposit base. And we still think that roughly the 50% data that we've been using is the right, is a reasonable estimate going forward. But again, it's a model and we haven't really seen that many rate hikes over a long period of time, particularly given money market reform and digital products in terms of deposit behavior. So at this point, we still think it's a reasonably good estimate. But our performance in wealth NII is strong and we still feel confident that we can grow that business, because of the lending products that we're offering to our clients, as well as the benefit of the forward curve this year and the potential for future rate hikes. Eric Wasserstrom : But specifically understanding that maybe the deposit data isn't as high as you\u2019ve anticipated. How would that reconcile with the actual decline in interest expense that you saw in Wealth Management, sequentially? Was it a change in liability structure, or I mean I guess I'm just surprised that that number went down, given that rates went up twice over that time frame. Jonathan Pruzan : You're referring to the 91 to 85? Eric Wasserstrom : Correct. Jonathan Pruzan : The $6 million, again, I don\u2019t -- that\u2019s a small number to track. I think that liability stack is pretty consistent quarter-over-quarter. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Matt O\u2019Connor: I was wondering if you could take about the equities business, it was fairly to resilient year-over-year. Just a little more color on that. And then obviously one of the drags was in prime and you mentioned higher funding cost. Maybe just so I question, but I thought there be, maybe an offset where your funding cost go up where you can pass that along to the clients as well. So just talk about that, but then more broadly speaking, the fact that the revolver is quite resilient versus a fairly solid year ago level. James Gorman : Sure. As you said, this is a very resilient business for us. We're number one in the world. We've got a very full service platform in providing intellectual capital for our clients globally, and the business has preformed quite well. We did see a pick up in cash and derivatives this quarter, PB was stable quarter-to-quarter. If you look at year-over-year, from the press release, we did see higher funding cost but that\u2019s really a function of the increased liquidity that we\u2019ve carried across the entire firm. And we allocate liquidity to those business, so that sort of that dynamic there; but again we're number one; we feel very good about our position; our performance was very strong, particularly in Europe this quarter; its global; we\u2019ve got a good product set and we feel very good about our position and our continued momentum there. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Fiona Swaffield : I have two questions on Wealth Management, could you talk lending growth, because to me it seems to slowed markedly. Do you think you will meet the targets you set out in the February presentation on the lending side, and where we're on penetration? And then separately just the non-compensation in Wealth Management, which was pretty low. I think you mentioned seasonal, but I mean its still looking good year-on-year. Is that something that that level could be sustained? Thank you. Jonathan Pruzan : On the first point, when I do the second point first, because I forgot your first point. On the second point, the non-comps, we continue to manage aggressively non-comps across the firm. Wealth has been very good at that over the course of the last several years, improving the margins from below 10% to now its current 24% level. The seasonality when we go from a fourth quarter to a first quarter, it's not a great sort of non-comp expense comparison because of the seasonality and some of the spending accounts in the -- marketing of business expenses and wealth, but very strong expense discipline in that business and we would expect that to continue, and then on the target. so the targets that we put out or the guidance that we gave in February, I still feel very confident about, particularly since we, if you recall, at that point, we were looking at two rate increases probably one in the middle of the year and one at the end of the year. And we have seen one happen in March so it clearly happened earlier and the data has been a little bit better then we expected. So my confidence in that guidance overall in NII is still very high. The lending growth in the wealth products was good. As we said before, we would expect mortgage probably to slow, given the rising rate environment. But broadly speaking, the lending targets that we have are on track to provide the NII growth that we expect. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Devin Ryan : Maybe another one in equities here, we\u2019re starting to get a number of questions on MiFID II as it moves closer. So being the leader in equities, it would be just great to get some perspective on what you\u2019re hearing from clients and how you\u2019re preparing for it. And ultimately, do you think this kind of a risk for the business or do you see an opportunity for Morgan Stanley to take more market share? James Gorman : So just generally on MiFID II, as you would expect, we have been preparing for quite some time for the implementation in the beginning at 2018. There are operational and implementation requirements and cost that go with that and we budgeted for that, it\u2019s mostly around IT and systems. And we expect to be in compliance in the beginning of \u201918 when the new rule comes into effect. In terms of the impact, clearly when you have a change, there is probably the potential certainly early for disruption as people adjusted to the new rule. In terms of how that affects market structure longer term and whether people start trading with fewer counterparties or not, I think it\u2019s too early to tell. But again, we are number one in the world in this business and we would expect to maintain that position. And if there is an opportunity for people to consolidate their trading counterparties, we would expect to be part of that benefit. Devin Ryan : Just quick follow-up here, securities based loans begin some attention recently. I guess just maybe seeing a little bit more scrutiny and obviously, it\u2019s been a nice product for Morgan Stanley. It seems like a nice natural product for your clients. I am just curious if there is any change in how you\u2019re thinking about that product specifically within the overall bank mix? James Gorman : No. Again, I think as you highlighted, it\u2019s been a good product and an important product for our clients. It\u2019s part of our full service product offering. Our clients like the products if it helps to manage their liquidity. It\u2019s actually reasonably easy and efficient application process. And if you look at the rates relative to other products like HELOC and unsecured, it\u2019s an attractive rate for our clients. So it\u2019s a good product for the clients. From our perspective, it\u2019s highly collateralized. The weighted average LTV on the product is a little over 40%. It\u2019s really not a credit risk issue, it\u2019s really -- the risk is really around operational risks of fraud. And we haven\u2019t really seen any material losses in that business. So again we feel good, it\u2019s floating rate, it\u2019s a nice product for us to offer and it\u2019s a product that our clients like. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Matt Burnell : I guess just following up on the question on MiFID, what\u2019s going on in Europe. Jon, you mentioned Brexit as being a potential catalyst for volatility. Could you provide a little more color on that given the announcement this week of June election? And does that increase your view that there could be a greater level of volatility in the second quarter into the third quarter than you might have previously assumed? Jonathan Pruzan : In terms of -- let me make some comments on Brexit, I don't recall saying increased volatility for Brexit. But clearly, we have been as have all of peer firms been trying to plan for Brexit for quite some time, we individually have an extensive network of offices and licenses across the EU 27. So we have options, several options that will work once we understand what the ultimate outcome is. We've been in Europe for 50 years, it's an important market for us and we\u2019re committed to supporting our clients, whether that be from London or from some other location. I'm not sure the election changes that. Certainly, doesn't change our analysis of it. It's clearly another risk event out there for people to focus on and concentrate on. But I don't think it changes much of our work and until the election happens, we're more importantly some of the negotiations are more advanced, it's really hard to tell you what the ultimate market structure and outlook is going to be. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim. Andrew Lim : Just wanted a bit more clarity on the high interest rates, and how that\u2019s coming through. You talked about the possibility to that you're on, but are you seeing any signs of having to pay any event or way to try and intensify deposit rates. And if not yet then maybe how do you expect that at some point in the future? And how -- at what level would you expect that to turn towards maybe a third or maybe a 50% of the higher interest rates for that to be paid away? Jonathan Pruzan : As I mentioned, Andrew, the deposit pricing, our deposit pricing hasn\u2019t changed dramatically here so the actual beta has been lower than the model beta. And I said, we continue to model about 50% beta and we think that's a reasonable expectation. But ultimately we'll have to see what happens around customer behavior and competitive dynamics and see how it plays out over time. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Michael Carrier : Just quick two on Wealth Management, so first one. Just on -- obviously, the trends have been strong, but just given you know what we've been seeing with the DOL in terms of delay and potentially it falls through. Just wanted to get a sense on how you guys are positioned if you\u2019re seeing any impact in either direction? And then just on the deposits, it seemed like that you've dipped down a bit in the quarter. I didn't know if you already covered that. But if there was anything that drove that versus the underlying growth that we've seen long term. Jonathan Pruzan : So on DOL, we've been very consistent in saying that we want to provide our clients choice and we will continue to do that with compliance solutions if DOL goes into effect. And we're prepared if it does to go into effect to be compliant. We've had good momentum broadly in the business. And some of the secular changes and secular flows that we've seen continue around fee based assets and just benefits accruing to scale players. So I think all of that momentum is playing well in our system, in our network. It probably has had a chilling effect on recruiting, attrition has been low. We are in attractive place to work and we've seen some good opportunities to bring in talent, so that\u2019s all been positive from that prospective. And we'll ultimately have to see if DOL gets implemented, delayed again, or ultimately, I guess shelved. On the second question, Michael [multiple speakers] BDP seasonality. So it's obviously not a particularly large move but one of the comments I made about client engagement one of the ways that we gauge that metric is around what people are doing with their cash. So every quarter people receive dividend and interest. And periods of volatility around certainty, we've seen BDP balances grow, if people keep it in cash or take it out of the system. What we saw that quarter is significant investments and the dividend and interest going back into the market. We've seen some seasonality where that happens in the first quarter, both the combination of people putting that money to work but also cap season. So nothing alarming and real stability in our deposit base. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. That does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations. During today\u2019s presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman. James Gorman : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. In the second quarter, we achieved 9% ROE reflecting the stability of many of our businesses, which offset a relatively difficult trading environment. In many ways, this quarter provided a robust test of our business strategy. Whilst many trading businesses are affected by benign markets, characterized by low volatility and the absence of meaningful macro events, other business lines demonstrative resilience. Investment banking showed continued strength, reflecting diversity of our global M&A and capital markets franchises. Investment management, saw asset inflows and solid performance across alternatives. As a result, this business saw improved revenues and returns. Wealth management performed at the high end of our 2017 target, achieving 25% pre-tax margin and a record profit before tax of over $1 billion. It is worth noting that in the first year after the acquisition of Smith Barney, wealth management generated approximately $1 billion to pre-tax profit annually. Compensation expenses are in line with our stated targets and higher accruals year-to-date reflect higher revenues. Non-compensation expenses, include one notable item, which Jon will take you through in a moment. Given the obvious headwind this quarter, we\u2019re pleased to have generated respectable return to shareholders, albeit at the bottom-end of our target range. Of course with the firm now on solid footing, [performance] (Ph) could still materially improve in the years ahead assuming constructive markets. In addition, there are three tailwinds worth calling out, each of which has the potential to impact our long-term performance in a material and positive way, capital, tax reform and interest rates. On capital, this year through CCAR, we asked for and received approval to buyback up to $5 million of stock and increase our dividend to an aggregate of $1 per share annually. While we intend to invest in our business as opportunities present themselves, we\u2019re determined to use any excess capital to continue to reduce our share count. Much has been told through adjustments as some of the Doug Frank rules that were put in place over the past eight years. It is fair to say that now is the time to make some practical changes for the multitude of regulations. These changes would allow U.S. banks to be greater engines of economic growth. Second, U.S. corporate taxes are too high. If the administration in Congress can achieve a sensible realignment of tax rates with other major developed economies, then that would be a clear positive for our business and corporate America in general. Finally, as the major U.S. depository we have endured historically low interest rates for a very long time. Each move when hiring rates assuming a measured path should benefit our business. In summary, in the second quarter we showed resilient in a challenging market. In a more favorable environment, we should see better results. More interesting to us though, of a long-term impact as some of the changes just described. We\u2019ve built meaningful operating leverage in our business, while we remain cautious in the near-term, we launch our business mix and remain bullish on the long-term outlook for the firm. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss the quarter in greater detail. Thank you. Jonathan Pruzan : Thank you and good morning. The optimism that characterized the first quarter was replaced with a more subdued tone amongst clients for the majority of the second quarter. Activity was more sporadic in market sensitive businesses particularly within fixed income were impacted. That said, we supported our clients when market opportunities presented themselves. Equity sales and trading and investment banking produced strong results. Wealth management and investment management both witnessed continued growth and stabilized our headline performance. Firm revenues were $9.5 billion, down 2% compared to a strong Q1. PBT was $2.6 billion, EPS was $0.87 and ROE was 9.1. Non-compensation expenses were up approximately $138 million or 65 quarter-over-quarter. Well over half of the increase was due to a provision that we recorded as a result of a self identified item relating to that on inter-company services provided to our UK operation. We also saw some seasonal increase in professional services, marketing and business development and higher volume driven expenses. We continue to exercise compensation expense discipline, which led to a 1% sequential decline in total non-interest expense. On project streamline, virtually all identified projects are in flight and we are on-track to complete the target outlined at the start of last year. Compared to the same period in 2016, our 2017 year-to-date revenues have increased by over $2.5 billion. In the same period, our non-compensation expenses have increased by about $300 million and total expenses by approximately $1.3 million in the same comparison. As a result, our year-to-date efficiency ratio of 72% is approximately 300 basis points lower than the same period last year and remains well inside the 74% target for the full-year. That said, we recognize that expenses in any one quarter maybe impacted by business mix, geographical mix, seasonal patterns and other factors. During the remainder of 2017, our focus will be on completing all remaining initiatives and making sure that the culture of costs discipline represented by project streamline remains best practice. This will help ensure that the savings achieved to-date remain permanently out of the expense based. Now to the businesses. Net revenues across institutional securities businesses of $4.8 billion were down 8% sequentially. The trading environment slowed from the first quarter, market moving events were episodic, volatility in many asset classes hit multi-year lows and activity was sporadic. Despite the quarter-over-quarter decline revenues across ISG were strong. Non-competition expenses were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 6% sequentially driven by the UK VAT expense, as well as higher execution related costs due to a shift in business and geographic mix of client activity. Compensation expenses were $1.7 billion with the compensation to net revenue ratio of approximately 35%. In investment banking, both advisory and underwriting performed well revenues of $1.4 billion were unchanged versus the first quarter. This result contributed to an exceptionally strong first half of the year. Advisory revenues for the quarter were $504 million, up 2% sequentially. Broadly M&A volumes remain healthy. The fundamental drivers of activity including challenging organic growth remained in place encouraging client engagement. However, we have seen a decrease in larger transformational deals on a year-to-date basis compared to 2016 as the current market environment is impacting management\u2019s decision to act. Additionally uncertainty over taxes, regulatory reform and the broader political landscape will likely weigh on activity. As such, we remain cautious as we look towards the rest of the year. Turning to underwriting, our continuation of stable capital markets with low volatility and range down credit spreads contributed to another strong quarter for underwriting. Overall, equity volumes continue to recover from the weak level seen last year particularly in Europe. The market was receptive to both IPOs and follow-on. We generated equity revenues of $405 million, up 4%. We expect activity levels to remain healthy although near-term issuance windows maybe impacted by macroeconomic uncertainties and a typical summer slowdown. Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased 5% sequentially to $504 million, a market wide decline in volumes relative to strong first quarter was partially offset by market share gains across both investment grade bond and high yield financing. Our sales and trading performance was solid, the post election excitement that began to slow towards the end of the first quarter did not reassert itself for most of the second quarter predominantly impacting our fixed income franchise. However, activities saw a notable uptick towards the end of the period as rates felled off. This contributed to our overall performance and underscores the strength and resilience of our franchise. In equities, we retained our leadership position and expect to be number one globally with revenues of $2.2 billion, up 7% sequentially. Strong prime brokerage revenues aided by seasonal factors contributed to the sequential increase. We continue to witness growth in client balances positioning us well in this business. Derivative revenues remain solid. These gains were partially offset by lower cash revenues driven by lower volatility. Once again, our diversified strategy and global footprint benefited from pocket to regional strength. In the quarter we saw a very strong European activity as well as increases up in Asia. Fixed income revenues in the second quarter were $1.2 billion down 28% versus a very strong first quarter and 4% versus a year ago. Historically, low volatility, a rally in interest rates over most of the quarter and fewer market events contributed to a slowdown in overall performance, while the revenue showed a sequential decline given the market backdrop, we\u2019re pleased with the results. In our credit businesses revenues were down quarter-over-quarter driven by lower levels of activity. Our securitized products business also witnessed a decrease in revenues compared to last quarter, as the frequency of larger transaction slowed. Within macro, our rates businesses were negatively impacted by low levels of volatility. This was partially offset by foreign exchange in emerging markets where discreet geopolitical events and pockets of volatility lead to stronger revenues. Commodities saw a sequential decline as there were fewer structured deals in the quarter. While the environment did weigh on the results, this quarter revenues underscores the progress the business has made over the last 18 months. Since we restructured our business in 2015, we have experienced various market backdrops. Clearly, some have been more favorable than others. We are encouraged by the consistency of recent results and are critically and credibly sized to service our clients as the backdrop evolves. Average trading VaR for the period was $51 million up versus $44 million last quarter. We deployed capacities to support accretive client opportunities. Now turning to wealth management, which reported another record quarterly revenue and pre-tax profit result. The revenue and margin achievements underscores the businesses ability to benefit from the scale of the platform. These results were achieved despite a normalization in activity following a strong first quarter as retail sentiment reflected the same uncertainties faced by our institutional clients. Second quarter revenues were $4.2 billion a 2% sequential increase. The PBT margin 25% slightly above our full-year 2017 target range reflected growth in fee based revenues and operating leverage. Client assets grew 2% to $2.2 trillion, fee based assets increased 4% to $962 billion were 43% of total client assets. While the department of labor fiduciary rule has contributed to these fee base close, the majority of the movements have been from non-retirement accounts, reflecting client\u2019s choosing the enhanced service levels provided by this offering. We saw strong fee based asset flows of $20 billion. Higher asset levels and positive flows contributed to asset management revenues of $2.3 billion representing 5% growth relative to the first quarter. Net interest income of $1 billion was up 2% over last quarter, that benefit a higher rates and lending balances was partially offset by lower deposit levels. This reduction in deposits reflects both typical seasonal client tax payments and deployment of cash into the markets. NII was further negatively impacted by higher prepayment amortization. Wealth management lending in the U.S. banks grew by about $3.5 billion in the quarter or 6%, as clients drew on their SPL lines to manage liquidity needs, a trend we often witnessed in the second quarter. Year-to-date our NII of $2 billion is up approximately $340 million or 21% compared to the same period last year. While market expectations for additional rate hikes have lessened. We remain comfortable with the full-year NII guidance provided in Q1. In particular, we expect to continue to benefit from further lending risk. Transactional revenues of $766 million were down 7% from Q1. While clients deployed cash into the market, the frequency of trading captured in brokerage accounts decreased from the previous quarter. Again, mimicking the pattern witnessed in the institutional space. Lower mark-to-market gains on our deferred compensation plans were also a driver of the sequential decrease. Total non-interest expenses were essentially unchanged versus Q1 highlighting the operating leverage in this scale business. Lower compensation expenses were offset by seasonally higher marketing and business development and professional services expenses. The compensation ratio was below our full-year target of 56%. Looking forward, we remain optimistic about the outlook for this business and the value of its contribution to the firm\u2019s business mix. Annuitized revenue continue to grow with fee based assets and increased loan balances. Additionally, our investments into improving our digital capabilities will enhance future productivity and provide more operating leverage to the franchise over time. Investment management witnessed a solid quarter with strength across both asset management fees and investment results. Total net revenues were $665 million up 9% quarter-over-quarter. overall, AUM grew 3% to $435 billion driven by investment performance with particular strength across our active equity strategies. We also saw positive flows across our equities, fixed income and alternative businesses with strong capital raising internationally. On the back of higher AUM, we saw a commensurate 4% growth in asset management fees to $539 million. Investment revenues were up 28% to a $125 million driven by gains in our infrastructure and real estate funds. Despite the 9% revenue increase, overall expenses were up only 3% quarter-over-quarter. Turning to the balance sheet, on a sequential basis total spot assets of $841 billion were up $9 billion and average assets were up $12 billion reflecting continued support of client activities within the sales and trading businesses. Our pro forma fully phased in advance RWAs are expected to be up approximately $22 billion versus the first quarter to $381 billion driven by higher market RWAs consistent with the increase in VaR metrics over the quarter. As a result, our pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced common equity Tier-1 ratio decreased approximately 70 basis points sequentially to 15.9% which remains in line with our pro forma fully phased in Basel III standardized common equity Tier-1 ratio. We continue to expect the two ratios to remain relatively close in the near-term. Our pro forma fully phased in supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter remained at 6.4%. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $500 million of common stock or approximately 12 million shares. Our tax rate in the second quarter was 32%, we continue to expect our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in the 32% to 33% range. This quarter\u2019s results reaffirm that our strategy is working. As James said at the outset, this quarter represented an important test of our model. Notwithstanding a challenging trading environment we achieved a 9% ROE on account of our balanced business mix and the resiliency of the franchise. However, investors slightly remains fragile. The same questions that lingered around timing and achievability of the administration\u2019s policy initiatives at the end of the first quarter remain unresolved as we enter the third quarter. In addition, the market continues to grapple with mixed economic data and questions around the timing and pace to monitory policy tightening. This dynamic may continue to weigh on activity and sentiment in addition to typical seasonality in the summer. At the same time, we should not lose focus on the broader macroeconomic issues that could have a materially positive impact to our business. After years of headwinds for the industry, we are finally starting to see some tailwinds that can be promising for our business in the long-term including the potential for tax reform, sensible regulatory change and a rising interest rate environment. We are confident that we will achieve our stated goals. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Glenn Schorr : First question on wealth management, I noticed the deposits down 7% I think, sometimes its seasonality and then sometimes it\u2019s cash deployment. I\u2019m just curious, how you attribute some of that and also if this is late competition and what we expect on deposit data, if there are more rates hikes? James Gorman : Sure Glenn. I think as I mentioned in the script, it was a combination of both. Clearly, we normally see in the second quarter PBT deposits going down, because of tax season. We also saw continued deployment into the markets. I don\u2019t think, we have seen a lot of deployment into other cash product. So again from a competitive dynamic, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a rate story, I just think it\u2019s an opportunity story. We\u2019ve started a couple of quarters ago initiating some other strategies around the deposits including premier cash management product and some CD products and we\u2019ve got a couple of billion dollars in those products. So we feel good about the overall deposit franchise and the overall ability to fund that business as we continue to see growth in the asset side. Glenn Schorr : So maybe bluntly, if we get a couple more rate hikes do you capture the majority of it - even without as us said a rate story. Do you have to hike along the way or are the clients looking to participate in that move-up? James Gorman : I think the best indication of how we feel about that is really looking at the NII line, which is as you know has been a very good story for us. All right, back in 2012, we had a $1.6 billion of NII in wealth business, last year was $3.5 billion grew more than $500 million. In February, we talked about what we thought we would see and we thought we would continue to see good growth in the NII line, albeit at a slightly slower pace. Year-to-date were at $2 billion, which is up over $340 million over last year. So again, we feel very confident about that story, it is reliant on the lending growth, which we saw a good growth across all the product this quarter. So we feel good about that, I think the composition is a little different, your comments about betas, generally the betas have lagged what we\u2019ve modeled. So that\u2019s been a positive, we\u2019ve also, if you go back to the first quarter, remember what the curve looked like, I think we\u2019ve gotten rate hikes faster than we thought back then. On the other side of the ledger, you just mentioned the deposits are down. So, we brought down the liquidity pool in the banks as well as started to use other savings and deposit products as well as some wholesale funding to support that business. And then lastly, we clearly, we didn\u2019t model any pre-payment acceleration that we saw in the second quarter as rates went down. So on balance, we are very confident with where we are on NII and it\u2019s been a good story, but the composition has been a little different. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, first on [Indiscernible] really again encouraging to see the sustained stability, say that a few times - now that clearly you demonstrated some stability here after the repositioning. Has there been a shift in mix. Can you give us a sense for the different business lines now that the business has been adjusted and can you also - I know you mentioned Jon that commodities were down sequentially, but was this quarter extraordinary from your perspective we\u2019ve heard some mixed things from some of the competitors some additional color there will be great. Thanks. Jonathan Pruzan : Sure I\u2019ll try. You know I think the way I would look at it is the results clearly just reflect the environment that we were operating in. if you look over year-over-year the results are pretty flat. So, when we look at the individual product mix, as I did mention our rates business given the low volatility is down, yet our FX did a little bit stronger particularly in the emerging market areas. Credits were hung in there, less movement in credit spreads this quarter, but again comparable type of results in light of effected the year-over-year results were essentially flat. So we feel good about the business, commodities are also down a little bit, less activity and a tighter trading band there, but the results reflect the moves and the changes that we made and the results reflect that the business is really starting to come together and jelling and I think we feel pretty good about the results in light of the environment. Brennan Hawken : Right. So I guess from your perspective paraphrasing you said that commodities were tough, but not necessarily extraordinarily difficult or remarkable in that way? Jonathan Pruzan : Yes, listen the commodity business that we have has been totally reshaped and resized, more traditional sales and trading supporting our client base. It\u2019s a smaller contributor for us. So the movements are not that dramatic. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Your line is now open. Steven Chubak : Good morning. So, wanted to started up with the question on wealth management and pre-tax margin, certainly encouraging to see that you guys eclipse the 25% target for the quarter. I\u2019m just wondering as we look ahead to the second half, given a number of favorable trends for the business that Jon you had cited whether it\u2019s strong fee based conversions, healthy loan growth and NII expansion. I\u2019m wondering barring any market exogenous market shocks whether you can sustain margins above that 25% target for the remainder of the year. Jonathan Pruzan : Listen, I think you highlighted what we think is driving that margin. Right now, with the rates and higher markets those are good trends that will drive our asset base fees as well as our NII, our lending growth has been solid, I think the one area of potential volatility or softening is around transactional. We are heading into the summer months, but again, I think the tailwinds for this business are very good. We saw really nice operating leverage here, we saw really nice growth across all products in the lending book and we feel very good about the results, I mean the PBT at $1 billion plus is obviously a record and it\u2019s a really important contributor to the overall franchise. Steven Chubak : Thanks and just one follow-up on capital. You guys had outlined a couple of the potential benefits to your business in terms of capital release that were outlined in the treasury white paper. One of the areas that\u2019s getting quite a bit of focus is this notion that the prospects for cash and liquid assets to be exquisite from the SLR denominator. And I\u2019m wondering given the Tier-1 leverage constraint in CCAR of 4% appears to be a binding constraint for the moment. It\u2019s not clear weather that carve out is going to apply to that measure. I didn\u2019t know if you had had any feedback from regulators as to whether they were considering that possibility and what that might mean for you guys in terms of capital release? Jonathan Pruzan : On the first part of the question I think clearly the reform around SLR would be helpful for a variety of reasons whether or not it\u2019s our binding constraint this quarter or next quarter is certainly not a foregone conclusion. So there could be some benefit from that but we also think there is just general benefit with that calculation in terms of what it means for their overall sales and trading businesses. But I do think there are several changes have been discussed or that are being discussed that would clearly help our position including around the balance sheet and how you think about capital actions going forward. So I think it\u2019s a little early on 2018 CCAR to sort of have a prediction, but clearly we were pleased with the results, if you look back at year ago where we were versus what came out of the report a couple of weeks ago with a 100%ish payout and a 33% increase in capital return and a clean report we\u2019re very pleased. James Gorman : I would just add on the leverage ratio, specifically, we have argued for a number of years and present to regulators for a number of years that the fact that a balance sheet growth during the time of financial stress is hard to understand how that happens. As such depreciate assets run off, new businesses not gathered, it would be hard to imagine in fact during the crisis in the years following of our own balance sheet obviously shrink dramatically both through our actions and through market activity. So the leverage ratio constraint is made more acute by the fact that the denominator is growing at I think it\u2019s about 4.5% a year for the nine quarters. There being quite a lot of sympathy to that view that if we should look not at some blanket growth rate, but what actually experience was during the crisis and during other periods of financial stress. And I think that experience would largely hold up the balance sheet shrink. So if you just held our balance sheet flat for that time period, that would have a material impact on our leverage ratio. So I think there is certainly a good dialogue going on through the treasury white paper and with the regulators on that topic alone. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. Guy Moszkowski : Good morning. Just looking at the VaR and the [indiscernible] metrics, which you talked about and floated up on average basis, I guess it\u2019s about an 8%, depending on which one you look at. So could you give us a sense for given that those are average daily I guess metrics. What we look like at on a spot basis towards the end of the quarter, should we be expecting that these things will close down again? Jonathan Pruzan : Sure. A couple of things. So on the VaR metric, obviously the 51 million was the average for the quarter. If you have queue, it was actually 57 at period end at March 31. So that actually came down overtime and it has actually continue to come down and the spot period end will be lower than the 51 that we said. On the RWA comments, actually some of the calculations are daily average volumes, some of them 12-week averages. And the VaR metrics are important in those calculations. So I think the same trend that we\u2019ve seen in the VaR would be consistent in terms of how we finished out quarter end in that metrics. With the ratio that we have at CET1 even at the 16 or 59 level, we\u2019re still obviously very, very strong in terms of our capital positions. Guy Moszkowski : Great that\u2019s helpful. And then just my follow-up question is more targeted on SIC. Specifically given the success that you have had in generating revenue even in a period like the one that we just had which was certainly weaker characterize by low vol, et cetera on the things that you have said. Would you consider raising your quarterly average expectation from that $1 billion number that you\u2019ve been talking about for quite a while now? James Gorman : Guy, I\u2019m surprise, it took somebody this many questions to get to let\u2019s trace the targets discussion. We just went on the pre-tax margin a few questions ago. I think the short answer you know and it\u2019s no. We\u2019ve been pretty consistent, we took these targets for proof of business model for this year. We\u2019re going to stay with them. We think, listen, we were - recall certain fourth quarter 2015, we were doing 500 million and 600 million in SIC first quarter of 2016, I think if memory serves its about 800 million. A billion dollar number on a study run rate basis is a good number with 25% less people much smaller organization, much more focused organization. If we consistently do better than that and that\u2019s terrific. But I don\u2019t think, the point of setting the target to establish, what we needed to prove to ourselves on an average run rate for the business to justify the expenses in capital balance sheet that we put behind it at that level. Everything we do better than that with the same expenses capital and balance sheet is obviously a gift. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. Jim Mitchell : Good morning. Maybe a follow-up in the SLR and the treasury report. If we assume that both the Tier-1 leverage ratio and the SLR treated similarly by exempting cash and maybe short-term treasuries. How do you think that impacts the business, I guess, I think a lot of people are asking the question of? Is this a revenue opportunity to kind of re-expand the business whether it would be REPO or other businesses or is it really more of an excess capital story. Just trying to get a sense of, if you think business has been held back by the SLR? James Gorman : Let me tell start with and Jon might want to add to it. First and foremost this is a capital question. We believe, we are over capitalized. There were good reasons for that several years ago as we were coming out of those financial crisis, we had a dividend of $0.05 a quarter, we\u2019ve raised that four years in a row to $0.25. Our initial buyback program was zero then went to $500 and it\u2019s now all the way up to $5 billion over five year period. And our payout ratio is closing in on 100%. So we clearly believe that we are over capitalized and for good reasons we were coming off the crisis and we needed to shore up our defenses. There is plenty of opportunity for business expansion with the amount of capital we have today. The more fundamental issue is what is the right level of capital this firm should hold. Are we holding too much capital, because the way the leverage ratio is being constructed, what is the right denominator for the SLR, in fact what is the right ratio. In Europe it\u2019s 3% of the balance sheet and that the growth of balance sheet. In the U.S. they took the [indiscernible] balance sheet ratio of 5% and attached it to this SLR balance sheet from Europe. So we sort of ended up with a fairly [draconian] (Ph) answer. I think let\u2019s start with number one, if the trades in other type securities can be taken out of the SLR that obviously make sense. Number two, to not gross up the balance sheet under the core leverage ratio make sense. And I think we have capacity at that point both for further capital distributions and for sensible business growth. You saw the RWAs bounce a little bit this quarter, that was consistent with sensible business growth, there was opportunity clearly Tier-1 capital ratio is another constraint or no way near it. So that\u2019s the RWA constraint is not there for this firm at the moment. Jim Mitchell : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe as a follow-up on just the treasury report generally. Is there any other aspects of the proposals that you would be particularly helpful for your business? James Gorman : I\u2019m trying to remember all the aspects of the report, but I actually can\u2019t do off the top of my head. I think clearly, I think there is a general recognition from the regulators all the way through the treasury that the Volcker Rule as it play out overtime straight a fair bit distance from Paul Walker initially envisaged, which was a simple restriction on the amount of capital put into proprietary invest and proprietary trading and but then frankly constrained on the ability of institutions to make markets and effective market liquidity. So I think the treasury reports spoke about that. There was reference to the fact that the banks are required to continue their payouts, not withstanding there in the period of financial stress for nine quarters, no bank board would authorize continuing on buyback program during a financial crisis, that clearly wouldn\u2019t happen. You could holding the dividends static, but certainly the buyback shouldn\u2019t be and that would have material effect on the institutions. So our approach has been and we\u2019ve talked about this somewhat publicly recently, let\u2019s focus on a few things that don\u2019t require major legislative change, let\u2019s see the basic architecture of Dodd-Frank in place. Let\u2019s focus on some sensible changes, because we\u2019ve now had eight years of experience and digest and see what worked and what didn\u2019t. And the cumulative effect of a lot of these regulations in some cases end up if you will with a double counting. And I think the spirit of the treasury report reflected that. I think they are focused on sensible pragmatic change, they are not focused on trying to redo the whole legislative agenda. And I think that\u2019s the right approach. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Devin Ryan : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe first here just in wealth management, you\u2019ve recently outlined the digitalization strategy, which was very helpful and with respect to the [robo] (Ph) offering, it sounds like you\u2019re not going to be able to focus on the children of the existing clients and some lower balance accounts which does seem to mark us with this generation of wealth transfer coming here and where the money is going to be over the next several decades. So as we think about that process, how do you protect against maybe some cannibalization of existing business as clients look at the lower price point. You know I guess the question is a revenue opportunity here just much more of an offset or do you just not think this as something that would appeal to some of your existing higher net worth clients for a portion of their accounts, it\u2019s a just a different bucket. Jonathan Pruzan : Yes, I think that your description of what we\u2019re doing on the digitalization and the robo strategies is pretty accurate. Listen, we have a business that is built to cater to clients with wealth. Those wealth clients want advice, they want personal advice, we\u2019re seeing it as we see the brokerage fee base flows coming out of brokerage into the fee based accounts. Obviously digital is going to be an important part of that strategy, but the digital only client is not someone right now that would generally be interested in the types of products and services that we have. We think the digital strategy is going to be important for both revenue opportunities longer term but also optimization and efficiency around what happens in a branch and how we free up people\u2019s time to spend more time with their clients. So overall it\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s going to be built for the longer term but the thesis of our business is around providing people with personnel advice around their wealth and their planning. James Gorman : I would just like to add to that because it\u2019s an important question. We actually saw this maybe once before in 1999 when the direct players came out and the big fear was cannibalization. That would only have held true if people actually didn\u2019t value the financial advisors and advice that we\u2019re getting from those advisors. And it didn\u2019t play out that way. The reality is the marketplace has different segments based on consumer preference and I think the digital strategy makes all the sense in the world. That\u2019s clearly a segment whether they change their behavior as they become wealthy remains to be seen. But there is clearly a segment that wants to deal digitally just as so the segment that wanted to deal through direct brokerage trading and so on. But on the price sensitivity, it\u2019s interesting, I think I\u2019m right in this. If you look at the average basis points paid from the various robo platforms, they range in general like things from something like 20 to 40 basis points. If you look at the average basis points for a full service advisory like us, just divide our revenue into our assets including everything, you get somewhere in the 70s, low 70 basis points. So the value added of the financial buys and the institutions behind it and the research, the product offering, the new issued calendar you could argue is being putout there for 30 to 40 basis points. It\u2019s not clear to me that, that is such an expensive gap that that\u2019s going to lead to the cannibalization issues. I think it\u2019s more that we just need a very compelling digital platform to deal with clients who want to deal with Morgan Stanley, but want to deal with us digitally and don\u2019t want to deal through a traditional wealth management advisory relationship. That\u2019s an exciting opportunity for us, frankly given our brand and add technology capabilities. Devin Ryan : Okay, great. That\u2019s great color, looking forward to seeing it. Maybe an equity is trading here, we\u2019re six months away or within six months of method to in Europe I\u2019m sure there is lot of corporation at the firm right now. So just curious with respect to expectations there, is this something that you feel like it will weigh on the research fee pool, but you\u2019ll pick it up in trading market share or just Morgan Stanley is going to take market share of the overall equities pool. I\u2019m just curious kind of how you would frame your expectations right now, this is we\u2019re getting pretty close to be implementation? Jonathan Pruzan : Yes. Well, I think, as you know, we\u2019ve been preparing for a while both in terms of dialogues with clients, but also systems and technology related investments that we needed to make. But I would tell you, it\u2019s going to be very hard to estimate what the impact of this is. Any time you have a change of this magnitude where you just sort of flip a switch. We would expect the potential for disruption to be pretty high, how would affects longer term structural markets, it\u2019s still up in the air, we\u2019ve global clients to already doing this. We have global clients, so we\u2019re going to probably adopt it in all the markets. Even though, we don\u2019t expected to be adopted in the U.S., we have some clients [indiscernible] off that European operation. So how it all plays out is certainly unclear. But given the fact that we are number one in the world in this business and we have a full service platform and intellectual capital and product. There is consolidation in a number of counter parties. We would expect to participate in that, but I think it\u2019s a little early to make a call here and trying to estimate the impact is also probably a little early to make a call. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now open. Chris Kotowski : Yes. I mean recognizing the excellent outcome that you had in the CCAR capital return process. I have to say, I was surprised a week before, when the DFAS results came out that, that still shows Morgan Stanley has been severely impacted by the severely adverse scenario. That said, the booklet shows you losing 8.4 percentage points of capital and against the median of 2.8. And given all you\u2019ve done and de-risking your balance sheet. I would have thought that we would have seen more progress in that and can you tell us what it is in the fed methodology that seems to cut against you, so disproportionally? Jonathan Pruzan : Again, we were very pleased with the results. We had the same issue last year around DFAS and people sort of concerned with our outcome and about 100% payout ratio continue to increased capital return, part of our core strategy. We clearly have de-risked the balance sheet or RWA density is lower and basically every other firm out there, which is why you see some of that disparaging percentages. If you look at the leverage base ratio, as you get a slighter different picture. We clearly had de-risk, we\u2019ve got and you\u2019ve seen that through the dollar amount of losses that we\u2019ve seen over the last several years have come down. We have met our strategic objective of increasing capital return. We still think we\u2019re capital sufficient. When we came out in January of 2016 with that statement. We said, we were capital sufficient, we did not want to grow our equity base, we have grown our equity base a couple of billion dollars, but we\u2019ve also supported our businesses and grown our balance sheet by $50 billion. So we\u2019ve increased capital return and we\u2019ve increased the size of the balance sheet and we feel very comfortable with our capital position. James Gorman : Chris, we don\u2019t have complete excess to the fed models as I think you know. The construction of operating risk capital, the various stress falls that are in there, counter party risks, how the trading book is managed, how you derive your PP&I, there is a hell of lot of stuff that goes into this. Our own submission was 45,000 pages. And frankly looking back at this point, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be very valuable. The regulators and treasury are all focused on how to make both the models more transparent, the process more transparent and to make some sensible adjustments for it. So honestly I may not to be equipped about it, but I sort of don\u2019t care what the past was. What I do care is that our distribution this year approved to is about $6.8 billion and five years ago it was $400 million. So let\u2019s start with that one and number two, let\u2019s see what changes comes through, we may all be pleasantly surprised, we may be in the same place we\u2019re in, but we\u2019re operating now currently with about 100% pass. So I would let this one play out a little bit and see what comes out of the treasury efforts. Chris Kotowski : Okay. And I mean I guess the thing is right, just again if you look at the old way of doing it right, if you need at five, after the stress then you were losing eight or nine and you need one for a margin of safety that would suggest you need to see T1 ratio on a 14%, 15% on an operating basis, I mean is there an outlook for like operating at less than that? James Gorman : I think you are torturing yourself by looking it backwards. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t do it. Focus on the big picture here. The big picture is, we distributed $400 million five years ago, we\u2019re distributing $6.8 billion now and there\u2019s the full review of the whole capital process being undertaken right now. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe Generale. Your line is now open. Andrew Lim : Hi there. Can I foresee a bit more new claim of excess capital? As things currently spanned [Indiscernible] scenario and that\u2019s 3.2% slightly up to 3% minimum. So you\u2019re maxing out your capital return here. You came with excess capital as contingent on changes kind of true form the treasury or as you say the fed being more lenient on how do you guys leverage [Indiscernible] stress scenario. And so I mean can you give a bit more color on that? James Gorman : I\u2019m really not sure what else I can say. We have consistently increased that capital payouts while the tests become consistently more severe, we\u2019re now at a 100% payouts, by definition, any excess capital we have and gating constraint was the leverage ratio this year and we were above the gating constraint after we did our distribution, so by definition we are carrying excess capital. And our view is that, the way we calculate our capital needs to run our business, we continue to have excess above that, but we\u2019re waiting for the outcome of the white paper and the various efforts from the regulators to see what changes take place, there are clearly going to be changes. How favorable they are and to what extent they fit Morgan Stanley remains to be seen is not going to be productive to try and guess that. Andrew Lim : Right. Understood. And just a follow up question. [Indiscernible] background we haven\u2019t heard anything like that for a long time now. But [indiscernible] when you might get some disclosure of the impact on capital ratios or the timing? Jonathan Pruzan : Yes, I don\u2019t think we have much more visibility than anyone else in this area. I think the thing that sometimes people fail to recognize is we obviously have this white paper and if you think about it, we are actually going to enter a period of refinement and adjustment to regulations versus where we were a year ago, where our expectation was incremental regulation for periods of periods of periods of time to come, we\u2019re clearly going to be in a better place. Now how that plays out and what timeframe and what the actual changes are, it\u2019s very hard to predict, but we are clearly entering a different period going forward that we have been in the last eight years. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Gerrard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Gerrard Cassidy : Thank you, good morning. Can you guys share with us once we get into a more normalized return on capital environment that we see in the future. What kind of dividend payout ratio are you guys comfortable with as we look further out? James Gorman : You know I don\u2019t think it probably serves us well to get a head of that discussion with the regulators and others. I think the current regulatory environment anticipates for the G-Sifi banks at payout ratios of something like 30% and for some of the smaller institutions I think they\u2019ve gone higher than that maybe up to 40%. Whether that changes, you know post all the work being done, I don\u2019t know we\u2019re not at the 30% of this point. I think we\u2019re close to it. So one way to think about our business which is I thought about it for a while the wealth management business is almost like a yield stock. So you can imagine the dividend coming out of wealth management earnings and obviously the institutional businesses are more volatile overtime. So they are more capital distribution businesses or capital investment businesses. But I don\u2019t know Gerrard that we want to change what the targets that are currently being given to us by regulators. Gerrard Cassidy : Okay, great. And then second in the supplement package, on page five you give us the total loans of the organization. And could you share with us some color on - I may have missed this I apologize if I did. Why the corporate loans were down 37% or so year-over-year and a little color behind that really good growth you\u2019re seeing around the wealth management side where those loans are up 20%. Jonathan Pruzan : I\u2019m just flipping to page five, give me a second here. Okay, I think the changes in the corporate book are really around the size of the event book in sort of the event activity as well as some just overall management of the relationship book. The real story for us is as you mentioned has been in the wealth business as we continue to increase the penetration of our client base with lending products. The growth has been very good across all of our three core products the SPL, the mortgage and tailored lending. And we feel like we\u2019ve got good momentum in the growth last quarter at $3.5 billion was pretty balanced across the business a little bit more skewed towards SPL and tailored versus mortgage given what happened in rates, but again that lending story we feel very good about, our levels of penetration of how many of our clients have lending products is still probably a bit below peer level. So we expect or feel good about the ability to continue to grow that and that\u2019s been a real key driver to our wealth business. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Atlantic Equities. Your line is open. Christopher Wheeler : Yes, good morning. A couple of questions on wealth management. I think during the quarter we\u2019ve had the news that I think yourself and couple of your big competitors are now stepping back from filing away experience financial advisors and obviously in doing obviously reducing the cost of amortizing the [indiscernible] senior producers. I would like to perhaps understand how that perhaps progressing, how you\u2019re getting on with that because obviously it\u2019s a big change. And then perhaps to sort of link it up with the end of the Smith Barney payouts and talk about what you think this might do to your pre-tax margin, because I think at one said you say it might add, once a Smith Barney payouts retention packages run out, I mean, next year. You might be adding 1.5% percentage points deal your pre-tax margin. So a bit of color there would be helpful. Thank you. Jonathan Pruzan : I\u2019ll go first on the second part of your question, which is the retention payments conclude in first quarter of 2019. Obviously, it\u2019s a function of numerator and denominator, but 1.5% increase is a reasonable approximation and obviously that will drop directly to the bottom-line. In terms of the attrition in the recruiting that we\u2019ve seen is clearly slowdown and that is obviously helpful both in terms of just ins and outs. The expense associated would bring in new FAs, but also when a FA leads generally they\u2019re book goes with them or a good chunk of their book goes with them. So just lower levels of recruiting and lower levels of attrition has been overall helpful to the business. Christopher Wheeler : And when you just want to decide whether do you think your competitor is holding the line, but it does seem like the beneficial move, but there are one or two players out there, of course, still sort of quite came take away some of your senior people? James Gorman : Listen, these are big organizations. Our major competitors each have, I don\u2019t know 10,000 to 15,000, 16,000 advisors. if you have 1% attrition that\u2019s three-people a week. So it\u2019s not like going to have movement, you\u2019ll always have moment Chris. I think what\u2019s changed structurally with the industry is frankly, there are fewer competitors, if you think Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley is now a composites that includes Dean Witter Reynolds & Company, Robinson, Humphrey, Legg Mason, Smith Barney, Shearson, Hutton. And probably some that I\u2019m missing, all of which use to compete against each of it, recruit against each of it. So it\u2019s a consolidated industry, the big and small films continue to recruit, there are fewer numbers, all that I think the deal structures have become shall I say more sensible, there was a bit of a crazy period there. So, yes, but there will always be some recruiting and that make sense to many people ever right to getting work whether want to work. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Your line is now open. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay thanks. Maybe just a first question on equity sales and trading. I think this is probably third or fourth quarter now, you called out strength and time broker. As a driver of those revenues, can you maybe give us a little bit more color as to what\u2019s driving that strength? Is it by region, is it existing clients more active, is it client growth? Jonathan Pruzan : The simple answer is yes to all of those. Very strong quarter, the growth was across all of the regions, particularly stand out being EMEA, given some of seasonality there. Balances are up, we continue to invest in the balance sheet. And so, again it\u2019s been a very good story for quite some time, it\u2019s the full service platform and our clients have been very responsive to that. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then second question, can you give us an update on kind of where the banking pipeline stand especially for M&A, it seems like there is been pick-up and activity thus far early in the third quarter, I mean how does the pipeline stand at the end of the second quarter versus first quarter? Jonathan Pruzan : I would say that, first of all its very early in the third quarter, point number one. I would say that\u2019s a IBD pipeline, it\u2019s clearly healthy into the third quarter. I think if we look specifically advisory, it\u2019s probably down slightly. But overall, the equity and, debt underwriting remains healthy. IPOs backlog is healthy and broad and activities picked up really nicely here. So again a healthy environment. We are going into the summer months, so we\u2019ll have to see how that impacts us as well as all of the sort of policy uncertainty, uncertainty that we talked about in the past. But right now, pretty healthy. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. That concludes the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com.  Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.  I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman. James Gorman : Thanks, Sharon. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us. While the third quarter was impacted by the typical summer slowdown across many of our businesses, our results reaffirmed that we can generate solid returns against a more subdued backdrop. Strong performance in Wealth Management and Investment Management and stable results in the market-sensitive businesses demonstrated the importance of the balanced business model.  Wealth Management posted record revenues. Margins remained in excess of our target range. These results were achieved despite slower transactional activity. We continue to witness growth in fee-based assets, which surpassed $1 trillion in this quarter. Clients continued to choose the enhanced service models provided by this offering. This trend has reduced our resilience -- our reliance on transactional activity. Incremental revenues will continue to drive margin improvement, subject, of course, to decisions to invest in initiatives that have the potential to further accelerate growth. These investments include not only our digital build-out but also further enhancements to our advisory platforms, lending cash management products and integrated, goal-based planning solutions.  Within Institutional Securities, Investment Banking showed continued strength, particularly in advisory, notwithstanding the amount of uncertainty around the political and fiscal outlook. Sales & Trading was impacted by the environment, characterized by a seasonal slowdown, muted client activity and low levels of volatility. That said, Equity Sales & Trading demonstrated consistency despite subdued activity. Fixed Income remained above our $1 billion run rate per our average quarterly revenue goal, and Investment Management exhibited steady performance with a combination of positive flows across our actively managed strategies.  Often an underappreciated part of our firm, Investment Management represents a high-returning business with a complementary mix of traditional and alternative platforms. We continue to explore both organic and inorganic opportunities in this space. Our pending acquisition of Mesa West Capital serves as the most recent example. Mesa West complements our existing real estate product offerings and provides us with an opportunity to leverage our current distribution channels.  We continued to see signs of operating leverage across our business model, not just in Wealth Management, where it's most apparent. Incremental revenue is expected to generate higher margins, assuming we continue to manage our cost base with discipline. That said, we won't be shy about reinvesting where we see market and competitive opportunities. The Mesa West acquisition and the continuing build-out of our U.S. banks serve as examples of this choice.  Finally, as has been widely discussed in every corner of our sector, there are 3 additional medium- to long-term drivers of performance improvements for our industry, corporate taxes, rates and any changes to the regulatory framework. To repeat what is commonly understood, as a firm, we have a relatively high corporate tax rate given our meaningful U.S. presence. Second, we continue to be positioned to benefit from higher interest rates. And third, we are heavily regulated, not least in the area of capital, which culminates with the CCAR exam. While the degree of these changes will become clearer only over time, they should not go unnoted. In the near term, we continue to have good client receptivity around the globe. And absent any material changes to macro conditions, we remain confident in the goals we have set for this year. I'll now turn the call over to Jon. Jonathan Pruzan : Thank you, and good morning. The operating environment we witnessed in the third quarter, in many respects, represented a continuation of the second quarter's market conditions. Client conviction remained limited. Activity and volatility were muted across several markets, impacting Sales & Trading in particular. Typical summer patterns added to the lackluster tone. Despite this somewhat uninspired trading environment, results remained solid with strong performance in Investment Banking and Investment Management and consistent revenue growth in Wealth Management. At $9.2 billion, firm revenues were in excess of $9 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter. In the quarter, PBT was $2.5 billion and EPS was $0.93. ROE was 9.6%. These numbers were aided by certain tax benefits that I will discuss in detail shortly. These tax benefits contributed approximately $0.05 of EPS and 50 basis points of ROE.  Our year-to-date efficiency ratio of 72% is well inside the 74% target we've set for 2017. This is evidence that the Project Streamline expense savings initiatives we embarked on at the beginning of last year are coming to fruition. Underscoring the firm's operating leverage, year-to-date revenue is up $2.8 billion or 11%, and pretax profit is up $1.3 billion or 20% over the same period last year. Going forward, our focus will be on ensuring that the savings achieved to date are kept permanently out of the expense base in an effort to maximize operating leverage across all of our businesses. Over the quarter, non-compensation expenses were down $63 million or 2%, primarily driven by the absence of the VAT provision recorded in the second quarter. We continue to exercise compensation discipline, contributing to a 2% sequential decline in total noninterest expense.  Now to the businesses. Net revenues in our Institutional Securities businesses of $4.4 billion were down 8% sequentially. In addition to the seasonal slowdown across several of the businesses, volatility in many asset classes remained at or near multiyear lows. And there were fewer idiosyncratic market-moving events. Consequently, client activity slowed from the second quarter. Non-compensation expenses were $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 3% sequentially. Compensation expenses were $1.5 billion. Our year-to-date compensation to net revenue ratio was approximately 35%, in line with our target of 37% or lower.  Investment Banking continued to show strength in advisory and debt underwriting. Revenues of $1.3 billion were down 10% versus a strong second quarter. We continue to leverage our global franchise, working with clients to provide holistic solutions. This consistent focus has contributed to an improvement in several of our market positions. Advisory revenues for the quarter were $555 million, up 10% sequentially. Despite a decrease in larger transformational deals, M&A volumes are healthy and on par with last year's levels. A combination of challenging organic growth and attractive financing markets continues to drive activity.  Turning to underwriting. While equity volumes have recovered relative to the low levels of activity experienced over the course of last year, the quarter-over-quarter results showed a traditional seasonal trend with slower activity in the summer months. We generated equity underwriting revenues of $273 million, down 33% sequentially. We expect healthy activity levels in the fourth quarter, subject to issuance windows remaining open, which may be impacted by macro-economic uncertainties, geopolitical events and a typical seasonal slowdown at the end of the year.  Fixed Income underwriting revenues decreased 12% sequentially to $442 million, driven primarily by lower investment-grade issuance. High-yield markets have continued to be very receptive to both acquisition financing and opportunistic refinancings, aided by range-bound credit spreads, low volatility and significant market liquidity. Overall, Investment Banking pipelines are healthy and diversified across products, regions and sectors. CEO confidence remains high, and we are actively engaged with our clients. However, we maintain a cautious outlook as political and policy uncertainties may influence management's decision to act.  In Sales & Trading, we supported our clients when opportunities presented themselves and prudently managed risk throughout the quarter. Our results were consistent with the market backdrop. And overall, revenues were in line with historical third quarters. In Equities, we retained our leadership position and expect to be #1 globally. Revenues were $1.9 billion, down 12% sequentially. Our global footprint and diversified strategy continued to enable us to benefit from pockets of regional strength. Sequentially, Europe was weaker coming off a seasonally high second quarter, but continued strength in Asia buoyed our results. Prime Brokerage revenues remain a source of stability and client balances continue to grow. Derivatives saw a sequential decrease on fewer corporate transactions, which can be lumpy. And cash revenues remain stable as lower volumes and subdued volatility were combined with a more benign market-making environment.  Fixed Income revenues in the third quarter were $1.2 billion, down 6% versus the second quarter. Our macro businesses were negatively impacted by sequentially lower results in foreign exchange and persistently low levels of volatilities in rates, where client activity remain muted. As we have discussed, activity in these businesses is often aided by discrete events or meaningful market trends. Lack of such events or trends weighed on results. In credit, revenues were also down quarter-over-quarter. In aggregate, spreads remained at very tight levels, negatively impacting volatility and client demand. Commodities saw a sequential increase as activity improved in the quarter.  Overall, this quarter's results reinforce the progress we have made in this business. We have continued to support our clients and have generated revenues in excess of the $1 billion goal for 6 consecutive quarters against a variety of market backdrops. We remain confident in the strategy outlined nearly 2 years ago and we are pleased with the performance. Lastly, average trading VaR for the period was $43 million, down versus $51 million last quarter, primarily driven by lower market volatility across both equity and fixed income markets.  Turning to Wealth Management, which reported further growth in both revenues and pretax profits relative to last quarter's record levels. Our business continues to benefit from a shift towards an advice-driven model with a decreased reliance on transactional activity. This quarter's results further underscored this trend as growth in asset management revenues more than offset the seasonal slowdown in transactional revenues.  Third quarter revenues were $4.2 billion, a 2% sequential increase. At 26.5% for the quarter, the PBT margin now exceeds 25% year-to-date. The margin increase reflects the benefit of our scale platform with operating leverage across both compensation and non-compensation expenses. Year-to-date, revenue grew 9% or $1.1 billion. At the same time, we saw a total expenses growth of only 5% with non-compensation expenses down and continued compensation discipline. As a result, pretax profit is up 24%.  Total client assets grew by 3% to $2.3 trillion. We continue to witness strong client demand for our advisory solutions. Fee-based asset inflows were $16 billion in the quarter, contributing to a record year-to-date flows. These flows represent an important organic growth driver of this business. Total fee-based assets increased 4% and are now in excess of $1 trillion or 43% of total client assets. Higher asset levels and strong quarterly flows contributed to asset management revenues of $2.4 billion, representing 4% growth relative to the second quarter. Net interest income of $1 billion is up 2% over the last quarter, reflecting the benefit from both higher rates and lending balances. This was partially offset by higher funding costs, which include a higher blended BDP rate as well as the cost of incremental CDs, saving products and third-party liabilities that are part of our diversified bank funding strategy. Wealth Management lending in the U.S. banks grew by about $1 billion in the quarter or 2%. Continued strength in loan production offset the impact of higher paydowns in the quarter. With year-to-date net interest income of $3 billion, up approximately 19% year-on-year, we remain on our way to generate full year NII growth in line with the guidance we had provided. Transactional revenues of $739 million were down 4% from Q2. The decline reflected a typical decrease in retail engagement during the summer months across both equity and fixed income markets as well as the slower underwriting calendar.  Total noninterest expenses were essentially unchanged versus Q2. The compensation ratio was 55%, in line with our stated targets. Non-compensation expenses were down 3% sequentially due to seasonally lower marketing and business development expenses. This quarter's performance clearly demonstrates the strength of the franchise and the powerful combination of a highly annuitized revenue mix and the operating leverage that comes from a scale platform. We continued to enhance this business profile by investing in our advisory platforms, digital capabilities and banking and lending products.  Investment Management witnessed another solid quarter with continued growth in asset management fees and strong investment results. Total net revenues were $675 million, up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Overall, AUM grew 3% to $447 billion. We witnessed positive flows and strong investment performance, particularly across our active equity strategies. We continue to see increased investor interest in our high-conviction strategies across the platform. On the back of higher AUM, we saw 5% growth in asset management fees to $568 million. Investment revenues were also strong at $114 million, primarily due to more recent private funds entering carry. As discussed in the past, we expect this line item to continue to be lumpy. Overall expenses of $544 million were up 4% quarter-over-quarter, driven by higher compensation expense on carried interest. As James mentioned, in the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Mesa West Capital. This will complement our existing real estate and private credit offering with a premier commercial real estate credit strategy. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter. We will continue to opportunistically evaluate tactical acquisitions across our Investment Management platform as we further grow this high-return business.  Turning to the balance sheet. On a sequential basis, total spot assets of $854 billion were up $13 billion. In the quarter, the binding constraint for our risk-based capital ratios shifted from advanced to the standardized approach framework. Our pro forma fully phased-in standardized RWAs are expected to be essentially unchanged as higher credit RWAs offset a decline in market-risk RWAs. Our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III standardized Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is expected to increase slightly to 16.3%. Our pro forma fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio is expected to remain at 6.5%. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $1.25 billion of common stock or approximately 27 million shares and our board declared a $0.25 dividend per share. Our tax rate in the third quarter was 28.1%. This included a total of $94 million of net discrete tax benefits, $11 million related to the recurring type of discrete tax item for employee share-based payments and the balance primarily resulting from the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets -- excuse me, deferred taxes.  This quarter, results reaffirm that our balanced business model is performing. At the beginning of 2016, we presented a 2-year plan. Over the last 7 quarters, we have witnessed a variety of economic backdrops. And while this quarter certainly did not present the most constructive backdrop for some of our businesses, our performance was consistent with our stated objectives. We are encouraged by the continued growth in our more annuitized businesses, providing a buffer to those businesses that are more sensitive to quarterly changes in the environment. We remain focused on executing our strategic plan throughout the rest of the year and, absent any material changes to macro conditions, we are confident that we will hit our stated objectives.  With that, we will open up the line to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. James Mitchell : Maybe just on the Wealth Management side, you guys had very good growth -- sequential growth in deposits. There's been some discussion in the industry about kind of a pricing pressure. Can you discuss where you saw deposit rates in Wealth Management business and how you were able to attract, I think, about $10 billion sequentially on deposit franchise? Jonathan Pruzan : Sure. I think, as you recall, we've been talking about our deposit deployment strategy for quite some time. And we've been investing excess liquidity into our loan product over the last several years. In the beginning of the year, we told you that, that trend would come to an end. We did see that this year. It happened a bit sooner than we anticipated as we saw more cash go into the markets, particularly the equity markets as those markets rose around the world. And we've seen cash in our clients' accounts at its lowest level. So what we had been doing over the last several years is building out our product suite in that business. As you recall, we were really just a solo product with the BDP product. So we've built out those products, particularly around our cash management engaged initiatives around savings products as well as CDs and other products to sort of supplement our deposit base. In terms of the pricing, we had 4 rate hikes over the last 2 years. We did, at the end of the second quarter raise our rates across the platform in the broker deposit channel. Those rates were predominantly sort of pegged at 1 or 2 basis points. They're now on average about 6 basis points. But we have been supplementing our deposit base with other savings products and CDs. And you see the cost of that running through the interest expense line. So started the year at $154 billion of deposits, it drifted down to $144 billion as people engaged in the market and deployed their cash. And it's now back at $154 billion again with a slightly different mix, but back to sort of the historical year-end level. James Mitchell : Okay, great. And maybe, just the follow-up, just on your asset management acquisitions, you've got sort of a new tone, I guess, or more aggressive tone about further acquisitions. Is there particular asset classes you're looking at? Is it focused still on alternatives? Or do you see you'd like to have scale in other asset classes? James Gorman : I think there are a bunch of areas across the asset management platform we could continue to build out. We have looked obviously at Fixed Income, where we have smaller space. We have a relatively narrow but very productive active asset management business on the long-only side. And so there are some geographic areas where we could fill in. In this case, it was in the alternatives platform. Real estate has been, for most of our history, a tremendous strength. We have a great team running it. The business is doing well. They've launched new funds. This made sense to us. So I think what we're signaling, and Jim, you're picking up on it, is we're open for business to find inorganic pieces that can help build out parts of our platform that make sense. We're not looking for any grand splash here, but we're open for business opportunistically. And this was a perfect example. We looked at another deal over the last couple of quarters. And in the end, it got too expensive, we pulled away from it. So we're going to keep pricing discipline. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Just a follow-up on Jim's question on the wealth deposit cost and the CD program. The CD program has gotten a lot of attention. And it certainly seems to be successful here in bumping up the deposit base. How much of the $25 million in interest expense that you guys saw quarter-over-quarter was attributable to this CD program? And when you guys think about that cash, I believe it's an 11-month program, how sticky do you think that is? And what are you guys working on to try to make sure it's as sticky as possible? Jonathan Pruzan : Sure. Let me try to take a crack at that. There are a couple of different points. Just remember, we have not made a huge effort historically to build out incremental products in the wealth -- in the deposit side, because we were sitting on so many excess deposits. So this is new for us. We've been working on this cash management engaged initiative as well as building out sort of traditional CD products. And we will continue to diversify our funding mix and our liability stack. And we also have access to wholesale markets, including brokerage CDs and FHLB and external sweeps and other things. So this is really around the right composition and mix of a liability stack. In terms of the interest expense, Brennan, it was a combination of both. The increase -- the BDP increase really happened at the very end of the second quarter, taking up from 1 -- a little over 1 basis point to 6 basis points. So some of that increase is from that; and the rest would be from a combination of the CDs. We ran some savings promotions as well. Mind you, this is for existing clients and new money only. And we're obviously not alone in running promotional programs to increase the deposit levels. I think in terms of stickiness, as James has mentioned and I have mentioned, we are seeing more of our clients engage with us on the advisory platforms. We're providing more services and products for them. And I think we're approaching the clients holistically both on the asset as well as the liability side. As I said, we're new to this, so we'll have to see what the numbers play out. But we're very confident regarding the liquidity position that we have in the banks. Brennan Hawken : Okay, great. And -- okay, so the BDP came at the end of the quarter, so there might be a little follow-through to next, that's fine. Jonathan Pruzan : No, it came at the end of the second -- I think we raised rates either June 30 or July 1. So we did see the full impact of the BDP rate. We didn't see the full impact of sort of the incremental deposits because those were raised over the second and third quarter. Brennan Hawken : I see, okay. Thanks for clarifying that. As far as shifting gears to MiFID, when you guys think about MiFID coming here in the capital markets businesses, how are you thinking this is going to impact your European business next year? And when you think about balancing not only the payment for research but also the enhanced liquidity throughout European trading operations, how do you manage the potential impact of spreads through that enhanced transparency? And how do you intend to -- how do you think about sizing that potential impact? Jonathan Pruzan : Well, a couple different components there. Number one, we are the #1 equities business globally with a sort of -- with an integrated platform and a leading research product. MiFID has been coming for a while. And we've been actively engaged with our clients discussing this change. Those conversations are obviously very unique based on usage and needs of our individual clients. But those conversations have been constructive and ongoing. And we've also been investing in the platforms and the infrastructure to be in compliance. In terms of how it impacts the market, remember, we have, give or take, an $8 billion Equity business. This is a smaller component of that business. We have an integrated platform and provide value-added services through intellectual capital access, liquidity and whatnot. And we've approached our Sales & Trading clients holistically. So it will have an impact. Trying to measure that is sort of hard at this point. Our sense is, it's going to be a little bumpy because it's not clear that everyone is going to be ready for the switchover in January 3. But we would expect it, a, to be manageable; and b, potentially longer term as the #1 player in this space, if people do consolidate trading with counterparties, we would expect to be the beneficiary of that. So overall, a change, but we adapt to change all the time. We think it's manageable. And it has the potential to accrue to our benefit. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Just maybe an update. In Wealth Management, in the past, you've provided statistics on, I guess, the last time you showed it, 100% of days in the year, you earn between $50 million and $70 million. Is that still the right range? Is the range rising as -- interest rates as you go more fee-based and the markets go up? And then while I'm getting greedy, if you might update us on what percentage of assets are in the $1 million and above camp inside Wealth Management? Jonathan Pruzan : Wow, those are pretty technical questions. I think still good. How about still good. Lots of stability in this business and good tailwinds. Obviously, the total revenues generated are increasing. But I still feel like it's in that range in terms of a good indicator on a daily basis. The nice thing about this business is not only the stability and the growth dynamic, but we've got some nice tailwinds behind it. Also if you look at the fee-based accounts and the fee-based revenues, it's now over 50% of the revenues in that business this quarter. So again, lots of stability and lots of continued operating -- opportunity for operating leverage going forward. The general shape and characteristics of the business are pretty stable. Glenn Schorr : And maybe a question on the margins inside Wealth Management, obviously a big number this quarter. As interest income becomes a bigger part, as your deposit programs take hold, I mean, obviously markets go up and down. But you're managing cost there. You have another 150 basis point of benefit coming in a little more than a year. Do you think pretax margins can consistently grind higher? And is there any natural ceiling there? James Gorman : I guess, that's sort of the early question around, \"Are we going to change our margin targets or whatever?\" Listen, the incremental dollar revenue is coming on with an incremental higher margin than the embedded margin. So in theory, absolutely they grind higher. In practice though, we've got to look at -- we're also focused on growth. And what the management team in that business is doing is looking for ways in which we can drive further growth over the next several years rather than trying to grind out a particular margin in a particular quarter. But you're right. The math suggests with what's happening with retention deals coming off and what's happening with interest rates, margin should grind higher. But again, I'm as much -- more focused frankly on total growth than I am on the incremental margin in a given quarter. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Mayo : Can you hear me? James Gorman : Yes, we can, Mike. Michael Mayo : Okay. So your U.S. bank deposits are back to $154 billion and that's almost the size of the 11th largest bank. And I know this is a new realm for you guys, but what is your deposit beta on those $154 billion of deposits? And what I'm really trying to get to is the first couple questions, what should we expect in the future? What do you have planned as far as future CD campaigns or a little bit more on your strategy? Jonathan Pruzan : Sure. That's a great question, Mike. Let me just step back for a minute and just sort of talk about NII more globally or at the top of the house. We have seen really good growth in that line item. Year-to-date, we're up just under $500 million. Some of that is on an increase in the lending balances. We're up about $6 billion or $7 billion. Some of that is based on the beta concept. As I've just mentioned, we've had 4 rate hikes over 2 years. This was the first time we raised our BDP rate. We raised it, on average, about 6 basis points. So on the last hike, the 6 over 25% would suggest a 25% beta. Based on historical behavior and our model suggests closer to a 50% beta is the right number to look at going forward. But we're in a new environment of, a, rising rates; b, we've seen money market reform; c, there's been a lot of changes in technology and how people save money. So I would say that, to date, we've outperformed the beta assumption. But we still think that 50%-ish is the right way to think about it going forward. That also being said, as rates get higher, betas get higher, as you know. In terms of the overall strategy, we are getting more mature in this business and in our liability structure. We have sort of made it through, if you will, the excess liquidity position. We still have some, given that we've just raised the deposit number from the $144 billion to $154 billion, we do have excess liquidity today to continue to fund lending growth going forward. But we're going to have a mix of products that support future lending growth. We still feel good about the lending opportunity within our wealth client segment. Penetration rates are still reasonably limited. And we've seen opportunities to continue to increase penetration there. And the funding will be a mix of all of the liabilities that I talked about earlier. We do -- we would like to continue to build out this cash management engaged initiative, which should bring in savings deposits, some mix. We raised about, give or take, a couple billion dollars in savings this quarter, probably $5 billion or $6 billion of CDs. That's both within the network and externally; and then a couple -- some incremental wholesale liabilities. So again, we have plenty of access to liabilities. BDP will be and will continue to be our primary product and our biggest contributor. But this is a day that we have expected for a long time and have sort of been building out the capabilities in advance of it. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Steven Chubak : I had a question on Wealth Management as well, but just actually on the fee income side of the equation. So as we think about some of the fee income tailwinds outside of higher markets, one of the biggest ones that you've spoken to is the continued pace of conversions from brokerage to fee-based. We certainly saw that, that benefited results this quarter. And especially in light of DOL implementation likely to be delayed and potentially tabled, how should we think about the pace of fee-based conversions from here as that seemed to provide a nice tailwind to some of the acceleration that we saw in recent quarters? Jonathan Pruzan : Sure. Listen, the year-to-date flows have been very strong and they've not been solely driven by DOL. A significant amount of the conversions this quarter came from non-retirement accounts. So while I think the DOL implementation or the original implementation did form a catalyst for some conversions, it's not been the primary driver, number one. Number two, as we continue to build out the goals-based platform, as we continue to build out digital and our other services, I think our clients are attracted to the value-added proposition of a managed account and we see that trend continuing. It's been a nice tailwind, as you say. And we'll see the benefits of that going forward. As you know, there's a lag between the fees and the flows. But it's been really quite positive and diversified, not only driven by retirement accounts. Steven Chubak : And maybe a broader question on how you're thinking about capital management and some strategic growth initiatives. And one of the things that comes up quite often in discussions is that, as we look at the various capital constraints, you're much more leveraged than risk-based constrained than many of your peers. And as you think about potential opportunities to either better optimize your capital base or -- and even consider or demonstrate some willingness to explore inorganic growth opportunities, are you open to expanding into areas that are maybe more risk-intensive and which could potentially help you optimize against some of your more constraining capital ratios such as leverage? James Gorman : Steve, it's James. I think that's a much broader discussion than we'd probably do justice on an earnings call. We've worked very hard in the last several years to get ourselves in a position where our buyback and dividend combined generated close to 100% payout. We still believe we're carrying significant excess capital. And you're right, at this point in time, the leverage ratio has been the constrained at least the last couple of CCARs. Now whether that continues remains to be seen. I think the team, we're acutely conscious of risk-based capital, leverage-based capital tradeoffs. I think we've started, as evidenced by the Mesa West transaction, to show that we're not shy about doing inorganic things where they make sense. We're not interested in particularly making a splash on that front. We like businesses where we have real scale advantages. That's where we're aggressive. And Wealth Management was the example on that. But otherwise, they tend to be inorganic, should be much more tactical, I would think, in general. So it's a much longer discussion. But at this point, we'd like to continue -- we have a lot of shares outstanding. We've got our dividend to $1 a share on an annual basis. We like to continue to pursue the buyback dividend strategy and excess capital. Once we see more clarity around the regulatory framework, if and when we see we have more excess capital, then we'll put that to work either inorganically or with further buybacks or indeed against some of the risk-based businesses that we're in. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Guy Moszkowski : You alluded, Jon, a little bit to targets for Wealth Management lending growth and kind of the headroom that you see. I was hoping that maybe you could give us a little bit more of a quantitative sense for how you assess your penetration versus competitors, client appetite and, therefore, sort of what you see as a headroom for prudent lending. Jonathan Pruzan : Well, again, I would say that we've seen continued growth in the lending product across Wealth Management across the 3 products, mortgage, securities-based loans and tailored product. In '16, that was $10 billion. To date, it's been about $7 billion. We've seen good loan production across all 3 channels -- or excuse me, all 3 products. We did see some big payoffs at the end of the quarter that muted our total balances outstanding this quarter. But we continue to see real receptivity within the wealth client network for these products. We're continually designing products that we think that fit within the footprint. Based on market data, it suggests that our penetration rates are lower than some others, so we think that we continue to have room both on the SBL and on the mortgage product. And we've seen consistent production over the last several years. So it sort of gives us confidence that we will continue to be able to grow those balances going forward. James Gorman : The other thing I'd just add about -- strategically about that business is the lending side provides a lot of stickiness with the relationships. So I was on a phone call with a client yesterday. His adviser left to a competitive firm, a multi-hundred million dollar relationship. We have a significant loan out to that client. And the client has no interest in moving because they like the loan that we have. They like the funding they're getting from that. They -- in fact, after the call, he said they were likely to increase their assets here. So that stickiness for the high end is a big deal. These markets go in cycles as we all know. And people want access to credit. They have large illiquid positions, so concentrated stock in businesses they founded, and they don't necessarily want to liquidate that. And we're in a position where we're dealing with a lot of very, very wealthy people. I think 2% of our assets with clients with less than $100,000 with us. So the vast majority have significant wealth. And it's a real competitive advantage now to be able to compete with the banks and offer these lending products. Guy Moszkowski : That's a good point. Follow-up question, just on targets again. You were asked the one about Wealth Management margin targets, but what about fixed? Given that in what was clearly a very challenging quarter, you well exceeded that $1 billion quarterly level. Any potential movement on your goal there? James Gorman : Guy, when we set the targets, it was the beginning of 2016 for 2017. And we said we'd like to see 4 things happen, an ROE range of 9% to 11% in 2017. We've hit that each quarter; efficiency ratio driven by Project Streamline of 74% expense to revenue, and we've been below that for the 3 quarters; Wealth Management margin, 23% to 25%, and we're now operating above that level; and the fourth, of course, was the Fixed Income division's revenues, which we thought, given what the team did with the restructuring in the fourth quarter '15, I think it was, we thought that the business model stood on its own with about $1 billion in revenue. That wasn't obviously an aspirational performance. But we thought that's what it should do. And recall, we've had a couple of quarters around $500 million, $600 million. First quarter of '16, I think we did about $800 million and change. And since then, we've had, what's that, 6 quarters of consecutive $1 billion-plus. It's actually probably average. I haven't look at the numbers, but my guess is it's averaged $1.25 billion over that time. So clearly, we exceeded the $1 billion. I don't know. We'll think through the end of the year. I don't think there's a lot of point in trying to nail ourselves to a specific revenue target for a business as volatile as that. I haven't seen our competitors do that. What we wanted to do was say we want it full-blown minimum. It's not sort of a race to -- we could drive revenues in that business harder, but we'd use more balance sheet and we wouldn't necessarily have the same risk profile we've got, so there are tradeoffs in it. And at this point, we're really happy with what the team has done. I think they've done a terrific job. They've taken a business that was really on its heels. And it's clearly become competitive on a global basis. It will never have the macro businesses of the big banks, but it's really performing well across the franchise. So I doubt you're going to see new targets in that. I just don't see a lot of upside for that. And I don't think people can sensibly predict revenue outlooks for something that volatile, but what we did seek to was a minimum revenue number. And let's get through the end of this year, we've got another quarter to go. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor: You guys had touched on efficiency a couple of times, and specifically Wealth Management. But I guess, just to circle back, from a firm-wide point of view, how much more opportunity is there? I guess I step back and I think that your businesses are higher expense-based in general, but you also have leading market shares in a lot of what you do, have been executing well, as you pointed out, in getting the efficiency ratio down, you're exceeding your plan this year. But just how much more opportunity is there for maybe continued low-hanging fruit in the back office or within the institutional business? James Gorman : Yes, I don't think there's a lot of -- Jon will comment on this, but I don't think there's a lot of low-hanging fruit. I mean, we've been at this for a few years. So I think we have a pretty good handle on our expenses. The primary driver is, of course, the compensation expense. And I think, the ranges we have given in each of the businesses make sense. I think, our ISG comp ratio this quarter was around 35%. Wealth Management is obviously higher because of the payout structure in that business, but it's been grinding lower over time as non-compensable revenues come onstream. And the Investment Management businesses tend to come out around the 40%, 42%, 44%, somewhere in that range. So that's a number that honestly is more a function of what the revenues are. The non-comp expenses, we have held pretty tight, in fact, extremely. And we've taken, I think, the obvious low-hanging fruit off the table. But as you point out, these businesses are scale businesses. The non-comp expenses in Wealth Management, I think, Jon, were down a little bit this quarter on significantly higher revenues. And in the institutional businesses, there's a lot been going on with CCAR and resolution planning that has added expenses. We had the resubmission of CCAR last year. We had the British VAT tax issue, which hit the non-comps. We're still grinding through the last of the litigation from the crisis that you see pop along in little dribs and drabs every quarter. And we're increasing our spend, as you would want us to do, on cybersecurity. We're making big investments in digital.  We're driving a lot of electronic transformation within the institutional business. So there are areas where we're investing in the platform because we want to build a Morgan Stanley of the next 5 to 10 years, not the last 5 years. So short answer is, I think, low-hanging fruit, we have pretty much picked up. Scale in the businesses really matters. That's why you saw, I think, with a 9% year-over-year revenue, it was something like 15% to 18% pretax increase. And we're trading off sensible investments for long-term growth versus short-term fill-ups. And I think what you're going to see with every $1 of incremental revenue, you will still see a higher incremental margin coming on even with those investments. Jon, is there anything I missed there? Jonathan Pruzan : Yes. No, I think you've hit it. I think we continue -- if you just look at the non-comp line, we continue to try to make progress on there. If you recall, when we came out with our targets at the beginning of '16, we didn't really expect the incremental CCAR that we got from the resubmission. Brexit wasn't on the table. So there are things that pop up all over the place that sort of cause that business -- cause those expenses to move around a little bit. But again, on an incremental basis, we've shown some really nice discipline and trends in both the areas that we can really control. We have seen a little bit of an uptick in the BC&E and transaction taxes as our strength in outside of the U.S. has continued to grow. So Europe and Asia generally come with higher expenses in the Sales & Trading businesses. But our hope is that we'll continue to maintain the discipline. Maybe some of the investments that we're making around automation will lead to better efficiency that might be able to bring down the unit cost a little bit more. But I would agree with James that sort of the low-hanging fruit is sort of -- we've sort of taken that out already. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : I apologize if you've addressed this already, but as an Advanced Approach bank, could you tell us what your LCR ratio, liquidity coverage ratio, was this quarter? And where do you hope to manage that to? Jonathan Pruzan : Our LCR for the second quarter was in the high 120s. We would expect it to maintain that level or it has maintained that level. It's going to bounce around a little bit. But clearly, the 100% limitation is not a binding constraint for us at all within the liquidity -- within our liquidity framework. So again, it's not -- it hasn't been a constraint for us. I don't expect it to be one in terms of the management of our liquidity. We look at our stress tests and resolution and all the different analysis that we do. And it has generally not been a binding constraint for either -- for the institution. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Subsequent to your second quarter call, obviously the Treasury came out in October with their new white paper on their views of where the changes in the capital market regulations should head. Can you guys give us some color on 1 or 2 of the regulations that's most important to Morgan Stanley that you'd like to see changed? Jonathan Pruzan : Well, again, specifically to the October white paper, it was really around the capital markets. I think we're broadly supportive. It was a very large and dense document. Anything that improves the liquidity of markets would be a positive. Anything that reduces the unnecessary administrative burden would be a positive. Anything that reduces complexity around the implementation or the compliance with the regulations would be a positive. Generally, the tone, broadly speaking, has been positive. It's been around recalibration and simplification. And so whether you're talking about Volcker or CCAR or the SLR resolution, which was generally the topics that get discussed, anything that would simplify those, anything that would reduce the complexity and the overlapping nature would be positive. We think the tone, at least from the Fed right now, has been around that simplification process. And we'll see what and if anything gets done over time as people get into their seats and their new jobs. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC. Alevizos Alevizakos : I've got a broad question. Since you mentioned that a lot of your clients moved their money out of deposits and into active products, I'm wondering whether the percentage of your IB revenues have actually increased. And my main question is basically, since Wealth Management is presumably the largest client in the Investment Banking, what is the percent of the total IB revenues that are generated and actually belong effectively to the Wealth Management division? Jonathan Pruzan : I'm not sure I follow the question so much, so let me just take a stab at what I think you're getting at. In terms of what we've seen in sort of the wealth network, the total sort of cash and money market and cash equivalent balances are down at sort of near-time lows. So it's not only deposits that people have been deploying into the markets, it's just sort of all their -- it's sort of all the cash and cash equivalent categories. There are clear synergies between our wealth business and our institutional businesses. But in terms of the amount of revenue that goes back and forth, I think that's an area that we think the businesses are complementary and they benefit each other, but we don't -- I wouldn't describe it in terms of the ways that you have. Clearly, having that distribution arm is good for a new issue product. It's good for certain structured products. So we continue to develop products that our wealth clients want. But again, the businesses are complementary and we don't measure it like that. Alevizos Alevizakos : Sure. And as a follow-up question. At the moment, what are the 3 top products that you would say that your wealthy clients are getting out of your Investment Banking franchise? Jonathan Pruzan : Again, our clients -- we have an open platform. Our clients have access to products across all of the different investment opportunities. Clearly, some of our clients like the new issue product. As I said, we saw a lot of engagement with our clients with the cash and money market balances going down. And it looks like the proportion of invested assets and equities went up across the platform, so broadly speaking, equity product. They enjoy -- also there's structured products that some of the segments enjoy in terms of products that are tied to indices and other markets or other indexes or other rates around the world. But again, it's an open platform. It's a full-service platform. It is integrated with our institutional business, so there are some complementary -- complementarity to it. But again, I wouldn't describe it as the way you're describing it. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Devin Ryan : Maybe first one here, just within GWM, obviously a lot in the mix on the technology front with the robo platform and some of the goals-based technology being rolled out, which hopefully should attract new clients and expand the wall with existing clients. So can you remind us on the timing of maybe some of the key initiatives there? And then, just as digital becomes a bigger theme, I think, for the industry, how does Morgan Stanley think about when it's appropriate to build something that's proprietary versus partnering with outside FinTech? Jonathan Pruzan : A couple different things. I would say, one, that sort of the digital strategy and the digital product rollout, I would say, broadly is on schedule. We're in beta testing with some of the products right now and are going to go out to the full network soon. So I would say, our investments around product are on schedule. When we think about digital, it's obviously a very important component to the overall franchise, but there's 2 components. There's a revenue component as well as an efficiency and automation component. I would suggest that a lot of the investments that we're making are going to help with the automation and efficiency of our branch network, which should lead to again better operating leverage in the business upfront and will also save time with our FAs and our CSAs, so they'll have more ability to spend time with clients. But again, when we think about our wealth business, it's a business that's built on scale. And it's built on the fact that people with wealth want personal advice. So it's going to be both a mix of technology and digital with the personal element of the advice channel. And we think that's the winning formula going forward. But digital is important. It's on track. I would say the impact to the financial results are going to lag those investments. We'll see it probably first on the expense side and then later on the revenue side. Devin Ryan : Yes. Got it, okay. Good color there. And then just follow-up here, maybe one around FIC and just bigger picture. When rates were low, I know many thought that as rates started to move, clients would increasingly reposition portfolios, so that would drive higher trading volumes. And I know you've spoken in the past around kind of Prime Brokerage client leverage. I'm sure it's still low. Are you seeing anything structurally holding back client risk-taking? Or do you just feel like it's simply just not enough buy-in on this market or the economic growth outlook? Just trying to think about kind of if there's something else structurally that's maybe within the leverage levels. Jonathan Pruzan : Listen, I don't think it's structural. We've seen low volatility across many asset classes. We've seen a lack of sort of idiosyncratic events. When there is uncertainty, in some ways, that's -- or differences of opinions, that generates trading activity. We haven't seen a lot of that more recently. I think the underlying fundamentals sort of the global recovery, if you will, are pretty positive. But we haven't seen real dramatic changes in the rate profile. The 10-year treasury rebounded a little bit here recently. But given the geopolitical risk and the persistently low inflation numbers, it's a pretty tight trading band, FX rates, tight trading band, credit spreads, tight trading band. So again, I don't think it's structural. I think it's cyclical at this point. At some point, there will be catalysts to change the direction of the trading environment, and whether that's tax policy, whether that's better inflation data. But there will be something. And so this has been a sort of a subdued environment. I don't think it persists forever. But when and how that catalyst appears is clearly a question mark. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That concludes the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

My name is Jody and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Eaton Vance Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Dan Cataldo, Treasurer, you may begin your conference. Dan Cataldo : Thank you and good morning and welcome to our fiscal 2017 fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. Here this morning are Tom Faust, Chairman and CEO of Eaton Vance and Laurie Hylton, our CFO. We will first comment on the quarter and then take your questions. The full earnings release and charts we will refer to during the call are available on our website eatonvance.com under the heading Press Releases. Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainties in our business, including but not limited to those discussed in the company\u2019s SEC filings. These filings, including our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K are available on our website or upon request at no charge. I will now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Faust : Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.48 for the fiscal year ended October 31, which is up 16% from $2.13 in fiscal 2016. For the fourth quarter, we are reporting $0.70 of adjusted earnings per diluted share, that\u2019s up 23% from $0.57 in the fourth quarter of last year and up 13% from $0.62 in this year\u2019s third quarter. We finished fiscal 2017 with record managed assets, record annual net inflows and a record quarterly earnings rate, all-in-all, a very strong year. One of the most notable events of our fiscal 2017 was the acquisition in December of the assets of the former Calvert Investments and the addition of the Calvert funds to Eaton Vance. The Calvert funds are one of the largest and most diversified families of responsibly invested mutual funds, encompassing actively and passively managed equity, fixed income and asset allocation strategies, all managed in accordance with the Calvert principles for Responsible Investing. Responsible Investing continues to be a leading trend in asset management, appealing to the growing universe of investors who seek both financial returns and positive societal impact from their investments. At the time we acquired Calvert, I talked about the opportunity we saw to apply Eaton Vance\u2019s management and distribution resources to help Calvert become a larger and more impactful company. Now, almost 11 months later, we are on the road to doing that and more excited than ever to have Calvert as part of Eaton Vance. Although many growth opportunities are yet to be realized, Calvert is already starting to contribute positively to our net flows. Total managed assets of our Calvert research and management subsidiary, including amounts sub-advised by other Eaton Vance affiliates, increased from $12 billion at acquisition to $12.9 billion at fiscal year end. We finished fiscal 2017 with consolidated assets under management of $422.3 billion, up 26% from 12 months earlier. The $37.8 billion of consolidated net inflows we had in the fiscal year represents 11% internal growth in managed assets and exceeds our previous high annual inflows by a wide margin. Excluding our lower fee exposure management business, net inflows for the year were $26.4 billion, equating to 10% internal AUM growth. As we have mentioned in recent quarters, while net flows and internal growth in managed assets are customary measures of an asset manager\u2019s organic growth, we find it increasingly important to understand and track internal growth in management fee revenue. Organic revenue growth, as we define it, is the change in the run-rate management fee revenue resulting from net inflows and outflows taking into account the net fee rate applicable to each dollar in and out. Like in the calculation of organic AUM growth, the impact of market action and M&A are excluded. Calculated on this basis, our organic revenue growth was 7% for fiscal 2017 and 5% in the fourth quarter, which was our seventh consecutive quarter of positive organic revenue results. Although peer managers typically don\u2019t disclose their organic revenue growth numbers, we suspect our numbers are \u2013 our results on this measure would rank among the highest in the industry. A key to Eaton Vance\u2019s success in fiscal 2017 has been our ability to grow our higher fee actively managed business, while continuing the accelerated build-out of lower fee more passive businesses, our active investment strategies, which include a wide range of equity, fixed and floating rate income and alternative mandates, had net flows of $9.4 billion for the year, a very respectable 5% organic growth in managed assets. Growth in actively managed strategies was complemented by strong growth in passive mandates, which include Parametric\u2019s portfolio implementation and exposure management businesses Eaton Vance Management\u2019s laddered income separate accounts and Calvert index funds. Collectively, these strategies grew managed assets at an 18% internal growth rate for the fiscal year. Turning to the fourth quarter, our net inflows of $8 billion reflect positive results for every investment category, except equity which turned negative after net inflows in the second and third quarters. Within equity, strong net inflows into the Parametric defensive equity strategy and positive contributions from Eaton Vance large cap growth and Calvert emerging market strategies were more than offset by $1.8 billion in combined net outflows from Parametric emerging markets and Eaton Vance large-cap value. Both of these strategies experienced a large single client or single platform redemptions during the quarter, accounting for much of these strategy\u2019s negative flow results for the quarter. Fourth quarter net inflows into fixed income of $2.1 billion were largely driven by $1.5 billion of net inflows into municipal and corporate bond laddered separate accounts. Also contributing positively to fourth quarter fixed income flows were high yield, managed municipals and our top performing emerging market local debt strategies. Our floating rate bank loan business generated net inflows of just over $400 million in the fourth quarter, with U.S. retail demand for floating rate products having slowed over the past couple of quarters, fourth quarter growth in our bank loan business was driven by demand from clients outside the United States, which now account for about 25% of our bank loan business. The diversity of our client base in this segment is a stabilizing influence on quarterly flow patterns. Net inflows into our alternatives category remained strong at almost $700 million for the fourth quarter, driven by growth in our global macro absolute return franchise. Global macro continues to gain traction as a result of a strong performance record over multiple periods, low volatility and low correlation to traditional income in equity markets. Portfolio implementation had quarterly net inflows of $2 billion driven by continued strong growth in Parametric Custom Core equity separate accounts offered to retail and high net worth investors. A key component of our custom beta product set managed assets in this business grew from $32.6 billion at the beginning of the fiscal year to over $50 billion on October 31. As we have mentioned in prior calls, we frequently market Parametric Custom Core strategies in conjunction with Eaton Vance municipal and corporate bond ladders and refer to the combined offering as custom beta. As can be seen on Page 17 of the call slides, our total managed assets in custom beta strategies offered as retail and high net worth separate accounts is now $68 billion, up 57% from the beginning of the fiscal year. These market leading offerings combined the benefits of passive investing with the ability to customize portfolio to meet individual preferences and needs. Our final mandate reporting category, exposure management, had net inflows of $3 billion in the fourth quarter. Exposure management is a Parametric business offering primarily futures based overlay strategies to institutional investors so they can add, remove or hedge market exposures within their portfolios in a transparent, efficient and highly customized manner without disrupting their underlying investment holdings. At an average fee rate of 5 basis points, this is our lowest fee business, but a leading growth contributor. Since entering this business through the acquisition of the former Clifton Group at the end of 2012, we have grown our exposure management AUM at a rate of 23% annually. Turning to investment performance, our story remains strong. At the end of October, we had 68 funds with overall Morningstar ratings of 4 or 5 stars for at least 1 class of shares, including 30 5-star rated funds. As measured by total return, at October 31, around 50% of our fund assets ranked in the top quartile of their Morningstar peer groups over 3 and 5 years and 75% of assets ranked above median. And presenting at an investor conference last week, I outlined Eaton Vance\u2019s most important strategic priorities heading into fiscal 2018. The list hasn\u2019t changed much from last year, but that shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, consistency and continuity have long been hallmarks of Eaton Vance. As described last week, our major priorities are first, capitalizing on our investment performance leadership and distribution strengths to grow sales and gain market share and active strategies. Second, extending the success that we have had with our custom beta lineup of rules-based separately managed account products. Third, leveraging our Calvert acquisition to lead the growth of Responsible Investing. Fourth, becoming a more global company by building our investment and distribution capabilities outside the United States. And fifth, positioning NextShares to become the vehicle of choice for investors and actively managed funds in the U.S. I have already touched on the first three initiatives, but let me update you on the last two, our global expansion in NextShares. While still a small part of our business, our international footprint is expanding significantly. In addition to owning 49% of Montreal-based global equity manager, Hexavest, we operate internationally from offices in London, Sydney, Singapore and a new location this year in Tokyo. In London, we now have a staff of nearly 50 people, up from just a handful 2 years ago. I am pleased to report that our increased focus on growing our international business is beginning to pay off. In the fiscal year, assets managed for non-U.S. clients contributed over $5 billion to the company\u2019s consolidated net inflows, equating to 30% internal growth in managed assets. Leading contributors to this year\u2019s international growth include bank loans and exposure management. Still representing less than 6% of managed assets, we see lots of room to run for additional growth outside the U.S. On NextShares, I suspect everyone on the call knows by now that this is a new type of fund vehicle, first launched in early 2016, combining proprietary active management with the conveniences and potential performance and tax advantages of exchange traded products. Our NextShares subsidiary holds patents and other intellectual property rights related to NextShares and is seeking to commercialize NextShares by entering into licensing and service agreements with fund companies. To-date, 16 fund companies have entered into preliminary or final NextShares agreements. Last week, we announced the launch of what becomes the ninth NextShares fund, joining 3 Eaton Vance, 3 Waddell & Reed and 2 Gabelli NextShares offerings already in the market. The new Eaton Vance Oaktree Diversified Credit NextShares fund provides access in an exchange traded structure to the Oaktree diversified credit strategy, which is not otherwise available to retail investors. In other major NextShares news, UBS and NextShares Solutions issued a joint press release yesterday, announcing that NextShares are now available to UBS\u2019 network of 7,100 U.S. financial advisers through the UBS brokerage and strategic adviser programs. With this announcement, UBS becomes the first full service wealth manager to offer NextShares through its financial advisers. The launch of NextShares at UBS brings NextShares to a large audience of financial advisers and their clients and for the first time, provides our distribution team a significant opportunity to promote the NextShares funds we manage. Now, that we have UBS as the major distribution partner, we expect the number of NextShares funds to be introduced by Eaton Vance and other sponsors to ramp up over the coming weeks and months. There are currently about 15 NextShares funds from various sponsors in the registration process. With the Oaktree diversified credit strategy now available in a NextShares\u2019 format and UBS engaged as a major distribution partner, the next few months promise to be very interesting on the NextShares front. As it has been throughout our long involvement in this initiative, our goal remains to position NextShares to become the fund vehicle of choice for active strategies and to use this innovation to help address the competitive imbalance that now exists between active and passive funds. Before I close, I would like to comment briefly on the tax reform initiative now underway in Washington. Eaton Vance has long supported the goals of tax reform to adopt the simpler, fairer tax code that enhances the global competitiveness of U.S. business and promotes faster U.S. economic growth. Few companies would benefit more than Eaton Vance from the lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20% as proposed in both the House and Senate bills. One provision of the Senate, but not the House bill that we don\u2019t support and are working to combat is the small revenue raise that scored at $2.4 billion over 10 years that would generally require taxpayers other than regulated investment companies to determine the cost basis of the securities they sell, gift or otherwise dispose of on a first-in, first-out basis. Effective for dispositions on or after January 1, 2018, non-RIC investor could no longer select specific shared lots when they dispose of securities unless they hold multiple positions. Eaton Vance is among the large number of securities firms working to prevent this provision from becoming law. In our view, adopting mandatory FIFO would be bad for investors, bad for our markets and ultimately bad for the U.S. economy, inflicting harm far out of proportion to the provision small contribution to paying for tax reform. Plus, implementation would be an administrative nightmare that we don\u2019t see how it can be accomplished by the proposed effective date of January 2018. If enacted, the mandatory FIFO provision would affect Eaton Vance\u2019s business by complicating the management of non-RIC assets for after-tax returns, including the Parametric Custom Core franchise. Since the Senate proposal first came to light 12 days ago the Parametric Research team has been feverishly evaluating the potential impact of mandatory FIFO on their tax managed strategies. While it would certainly change certain aspects of how they build and manage client portfolios, the research to-date shows that substantial tax alpha could still be achieved if FIFO is required. As the legislative process for tax reform plays out over the coming weeks, we will be working both to help ensure that mandatory FIFO does not become law and to prepare our business for the possibility that it does. That concludes my remarks. And I will now turn the call over to Laurie. Laurie Hylton : Thank you and good morning. As Tom mentioned, we are reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.48 for fiscal 2017, an increase of 16% from $2.13 adjusted earnings per diluted share in the prior fiscal year. On a GAAP basis, we earned $2.42 per diluted share in fiscal 2017 and $2.12 per diluted share in fiscal 2016. As you can see in Attachment 2 to our press release, adjusted earnings differed from GAAP earnings in fiscal 2017 by $0.06 per diluted share to reflect $5.4 million of debt extinguishment costs associated with the May 2017 retirement of $250 million of senior notes due in October 2017. $3.5 million of structuring fees paid in connection with our July closed end fund initial public offering and $0.5 million to reflect increases in the estimated redemption value of non-controlling interest in our affiliates redeemable at other than fair value. Adjusted earnings differed from GAAP earnings in fiscal 2016 by $0.01 per diluted share to reflect $2.3 million of structuring fees paid in connection with our May 2016 closed-end fund IPO. Adjusted operating income, which excludes the impact of closed-end fund structuring fees paid, increased by 17% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating margin was 32% in fiscal 2017 versus 31% in fiscal 2016. Tom mentioned we are reporting record quarterly adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.70 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. That\u2019s an increase of 23% from $0.57 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and up 13% from $0.62 in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted earnings differed from GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 by $0.01 per diluted share to reflect increases in redemption value of non-controlling interest and affiliates redeemable at other than fair value. Adjusted earnings per diluted share matched GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter fiscal 2016. Adjusted earnings differed from GAAP earnings by $0.04 per diluted share in the third quarter fiscal 2017 to reflect the earlier referenced debt extinguishment costs and closed end fund structuring fees paid this fiscal year. Excluding closed end fund structuring fees paid, our fourth quarter adjusted operating income increased by 25% from the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 and 11% sequentially. Our adjusted operating margin was 34.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 versus 32% and 31.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and the third quarter of fiscal 2017 respectively. Tom mentioned it was a record year for us in terms of managed assets. Ending consolidated managed assets climbed to a record $422.3 billion at October 31, 2017, an increase of 26% from the end of fiscal 2016, reflecting record annual net inflows, favorable markets and the impact of the Calvert acquisition at the end of calendar 2016. Ending consolidated managed assets increased 4% from the prior quarter end primarily driven by strong net flows and positive market returns. Average managed assets in fiscal 2017 increased 19% in comparison to the prior fiscal year, generating a 14% increase in revenue. Revenue growth trailed growth in average managed assets during the fiscal year due to a decline in our average managed fee rate from 35.8 basis points in fiscal 2016 to 34.5 basis points in fiscal 2017. This decline in our average management fee rate is primarily attributable to the ongoing shift in our business mix as lower fee exposure management, portfolio implementation and bond ladder businesses have become a larger percentage of our assets under management. Performance fees which are excluded from the calculation of our average fee rates, contributed $400,000 in fiscal 2017 and $3.4 million in fiscal 2016. Comparing fourth quarter results to the same quarter last year, 22% growth in average managed assets drove a 17% increase in revenue. Sequentially, average managed assets increased 5%, driving revenue growth to 3%. Our average annualized management fee rate was 33.9 basis points in the fourth quarter fiscal 2017, down 3% from 35 basis points in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, and down 1% from 34.2 basis points in the third quarter fiscal 2017. Although strong flows into our lower fee strategies continue, net inflows into higher fee strategies helped to mitigate the overall fee rate decline. Performance fees reduced earnings by $300,000 in the fourth quarter fiscal 2017 and contributed $600,000 and $500,000 to earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and third quarter fiscal 2017, respectively. As Tom noted, we realized 7% internal growth in management fees and 11% internal growth in managed assets in fiscal 2017. This represents a significant improvement from fiscal 2016 when we realized 1% internal growth in management fees on 6% internal growth in managed assets. We are pleased to see asset growth translating into demonstrable revenue growth and are optimistic about our ability to continue to build on this momentum in the next fiscal year. Fiscal 2017 consolidated revenues were the highest in company history. In the fourth quarter fiscal 2017, we realized 5% annualized internal growth in management fees on 8% annualized internal growth in managed assets. This represents a significant improvement over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 when we realized 2% annualized internal growth in management fees on 6% annualized internal growth in managed assets. The spread between management fee and AUM growth rates in this year\u2019s fourth quarter matched the preceding quarter when we generated 6% annualized internal growth in management fees on 9% annualized internal growth in managed assets. Turning to expenses. Compensation expense increased by 13% in fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting higher sales-based incentive accruals driven by strong product sales, higher operating income-based bonus accruals driven by increased profitably, higher salaries and benefits associated with increases in headcount, partly in connection with the Calvert acquisition, and higher stock-based compensation. As a percentage of revenue, compensation expense decreased to 36% in fiscal 2017 from 37% in fiscal 2016. Even with continuing revenue growth, we anticipate that compensation as a percentage of revenue will stay in the 36% range in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, given seasonal pressures associated with payroll tax clock resets, 401(k) funding, year-end base salary increases and stock-based compensation acceleration associated with employee retirement. Controlling our compensation costs and other discretionary spending remains top of mind as we move into the new fiscal year. Non-compensation distribution-related costs, including distribution and service fee expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commissions, increased 13% in fiscal 2017, reflecting an increase in closed-end fund structuring fees and higher marketing and distribution-related costs, primarily driven by higher average managed assets and the addition of the Calvert funds acquired at the end of calendar 2016. Backing out closed-end fund structuring fees paid, which we do in calculating adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per diluted share, our non-compensation distribution-related costs in fiscal 2017 were up 12%. Fourth quarter distribution-related expenses were up 12% year-over-year and down 6%, sequentially. Fund-related expenses increased 36% in fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting increases in sub-advisory fees paid and higher fund subsidies associated with the addition of the Calvert funds, increases in fund expenses born by the company on funds for which we earn an all-in fee and $1.9 million in onetime reimbursements made to the funds by the company during the third quarter fiscal 2017. Other operating expenses were up 7% in fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting increases in travel, communications, professional services, other corporate expenses and information technology spending. In terms of specific initiatives spending, expenses related to Next Shares totaled approximately $7.4 million in fiscal 2017 versus approximately $8 million in fiscal 2016. We continue to spend approximately $2 million per quarter in connection with our NextShares initiative. Net gains and other investment income on seed capital investments contributed $0.01 to earnings per diluted share in each of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 and the third quarter fiscal 2017. When quantifying the impact of our seed capital investments on earnings each quarter, we take into consideration our pro rata share of the gains, losses and other investment income earned on investments in sponsored products, whether accounted for as consolidated funds, separate accounts or equity method investments, as well as the gains and losses recognized on derivatives used to hedge these investments. We then report the per share impact, net of income taxes and net income attributable to non-controlling interest. We continue to hedge the market exposures of our seed capital portfolio to the extent practicable to minimize the associated earnings volatility. Our effective tax rate was 36.5% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, 39% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, and 36.9% for the third quarter fiscal 2017. Excluding the effect of consolidated CLO entity earnings and losses allocated to other beneficial interest holders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, our effective tax rate would have been 38.3% for the quarter. So among the highest tax rate of corporate taxpayers worldwide, Eaton Vance would be a major beneficiary if efforts in Washington to lower the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20% proved to be successful. In April, we issued $300 million of new 3.5% 10-year senior notes and issued a redemption notice for our $250 million of 6.5% senior notes due in October 2017. On a net basis, these transactions result in an annual reduction in our interest expense of approximately $5.8 million. In other capital management activities, we repurchased 549,000 shares of nonvoting common stock for approximately $26 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding increased by 2% during the fiscal year from $114 million on October 31, 2016, to $116.4 million on October 31, 2017. We finished our fourth fiscal quarter holding $824.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term debt securities and approximately $336.9 million in seed capital investments. This past August, the company invested $18.8 million in a new warehouse-stage CLO entity that we began consolidating in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Our total outstanding debt at the end of fiscal 2017 consists of the $300 million of 3.5% senior notes issued earlier this year and $325 million of 3.65% senior notes due in 2023. We also have a $300 million credit facility, which is currently undrawn. It\u2019s worth mentioning that different from what our balance sheet may suggest, we did not increased our seed capital portfolio significantly during fiscal 2017. The increase in investment shown on our balance sheet is largely offset by an increase in redeemable non-controlling interest, reflecting the impact of new consolidation guidance adopted during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 that necessitates the consolidation of a greater number of funds in our seed capital portfolio at lower levels of ownership. As a final note, I would observe that Eaton Vance continues to operate at high levels of profitability while maintaining significant financial flexibility, even as we support strong business growth. Looking forward to the next fiscal year, based on what we see today, we expect earnings comparisons to benefit from growth in revenue driven by higher average assets under management. If tax results if tax reform results in lower taxes in our fiscal 2018 U.S. income, after-tax results will be further enhanced. These remain good times for Eaton Vance. This concludes our prepared comments. And at this point, we would like to take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Hi good morning. Thanks very much. Maybe, Tom, you talked about the FIFO, both on the Senate side, and thanks for the color on Parametric\u2019s initial stake on it. Is there any sense of what portion of the tax alpha that Parametric has historically generated is coming from, choosing the timing of the securities? Realize that, that might be a difficult thing to answer but just to get a sense of what type of impact they could have on the historical tax alpha if that is implemented? Tom Faust : Yes, I don\u2019t - thanks for the question, Brian, I don\u2019t know that and I think it might be a hard thing to quantify in total. Obviously, it\u2019s going to vary a lot by circumstances of an individual account. Paul Bouchey is the Head of Research at Parametric. And I have been in touch with him and with Brian Langstraat, who runs Parametric, over the last couple of weeks as this issue has been out there. And they have been doing as I said in my remarks, they have been doing a lot of work. I\u2019m looking at the ability in a mandatory FIFO regime if that\u2019s what happens, to generate tax alpha. And there, I would say that the results, as reported last night by Paul, are quite encouraging, that you can get to essentially comparable levels of tax alpha, but you have to do it in a somewhat different manner. Essentially, what you want to avoid is having a single security purchased at multiple different price points. So I think that means, generally, as you build out your portfolio over time, you are adding new positions as opposed to adding different layers to existing positions. So you have to you got to think about it more, the way you build portfolio will be different. I think one of our challenges is, if this becomes a law, the proposed effective [date] [ph] is about 5 or 6 weeks from now, so there may be some planning that needs to be implemented before this takes effect. And certainly, there will potentially be some changes in algorithms to be affected so that the new way of operating is reflective of this rule, of this information if it comes through. I would say there is a potential positive for perhaps significant in there for their Custom Core business in that and tax reform and that it\u2019s looking like for higher-income investors, federal rates will be probably flat, but the effective rates, including the state tax is net of federal deductions, in places like California, New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut, places that have relatively high state taxes, then that tax rate doesn\u2019t go down and in fact, could go up likely would go up quite sharply on a net basis in some of those places, which not surprisingly represent a pretty big part of our tax-managed business. So as mentioned, this is something that we oppose. We think it works against what tax reform is trying to accomplish. It complicates the lives of investors, but in some ways, it makes the importance of being smart about tax management even greater. And hard to say, but on balance, we think it could well be a positive for our business. Brian Bedell : Okay. Okay, that\u2019s great color. And then maybe just a follow-up on the NextShares with UBS, with that starting up, any sense of aside from the different advisory agreement that you will be having with the other managers, a sense of how the financial advisers at UBS are viewing the product and whether they are going to begin shifting to that en masse, I mean, I guess, just based on conversations, I imagine there\u2019s not really a lot of evidence yet of any traction at this stage? Tom Faust : Yes, it\u2019s obviously very early. I think it was officially turned on in their system either Friday or yesterday. So this is brand new. Also, there\u2019s a process that UBS is undergoing of vetting individual funds. And I know not all of the NextShares funds are yet through that process, including the Oaktree fund that we announced launch of last week. We are very encouraged that UBS is putting funds through an expedited review process. They have lowered the normal standards in terms of how much assets have to be in the fund, recognizing that practically speaking, that since they are the main market here that they can\u2019t realistically expect a lot of flows into the fund to be there before they come in. But we are optimistic. There\u2019s a training module that has been implemented across UBS. I think that\u2019s been well received. As I mentioned in my remarks, this is really the first time that we can wholesale NextShares. The two smaller broker-dealer relationships that we started last year really don\u2019t fit with our distribution model and that of other NextShares sponsors. But this is right down our alley. I should say we are particularly excited about the Oaktree strategy. Oaktree has of course, has an outstanding reputation as a credit manager and this is the first time this diversified credit strategy is available to retail investors. How I think UBS advisers will think about this is strategy by strategy. You put an uninteresting strategy in a NextShares structure I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be compelling for an adviser. But you put but if you put an interesting compelling strategy in front of a NextShares adviser, we think that will motivate that adviser to learn about and to invest in NextShares. And that, that success we certainly hope, will lead that adviser and other advisers and ultimately other broker-dealers, to embrace NextShares, not only for that strategy, but in time for a whole broad array of strategies. So, one step forward, maybe a small step, but certainly, in the whole process here, quite significant. We I would say, in thinking about flows to expect out of UBS, a couple of cautions. One was the one I just said, that all the products are not yet approved and there will be a rollout of product of NextShares at UBS over some period of weeks and months. I think there\u2019s a handful that are approved today and certainly, we expect that to grow by the week for the foreseeable future. But the other thing is that it\u2019s not available yet on all the platforms at UBS. UBS has, for several years, been involved in a major systems upgrade that\u2019s expected to conclude, I think sometime around the middle of next year, and we won\u2019t to be fully available everywhere at UBS in terms of systems until that\u2019s done that process is done. So right now, we are available in brokerage and strategic advisory, but not available in their other advisory programs. Brian Bedell : The strategic advisory is their [wrap] [ph] program, I believe, it\u2019s that correct? Tom Faust : Yes. Or it is a [wrap] [ph] program. I think they have other ones as well. Brian Bedell : Great thanks for all the color. Tom Faust : Yes. Thanks, Brian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee of KBW. Your line is open. Robert Lee : Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Can you maybe just as a starting place I noticed that you have kind of made a comment in the release about a CLO entity. So it kind of sounds like you are looking to get heavier into the CLO business in managing CLOs. Could you maybe kind of update us on your plans there? And I saw you had a little bit warehouse, so do you have some kind of CLOs you are thinking are coming to market in the next couple of months and just kind of how you are thinking about that business? Tom Faust : So we have one CLO that\u2019s in process that we have mentioned that\u2019s in that\u2019s, I guess, come out of the warehouse stage. We have, I would say, a renewed interest in this business. We have a team here that\u2019s been doing CLOs for certainly well over a decade. We think we are pretty good at this. It\u2019s a huge part of the bank loan market. For public companies, it\u2019s a bit challenging because of the reporting requirements. There are also risk retention rules that effectively require us to own, I think it\u2019s 5% of the entity. You can do that by owning a pro rata strip of the different risk levels or by owning much of the equity. We are I don\u2019t think you can you should expect to see Eaton Vance become primarily a CLO shop. This is a big business, but there are their capital needs here, the risk considerations, there are accounting complexities. But having said all that, this is an asset class that we like. We think we are very good at managing bank loans. We think we understand how CLOs work. There is a stickiness to the assets that we like and we would expect, I would say, relatively slowly to be ramping up our CLO exposure. Robert Lee : Okay, great. And then maybe just following up on Hexavest, I guess you are \u2013 I assume you are in negotiations with them right now about the buying up the majority stake. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any update on expectations that we should think of around that. Or to some degree, is that impacting how you are thinking in the short term at least about kind of share buyback or capital management? Tom Faust : I think it\u2019s if we were to exercise our option, it would be about a $90 million item. So it\u2019s not an insignificant spending amount. So at the margin, that would influence other uses of capital. I would say that, as your question suggests, we are in the middle of negotiations and would prefer not to say too much. We like these guys very much. We like the way they run their business. But it\u2019s not ultimately recent agreement on whether or not to exercise that option. We have, I think the period expire sometime in the middle of December. So time is getting short and so stay tuned. Robert Lee : Okay and then thanks. Patience is maybe one more question is, can you maybe update us on any kind of how you are thinking of the institutional business of your pipeline. You mentioned, obviously, some success with some of the global macro and obviously the bank loan products in the U.S. and outside, but any kind of color on how we could think about institutional activity on any pipelines? Tom Faust : Yes. So we have a pipeline report that we circulate weekly internally. And as of the end of last week, when the last pipeline report was circulated, happily, lots of indicated inflows and not many indicated outflows, which is good. The areas of growth anticipated based on these are one, not funded. One is a global high-yield mandate for an international client. There\u2019s a quite interesting Calvert-enhanced cash strategy that is pending funding that we think perhaps could be a model for other similar responsibly managed enhanced cash mandates, the parametric pipeline in terms of Custom Core, defensive equity and exposure management continues strong. I was in Japan, I guess, 2 weeks ago, working with our sales team there, meeting with clients. Japan is our largest market outside the United States, and we have seen very strong growth there, that accounts for much of the overall growth in our international business we have seen this year. Strategies we talked about during those sessions when I was there included bank loans, included global macro, included taxable municipal securities, which is kind of interesting, somewhat new market. You wouldn\u2019t think on its face that municipal bonds would be interesting to investors in Japan or places outside the United States. But there\u2019s a market of about $500 billion today for securities issued by municipal issuers, but that don\u2019t qualify for the favorable tax treatment. Therefore, they traded yields that are more comparable to corporate securities. Those corporate those municipal issuers have different risk characteristics than our corporate issuers that make them potentially attractive for taxable investors around the world including outside of the United States. Interestingly, one of the proposals in the tax reform initiative would potentially curtail, it varies a little bit by the House and the Senate version. But in both cases would limit certain types of tax-exempt municipal bond issuances, which interestingly could help address one of the issues we are facing in the taxable market is that it\u2019s a relatively small market with limited supply. So what was released in one side might be a source of growth on the other. But quite active across a range of strategies in institutional, U.S., international, certainly Eaton Vance, Hexavest, Parametric, Atlanta Capital, every one of our subsidiaries is actively trying to build business institutionally, it\u2019s not easy. There tends to be longer selling cycle. Obviously, these are competitive times with lots of pressure from passive and particularly in equities, but we think that maybe, particularly outside the United States as we build a bigger presence, there could be some low-hanging fruit for us in building out that institutional business relatively quickly. Robert Lee : Okay, great. I appreciate the color. Thanks for taking my question. Tom Faust : Right. Thank you, Rob. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz of Citigroup. Your line is open. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much for taking my questions. So maybe a two-parter, Laurie, you mentioned that comp to be about 36% of revenue is looking to the first quarter. So within that, what are some of your baseline assumptions as you look out for the rest of the year? And just remind me if that is sort of a seasonal high point in terms of that ratio in absolute dollar spend? And then on the other side of that, other expense looked like it\u2019s rather high this particular quarter, you didn\u2019t call anything out either in your prepared remarks or in the press release? So is this a new run rate? Was there any sort of mapping of items this quarter? Just trying to get a sense as we look ahead into the new year. Laurie Hylton : Yes, Bill, this is we\u2019re going to address the comp question first as we move from the fourth quarter into the first quarter, we\u2019ve always got the sort of the seasonal adjustments that we recognize in terms of a number of things. We\u2019ve got base increases, we\u2019ve got benefit resets, we\u2019ve got payroll tax clock resets. And I think, last year, as we moved from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year that was about a $4.5 million increase. As we look at the same numbers going into \u2013 from the fourth quarter of this year going to the first quarter of 2018, I think we\u2019re probably looking at something a little north of $5 million in terms of incremental pressure on our fixed compensation expenses. You\u2019d have to do your own math based on your expectations about sales to come up with what the pressure might be in terms of our variable compensation, but that\u2019s generally that pressure that we hit each first quarter and that it certainly colors our expectations about that 36% number in the first quarter. In terms of other expenses, this was actually a very clean quarter from an expense perspective. So I don\u2019t know that there was anything in particular that I would call out in terms of our other operating expenses. We\u2019ve been able to keep a pretty good lid on it and I think that we\u2019ve been exercising a lot of control over discretionary spend. So I really don\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t think of anything off the cuff that would really \u2013 that we would need to address in terms of something unusual in the fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Michael Carrier : Hi, thanks a lot. Tom, just on the acquisition side to Parametric, just whether it was timing strategy, turned out very well. You look at what you guys see with Calvert, maybe when you did the transaction. And then over the past 11 months, you\u2019ve been \u2013 you\u2019re talking in the different distribution channels. Just wanted to try to gauge either how you see that playing out, whether it\u2019s the core products you mentioned, maybe this enhanced cash product being like a potential opportunity, just where you\u2019re seeing the demand now that you\u2019ve had 11 months on the platform? Tom Faust : Yes. Thanks, Michael. The \u2013 one of the challenges we\u2019ve had with Calvert is there are growth opportunities in lots of different directions. We had a Calvert-devoted strategy session toward the end of last week to try and get some kind of consensus on where do we go. And there\u2019s \u2013 do we focus on building out institutional business? Calvert traditionally has been a retail brand but in many ways, the demand for Responsible Investing is more developed in certain institutional markets. Do we take Calvert overseas because, again, particularly in Europe, demand in many places for Responsible Investing is more developed there than it is here. We \u2013 within U.S. retail, which has been the focus of Calvert traditionally, they have a relatively underdeveloped business historically in the warehouses. And many of those firms, including yours, have major initiatives to build the Responsible Investing business and are looking for partners to work with them to do that. So I\u2019m not maybe a greedy person because I \u2013 my vote in the strategy session was to do all of these, but we are somewhat constrained by resources. But we\u2019ve got funds, we\u2019ve got separate accounts, we\u2019ve got retail, we\u2019ve got institutional, we\u2019ve got U.S. and international. And then certainly within different strategies, we\u2019ve got opportunities. In terms of the objective to sell more now as opposed to lay the groundwork for things that might take 6 or 12 or 18 or 24 months to result in flows, the most compelling Calvert offerings today are their 5-star-rated emerging market equity fund, their range of shorter duration, short duration, ultrashort income strategies; and their index products, primarily on the equity side. We think we\u2019ve got plenty to do in the near term to get our sales force focused on selling those in the right areas of the country where Responsible Investing matters. But also, we\u2019re doing a lot of work laying groundwork for potentially interesting longer-term opportunities for different product structures perhaps in certainly different markets. I mentioned the \u2013 I think your question, you mentioned this as well was the institutional enhanced cash market where we have one pending funding awaiting, but certainly in coastal markets where you\u2019ve got large pools of corporate cash and corporations that are committed a social mission that includes principles very similar to the Calvert principles for Responsible Investing, we think there could be a very nice match not only in corporate cash but also working with those same firms to get placement of Calvert strategies in 401(k) programs, for example. So we\u2019re in a target-rich environment. We\u2019re coming out of a period where Calvert is a stand-alone, who had gone through some struggles for a period of years, so we\u2019ve had to right the ship in some ways, but we\u2019re gratified that as that\u2019s happened, we\u2019ve been able to begin the process of putting Calvert on a growth trajectory and the comparison to Parametric, I hope it turns out like Parametric. I think it wouldn\u2019t be completely out of the realm of possibility that, that happens, but the kind of success we\u2019ve had with Parametric over the last 16-or-so years that they\u2019ve been part of Eaton Vance is \u2013 I guess 14 years as part of Eaton Vance is not something we can necessarily count on from every acquisition. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler of William Blair. Your line is open. Chris Shutler : Hi, guys. Good morning. On the floating rate side of the business, can you give us a little more color on the demand dynamics that you\u2019re seeing between retail and institution. And then talk about the supply in the bank loan market right now and how you\u2019re feeling about capacity? Thanks. Tom Faust : Yes. So just maybe starting on the capacity side, we are at, I think, roundly $40 billion. It is a market \u2013 I don\u2019t have the number off the top of my head, but I think it\u2019s globally, around a $1 trillion market, something like that. So we\u2019re at 4% or \u2013 which is we\u2019re a major player, but I think the last time we thought about \u2013 the last time we thought we were close to capacity, I think we had assets in the mid- to high-40s, but the asset class was probably more like $600 million at that time. So I think we feel like we\u2019ve got a fair bit of running room in terms of the ability to grow our bank loan franchise from current level. The demand, as I highlighted in my prepared remarks in the quarter was really driven by institutional and particularly driven by clients outside the United States. Retail, I think, was pretty close to \u2013 was modestly positive but certainly not what we saw in the first couple of quarters of the fiscal year. Explaining retail demand for \u2013 is always a little hard, but what seems to be clear in bank loan flows is that when people are fearing increases in interest rates on the long side and anticipating increases in rates on the short side, it would see more bank loan inflows. Certainly right after the election, we were in one of those kinds of environments where people were optimistic about economic growth, expecting to see potentially a lot of stimulus, were worried about inflation. That was an environment where we saw, literally overnight, a major pickup in bank loan demand. What\u2019s happened over the last couple of quarters is with maybe a lessening of concern about rates on the long end and a tempering of expectations about the pace of Fed action on the short end. There\u2019s been a bit of a reversal of that \u2013 of those strong inflows that happened a year-or-so ago. Fortunately, for Eaton Vance, we\u2019ve been in a quite strong performance cycle, which you layer on a good 1-year numbers with a very strong history, we have an excellent performance story to tell today. So we\u2019re in \u2013 we feel like we\u2019re in the hunt for bank loan mandates wherever they are to be won, retail, institutional, U.S., international, the catalysts for the next wave of growth, I suspect, likely will be some change in interest rate expectations, either short end or long end or both. But for the moment, we have a relatively stable business that\u2019s experiencing modest growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Patrick Davitt : Thanks for taking the question. I have a quick follow up on Hexavest. Is it still fair to kind of use the guidance you gave in 2012 around fee rates and accretion to kind of estimate the potential impact to your earnings estimates in margin from the integration of the additional \u2013 well, actually, the 75%, if you decide to pull the trigger there? Tom Faust : You may have a better memory than mine, what was my guidance from 2012? Patrick Davitt : I think you said mid-30s fee rates, which suggested a margin in the 60% to 70% range. Tom Faust : The fee rates are \u2013 that\u2019s ballpark in the right area. Dan Cataldo : Patrick, if you look in our disclosures in the press release, we just \u2013 the contribution from Hexavest to our P&L shows up in the equity and income of affiliates. And that \u2013 as we\u2019ve I think said in the past, is almost entirely Hexavest. So that will give you a sense of the current contribution of the 49% ownership of Hexavest. Patrick Davitt : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Fannon : Hi, thanks. My question is on tax, I guess as a major corporate tax beneficiary as you guys have highlighted, can you talk about the priorities of that kind of excess cash flow in terms of how it will either to be sent back through capital return through buybacks and dividends or investing more in the business or M&A? Can you talk about what you\u2019re \u2013 how you\u2019re thinking about that? Tom Faust : Yes. Well, I like your optimism that this is going to be enacted. So I\u2019ll start with that. Just to maybe level set, our expectation is that once this is sort of all run through, whenever that is or if that\u2019s going to happen, assuming that the corporate rate stays at the 20% level that\u2019s in the \u2013 currently in the House and the Senate bill, we expect our blended combined rate to be around 25%. There\u2019s an adverse effect in there of some of the changes in how executive comp is treated that\u2019s reflected in that number. But compared to that 38.5%-or-so range where we are today, that\u2019s a \u2013 I think that\u2019s about a 22% earnings increase once the tax increase \u2013 once the tax cut comes through, assuming, importantly, this is a big caveat, that some of that doesn\u2019t get pass through to in higher cost or competed away in some ways in terms of \u2013 or a revenue realization. We\u2019ll get \u2013 we likely will have some of that effect. But in terms of the overall effect if this happens, we certainly would expect the net effect on after-tax earnings and earnings per share to be strongly positive. Your question is what do we do with the money. I think it\u2019s the same as how we think about things now. I think about \u2013 so there\u2019s a \u2013 we could get a windfall from the market going up. We could have some big growth surge in our business, but I don\u2019t think those would fundamentally change how we think about capital uses. Our options are the same as they\u2019ve always been, dividends, share repurchases, so returning money back to shareholders or investing in the business either in the form of seed capital or acquisitions. I would say we wouldn\u2019t feel any particular greater urgency to do acquisitions because we\u2019re earning at a higher rate and producing more cash flow. We would certainly consider an increase in the dividend to maintain something like the current payout rate, but that\u2019s obviously a bit speculative and in the future. Whether we would ramp up share repurchases would depend on in part on our view of whether the stock represented good value at that particular time. So the options would be the same as today. The choices would be very much dependent on the situation as we see at the time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Ari Ghosh : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. This is Ari Ghosh, filling in for Craig. So just on the Parametric and custom data business, could you provide an update on the competitive pressures that you\u2019re seeing here including from property bands and robos? And then has there been any changes to the pricing trends here that would pressure the fee rate? And I believe yours is currently around the 15, 20 bp range on a blended basis? Thanks. Tom Faust : That\u2019s right, and thanks for the question. This is an area like many parts of our business where there is price competition. We\u2019re seeing strong volumes and we\u2019re seeing, at least in some pockets, some increased pricing pressure. There are not particular new entrants that we\u2019re worried about or that are driving prices down. It\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s largely that the \u2013 this is viewed as a passive or maybe quasi-passive investment strategy and people are quite aware that the cost of passive generally is going down. When we look at the value proposition of producing tax \u2013 after-tax alpha, somewhere in the 150 basis point range or hopefully better than that over time, we think this represents an extraordinary value relative to what we generate and benefit and also an extraordinary value relative to other passive alternatives that don\u2019t provide tax alpha. I talked in my prepared remarks a bit about the tax bill and the mandatory FIFO provision. It is interesting that if this goes into effect that, that may have some competitive effects, the firms that are maybe more sophisticated in their management and the capability and are more developed in their systems like Parametric, we would hope would be in a position to respond more quickly to implement changes in systems as necessary and that perhaps that can be helpful in terms of pricing dynamic in the marketplace with a fairly disruptive change in how people would have to implement tax management. But we are a bit speculative, but we are \u2013 we think by a considerable margin, the largest player in the business. There are real economies of scale that come in this, but we\u2019re aware that this is something that other firms, at least can think they can do and that we need to distinguish ourself in the marketplace, not only by service levels and performance in terms of generated tax alpha and tracking of benchmark, but also in terms of being cost competitive where required. Operator : Due to time restriction, we are unable to take any further questions. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Dan Cataldo for final remarks. Dan Cataldo : Great. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We appreciate your continued interest in Eaton Vance, and hope you all have a happy and safe Thanksgiving. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Analysts: William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Good morning. My name is Chris, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Eaton Vance Corp. First Fiscal Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Treasurer, Dan Cataldo, you may begin your conference. Daniel C. Cataldo - Eaton Vance Corp.: Thank you and welcome to our fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings call and webcast. Here this morning are Tom Faust, Chairman and CEO of Eaton Vance; and Laurie Hylton, our CFO. We will first comment on the quarter and then take your questions. The full earnings release and charts we will refer to during the call are available on our website, eatonvance.com, under the heading, Press Releases. Today's presentation contains forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainties in our business, including but not limited to those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings including our 2017 annual report and Form 10-K are available on our website upon request at no charge. I'll now turn the call over to Tom. Thomas E. Faust, Jr. - Eaton Vance Corp.: Thanks, Dan and good morning, everyone. Earlier this morning, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.78 for the first quarter of our fiscal 2018, which is up 47% from the $0.53 that we reported in last year's first quarter, and also up 11% from $0.70 that we reported in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year. The nearly 50% year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings per diluted share reflects 29% higher operating income and the favorable effect on adjusted earnings of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December. As Laurie will discuss in more detail, our first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share exceeded the $0.63 of U.S. GAAP earnings per diluted share we reported for the period, primarily to reflect the revaluation of previously booked deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the lower U.S. corporate tax rate, the tax expense we recognized on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings not previously subject to U.S. tax as is required under the Tax Act, and the recognition of net excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation plans in connection with the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock awards during the period as newly adopted accounting guidance requires to be included now in GAAP earnings. First quarter adjusted earnings also reflect the add back of a onetime charge recognized during the period in connection with the expiration of our option to acquire an additional 26% ownership interest in our 46% owned affiliate Hexavest. We finished our first fiscal quarter with record managed assets and had record revenue and record adjusted earnings for the quarter as the strong business trends of fiscal 2017 continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Ending assets under management at January 31 were $449.2 billion, up 24% from a year earlier and up 6% from the end of the previous quarter. We had positive net flows in each of our six investment mandate reporting categories; equity, fixed income, floating rate income, alternatives, portfolio implementation, and exposure management. And also across all four of our investment vehicle reporting categories; funds, institutional separate accounts, high net worth separate accounts, and retail managed accounts. Our net flows for the quarter were $7.1 billion, which represents 7% annualized internal growth in managed assets. Excluding our lower fee exposure management business, net inflows for the quarter were $5.6 billion, also equating to 7% annualized internal growth in managed assets. On the basis of growth in management fee revenue, our annualized internal growth rate for the quarter was 5%. Organic revenue growth as we define is the change in run rate management fee revenue resulting from net inflows and outflows, taking into account the fee rate applicable to each dollar in and out, and excluding the impact of market action in acquisitions. As we discussed in prior quarters, we believe an asset manager's organic growth is better captured by internal growth in fee revenue than by internal growth in managed assets. A key to our success in fiscal 2018 \u2013 into 2017 was growing our actively managed strategies at the same time, as our specialty passive strategies continue to demonstrate high growth. In breaking down our overall business into active and passive, we treat as passive our portfolio implementation and exposure management reporting categories, which are Parametric businesses, as well as EVM managed ladder bond strategies reported within fixed income and Calvert index strategies reported within equities. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, our active strategies grew managed assets at a 5% annualized internal growth rate, while our specialty passive strategies increased managed assets at an 8% annualized internal rate. Net inflows into active strategies were driven by positive flows into EVM fixed income, alternatives, floating rate income, and equity strategies, as well as Calvert equity and fixed income. Parametric active strategy flows were modestly negative, as continued strong growth in defensive equity and other equity option strategies was offset by outflows from emerging market equity and alternatives. Among our specialty passive strategies, we continue to see strong demand for our laddered, municipal and corporate bonds separate accounts, which had net inflows of nearly $1.5 billion in the quarter. Also contributing to the quarter's 8% organic growth in specialty passive strategy managed assets were $1.8 billion of net inflows into Parametric's Custom Core equities. As we have previously described, we grouped EVM managed ladder bond separate accounts with Parametric's Custom Core equity separate accounts offered in retail and high net worth channels and call this combination Custom Beta. As shown on page 12 of the call slides, our managed assets and Custom Beta strategies ended the quarter at nearly $80 billion, up 15% for the quarter. The continued growth here highlights ongoing investor demand for access to passive exposures that are customized to meet individual preferences and needs. In the quarter, Parametric exposure management had net inflows of $1.5 billion, continuing this business's strong growth trend. Since entering the business through the purchase of the former Clifton Group in December 2012, our exposure management AUM has increased from $32 billion to $90.5 billion, a near tripling in just over five years. Even at an average fee rate of just five basis points, this business is making a meaningful contribution to our earnings. Calvert branded strategies contributed nicely to the quarterly flow results, with almost $500 million in net inflows. The improving monthly trend of Calvert flow results, since we acquired this business at the end of 2016, is illustrated on page 11 of our call slides. Leading contributors to Calvert's positive net flows for the quarter included emerging market equity, core bond and Responsible Index strategies. Responsible investing continues to be a leading trend in asset management, appealing to the growing universe of investors who seek both positive financial returns and positive societal benefits from their investments. Since we acquired Calvert at the end of December 2016, total managed assets in Calvert strategies have grown from $11.9 billion to $14 billion, an increase of 18% in just 13 months. From an investment performance perspective, our story remains strong. At the end of January, we had 63 funds with overall Morningstar ratings of 4 or 5 stars for at least one class of shares, including 23 5-star rated funds. As shown on page 14 of our call slides, at the end of January, approximately half of our managed assets ranked in the top performance quartile of peer funds as categorized by Morningstar for the past one, three and five years was 63%, 77%, 76% and 77%, ranking in the top half of their Morningstar peers for their respective measurement periods. In a time of rising interest rates, it's certainly helpful for us that many of our top-rated and top performing funds are floating-rate or short duration income funds or absolute return strategies that are positioned as alternatives to traditional fixed income. At the end of January, we had three floating-rate funds, five short or ultra-short duration taxable income funds, and three short duration short-term or limited maturity municipal funds ranking 4 or 5 stars. As income investors seek protection from erosion of principal value and to achieve higher income levels, as interest rates move higher, we think we are well positioned for growth across this broad menu of high-performing income strategies with limited exposure to duration risk. Our global macro strategies, which constitute most of our alternatives reporting category continue to perform well and are also positioned to benefit from investors seeking alternatives to intermediate and long-term bonds. The two global macro funds we offer in the U.S., Global Macro Absolute Return and Global Macro Absolute Return Advantage have each had favorable returns versus their LIBOR benchmark over the past one, three, and five years, and are true alternative investments. With very low correlations versus equity and fixed income market returns, they don't perform at all like stocks and bonds, and have a history of low volatility. In the current environment of stressed equity valuations, increased market volatility and rising interest rates, these strategies are particularly appealing. In the first fiscal quarter, the five-star rated Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return Advantage Fund was a top seller across our U.S. equity fund line-up, with inflows of over $900 million gross and nearly $800 million net, tops among all of the strategies that we offer as mutual funds in the U.S. With management fees of 90 basis points annually on incremental assets, GMARA as we call it internally, is also among the highest fee strategies that we offer. Growth prospects for GMARA and related strategies remain excellent. Let me finish with updates on two of our other important initiatives, our global expansion and NextShares. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we had net flows from clients outside the United States totaling $500 million, which equates to 8% annualized internal growth in managed assets. There were also two important strategic developments during the quarter relating to our multiyear effort to expand our international business. First on January 31, we announced the hiring of a five-person team that constituted the global fixed income group of the now former Oechsle Investment Advisors (sic) [Oechsle International Advisors]. Based in Frankfurt and led by Astrid Vogeler, the team has been integrated into Eaton Vance's Global Income Group and has a core global bond capability that we previously did not have. With $800 million in current assets under management, Astrid and her team have delivered strong returns versus benchmark over many years. The office they occupy now serves as home base for Eaton Vance in Continental Europe with our Frankfurt-based Business Development Director, Thomas Body, also working from the same location. Eaton Vance is now open for business with boots on the ground in Europe's largest economy and a historically strong market for income returns. Also in January, we moved into new office space in Tokyo to support continued growth of our business in Japan. The new office which can accommodate up to eight people gives us room to expand our physical presence in our largest international market. On NextShares, we continue to make progress on multiple fronts. As a reminder, NextShares are a new type of fund vehicle combining proprietary active management with the conveniences and potential performance and tax advantages of exchange traded products. Our NextShares Solutions subsidiary holds patents and other intellectual property rights related to NextShares and is seeking to commercialize them by entering into licensing and service agreements with fund companies. The first NextShares fund was launched on Nasdaq in February 2016. Today, there are 15 NextShares funds from seven different fund families that are listed for trading with two more funds from an additional sponsor expected to launch in March. The currently available NextShares funds cover a broad range of investment strategies, including U.S. and global equity, taxable and tax-free fixed income, and floating rate income. Managers represented include, in addition to Eaton Vance and Calvert, Brandes, Gabelli, Reinhart, Waddell & Reed and Oaktree and Wellington as subadvisors. On the distribution front, the main focus continues to be UBS, where NextShares officially launched on their brokerage and strategic advisor platforms on November 20 of last year. Sales to-date at UBS have been modest, constrained by the need for each and long strategy to clear UBS due diligence, a process that does not begin until a fund starts trading. With several of our most attractive strategies expected to clear due diligence and to become available for purchase within the next month, we expect the sales spigot to begin opening over the coming weeks. In launches like this one, success begets success. As sales begin to flow at UBS, the NextShares structure becomes increasingly attractive both to additional fund sponsors and to other broker dealers. As it has been throughout this initiative, our goal remains to position NextShares to become the fund vehicle of choice for active strategies and to use this innovation to help address the competitive imbalance that continues to exist between active and passive funds. That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll now turn the call over to Laurie. Laurie G. Hylton - Eaton Vance Corp.: Thank you and good morning. As Tom mentioned we're reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.78 for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 47% from $0.53 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and up 11% from $0.70 of adjusted earnings per diluted share reported in the fourth quarter fiscal 2017. As you can see in attachment to our press release, adjusted earnings differed from GAAP earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 by $0.15 per diluted share, primarily reflecting the impact of tax law changes and the newly adopted accounting standard. Adjustments affecting our first quarter include $21.7 million revaluation of deferred tax amounts resulting from the new tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017, $3 million of incremental tax expense also resulting from the December tax law changes related to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings not previously subject to U.S. taxation, and then $11.9 million income tax benefit related to newly adopted accounting guidance addressing the treatment of stock-based compensation plans. This benefit, driven by the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock during the period, would have been recognized as an adjustment to equity rather than the income statement item under the previous accounting guidance. As a further adjustment to first quarter earnings, the company recognized a $6.5 million pre-tax loss, $5.7 million after-tax, in connection with the expiration during the period of our option to acquire an additional 26% ownership interest in our 49% owned affiliate Hexavest. Adjusted earnings per diluted share matched GAAP earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and differed from GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 by $0.01 per diluted share to reflect increases in the estimated redemption value of non-controlling interests in affiliates redeemable at other than fair value. As of January 31, 2018, all non-controlling interests in our affiliates are redeemable at fair value. Our operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was up 29% in the first quarter fiscal 2017 and down 2% sequentially. Our operating margin was 32.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 versus 29.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and 34.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. As reflected in the sequential comparison, first quarter results were impacted by the usual seasonal compensation pressures that I will discuss in a moment. Ending consolidated managed assets at January 31, 2018 reached a new record high of $449.2 billion, an increase of 24% over the past year, and up 6% from the prior quarter-end, driven by strong net flows and positive market returns. Average managed assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 26% from the first quarter of fiscal 2017, driving a 19% increase in revenue. Revenue growth trailed growth in average managed assets year over year, primarily due to a decline in our average management fee rate from 35.1 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 to 33.7 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This decline in our average management fee rate is primarily attributable to outsized growth of our lower fee exposure management portfolio implementation and bond laddered businesses. Average managed assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 5% versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, generating a 4% growth in revenue. Sequentially, our average management fee rate declined modestly from 33.9 basis points in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to 33.7 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Although strong flows into our lower fee strategies continue, net inflows into higher fee strategies helped mitigate the overall fee rate decline. Performance fees, which are excluded from the calculation of our average fee rates, reduced earnings by $0.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, contributed $200,000 to earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and reduced earnings by $300,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. As Tom noted, we realized 5% annualized internal growth in management fees on 7% annualized internal growth in managed assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to 7% annualized internal growth in management fees on 9% annualized internal growth and managed assets in the first quarter of last year. Our management fee and AUM internal growth rates in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were largely consistent with the fourth quarter of last year when we had 5% annualized internal growth in management fees on 8% annualized internal growth in assets. We continue to be optimistic about our ability to continue this momentum through the balance of fiscal 2028. Turning to expenses, compensation expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by 15% from the first quarter of fiscal 2017, reflecting increases in operating income-based bonus accruals driven by increased profitability, higher salaries and benefits associated with increases in head count and year-end merit adjustments, and higher stock-based compensation, all partially offset by a decrease in sales-based incentive accruals. Sequentially, compensation expense increased by approximately 10% from the fourth quarter fiscal 2017, reflecting higher stock-based compensation expense, higher sales-based incentive accruals driven by strong product sales, higher salaries and benefits driven by increases in head count, and several seasonal compensation factors, including fiscal year-end merit increases and calendar year employee benefit and payroll tax clock resets. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, there's approximately $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense that we would not anticipate seeing next quarter. On the flipside, we are increasing our annual 401(k) employee contribution match, which will result in an incremental expense of approximately $1.3 million next quarter. Non-compensation distribution related costs, including distribution and service fee expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commissions, increased 11% and 4% versus the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, primarily reflecting increases in intermediary marketing support payments mainly driven by higher average managed assets and higher marketing and promotion costs. Fund-related expenses increased 37% and 21% versus the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, primarily reflecting increases in fund subsidies, higher sub-advisory fees paid, and an increase in fund expenses borne by the company on funds for which we earn an all-in fee. The year-over-year increase in fund subsidies is attributable primarily to the addition of the Calvert funds through the acquisition of the business assets of Calvert Investments at the end of calendar 2016. The sequential quarter increase was largely due to calendar year-end subsidy accrual adjustments and growth in assets and subsidized funds with expense cap. Other operating expenses were up 14% versus the first quarter fiscal 2017 and down 2% from the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects an increase in information technology spending, as well as higher travel, communications, professional services, facilities and other corporate expenses. The sequential decrease in other operating expenses primarily reflects lower professional services and travel expenses, partially offset by slightly higher information technology and other corporate expenses. We continue to spend approximately $2 million per quarter in connection with our NextShares initiative. Net gains and other investment income on seed capital investments were negligible in the first quarters of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, and contributed $0.01 to earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. When quantifying the impact of our seed capital investments on earnings each quarter, we take into consideration our pro rata share of the gains, losses and other investment income earned on investments in sponsored products where they're accounted for as consolidated funds, separate accounts or equity method investments, as well as the gains and losses recognized on derivatives used to hedge those investments. We then report the per share impact net of income taxes and net income attributable to non-controlling interest. We continue to hedge the market exposures of our seed capital portfolio to the extent practicable to minimize the associated earnings volatility. Net gains and other investment income in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 includes the previously noted $6.5 million charge to reflect the expiration of the company's option to acquire an additional 26% ownership interest in Hexavest under the terms of the option agreement entered into when we acquired our initial 49% position in 2012. We add back this one-time change in calculating adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share for the quarter. Consolidated CLO activity contributed $1.6 million to non-operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Turning to taxes, our effective tax rate to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was 36.3% versus 37.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and 36.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. As we noted in the press release this morning, the company's income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 includes a non-recurring charge of $24.7 million to reflect the estimated effect of the Tax Act. This non-recurring charge is based on current interpretation of the tax law changes, and includes $21.7 million from the revaluation of the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities, and $3 million for the deemed repatriation of foreign sourced net earnings, not previously subject to U.S. taxation. The increase in the company's effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 resulting from this charge was offset by an income tax benefit of $11.9 million related to the exercise of stock options, investing of restricted stock during the period, and the net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest and other beneficial interests, which is not taxable to the company. Excluding the non-recurring impact of the tax reform and the net excess tax benefits recognized in the first quarter in conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting guidance, our operating effective tax rate for the quarter would have been 26.7%. The accounting treatment of income taxes related to stock-based compensation that I noted previously may cause an appreciable level of volatility in our quarterly effective tax rate going forward, particularly in the first quarter of each year. Excluding the impact of future stock option exercises restricted share vesting associated with this new accounting guidance, we estimate that our quarterly effective tax rate for the balance of fiscal 2018 will range between 27% and 27.5%. Our full year fiscal 2018 effective tax rate will range between 29.25% and 29.75%, and our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate will range between 25% and 25.5%. Consistent with our method of calculating adjusted earnings for the first quarter, we expect to continue treating net excess tax benefits or expense from stock-based compensation plans recognized each quarter as an adjustment item. In other capital management activities, we repurchased 672,000 shares of nonvoting common stock for approximately $36.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding increased 8% year-over-year and 4% sequentially to $123.9 million as of January 31, 2018. We finished our first fiscal quarter holding $740.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term debt securities and approximately $376.3 million in seed capital investment. In light of the recent tax legislation, capital management remains top of mind and we are actively considering our options as we think about how to best balance investing in our business and returning capital to shareholders. This concludes our prepared comments, and at this point, we'd like to take any questions you may have. Operator : Your first question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Just maybe on the European opportunity, Tom, you sort of called out the new platform onboard. I was just sort of wondering from here what kind of growth has that platform has had, and maybe if you could flesh out maybe the opportunity in Japan a bit more? Thomas E. Faust, Jr. - Eaton Vance Corp.: Yes, so the business that we didn't acquire it, but I guess the word would be assumed at the end of January was about $800 million in assets. That asset number has been quite stable over time. The company that group was previously a part of called Oechsle Advisors did not have significant marketing resources and certainly didn't focus those resources on their fixed income team, despite the fact that they have an excellent record, they have a credible team and they're located in a market that's very much focused on fixed income investing. So, we think there is an opportunity there. We've heard that there's at least one opportunity that I know about that's come to my attention where we are responding to an RFP, but we're in the very early days there, we are just a few weeks into our ownership of that group. We think there should be an opportunity, but it's pretty hard to say exactly how big that will be. Somewhat surprisingly, most of the clients' assets for that team are actually in the U.S. So I think they have four current clients they have different institutions in different places, but two of those are in the U.S. and the biggest two clients they have are U.S. based. But it won't be a big contributor, we don't expect, to our organic growth over the balance of this year certainly. But we do think that both that team and the broader benefits to our global income strategy of having a base in Frankfurt on the continent of Europe and also having a sales presence there could and likely will prove valuable to us over time. But we will not be, I don't think, an overnight success in terms of growing the AUM of that business; that's not our expectation at this point anyway. In terms of Japan, I mean, I mentioned last call that I was over there for a couple of weeks back in November. We're certainly in a quite dynamic stage in the growth of our business there. We have approximately $10 billion in Japanese based client assets, continues to grow nicely. A good mix of major institutional assets and smaller type accounts, primarily focused on bank loans, but increasingly other income type strategies are represented in our portfolio there until about a year ago we had only a single investment employee based in Japan. Since then, we've added two more sales and client service oriented professionals with the expectation that, by the end of this year, we'll add probably two or three more in the office that we just opened I think at the end of January. But from the time I was there, it's very clear that Eaton Vance is well known and we're well respected as a credible quality income manager in the Japanese market with a long history of service and performance excellence for clients there, and certainly everybody associated with our efforts in Japan. I think that there we have a real opportunity to grow that business quite meaningfully over the balance of 2018 and really beyond that as we get even better known in the marketplace and as our product menu continues to grow from the initial base, which was almost exclusively bank loans, which we've \u2013 for which we've had Japanese based clients for something close to 20 years now. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's great color. And then just a follow-up, Laurie, perhaps help maybe to guide what was the big increase in the share count sequentially, and then you just sort of mentioned your balancing sort of the plans on the other side of (32:21) U.S. tax front. Could you sort of give us a sense of how you're leaning and what's some of the areas where you either reinvest or return to capital might be? Laurie G. Hylton - Eaton Vance Corp.: Yes, I think in terms of the share count, Bill, the obviously run up in our stock price over the period contributed significantly. Using the treasury stock method, if you have a run up, it's going to increase your diluted share count. So you're seeing that there. We had obviously trended down a little bit in terms of our share repurchases last year. So, in terms of incremental dilution, we had some significant stock option exercises and restricted share vesting, and we were not necessarily offsetting all of that with share repurchases in the course of the year. So those two components combined increased the diluted share count. And in terms of our capital management, I think we like most companies in the industry are spending a lot of time thinking about that. I don't think that we're in a position at this point to lay out any definitive plans, but I will tell you that we'll probably be in a better position next quarter to have a more fulsome conversation about it. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. We received quite a bit of concern around Parametric's enhanced alpha strategies through the February correction and volatility. So I've a few questions around that. One, how do you feel those strategies performed relative to client expectations? Two, what has been the experience with clients through that period in terms of stickiness of assets? And three, do you feel like the product is more or less marketable now that you have that data point in your back pocket? Thomas E. Faust, Jr. - Eaton Vance Corp.: So let's just be clear on what is you're asking about, you're talking about the Parametric Emerging Markets strategy? Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : All the enhanced alpha stuff, yeah. Thomas E. Faust, Jr. - Eaton Vance Corp.: So what you mean by enhanced alpha stuff? So I just want to make sure I answer the right question. You're talking about emerging market equity or are you talking about defensive equity or volatility risk premium strategies? Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Like the volatility risk premium strategy, I'm sorry. Thomas E. Faust, Jr. - Eaton Vance Corp.: Yeah, okay so I'll focus on that. So the volatility risk premium strategy or sometimes called defensive equity or there is a mutual fund called Parametric Volatility Risk Premium Defensive Fund, but it's all variations on the same things. This is a strategy that is a volatility selling strategy. It is a hedge strategy in that the base portfolio is half invested in equities and half invested in cash instruments, I think in treasuries, that you can do it different ways. But that's how most of the assets are invested. And the way it's positioned is that you capture volatility risk premium, you're effectively a seller of insurance and capture that premium during periods of volatility like we had in early February. You will see a reduction in returns because you think of this as an insurance selling strategy. And so when there are more fires, there will be more claims to be paid. In this case, that gets reflected in a daily mark of the account assets. Performance was completely in line with expectations given the market environment. This is a rules based strategy. There were and I don't think will ever be significant surprises in how it performs. It's not a leverage strategy. In the worst case, it has an equity beta of 1 or approaching 1. So it's a strategy we like and certainly we have not heard about significant market concerns about how that strategy has performed in this environment. It has performed in line with expectations. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. I guess first on the expense outlook, if you could talk about I guess more on this past quarter the sequential pickup of what was seasonal versus the variable increase and just generally thinking about kind of the margin profile as we kind of look ahead, you gave a couple of the next quarter type of movements around the step-up and step-down around the 401(k) match and things. But just broadly thinking about, given the strength of asset growth through January, how you're thinking about kind of margin profile for next year? Laurie G. Hylton - Eaton Vance Corp.: Yeah, I think most of the comments we made they were forward-looking related, particularly the compensation and just to be clear, I think that we identified and have identified in the past roughly 40% of our compensation is variable. So that's going to move either in line with what's happening from an operating income perspective or in line with sales in terms of our compensation to our sales team. In terms of our fixed compensation, we've obviously seen some uptick in terms of our head count that drove our base increases and that's going to continue. The things that won't continue or won't continue that we saw in the first quarter would be the roughly $2.5 million of stock-based compensation that I highlighted in my comments and then the offset where we anticipate seeing the uptick in what otherwise would've been a drop off in our 401(k) match in the second quarter. But outside of that, I wouldn't anticipate seeing a lot of other seasonal adjustments on the comp side. I don't think that we're seeing anything significant in terms of the change in our operating model and I therefore would not anticipate seeing any significant moves in our operating margin moving into the next quarter. We always have this sort of downtick in the first quarter associated with these pressures that we've talked about and then we see things start to pick up as we move through the year. I don't see anything coming down the pike that's different. As we talked about, we're thinking about our capital management, may there be some incremental technology spend in the course of the year. There might be but it's not going to be significant in terms of moving the needle, in terms of our overall operating structure. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, Tom, you mentioned a number of key funds coming online for next years on the UBS platform. Can you maybe quantify that and think about or help us think about framing what that kind of opportunity could be over the next kind of 12 months? Thomas E. Faust, Jr. - Eaton Vance Corp.: Yeah, I certainly don't have numbers to share because we don't have any clear idea on how this is going to go. There are really two constraints on the growth of NextShares at UBS. One that I talked about is the one about products getting through their due diligence process and we think we're on the verge of a significantly \u2013 being in a significantly better position, meaning that several of the key strategies that we have strong hopes for in terms of sales potential. We expect to clear that due diligence process over the next month and that includes the Parametric floating rate strategy, I believe the \u2013 sorry, the Eaton Vance Floating Rate strategy. The Eaton Vance Oaktree Diversified Credit strategy, there's a Hartford Global Impact strategy that is managed by Wellington, that I know Hartford is pretty excited about and will be putting up some considerable market resources behind. So those are \u2013 we know those are close and we think that those products, plus things already available already through due diligence will be sufficient to get our sales force talking about NextShares and to get the sales force of Hartford and other firms that have NextShares represented, to have this be a key part of their focus within UBS and then we should see some sales results. In all cases, where a NextShares fund is offered alongside a similar strategy, the NextShares fund is less expensive both in terms of its expense ratio and in terms of its expected non-expense ratio, operating costs, so we expect to see better performance. Over time, we expect to see improved tax results of operating as exchange traded funds. So we think there's lots of reason for optimism, but it hasn't happened yet. The other thing that needs to happen to get a broader access at UBS and then ultimately to other places, within UBS today, we have access to the brokerage platform and one advisory program called Strategic Advisor. We do not have access to everything they do and that's for a technology reason. UBS is in middle of a pretty major technology upgrade where they're bringing in a new frontend system for their advisory platforms, and we have to fit the introduction of NextShares into the timing of that. And as that makes progress across UBS over the course of this year and as enhancements are made to that platform to incorporate NextShares, that further opens up the sales opportunity. But we're encouraged by our sales force's energy and enthusiasm and optimism that we can be successful here. We know other organizations similarly have sales forces that are very eager to get into UBS and start talking about NextShares. But as of this moment, we really don't have a lot to show for it, other than a lot of energy and a lot of excitement and a growing list of products that we think when you get in front of the right advisor and the right client, will prove to be quite compelling when offered as NextShares. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, thanks. Just a question on the flows, Tom, you mentioned, just how Eaton Vance is positioned in a rising rate backdrop and some of the products that are well-positioned. Just on the tax reform, any products that maybe you have seen demand, any shift there, I guess on a personal side the changes aren't as significant as the corporate side, but could you just \u2013 any change that you expect in some of the products that are tax efficient? Thomas E. Faust, Jr. - Eaton Vance Corp.: Yes, I think it's a little hard to say. I mean one thing that we speculated about during the quarter I think is probably everyone on the call is aware that, during November and December there was a proposal that would have \u2013 that was included in the Senate version of the bill that would have forced the use of FIFO, would have taken away taxpayers' ability to use so-called identified tax lot method and selecting the securities. And as people may know, that's an important part of the service offering of Parametric's Custom Core and related products offered by competitors, where you're trying to achieve returns that match a prescribed benchmark, but to exceed the returns on an after-tax basis through tax laws harvesting and other ongoing tax management techniques. We don't know this for a fact and can't confirm this, but we suspect that during the first quarter, our first fiscal quarter that is November-December period that there was a bit of a chilling of the market for those kinds of things just because there was so much focus and so much energy devoted to trying to figure out what was going to happen with the tax law and what that it implied for our clients and how these things would work, if the ability to use identified tax lot method went away. So one thing that we do see and that we can see it \u2013 we do expect and we see this somewhat in the numbers that we should see a month-to-month improvement in that business versus what we saw in the last couple of months of the year. We certainly saw an improving trend, January versus November and December in Parametric Custom Core, and also just for February that we've seen to-date that same trend has continued. So short-term, a positive tax reform in the way it turned out is taking away the uncertainty about whether or not this FIFO method was going to be required going forward. So that's the very short-term. Maybe on the longer term, I think the issue that perhaps you're focusing on is that, for high-income taxpayers in let's say coastal areas, certainly California and New York state, New York City as examples, tax rates didn't go down, they actually went up and that reflects both modest decreases in the top federal rate but importantly the loss of the federal deduction for state taxes paid or at least a limit on that. And we think over time, that will produce more demand for tax-managed equity strategies and also more demand for municipal income strategies in those markets. So we think investors are starting to figure this out. People tend to get most focused on taxes as we approach April 15 and certainly, we're using this time of year and the fact that there has been a change in the tax law as a catalyst to get in front of advisors to help them get their clients positioned appropriately for the new tax environment as it now exists. And historically, times of tax change almost regardless of the direction of change has been good for tax management and tax managed strategies, simply because it moves to the top of the mind of advisors and clients and changes in the tax law create new opportunities for potential tweaks to strategies that clients can use to enhance their returns. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good, that's helpful. And I just have a quick follow-up on Calvert. The progress there has been has been good. Just on, when we think about the growth going forward in the product offering, is it more demand by clients picking up as we see more and more interest in ESG, or is there more that you guys can be doing or are doing on the distribution front in terms of getting those products on platforms or new product offerings? Thomas E. Faust, Jr. - Eaton Vance Corp.: Yes, of course, those two are related. At firms where there is a major push relating to responsible investing, naturally it becomes easier to get strategies and funds onto platforms, so that has been a help, and we have seen some improvement there. I would say there may be three drivers of the growth of Calvert over the last year. The two you mentioned, which is general growing awareness and enthusiasm for responsible investing, that's one. Two, bringing the distribution resources of Eaton Vance to bear supporting Calvert. The third would be the investment performance component, which is that we have a number of high performing top rated funds under the Calvert banner, and that \u2013 as their performance has been strong, that drives flows in the same way that it does in other parts of the market. Perhaps there's somewhat less sensitivity among responsible investors to performance, but still performance matters in this space, and to the extent we have strong performance that affects flows. In fact, the top selling Calvert strategy has been their Emerging Markets Equity strategy, which no surprise it's been a very strong performer both in an absolute sense because emerging markets have been strong, but also particularly strong on a relative basis with a five-star rating by Morningstar. So we think we've got a long way to go. There are many opportunities, many different ways to apply Calvert's expertise in evaluating investments from an ESG perspective, their reputation as a leading brand and thought leader in this space. You may have seen a Barron's cover story two or three weeks ago that was ranking the 100 most responsible companies among public companies in the U.S. As noted in that article, that was all based on research done by Calvert. And so, there are \u2013 and also there was an article in Barron's this past week about different investors thinking differently about having gun manufacturers represented in their portfolios. The quote in that is from John Streur, CEO of Calvert. So they're very much \u2013 Calvert is very much in the conversation about responsible investing issues whether those be environmental issues, social issues or governance issues. And as these become increasingly important to a broader range of investors in the U.S., as they've long been in Europe, we expect that the value of this franchise for us to only grow. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Hi, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to make sure I heard this correct on the tax reform side, I think Laurie did you say or maybe just reiterate the tax rate guidance for fiscal 2019, and then I think you said the impact of the stock option expensing is not in that tax rate and will be adjusted out, is that correct? Laurie G. Hylton - Eaton Vance Corp.: Correct. So, yes, we gave the guidance for 2019 at roughly 25% to 25.5%, and that's taking out all the noise associated with the fact that this year we obviously only got 0.833% of the benefit of the tax reform, because of our fiscal year. And when we are going to be presenting our earnings and will also get the same reconciliation for our effective tax rate. Those \u2013 the number that I gave for next year for the 25% to 25.5% excludes any anticipated impact of the stock-based compensation in the new accounting guidance. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you, great. Thomas E. Faust, Jr. - Eaton Vance Corp.: So, Brian, we made the decision to exclude those adjustments in tax rate related to this new accounting guidance requiring these tax adjusted related to stock-based compensation plans to go through the income statement, probably for the reason that you're focusing on, which is both for modeling purposes and in terms of really thinking about the company's performance on a current basis, it's very hard to think about that as a measure of our current performance. What drives that in the short run is how does our stock do and how many employees choose to exercise options during a period, neither of which relates particularly to at least as I think about fundamentally how the business is doing. So we think we treat that both in the first quarter and planned on an ongoing basis as an adjustment to GAAP earnings. And then also, anything we're projecting in terms of future tax rates as Laurie said is backing that out or ignoring that both because we're not including it in adjusted earnings, but maybe more importantly because we don't really have any way of predicting either where our stock price is going to go or the rate at which employees are going to be exercising options. So it's kind of a necessary exclusion. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, that makes sense. And just I guess philosophically, I know you're still working on the game plan for what to do from the incremental contribution from tax reform. But I guess philosophically if we continue to have a mid-single digit through a better type of organic fee revenue growth with say normal market returns, should we still be thinking of the operating margin outlook as one that's benefiting from scaling the business, and so continuous operating margin improvement on an annual basis? And if I could squeeze one more in there, just the driver of the alternative fee rate increase, was that all from Global Macro Absolute Return? Laurie G. Hylton - Eaton Vance Corp.: Probably the easiest to answer is the second question, which is yes. It was Global Macro... Thomas E. Faust, Jr. - Eaton Vance Corp.: Yeah, that category is very dominated by that one strategy. Laurie G. Hylton - Eaton Vance Corp.: Yeah. Thomas E. Faust, Jr. - Eaton Vance Corp.: And Global Macro Absolute Return Advantage is the higher fee relative to the category average. Laurie G. Hylton - Eaton Vance Corp.: Right. And I think in terms of operating margin, I think we continue to have this conversation obviously, but we do believe that there is opportunity for margin expansion over time. I think it's just a function quite frankly of what our product mix looks like and ultimately what is happening with the business in terms of sales. And we've got quality problems when we had periods of high sales that drives up our incentive compensation. But I think \u2013 at this point, we are not anticipating any seismic shift in the way that we think about our operating model. So I wouldn't say that I would give you any guidance and we would see any significant changes. Thomas E. Faust, Jr. - Eaton Vance Corp.: But as I understand the question, I think there's a \u2013 you're trying to relate the tax law changes to operating margins or \u2013 and I think maybe under that is are we expecting to spend away a lot of the tax benefit which would have an adverse effect on margins, or do we expect to see that competed away, that benefit of the tax or tax rate to be competed away, I suppose in a way that would hurt our revenues rather than our expenses. But we are certainly not expecting to see a lot of increases in expenses for the reason that our taxes went down. Laurie did mention an increase in employee benefit, which is our annual employee matching, which is a relatively small item, but meaningful to our employees and also marginally meaningful in terms of our overall cost structure. No doubt there will be other things that we'll be doing, but I don't think we will be relating decisions we make about technology or other spending items to the fact that we're paying lower tax rate on our earnings in the U.S. going forward. And in terms of the market impact of this, we're already in a quite competitive business with certainly ongoing fee pressures, but I would say that incrementally there are significant numbers of players in our business that do not see a meaningful cut in their tax rate. Not everyone that manages assets is a corporate tax payer, which is of course a lot of where the benefit of the U.S. tax increase \u2013 U.S. tax cut fell. We were in a position to benefit more than most for the reason that we paid a higher tax rate and had more of our earnings in the U.S. than most of our competitors. But again, I don't think people will be cutting fees or becoming more aggressive in their competitive posture, simply because the tax rate in the U.S. went down. That might happen, but I don't think it will be for the reason that the tax rates are now lower than they were last year. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open. Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, guys, good afternoon. Just one quick one, thinking about M&A, please give us an update on your appetite right now to bring on new franchises, what asset classes, geographies are of interest, if any, and just any sense whether getting past tax reform with a little more market volatility here early this year, whether that's driving more sellers to explore other options? Thanks. Thomas E. Faust, Jr. - Eaton Vance Corp.: Yeah, so we're active in monitoring the acquisition market. I wouldn't say we're active in the acquisition market. Laurie and I field phone calls from investment bankers on a pretty regular basis. It feels like it's perhaps more of a seller's market than a buyer's market today, just based on what we hear as valuations on things that are out there. Thinking of ourselves more as a value buyer, that makes it perhaps less likely rather than more likely that we'll be stepping into major transactions this year. But we do monitor closely things that are happening. There are things that we've expressed interest in that invariably are going to go to other bidders that are perhaps willing to put a higher valuation or bid more aggressively or have more optimistic assumptions than we do. I think that's the way it should work. Acquisitions should go to the acquirer that provides the best fit and is willing to provide the highest valuation, in some cases, that will be in Vance. But in many cases, it will not be. So we look \u2013 we kick the tires a lot. Particular things that are interesting to us, we articulate our strategic priorities as including the one probably that fits best with an acquisition strategy is growing outside the United States, growing our global footprint. We're still, despite the accelerated growth we've seen in the last couple of years outside the United States, it still represents only about 7% of our revenues. So with the right cultural fit and at the right price, we would be interested in potentially doing an acquisition outside the United States. In terms of things here or specific asset classes, I don't \u2013 we don't feel like we have huge holes in our lineup. But certainly, we're interested in extending our reach into areas where we think we can compete effectively in investment strategies where we view alpha potential and also where we see a fit with our distribution capabilities and also with our investment culture. So we look, we talk and we certainly feel like we have the resources to be a significant player in this. And we talked about the financial flexibility we have as a result of our large cash and near cash position and our borrowing capabilities certainly. But we're not going to use that on a deal that we feel doesn't make sense for Eaton Vance. Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right, thanks Tom. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good afternoon now. In the past, you've been skeptical of nontransparent ETFs getting approval. I guess are you still skeptical and if the nontransparent ETFs are approved, to what extent do you think there will be effective competitors given the challenges you saw securing ETMF distribution and getting people kind of comfortable with the new structure? Thomas E. Faust, Jr. - Eaton Vance Corp.: Yes, thanks, Ken. I continue to be skeptical that some or all of the ideas that have been put before the SEC are ultimately approvable. And then beyond that, I'm skeptical that they will be widely applicable across asset classes. To my knowledge, essentially all of the proposals if not all the proposals are focused on U.S. equities. That's potentially a big market, but there are lots of other things outside of U.S. equities. But, there are a lot of issues for the SEC to consider not only how these things will trade, but more broadly are they successful in protecting the confidentiality of funds portfolio information, which is a key objective of these types of funds, and do they raise other securities law and related issues. So, yes, I continue to be skeptical that there will be broad approval of so-called nontransparent active ETFs. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great, thanks. And just quickly on Hexavest, you decided or noted to not exercise the option to buy more. Is Hexavest sort of now perpetually going to be a minority investment or is there opportunities in the future to kind of to reassess and maybe buy a greater stake? Thomas E. Faust, Jr. - Eaton Vance Corp.: Perpetually that seems like a long time to commit ourselves to, but there is \u2013 we have no option. This was a one-time option. We very much like our investment in Hexavest. But one of the things we like about it is the current ownership and governance model in which management, the people that run the company, the people that run the investment process, they own 51% and we own 49%. We are the distribution partner in all markets outside the United States. They distribute in Canada. They run the money. To us it seems like a better match after a lot of thought is for the team there to own 51% and us to own 49%. So that's where we've been. It's worked well. The business has grown under that structure. We like the way it works from a governance standpoint. And after much consideration, we concluded that we wanted to stay at 51%/49% as opposed to us move moving to a 75% position which was our option. Operator : And this concludes the Q&A session for the conference. I'd now like to turn it back to Dan Cataldo for closing remarks. Daniel C. Cataldo - Eaton Vance Corp.: Great, thank you all for joining us this morning. We appreciate your ongoing interest in Eaton Vance, and look forward to reporting back to you towards the end of May. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Amy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Eaton Vance Corp. Fiscal Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Laurie Hylton, Eaton Vance's Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Laurie Hylton : Good morning. And welcome to our fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings call and webcast. With me this morning are Tom Faust, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Eaton Vance; Dan Cataldo, our Chief Administrative Officer; and Eric Stein, our new Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations. As many of you are likely aware, Eric joined the Eaton Vance last month to replace Dan as Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations following Dan's promotion to Chief Administrative Officer upon the retirement of Jeff Beale. Welcome Eric and congratulations Dan on your new responsibility. In today\u2019s call, Tom and I will first comment on the quarter and then take your questions. The full earnings release and charts we will refer to during the call are available on our Web site, eatonvance.com, under the heading, Press Releases. Just a reminder, that today's presentation contains forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainties in our business, including but not limited to, those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings including our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K are available on our Web site or upon request at no charge. I'll now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Faust : Thank you, Laurie, and good morning everyone. Earlier today, Eaton Vance reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.77 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, which is up 24% from $0.62 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and down 1% from $0.78 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. For the first six months of fiscal 2018, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.54, an increase of 34% from $1.15 in the first half of fiscal 2017. Of the $0.39 per diluted share increase in first half adjusted earnings, $0.23 was attributable to growth in operating income, $0.12 is the net effective lower income taxes and the remaining $0.04 reflects the lower interest expense and other non-operating items. We ended the fiscal second quarter with $440.1 billion of consolidated assets under management, up 14% or $53.1 billion from a year earlier. The year-over-year increase in consolidated managed assets reflects net inflows of $28.6 billion and market price appreciation in managed assets of $24.5 billion. Consolidated assets under management declined 2% from the end of the fiscal 2018 first quarter, reflecting second quarter consolidated net inflows of $4.4 billion and $13.6 billion of market driven price declines in managed assets during the quarter. The $4.4 billion of consolidated net inflows in the second quarter equates to 4% annualized internal growth in managed assets. Excluding the $3.6 billion of net outflows from exposure management mandates, which are both lower fee and more volatile than the rest of our business, we had $8 billion of consolidated net inflows in the second quarter, an increase of 7% over last year\u2019s second quarter and up 43% from the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Reflecting strong inflows into a number of higher fee strategies, we generated annualized internal growth in consolidated management fee revenue of 7% in the second quarter, matching the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017 as the highest quarterly organic revenue growth rate we\u2019ve posted since we began reporting this metric a couple of years ago. As we define organic revenue growth is the change in our consolidated management fee revenue, resulting from that inflows and outflows, taking into account the fee rate applicable to each dollar in and out and excluding the impact of market action and acquisitions. By this measure, we believe Eaton Vance\u2019s among the fastest growing of U.S. listed public asset managers. A key contributor to our continuing strong internal growth is favorable investment performance. As shown on Page 14 of the call slides, at the end of April, 50% of our U.S. mutual fund assets were in funds ranking in the top cortile of the Morningstar category on a three year basis, and 55% of our U.S. mutual fund assets ranked in the top cortile among pure fund on a five year basis. We ended the second quarter with 67 U.S. mutual funds rated four or five stars by Morningstar, including 23 five star rated funds. As we highlighted last quarter, our second key contributor to our strong quarter results is the broad range of high-performing strategies we offer in investment areas, having particular appeal during periods of rising interest rates, such as we are now experiencing. These include our floating rate income, short duration fixed income and absolute return strategies. At the end of April, we had two floating rate bank owned funds, four short duration income funds and a global macro absolute return fund, all rated five stars by Morningstar. Each of these strategies is a current focus of our sales teams. Drawing down into our quarterly net flows by investment mandate, the three leading categories were floating rate income, fixed income and portfolio implementation, all with between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion in net inflows for the quarter. Within the floating rate loan category, second quarter net flows were well balanced between retail and institutional and between U.S. and non-U.S. clients. Japan remains our most important market for bank home mandates outside the U.S., and contributed significantly to second quarter net flows. Within fixed income, the largest flow contributor was the laddered bond separate accounts, which had $1.5 billion in net inflows during the quarter. Other leading contributors to fixed income category net inflows were high yield bonds, emerging market debt and short duration U.S. government inflation protected and strategic income mandates. On an overall basis, we grew fixed income across funds and separate accounts, and with both retail and institutional clients. In portfolio implementation, net flows in Parametric Custom Core separate accounts offered to retail and high net worth investors, continued to dominate the category, accounting for $2 billion to $2.2 billion total category net inflows in the second quarter. After a slowdown in the first fiscal quarter, likely relating to uncertainty about the new tax bill while it was being deliberated, net flows in the custom core mandates rebounded sharply in the second quarter, increasing by nearly 40% sequentially. As in other recent quarters, flows in our alternative asset category were driven by Global Macro Absolute Return mandates, which had net inflows for the quarter of just under $0.5 billion. Within equities, leading contributors to quarterly net inflows included EVM Growth, Parametric Defensive Equity, Calvert Emerging Markets and Calvert Responsible Index Funds. As previously mentioned, our exposure management business had net outflows of $3.6 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. This compares to net inflows of $5.4 billion in last year's second quarter and $1.5 billion of net inflows in this year's first quarter. As a reminder, this Parametric offering applies financial futures and other derivative instruments to help large institutional investors efficiently manage the equity, duration, currency and other market exposures within their portfolio with Parametric serving on either a discretionary or non-discretionary basis. The exposure management outflows we experienced in the second quarter reflect net withdrawals from client position on which we earn a management fee. Substantially, all of the net flow outflows are attributable to declining balances and continuing client accounts rather than loss of clients. Despite the volatility of this business contributes to our quarterly for reporting and fee rates averaging only 5 basis points annually, we continue to view exposure managements the core offering with solid profitability and good growth prospects. Having a strong exposure management franchise also helps us establish and maintain closer relationships with a client roaster that would be the envy of any asset manager. In many cases, Parametric client relationships that started with exposure management mandates, have migrated to also include other strategies. In recent investor communications, I\u2019ve talked about Eaton Vance\u2019s five strategic priorities for fiscal 2018, which are; capitalizing on our strong investment performance and favorable positioning to grow and active management; extending the success of our Parametric Custom Core and EVM bond laddered separate account franchises in specially passive and quasi-passive management; becoming a more global company; leveraging the Calvert acquisition we made at the end of 2016 to become a leader and responsible investing; and finally, positioning NextShares to become the vehicle of choice for U.S. investors and actively managed funds. Here's a brief progress report on each of those initiatives. As I mentioned earlier, we view our broad lineup of high performing funds and separate accounts and our leadership and investment strategies that are well positioned for it in environment of rising interest rates, as presenting significant opportunities to Eaton Vance to grow in active management, even as the overall market for active management continues to decline. Our confidence and the growth potential of our active strategies was born-out in the second quarter. During the quarter, net flows into our actively managed funds and accounts totaled $4.2 billion, equating to 8% annualized internal growth in managed assets. Based on results for the first three weeks of May and visible pipeline, we expect positive active strategy flows to continue in the third quarter. In the marketplace and internally, we sometimes refer to are Parametric Custom Core and EVM bond laddered separate account strategies offered to the retail and high net worth market as custom beta, these high value strategies to continue to demonstrate broad market appeal and significant growth. During the second quarter, net flows into our custom beta separate accounts totaled $3.5 billion. This equates to 18% annualized internal growth in custom beta managed assets. As with our actively managed strategies, results were made to-date and the pipeline of one not funded new business give us confidence that strong growth of our custom beta franchise will continue. Our business outside the United States remain significantly underdeveloped, representing only about 6% of our consolidated managed assets. Both in terms of globalizing our investment offerings and expanding our distribution reach outside the U.S., we continue to pursue growth opportunities. During the second quarter, net flows into funds and accounts managed for Eaton Vance clients outside the U.S. were $1.4 billion, which equates to 22% annualized internal growth and assets managed for non-U.S. clients. As we near the 17 month in our ownership of Calvert, we feel good about what we've accomplished and even better about the opportunities ahead of us to capitalize on Calvert's leading brand and leading expertise and responsible investing. While we are still in the early stages of repositioning Calvert beyond its historical roots in the U.S. retail market, Calvert branded strategy has generated just over $500 million of positive net flows in the second quarter, which equates to 14% annualized internal growth in managed assets. With a host of new business initiatives now in progress at Calvert and investor interest in responsible investing continuing to build, we are confidence that Calvert's best growth lies ahead. Finally, with NextShares, our focus continues to be on achieving commercial success for our distribution relationship with UBS, and using that success as a springboard to gain broader distribution reach and entering into licensing arrangements with more fund sponsors. There are currently 17 NextShares funds from eight fund families listed from market trading, including those from six unaffiliated fund groups; Brandis, Causeway, Gabelli, Hartford, Ryan Hart, and Allen Ried. About half of those 17 funds are currently available for purchase at UBS with the balance working their way through UBS\u2019s due diligence. Sales today at UBS have been modest with it just beginning to open as more funds cleared due diligence, more advisors complete required product training and more wholesale retention gets devoted to NextShares. In the long journey to commercialize NextShares the coming 12 months will be pivotal. We now have an initial range of approved NextShares funds, and a major distribution partner committed to working with us to bring these funds to market. Now it's the time to begin translating that potential into sales success. In closing, these continue to be good times at Eaton Vance. Our business has strong current momentum, driven by high performing investment franchises well positioned for the current market environment, a range of specialty offerings with the broad and growing market appeal and strong distribution and client service. Longer term, we believe that Eaton Vance is a culture, inheriting the capital structure distinctively supportive of continued business success as the management industry evolves. That concludes my remarks. And I'll now turn the call over to Laurie. Laurie Hylton : Thank you, and again good morning. As Tom mentioned, we\u2019re reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.77 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 24% from $0.62 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, down 1% from $0.78 of adjusted earnings per diluted share reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Second quarter\u2019s seasonal factors, primarily reflected three fewer fee days and three fewer payroll days in the quarter, reduced earnings by approximately $0.02 per diluted share sequentially. As you can see in attachment two to our press release, adjusted earnings trailed GAAP earnings by a penny per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 to reflect the reversal of $1.9 million of net excess tax benefits recognized from the exercise of employee stock option, investing of restricted stock awards during the period. Adjusted earnings per diluted share matched GAAP earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and exceeded GAAP earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 by $0.15 per diluted share, reflecting the impact of tax law changes, a newly adopted accounting standard addressing the treatment of stock-based compensation and the expiration of the Company's options to acquire an additional 26% ownership interest in our 49% owned affiliate tax vest. Our operating income in the second quarter fiscal 2018 was up 13% from the second quarter of fiscal 2017, down 2% sequentially. Our operating margin was 32% in the second quarter fiscal 2018 versus 31.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and 32.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Operating margin for the first six months of the fiscal year improved from 30.6% in 2017 to 32.1% in 2018. Ending consolidated managed assets of $440.1 billion at April 30, 2018 were up 14% year-over-year, driven by strong net flows and positive market returns, and down 2% sequentially, primarily reflecting market price declines in February and March, partially offset by strong net inflows. Average managed assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 17% from the second quarter fiscal 2017, driving 11% increase in revenue. Revenue growth trails growth in average managed assets year-over-year, primarily due to the decline in our average annual life management fee rate from 34.7 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to 33.3 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. This decline in our average annualized management fee rate is primarily attributable to outsized growth of our lower fee portfolio implementation and bond ladder businesses. Our average managed assets for the second quarter were up 2% from the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Second quarter revenue was down 2%, reflecting the impact of three fewer fee days in the second quarter and a modest decrease in our average annualized management fee rate. The sequential decline in our average annualized management fee rate from 33.7 basis points to 33.3 basis points primarily reflects the continuing shift in our business mix, driven by strong net flows into our lower fee portfolio implementation and bond ladder businesses. Strong net inflows into several higher fee strategies in the second quarter helped mitigate the mix driven fee rate decline. Performance fees, which are excluded from the calculation from our average management fee rates, reduced earnings by $0.5 million in both the second and first quarters of fiscal 2018, and were negligible in the second fiscal 2017. Tom noted, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, our annualized internal growth and management fee revenue of 7% outpaced our annualized internal growth and managed assets of 4%, primarily reflecting the impact of net inflows into higher fee strategies during the quarter. This compares to 7% annualized income growth in management fee revenue on 14% annualized internal growth in managed assets in the second quarter fiscal 2017. A 5% annualized internal growth in management fee revenue on 7% annualized growth in management in managed assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Based on current sales trends and the visible pipeline of pending flows, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to achieve positive organic growth in management fee revenue over the balance of fiscal 2018. Turning to expenses, competition expense increased by 9% from the second quarter of fiscal 2017, reflecting higher headcount, year-end increases in base salaries, increases in our corporate 401(k) match and other benefit costs, increases in operating income and performance based bonus accruals and higher stock based compensation, partially offset by a decrease in sales based incentive compensation. Sequentially, compensation expense decreased by 5% from the first quarter fiscal 2018, reflecting lower stock-based compensation, a decrease in operating income based bonus accruals, lower sales based incentive compensation and a decrease in base compensation, driven by fewer payroll days in the second fiscal quarter. Non-compensation distribution related costs, including distribution and service fees and the amortization of deferred sales commission, increased 4% from the same quarter a year ago, and decreased 3% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher marketing and promotion cost, higher commission and amortization for private fund and increases in intermediary marketing support payments, mainly driven by higher average managed assets. The sequential quarterly decrease primarily reflects reduced intermediately marketing support payments and lower distribution and service fees, driven primarily by lower average managed assets and share classes that are subject to these fees and the impact of three fewer fee days in the second quarter. Fund related expenses increased 29% and 3% versus the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and the first quarter of fiscal 2018 respectively, primarily reflecting increases in fund subsidy accruals and higher sub advisory fees paid. Other operating expenses increased 14% and 10% versus the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and the first quarter of fiscal 2018 respectively, primarily reflecting increases in information technology spending, as well as higher facility, professional services and travel expenses. We continue to spend approximately $2 million per quarter in connection with our NextShare initiative. Net gains and other investment income on seed capital investments contributed a penny and $0.02 for earnings per diluted share in the second quarters of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 respectively, and were negligible in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. When quantifying the impact of our seed capital investments on earnings each quarter, we take into consideration our pro rata shares of gains, losses and other investment income earned on investments in sponsor strategies, whether accounted for as consolidated funds, separate accounts or equity method investments, as well as the gains and losses recognized on derivatives used to hedge these investments, within the per share impact, net of income taxes and net income attributable to non-controlling interest. We continue to hedge the market exposures of our seed capital portfolio to the extent practicable to minimize the associated earnings volatility. Net gains and other investment income in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 included $6.5 million charge to reflect the expiration of the Company's option to acquire an additional 26% ownership interest in Hexavest under the terms of the option agreement entered into when we acquired our initial 49% ownership interest in 2012. We excluded this one time charge from our calculation of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter. Consolidate CLO activity contributed $800,000 and $1.6 million to non-operating income in the second and first quarters of fiscal 2018 -- second and first quarters of fiscal 2018 respectively. Turning to taxes, our effective tax rate for the second quarter fiscal 2018 was 26.7% versus 37.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and 36.3% in the first quarter in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company's effective tax rate for the second and first quarters of fiscal 2018 reflect net excess tax benefits of $1.9 million and $11.9 million respectively related to the exercise of stock options investing of restricted stock awards during those periods. New accounting guidance adopted in the first quarter requires these net excess tax benefits to be recognized in earnings. The Company's income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 also included a non-recurring charge of $24.7 million to reflect the estimated effect of U.S. federal tax law changes enacted in the first quarter. As noted previously, our calculations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share remove the effect the net excess tax benefits recognized in the second and first quarters in connection with the new accounting guidance and the non-recurring impact of the tax reform recognized in the first quarter. On this basis, our adjusted effective tax rate was 28.2% and 26.7% in the second and first quarters of fiscal 2018 respectively. On the same adjusted basis, we estimate that our quarterly effective tax rate for the balance of fiscal 2018 and the fiscal year as a whole will range between 27.5% and 28%, and our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate will range between 25.3% and 25.8%. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we used $36.2 million of corporate cash to pay quarterly dividends and $0.31 per share -- of $0.31 per share, and repurchased 1.3 million of shares of non-voting common stock for approximately $73.1 million. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $123.8 million, up 7% year-over-year and substantially unchanged from the first quarter. We finished our second fiscal quarter holding $791.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term debt security and approximately $369 million in seed capital investments, and with outstanding debt obligations of $625 million. We continue to place high priority on using the Company's cash flow to benefit shareholders. Even as we support strong business growth, we maintain significant financial flexibility. This concludes our prepared comments. At this point, we'd like to take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous. Your line is open. Patrick Davitt : The fee rate, particularly in floating rate, came down a little bit more than we would have expected. Are there any timing issues around when flows came in and out, or is there anything you want to that you would point out? And in particular, is there a mix shift within the floating rate bucket driving that to come down so much? Tom Faust : The main thing going on, I believe, during the quarter was continued growth on the institutional side of the business, which has for us and for market generally, has lower fee rate than in our recent product. So you'll see that rate bounce around, primarily reflecting mix of retail and institutional. I talked about -- we had good growth offshore in the second quarter and that largely was in bank loans and that was largely institutional. So hope that gives you a little flavor. Patrick Davitt : And then on the pipeline commentary, I appreciate that. Could you maybe scale that relative to last quarter and this point last year? Tom Faust : So that's on pipeline on our business generally or on specific\u2026 Patrick Davitt : I think -- you're talking about\u2026 Tom Faust : I don't have that on my fingertips, I don't recall where that was last quarter versus -- or the year ago quarter. We're looking at for the quarter on the order of $3 billion or so of net flows for which we see a visible pipeline. Understand that includes a mix of both active and passive businesses, and a fair bid of that is Parametric business, including that exposure management where we do expect net inflows. But I would say on an overall basis, the pipeline is robust. We've got multi-hundred million dollar visibility and to growth macro absolute return franchises, Parametric emerging markets, high yield bond, custom core the sense of equity and exposure management. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott : This is Geoff filling for Mike, thanks for taking our question. So just looking at the $800 million of cash and equivalent in the short term investments. How much of that would you say is free to return versus tied up due to regulatory other needs? And then maybe longer term is there a total payout ratio that you typically target? Tom Faust : Well, we don\u2019t have in our precise number on what cash tied up in regulatory. But we can -- feel like we can comfortably run the business with $200 million in cash. It's probably something close to 100 that would be tied up due to regulatory\u2026 Eric Stein : Included within that 200. Tom Faust : Exactly, yes. The second part of your question was? Geoffrey Elliott : So I think on the total payout ratio over the long term\u2026 Tom Faust : Yes, it's certainly something we look at each year when we review our dividend for the upcoming 12 months, and that typically is done mid-October. So it\u2019s definitely something we consider in addition to cash needs to support the growth of the business. Eric Stein : And I would say that on an overall basis long-term it\u2019s 100%, we have no other reason for being then to earn cash and cash flow for our shareholders, and returning that to shareholders either through dividends or stock repurchases, are certainly long-term goal and strategy and consistent with the history of the Company. The fact that we\u2019ve seen a buildup in cash over the last several quarters doesn't reflect the change in that philosophy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Bill Katz : Question for you just in terms of flows, and appreciate the last comments, so seeing across the range of the platform. Could you fill in maybe one level deeper and give us a sense of maybe where you\u2019re seeing the volumes coming from? Is it from other place with lesser performance, or is there any mix shift that you\u2019re seeing in terms of allocations whether it\u2019d be on that retail gatekeeper side or on the institutional consultant side? Tom Faust : Maybe it would be helpful to break that down. It will vary between our active and more passive businesses just starting with the active businesses. And in bank loans, we\u2019re benefiting from two things; one is bank loans have been an asset class that has attracted significant flows, relating to expectations and the reality of rising interest rate; and then second among the bank loan mangers not surprisingly, given our performance, we\u2019ve been gaining market share. So it\u2019s really a combination there of both and expanding category, which reflects cyclical factors maybe some secular growth there as well, plus a relatively strong performance profile for Eaton Vance. I would also highlight absolute return strategies in particular global macro absolute return, which again benefits from the cyclical phenomenon of investors looking to diverse so far away from fixed income and duration risk into a less correlated or non-correlated strategy that invest primarily in emerging market currencies and debt instruments of a short-term duration nature. There I think we\u2019re probably also gaining market share where in Morningstar categorizes us in non-traditional bonds in that strategy. And relative to that category, we\u2019ve noticeably gained market share over the last few quarters. The same generally would apply to other short-term income strategies. We have a short duration government fund that\u2019s in inflows. We have a short duration strategic income fund that\u2019s in net inflows. We have a short duration inflation protected fund that\u2019s in net inflows. In all those cases, we have strong performance. I believe those are all five star rated funds and also these are in categories position to benefit from investors looking for ways to diversify their duration exposure to reduce their duration exposure within fixed income. On the more passive side of our business, this is primarily what we call custom beta. We\u2019re benefiting from a couple of things there. One is on the equity side, this is primarily offering our customized index-based separate accounts as alternatives to index ETFs and indexed mutual funds where the benefit is -- the benefit of a customized exposure, which allows people to reflect responsible investing criteria or other portfolio of tilts that they desire. And also the better tax treatment of holding individual securities as opposed to holding those same investments through a fund. The primary advantages being two; one the ability to fund positions in time without having to sell and realize the taxable gain; and two, the ability to harvest and pass through on a current basis, the value of realized capital losses, which in a fund context are trapped inside the vehicle. On the fixed income side, our laddered, muni and corporate bond separate accounts, these are so primarily into broker dealer channels and there this is a way to feed into and benefit from migration of business from brokerage accounts to advisory relationships, particularly within fixed income and especially within the laddered bond accounts. We have been the market leader in this. We think we have industry leading relationships, industry leading performance characteristics and industry leading service level. So in all of these things, I\u2019d say Bill, it's hard to break it out between market developments and share developments. We have good data on the fund side of our business, not very good data in terms of market share outside of funds. But on overall basis, we feel like we're both gaining market share in key categories for us, but also benefiting from some fairly significant market trends that are pushing business into areas that we care most about, such as short duration or floating rate income and such as things like our custom beta strategies. Bill Katz : And then maybe a follow-up for Laurie, I may ask this question quarter-after-quarters, I do apologize for the repetition of it. Can you give us a sense of how you\u2019re thinking about margins from here? And I am trying to understand interplay now it looks like great comp leverage within the other line little bit sequentially. So you look out into the second half of this year or maybe longer term. Do you still think you can drive some operating leverage? And maybe is the way to think about on the incremental margin, just trying to get a sense of how much incremental room there might be for margins to move higher here quickly given the great growth? Laurie Hylton : In terms of looking out, I would love to have a crystal ball and tell you that I've got great visibility going out into 2019. But I think that would be an overestimation of our forecasting skills at this point. But I think that as we look ahead to the next couple of quarters, I would anticipate that we will be in this range. I do continue to think that we've got operating leverage opportunity. But I would not anticipate -- obviously, March and February, were both really tough months. From a market perspective, there was lot of volatility and it really hurt us in terms of what we lost to market -- lost to assets due to market. So that create a little bit of a headwind that we're coming out of now. But if we get some really nice market, that's going to be helpful. We could see a little bit more leverage. But otherwise, I would anticipate we're going to be in this range, maybe modestly up another 50 basis points. But I wouldn't anticipate we\u2019re suddenly going to see a screaming run on our operating margin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Your line is open. Daniel Fannon : I guess, just to follow up on that last question. Can you talk maybe about the differences in the profitability or the scalability of certain of your businesses? So if we think about, we know the fee rates but the exposure management how we think about that or this in terms of incremental margin, how you want to characterize it versus say your traditional fund business? Tom Faust : It's important to make sure, we're talking about the same thing, we're talking about margins. So just to be clear, we're talking about operating income as a percentage of revenue not operating income expressed in basis points on assets. So expressed in basis points on assets we make significantly less on exposure management because we clear with 5 basis points not starting with 30 or 50 or 75 on some of our mandates. In terms of margin profitability per dollar of revenue, that's a very good business. It's probably approaching the corporate average. It's not substantially below this is a scale of business very efficiently run. A portfolio manager and implementation business doesn't command the same compensation level as a portfolio manager does in a stock or bond picking business. It is highly scale dependent and we have a large scale there and it's entirely systems dependent. And we have excellent systems to support that business. So it's while though, say it's not particularly the margin, I don't think we would say it's higher than our average margin, but it's in the range of most of our businesses. If you look across our businesses, the key driver of profitability is scale. If you look at things like bank loans, where we've got a very large business. we have higher profitability. And things that we do in limited scale either because we're trying to grow the business or hope brings eternal and we're hanging on. Those kind of businesses have lower margin. So big picture our approach to growing the profits of Eaton Vance is developing and cultivating through scale a range of market leading franchises. And typically the bigger the franchise both the easier it is to sell all else being equal and the more profitable it is from a margin perspective again all else being equal. So the goal is always is to build scale to the extent reasonable and to the extent we still have the ability to manage money flexibly and efficiently at that scale. But the goal is to build scale across franchises and if you want to know relative levels of profitability of our business starting with revenues is probably a good place to look. And things that we have good revenues in, we tend to have good margins in. And things that we're trying to build revenue we don't tend to have attractive margins. This is fundamentally a people business, it takes a certain amount of people to run any kind of investment business, the more assets you manage the more revenues you generate likely the higher the fee is going to be from that business. And that holds pretty true across the board in our business. Daniel Fannon : Thanks that's helpful. And I guess just another question around M&A you guys have been successful and deploying capital and adding on businesses. I guess at this point of the cycle, how do you think about M&A in terms of that versus repurchasing your own stock or other capital return methods? Tom Faust : We certainly look, there have been some transactions that have happened to our business. We think asset management is right for consolidation. We think Eaton Vance has many of the characteristics of a successful acquire, including as you point out having a record, having done this successfully in the past and a fair bit of financial flexibility to allow us to finance a transaction. We're particular about what we might acquire. While in the past, we've been successful in growing our business and expanding our footprint within asset management through acquisitions. We are also mindful that this is a fairly hazardous business going out and buying someone else's asset management business and inheriting their culture and inheriting there people. So we wanted to do it very carefully. We are price-sensitive, we don't tend to win auctions, because really we're going to put the highest valuation on a business. But we do think that that we bring a lot to offer here and we do devote a fair bit of attention to at least thinking about that. So I think we it's not a large team, its mostly Laurie and myself and other people in the finance group. This is not a significant activity for people in our sales organization or people in our investment or admin group. But in terms of the senior levels of legal and finance and general business we do look a fair bit at things that might be of interest. I would put the kind of things that are possibly of interest to us into three or four categories. One that would be consistent with things that we've done in the past are what I'll call both on acquisitions where we had distribution firepower, we brought on our business mix and helped our business grow to scale, adding more distribution resources than that company could likely afford to do on their own. That's been our traditional growth path. We have also looked at acquisitions that would expand our footprint graphically, only about 6% of our assets today are outside the United States. We think there could be opportunities for us to accelerate the growth of our business outside the United States through transactions that involve cross-border linkups. And then finally there are the scale type transactions that involve both opportunities for revenue synergies, but also cost synergies and those are if done at scale significantly riskier in a financial sense and in a corporate culture sense, but we also certainly kick the tires on those. Again we do believe there should be and there will be consolidation in our business and we want to participate that and that at least at a level of looking and if the fit is right and if we put the highest value on something. It's possible that will be active there as well. Operator : Our next question from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Brian Bedell : I just want to come back to the fee rates, I think you explained the floating rate is moving towards the institutional from a mix shift and then quickly if I'm wrong I think you mentioned also in the fixed income the [lettered] bond portfolios shift towards that being lower fee rates that impacted that? If you can -- Craig if I am wrong enough and then also if you can comment on the equities bucket and the portfolio implementation in terms of the fee rates declines and that, is that a good run rate start into coming into the second quarter or do you think the mix would go back the other way? Eric Stein : Yeah, I think you're right in your observation. Certainly starting on fixed income, I think we highlighted in the call facts that we had a $1.5 billion of net inflows within fixed income that were ladder separate accounts that's 15-16 basis points business as that grows, that tends to pull down the average fee rate in the fixed income category. So that's the primary driver of that category. So you see, I'm looking in our press release, attachment 10. So the biggest year over year decline was in fixed income where fee rates went down 7% from 38.5% to 35.8% . Again, that primarily reflects the strong growth of our ladder separate account business is that if the rates in the 15 to 16 basis point range.  Floating rate income, I think we already talked about that. Alternatives which went the other way. We have a global macro absolute return advantage strategy that is at a higher fee rate, that and its sister fund, call macro absolute return, really dominate that alternatives category, both in terms of assets inflows and because the mix of flows have been skewed towards the higher fee advantage version of that strategy, you've seen that 9% pickup in average fee rates year over year in the alternative category. Equities, that's also primarily mix shift among the fastest growing equity strategies we offer are what we call defensive equity or volatility risk premium strategies, which are Parametric offerings using a derivatives, primarily there's a permanently call selling strategies, fast growth contributing there, there are also other strategies in the equity group and higher fee rates that have been growing but unbalanced, that fee decline reflects primarily mixed with faster growth of these options based -- rules based option strategies offered by parametric.  Within portfolio implementation, not exactly sure, that -- some of that might be mix, some of that is also we've grown with the client relationships where they have more pricing power and so fees on some business has been is coming at lower price points where it's a competitive situation, I would say generally, we view our business as, if you take out mix and look at pricing within existing mandates, something like 1% annual declines just based on fee concessions and break points built into fee schedules is part of our business.  I've been here 33 years and I can't remember ever raising prices on any of our strategies over that period, I might be missing something. But generally the nature of our business is that fee rates go down within mandates as they grow out to scale. And that trend is certainly present here, still pretty modest, something like 1% of that 4% year-over-year decline in average fee rates is true price declines with the balance representing a mix of faster growth of all three businesses than in higher fee businesses generally. Brian Bedell : And then I guess just on the -- I think I heard you say $3 billion and I wasn't sure if that was what you were indicating as the pipeline for through the outlook as you went through that for the quarter that we're currently in. And if you could just verify that? And then also talk about what's going on in the broker dealer channel obviously the platform consolidation? How you are faring in market share there and is portfolio implementation also part of that in terms of when mandates within broker dealer channels? Eric Stein : Yeah, so just to clarify. The number I gave that $3 billion number that's we have a weekly pipeline report of one not funded new business doesn't always happen, but these are as best our sales team can determine. Commitments that clients have made to hire us for new business things that we expect to fund over the coming period. Over the balance of the second quarter, which is going through -- balance of the third quarter which is going through the end of July as I mentioned, it's not only about $3 billion of pending pipeline and that includes about a $1 billion or so of Parametric exposure management and $2 billion of a range of other generally higher fee strategies. So I think that answers that first part. In terms of the impact on platform, broker dealer platform consolidation. We're winning some of [indiscernible]. So we're seeing some of our strategies getting -- taking all availability for current sale in broker dealer channels as they win or down the number of funds they offer. If you have a small fund it's pretty hard to justify the continuing existence of that if flows have not been strong. And we're not immune to that. We're seeing some of our funds being removed from platforms. When that happens I understand that doesn't mean the assets go away, typically those -- the assets stay on the books, though new sales are no longer permitted. There is the possibility for things that have been taken off the platform to come back on if there is advisor demand. We had -- during this quarter, we had and at least wanted to make -- broker dealers we had a case where several smaller Calvert strategies were taken off platform but then added back once they figured out that they have a large corporate initiative to support responsible investing and that these were leading high performing funds in those categories that do have growth potential as those responsible strategies grow. In terms of our non-fund business, our separate accounts including the implementation business the Parametric custom core. I don't think there's has been a lot of impact -- there is not a lot of impact on us of consolidation of offerings. I think that's largely been not fund phenomenon not a separate account phenomenon. And that's a legacy of days going back decades when large broker dealers potentially made all funds available. The separate account business -- the retail manage account business is a newer business and that was never really the way that business operated. Brian Bedell : Great, I mean that there are few there potentially gain share in the portfolio implementation process as other funds are cut from the platform? Tom Faust : That's absolutely right, we're positioned to grow our business in portfolio implementation generally as money moves from active to passive and quasi passive. We just picked up a custom core availability in single contract in the last of the major warehouse broker-dealers. So we have got full coverage now for both single contracts into a contract across the landscape of the warehouses that just happened in the last two weeks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Glenn Schorr : Similar to one of the previous questions I'm curious with all this growth and reasonable operating leverage, just thoughts on the share count going forward, I think we're up 7% year-over-year? Laurie Hylton : I think that we kind of have a very slightly more opportunistic and systematic share repurchase program. We're fairly heavy users or stock based compensation. We recognize that put the pressure on our diluted share count. But we really think about our share repurchase program in terms of our total capital management strategy and address that on a quarterly basis. And this quarter we did mean in, we repurchased what was $73 million worth of stock this quarter, and hopefully that will be helpful as we look at our share count for next quarter. But I don't have guidance to give in terms of what we anticipate we will do throughout the rest of the year outside of saying that we would certainly anticipate that we will be active in the market and that we do view share repurchase as a significant tool in our quiver as we think about ways that we can return value to shareholders. Glenn Schorr : Okay. And then if I could just get a follow up comment or clarity on the comment you made earlier on exposure management a product of declining client balances not clients leaving, is that just if you can think of it as run off of previous money less that you guys are just going to run this course is that the comment? Tom Faust : Let me again just explain again what this business is. So, imagine your large institutional investor with a couple billion dollars that you have placed with a number of different outside managers. So your pension fund or endowment or foundation. One application of parametric exposure management is to equatize the cash that exists within your different accounts held with different managers. So if you're actual cash in those portfolios is 3.5% and your target cash is 50 basis points you would hire Parametric to take long equity exposure implemented through futures equal to 3% of that billion dollar portfolio. We built on the basis of the amount of exposures outstanding. So if that client moves around. So let's say they either move their actual cash up or down from 3.5% or they move their target cash up or down from half a percent depending on the relationship between those two, the amount of balances on which we earn the management fee will go up or down in a particular quarter. We've tried and pushed down the management of that Parametric business to help us model, does it in some way relate to what's going on in the market, either in terms of market strength or weakness or high volatility or low volatility. And it turns out there aren't great correlations with what we report as flows in this business, to any of those market factors. We have some pretty large clients in there, where a 1% or 2% change in their target cash or how they're using parametric disclosure management can have a meaningful flow impact on us. In this particular quarter, we were in a period where large clients on balance, we're in a position of reducing their exposures. We continue to look at this business long-term as a growing business. We didn't lose clients or at least not any meaningful numbers of clients in the quarter. It's just that for reasons outside of our control and unfortunately outside of our ability to forecast during this particular period we had more clients take off positions then we had a put on positions. So, I have no reason to think that next quarter will be a repeat of this and the vast majority of quarters we've grown this business, both in terms of number of clients and in terms of average exposures with those clients, the best measure of success in our business -- in this business is primarily number of client relationships and that's grown steadily over time. How clients use this and extent to which they use this, is to some degree a function of the range of our services but it's also very much also a function of how they're positioning their portfolios. Do they have a lot of excess cash that they're looking to monetize, are they using futures to add or subtract duration, are they using futures to add or subtract currency exposure? All of these things will impact the extent of our net positions in this business and all of these will impact our revenues and flows from this business. So it's a little messy, it doesn't lend itself to forecasting in quite the same way as the balance of our business. But as I said in my prepared remarks -- despite low fees and despite some volatility of flows, we continue to regard this as an excellent business, nicely profitable, growing and also providing very deep important relationships with major institutions that have been very helpful to us across the Parametric business and thinking about and realizing a growth and other things that Parametric does. Glenn Schorr : I totally appreciate all that Tom. The only follow up I had is, if the foundation of this is to put idle cash to work and to eliminate cash drag even if it's temporary. As rates rise, does that start to just become a bigger drag or a competitor to the product in and of itself? Tom Faust : Maybe, I would guess that, really it's -- so it's -- how do you think about cash in your target allocations. Most institutions that I'm close to aren't targeting the allocations to cash because even though cash returns have come up, they're still significantly below longer term either equity or fixed income assets. And most institutions take the view that they can't afford to have a lot of assets sitting around earning very little. I think you're right in that, with rates around 1% there is a little less pressure than there was at rates at zero. But whether that's enough to impact institutions and how they think about cash I don't really know. I think if rates were 8% or cash rates were 8% and people were despondent about the return potential of longer term financial assets, we wouldn't be equitizing cash, but we might also be synthetically taking off equity or income exposure because this doesn't only work one way. One of the beauties of derivatives is it gives the flexibility to not only equitize cash but also to change equity exposures up or down or from emerging markets to developed markets and vice versa and but also to add and subtract duration currency exposure commodity exposure, et cetera. These are very powerful tools that can be used for lots of portfolio reasons. And we're optimistic certainly that as the push for return grows, that people will look to manage their portfolios more efficiently and these are ultimately tools for enhancing portfolio efficiency by allowing managers to more precisely target their asset allocations on a very tactical basis if that's what demands they want to do, without disturbing relationships with underlying managers. So we think this business is here to stay. Whether it's marginally less attractive at higher interest rates, I think there is a case can be made for that, but I would say that there are I would guess bigger factors likely that overwhelm that just in terms of the other flexibility of this service offering what we can do for clients beyond just equitizing cash. Operator : And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Hylton for any closing remarks. Laurie Hylton : We just want to thank you for joining us this afternoon. And we look forward to catching up with everybody again when we release our third quarter results in August. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Eric Senay, you may begin your conference. Eric Senay : Thank you very much. Good morning and welcome to our Fiscal 2018 Third Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. With me this morning are Tom Faust, Chairman and CEO of Eaton Vance, and Laurie Hylton, our CFO. In today's call, we will first comment on the quarter and then take your questions. The full earnings release and charts we will refer to during the call are available on our Web-site, eatonvance.com, under the heading, Press Releases. Just a reminder, that today's presentation contains forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainty in our business, including, but not limited to, those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings, including our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, are available on our Web-site or upon request at no charge. I will now turn the call over to Tom. Thomas E. Faust Jr.: Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Eric. Earlier today Eaton Vance reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.82 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. That's up 32% from $0.62 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of last year and up 6% from $0.77 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The 32% year-over-year increase in fiscal third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share reflects 9% higher revenue and an increase in adjusted operating margins from 31.6% to 33.0% and a decline in our adjusted effective income tax rate from 36.9% to 27.1%. We ended the fiscal third quarter with $453.2 billion of consolidated assets under management. That's an increase of 12% from a year earlier. The year-over-year increase reflects net inflows of $23.2 billion and market price appreciation of $24.4 billion. In the third quarter, the Company set new highs in terms of quarterly revenue and earnings and ending consolidated assets under management. During the third quarter, Eaton Vance had consolidated net inflows of $3.7 billion, which equates to annualized internal growth in managed assets of 3%. Excluding exposure management, which has lower fees and more volatile flows than the rest of our business, we saw net inflows of $7.4 billion and 4% annualized internal growth in managed assets in the third quarter. Looking at our organic growth from a revenue perspective, in the third quarter we generated annualized internal growth in consolidated management fee revenue of 5%. Our calculation of organic revenue growth measures the change in consolidated management fee revenue resulting from net inflows and outflows, taking into account the fee rate applicable to each dollar in and out and excluding the impact of market action, adjustments in the fee rates of continuing managed assets, and any acquisitions of managed assets. By this measure, we believe Eaton Vance continues to rank among the fastest growers in the asset management industry. The key contributor to our continuing strong internal growth is favorable investment performance. As shown on Slide 14 of the Webcast slides, of our mutual fund assets at the end of July, 47% were in funds ranking in the top quartile of their Morningstar category on a three-year basis, 59% in the top quartile on a five-year basis, and 44% top quartile over 10 years. We ended the third quarter with 24 U.S. mutual funds rated five stars by Morningstar for at least one class of shares. During a period in which net demand for active strategies has narrowed, we are fortunate to have high performing funds across a broad range of asset classes. As we highlighted last quarter, a second key contributor to our strong quarter results is the range of top-performing strategies we offer in investment areas having particular appeal during periods of rising interest rates, such as we are now experiencing. Consistent with the prior quarter, in the third quarter we had positive net flows across all our investment mandate categories except exposure management. Leading the way was portfolio implementation with net inflows of $3.1 billion. Growth in this category continues to be driven by Parametric Custom Core equity separate accounts which compete against index funds and ETFs on the basis of enhanced tax efficiency and the ability to customize account holdings to reflect client-determined responsible investment criteria and other specified portfolio tilts and exclusions. Parametric continues to be the market leader in what is commonly referred to as custom indexing. Within Custom Core, in the third quarter Parametric grew in both tax-managed and non-tax-managed applications and across retail, high-net-worth, and institutional markets. In fixed income, we had $2.7 billion of net inflows in the third quarter. Within this category, the largest contributor was laddered bond separate accounts with $1.7 billion of net inflows. Other leading contributors included high-yield bonds with net inflows of $360 million and mortgage-backed securities with net inflows of $340 million. Among our line-up of fixed income mutual funds, those positioned to short-duration, short-term, ultra-short, or floating-rate municipal, contributed nearly $550 million of net inflows, led by the five-star rated Eaton Vance Short Duration Government Income Fund. Launched in 2002, Short Duration Government Income recently surpassed $1 billion in net assets and now ranks as one of our top-selling funds. In the third quarter, net inflows in the Eaton Vance floating-rate bank loan mandates totaled $950 million. Continuing strong net inflows into our industry-leading line-up of floating-rate U.S. mutual funds were partially offset by net withdrawals by institutional investors, primarily from clients located outside the U.S. While some commentators have recently expressed concerns about a potential decline in bank loan market credit conditions, our team remains sanguine believing that there are attractive return prospects available in loans today. Within equities, third quarter net inflows of just under $500 million were led by EVM growth, Parametric defensive equity and Calvert emerging markets mandates, with Parametric Emerging Markets Strategies accounting for the bulk of net outflows. With our top-performing Eaton Vance Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap Fund now closed to new investors and net demand across most active equity categories remaining quite muted, we are finding that our best opportunities to grow in equities are in specialty products. In the alternative asset category, third quarter net inflows of approximately $250 million were driven by EVM's global macro absolute return mandates, which dominate this category's managed assets and flows. Our global macro absolute return strategies hold long and short positions in currencies, short-duration sovereign debt, and related instruments of emerging and frontier market countries. Because they invest in both long and short and have limited duration, these strategies have been less exposed to recent declines in emerging and frontier debt markets than the local EM debt indexes. For the year-to-date, the I-share classes of our two U.S. mutual funds following global macro absolute return strategies are down in the range of 1.9% to 4.6% based on total return. With the recent selloff in EM debt markets, these funds have recently moved into modest net outflows. Our exposure management business had third quarter net outflows of $3.7 billion, in line with the $3.6 billion of net outflows in the prior quarter. As a reminder, this Parametric offering uses financial futures and other derivative instruments to help large institutional investors efficiently manage their equity duration, currency, and other market exposures within their portfolios, with Parametric serving on either a discretionary or non-discretionary basis. The exposure management outflows we experienced in the third quarter reflect net reductions in active exposures held by continuing clients rather than the loss of clients. Indeed, the number of active exposure management clients we have increased in the third quarter. As we have discussed in prior quarters, fluctuations in exposure management positions held by continuing EM clients are driven by these institutional investors' shifts in investment policy or market outlook, changes in underlying securities holdings, and other portfolio consideration. While lower-fee and more volatile than our other asset management businesses, we value our exposure management franchise for the close client relationships it affords with many of the foremost institutional investors and the potential for business growth that arises from both new client acquisition and expanded offerings to existing clients. On an overall basis, we view our broad line-up of high-performing funds and accounts and our leadership in investment strategies that are well-positioned for an environment of rising interest rates as presenting significant opportunities for Eaton Vance to grow in active management, even as the overall market for active management continues to decline. In the third quarter, net inflows into our actively managed funds and accounts totaled $2.7 billion, with positive contributions across equity, fixed and floating-rate income, and alternative categories. This equates to 5% annualized internal growth in active-strategy-managed assets for the quarter. Our position in responsible investing continues to expand under the Calvert brand and across our affiliates. Since Calvert became a part of Eaton Vance at the end of December 2016, we have made significant progress growing managed assets in Calvert-branded investment strategies and positioning Calvert as the center for excellence in environmental, social and governance research and engagement activities. Including the Atlanta Capital sub-advised Calvert Equity Fund, assets under management in Calvert strategies have grown from $11.9 billion at the time of the transaction to $14.7 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The 24% growth in Calvert's managed assets over the 19 months of Eaton Vance's ownership reflects net inflows of $800 million and market appreciation of $2 billion. In the third quarter, Calvert-branded strategies had net inflows of $350 million. This equates to 10% annualized internal growth in managed assets. Separate from Calvert, Parametric manages over $21 billion of AUM based on client-directed responsible investment criteria, with these assets held in more than 2,000 Custom Core and other Parametric-managed separate accounts. Combined, we believe Eaton Vance is today one of the largest players in responsible investing, a position we are committed to growing in conjunction with the surging demand for investment strategies that incorporate ESG-integrated investment resorts and/or that are managed with the dual objective to achieve favorable investment returns and positive societal impact. Turning to our NextShares initiative, the number of NextShares funds in the market expanded to 18 during the third quarter, with offerings from Eaton Vance, Calvert, and six other fund families now available. Expected benefits to fund performance from use of the NextShares structure are being demonstrated and NextShares' novel NAV-based trading mechanism continues to function smoothly. Commercially, our progress growing NextShares' assets under management continues to be slow, with sale success still hampered by very limited distribution access. Despite UBS' commitment to supporting NextShares at our initial launch in last November, sales of NextShares through UBS financial advisors have to date been quite modest. Our biggest challenge is that NextShares are available for purchase at UBS only through brokerage accounts and through their Strategic Advisor non-discretionary advisory platform. Without access to UBS' substantially larger and more broadly appealing discretionary advisory program, known as the Portfolio Management Program or PMP, it has been difficult for us to gain the necessary attention of UBS financial advisors to achieve meaningful sales. Given the slow progress at UBS, over recent weeks we have redoubled efforts to pursue other paths to commercialization. Where this leads is hard to say. We are open to a variety of arrangements but we'll be guided by our obligation to act in the best interest of Eaton Vance shareholders. In closing, I want to congratulate my 1,700 colleagues on the strong business, financial, and investment results achieved in the third quarter, and express my optimism for the Company's continuing success. The momentum our business continues to enjoy reflects the range of high-performing investment strategies we offer that are well-positioned for the current market environment, the broad and growing appeal of specialty strategies and solutions we provide, and the strong distribution and client service delivered by our sales and marketing teams. Longer-term, I remain confident that Eaton Vance has the people, culture, resources, and capital structure to support continuing success as the asset management industry evolves. That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll now turn the call over to Laurie. Laurie G. Hylton: Thank you, Tom, and good morning. As Tom mentioned, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.82 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 32% from $0.62 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and an increase of 6% from $0.77 of adjusted earnings per diluted share reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. As you can see in Attachment 2 to our press release, GAAP earnings exceeded adjusted earnings by $0.01 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to reflect the reversal of $1.3 million of net excess tax benefits recognized from the exercise of employee stock options and vesting of restricted stock awards during the period. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, adjusted earnings exceeded GAAP earnings by $0.04 per diluted share, reflecting $5.4 million of costs associated with retiring the remaining $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.5% senior notes that were due in October 2017 and $3.5 million of closed-end fund structuring fees paid during the quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, GAAP earnings exceeded adjusted earnings by $0.01 per diluted share to reflect the reversal of $1.9 million of net excess tax benefits recognized from the exercise of employee stock options and vesting of restricted stock awards during the period. Adjusted operating income, which excludes the closed-end fund structuring fees paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, increased by 14% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Our adjusted operating margin was 33% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 versus 31.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and 32% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Our adjusted operating margin for the first nine months of the fiscal year improved from 31% in 2017 to 32.4% in 2018. Tom noted, this was a record quarter for Eaton Vance in terms of managed assets, revenue, and net income, both on a U.S. GAAP and adjusted basis. Ending consolidated managed assets of $453.2 billion at July 31, 2018 were up 12% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, driven by strong net flows and positive market returns. Average managed assets in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 13% from the third quarter of fiscal 2017, driving a 10% increase in management fee revenue. Growth in management fee revenue trailed growth in average managed assets year-over-year due to a 2% decline in our average management fee rate from 34.2 basis points annually in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 to an annual rate of 33.5 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. This decline in our average management fee rate is primarily attributable to the shift in our business mix over that period as lower fee portfolio implementation and bond ladder businesses grew as a percentage of our assets under management. Average managed assets in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 1% versus the second quarter of fiscal 2018. When combined with the 1% increase in our average annualized management fee rate and the impact of three more fee days in the third quarter, this drove a 4% increase in revenue. Sequentially, our average annualized management fee rate increased to 33.5 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from 33.3 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Performance fees, which are excluded from the calculation of our average management fee rate, reduced income by $0.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, contributed $0.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and were a negative $0.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. As Tom noted, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, our annualized internal growth and management fee revenue of 5% outpaced our annualized internal growth and managed assets of 3%, primarily reflecting the impact of net inflows into higher fee strategies during the quarter. This compares to 6% annualized internal growth in management fee revenue on 9% annualized internal growth in managed assets in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and 7% annualized internal growth in management fee revenue on 4% annualized growth in managed assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Turning to expenses, compensation increased by 7% from the third quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily driven by hiring, a modest increase in benefit cost, and an increase in operating income and performance based bonus accruals and stock-based compensation, partially offset by a decrease in sales-based incentive compensation. Sequentially, compensation expense increased by 3% from the second quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting higher salaries associated with increases in headcount and the impact of three more payroll days in the third quarter, higher stock-based compensation associated with employee retirements and other terminations, and an increase in operating income based bonus accruals, partially offset by lower sales-based incentive compensation and a seasonal decrease in payroll taxes and benefits. Non-compensation distribution related costs, including distribution and service fee expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commission, decreased 2% from the same quarter a year ago and increased 3% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower marketing and promotion cost and $3.5 million of closed-end fund structuring fees paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, partially offset by higher commission amortization for private funds and an increase in intermediary marketing support payment, mainly driven by higher average managed assets. The sequential quarterly increase primarily reflects higher distribution and service fees, driven primarily by an increase in average managed assets in share classes that are subject to these fees and the impact of three more days in the quarter. Fund related expenses increased 13% from the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and were up 3% over the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher fund subsidy accruals and sub-advisory fees, driven by asset growth in affected strategies and an increase in fund expenses borne by the Company on funds for which we earn an all-in fee, partially offset by the $1.9 million in fund reimbursements made in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that were one-time in nature. The sequential quarterly increase primarily reflects an increase in fund subsidy accruals. Other operating expenses increased 10% versus the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and decreased 2% from the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher information technology spending and facilities expense, partially offset by lower travel and other corporate expenses. The sequential quarterly decrease primarily reflects lower facilities, professional services and travel expenses, partially offset by an increase in information technology spending. We continue to focus on overall expense management and identifying ways to gain operational leverage. Net gains and other investment income on seed capital investments contributed $0.01 to earnings per diluted share in each of the comparative quarterly periods presented. When quantifying the impact of our seed capital investments on earnings each quarter, we take into consideration our pro rata shares of gains, losses and other investment income earned on investments in sponsored strategies, whether accounted for as consolidated funds, separate accounts, or equity method investments, as well as the gains and losses recognized on derivatives used to hedge these investments. We then report the per share impact net of income taxes and net income attributable to non-controlling interests. We continue to hedge the market exposures of our seed capital portfolio to the extent practicable to minimize the associated earnings volatility. Net gains and other investment income in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 included a $5.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt incurred in connection with retirement of $250 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.5% senior notes which were due in October 2017. We excluded this one-time charge from our calculation of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-operating income/expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 included $1.2 million of net expense allocation from consolidated CLO entities versus $0.8 million of net income contribution from consolidated CLO entities in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company did not consolidate any CLO entities in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 26.2% versus 36.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and 26.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company's effective tax rate for the third and second quarters of fiscal 2018 reflect net excess tax benefits of $1.3 million and $1.9 million respectively related to the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock awards during those periods. New accounting guidance adopted in the first quarter requires these net excess tax benefits to be recognized in earnings. Shown on Attachment 2 to our press release, our calculations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share remove the effect of the net excess tax benefits recognized in the third and second quarters of fiscal 2018 in connection with the new accounting guidance. On this basis, our adjusted effective tax rate was 27.1% and 28.2% in the third and second quarters of fiscal 2018 respectively. On the same adjusted basis, we estimate that our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and for the full fiscal year as a whole will range between 27.25% and 27.75%, and our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate will range between 25.3% and 25.8%. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we used $35.3 million of corporate cash to pay quarterly dividends of $0.31 per share and repurchased 1.4 million shares of non-voting common stock for approximately $76.6 million. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $122.7 million, up 5% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. We finished our third fiscal quarter holding $820.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term debt securities and approximately $390.8 million in seed capital investments. This compares to outstanding debt obligations of $625 million. We continue to place high priority on using the Company's cash flow to benefit shareholders. Even as we support strong business growth, we've maintained significant financial flexibility. This concludes our prepared comments, and at this point we'd like to take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : Last quarter you gave us some helpful kind of specific guidance on how the flow outlook was for the current quarter, how pipelines were looking. Any chance you could update that same disclosure and kind of talk about the trend through the quarter? Thomas E. Faust Jr.: So, just a little bit we can say about flow outlook and in significant parts of our business we don't have a lot of visibility. Most of the retail business, you don't have a real good lens. We know current trends. In places where we do have visibility, it's primarily on the institutional side. I guess one thing I would highlight is we have a one not-funded pending high-yield mandate which we expect to fund in the high hundreds of millions of dollar range that's pending. That's probably the most significant thing I would point to in terms of significant inflows other than the Parametric Custom Core and exposure management business where we have quite a strong backlog for new business that's coming in, again in a similar magnitude. Laurie, anything you want to add on that? Laurie G. Hylton: No, I think those would be the most significant inflows that we have identified in the pipeline. Patrick Davitt : Great, thanks. And then to that last point, any update on the non-U.S. opportunity for both exposure management and portfolio implementation? I think few quarters ago you had mentioned your first non-U.S. mandate in one of those, so I was just hoping for an update there. Thomas E. Faust Jr.: Yes, that was probably an exposure management. I would say it's been relatively slow. We continue to grow in both. Those are both Parametric businesses. The biggest market for them in exposure management and portfolio implementation is in Australia where we have what we call Centralized Portfolio Management offering there. Business there is stable. It's an elephant-hunting business. Not a lot of visibility to new business growth but also a steady stream of ongoing business there. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Ken Worthington : I apologize if I missed this. Exposure management had outflows for the second quarter in a row. Just maybe what's happening here both on the sales side and the redemption side? Thomas E. Faust Jr.: I had a couple of comments about that, but I'll just review those. So we had a net gain in client. I think we were net up two clients I think or up a net four clients on a base of something like 200 I think. So, the business is growing modestly from the perspective of the number of clients with whom we have relationships. So, essentially all of the decline in assets in this quarter were due to reductions in outstanding balances with existing clients. And that can be driven by several things. So, remember what this is. This is an overlay service where if a client wants say 63% equity exposure and their underlying managers have 61% equity exposure, they can add 2% synthetically through Parametric using derivatives. Most commonly, exposure arrangement is used to equitize cash positions but it can also be used on a transition basis to add or subtract exposure to different parts of the market. Increasingly we're finding that as investors are moving to immunize their fixed income portfolios, there is an increasing role for exposure management in managing the duration of their portfolios to match their liabilities. Overall we think this continues to be a growth business for us. There is a fair bit of volatility. We've had two straight quarters now of negative $3.6 billion and negative $3.7 billion of outflows. Our history over time has been balances with existing clients over time grow but that's with fits and starts and we've certainly seen that over the last couple of quarters. So, nothing fundamental that we can really point to and say the business has changed or there's any reason to think that the negative trends in terms of flows over the last couple of quarters is going to continue. In fact, I believe for the quarter to date we're in the positive territory. So we're hopeful this will return to being a growth business in the sense of flows. We know it's a growth business in terms of the number of clients we're serving. Ken Worthington : On ETMFs, you had been talking about the potential for the UBS relationship for a number of quarters. Is what you kind of mentioned on the call, the more limited access to the financial advisors, like why is that a surprise, has something maybe changed more recently in this relationship or was it always designed to have sort of that limited access to the UBS advisor? Thomas E. Faust Jr.: So just a little bit of review, so we in I think July of 2016 we announced an agreement to gain distribution access at UBS. In November of 2017, we launched our first product at UBS, first NextShares products at UBS, and have been slowly rolling things out ever since. There is a process that UBS has imposed where every fund had to go through internal due diligence. I think essentially that process is mostly done for \u2013 it is done for all the Eaton Vance products, and I think for the non-Eaton Vance products it's mostly done. There is a requirement also that each financial advisor to sell NextShares had to take an exam or a quiz. I think it's about a half-hour test you have to take to do that, to ensure that they have working knowledge of the product structure. So, we've had some progress there. It's been frustrating that we haven't had more advisors doing this, but in the absence of distribution access through the right platforms, it hasn't been particularly compelling for advisors to sign up for this exam and to take the exam. But the biggest issue, the one that I highlighted in my prepared remarks, is that today we're only approved in brokerage and we're only improved in Strategic Advisor, and Strategic Advisor is a discretionary advisor program, meaning that \u2013 sorry, non-discretionary program, which means that when a financial advisor wants to make a trade or make some change in the portfolio on behalf of the client, the advisor needs to go to the client and get consent to make that trade, so there's not a discretion to the financial advisor, and it's called Strategic Advisor at UBS. The larger program at UBS, called PMP, is their discretionary advisory program where financial advisor has full discretion to buy or sell within the limits of the account guidelines on behalf of the client without having to get the consent to every trade. Relatively recently we have learned that there are rules there in the program that UBS has imposed that will make it more difficult for us to gain access there. In particular, there's a requirement that no more than X percent, don't know what that number is exactly, but there is some percentage threshold that they are not willing to own of any fund, NextShares or otherwise, in that program. So it makes it very hard for us to use PMP as a way to jumpstart this business, which about two years ago we would have hoped that this program would have been available to us, but it turns out that for reasons largely relating to internal legal regulatory judgments that they have said that for NextShares, for any ETF, or any mutual fund, that they can't own more than a certain percent of a fund. And so that wasn't designed to address NextShares but it had the effect, because we don't have broad distribution elsewhere, of limiting our ability to grow in NextShares at PMP, and PMP will largely drive the success of NextShares in total of UBS. So, it was not good to learn of this policy change at UBS over the last really couple of months we've been hearing this. Ken Worthington : Got it, okay. I think I understand better. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Maybe one just on operating leverage and the margins, so given that you guys have been able to put up the positive flows, the organic revenue growth has also been favorable and you've got the markets as a tailwind, and I know you guys have been making ongoing investments, but when you look at maybe the year-over-year like operating leverage that we've been seeing in that 140 basis point range, when we think about going forward, is there anything that we should be thinking about that should either limit that or accelerate that as we look over the next call it 12 to 18 months? Laurie G. Hylton: I wouldn't think so at this point. I don't think that there's anything that's going to push that around a lot. I think, to your point, net flows are wonderful. They are a high-quality problem. They do put pressure on margin because there are immediate point-of-sale costs associated with it. To the extent that we continue to see strong inflows and have to pay for that, it will put pressure, but the rest of fundamentals of the business really have not changed. And I think as we file our Q and you are able to see a lot of the detail on the expenses, you're going to see that the relationships have been hanging together and there really haven't been any significant changes. Michael Carrier : Okay, got it. And then Tom, maybe just one, this is kind of bigger picture, but just when I think about like the growth avenues going forward, you guys have made some investments for international distribution and that would be like a longer-term kind of avenue of growth, obviously NextShares is one of those, but it sounds like depending on how this UBS relationship pans out and then if you can have other wins, you guys will make a decision on different paths to go on. But I just wanted to try to get \u2013 because if I look at the net flows that you are putting up, relative to the industry you are already doing well, but when I think about maybe other kind of like avenues that you guys have been making investments, where can some of the future growth come from that maybe we're not already expecting? Thomas E. Faust Jr.: I think there are a number of future growth paths. I mean I'll tart with bank loans which has been a big source of growth for us in the last couple of years. In the U.S. mutual fund market, we are I believe the largest, if not one of the two or three largest, I think we're number one in terms of total assets in mutual fund bank loan funds. I think this is a business that can continue to grow for us for quite some time. We're in an environment where short-term rates are moving up. We're in an environment where credit conditions continue to be pretty benign. We've been blessed with very strong performance across our bank loan products. I think we have two five-star rated funds. So we're I believe the market leader, if not a market leader, in the U.S. retail space, and I think the positive flow dynamic that we've seen there will continue. Other things I would point to in terms of growth avenues for us are really the whole Parametric business, starting with Custom Core, their tax-managed separate account index-based strategy business. We're at a revenue level of I think it's about $140 million or so for that business. I think there's, if we can do this the right way, I think there's a chance for that to become a business that's multiple the current size. The value add versus pure passive index funds and index ETFs is quite clear in terms of tax, the benefits in terms of customization, to provide better alignment with personal values or to better fit with other investments that a person has, and to be able to deliver that at a price point that's quite competitive versus index type offerings. I think there is tremendous upside potential for that business. I think more broadly across the Parametric platform of implementation and exposure management businesses, we see lots of room for growth across that franchise using their ability to efficiently implement portfolios of all kinds of different flavors, index-based, non-index-based, single index, multiple index, tax-managed, non, responsibly invested, otherwise, we see lots of opportunities for growth. The third thing I would mention is just the general area of responsible investing, both in the customized separate account world as done by Parametric and through Calvert. This is an industry where there's huge demand and no obvious market leader and we think we can be that or we can become that with a range of offerings, led by our Calvert brand but also including customized strategies offered through Parametric. I think this can be a much bigger part of the asset management business and I think Eaton Vance is in a position potentially to lead that. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Tom, you had mentioned in your prepared remarks that within equities the best opportunity you see for growth is in specialty products, and that's not surprising given some of the industry trends. I guess as we think about your current mix and what that would mean just in terms of profitability or fee rate as we think about going forward with Calvert and Parametric and some of the various kind of products that would fit that category, how should we think about the trend in fee rate as a result of that? Thomas E. Faust Jr.: I don't think there should be a big change in the fee rate. Some of the specialty products that we have in mind are relatively high-fee, some of the products are relatively low-fee. One of the drivers of that business has been the Parametric defensive equity strategy, which is a derivative-based strategy, which is relatively low-fee. I think it's in average in the 30 range, 35 range. As that grows, maybe that pulls down fee rates a bit. We also offer some specialty tax-managed equity strategies that tend to be at higher than average fee rate. So I think the blend of the two is probably positive. We do have I should say add in the realm of equities, we have a good relative performance here across our line-up of equity strategies; growth, value, core. Across asset classes, generally we're ahead of benchmark, generally we're ahead of peer group. We have a team of global equity analysts and portfolio managers based primarily in London that joined Eaton Vance just about three years ago and they have some strategies there that are hitting their three-year performance mark, particularly on the small-cap side, small-cap global and small-cap international. We're hopeful or optimistic that over the next 6 to 12 months we can see significant flows there for strategies that are at the higher end of our average fee rate for equities. Dan Fannon : Got it. And then I guess, Laurie, as a follow-up on just expenses and kind of outlook for margin, I guess anything in the quarter one-time that we should be thinking about that what have you just kind of normalizing for next quarter and going forward that you would highlight? And then given the beta that we've seen thus far just to start kind of your last fiscal quarter, anything that would kind of derail kind of continued margin expansion? Laurie G. Hylton: No, this was an incredibly clean quarter from an expense perspective. So, I wouldn't identify anything as a one-time item that would be worthy of note. I don't think that there is any impediment to margin expansion outside of the fact that there are obviously a number of different components that are going to factor in. And as I mentioned, we're obviously experiencing significant growth in our flow story and it's a quality problem but there are costs associated with it because everything on the retail side obviously is point-of-sale, so in terms of our incentive compensation. But I don't see anything that would necessarily represent an impediment to growth over time. It's just going to be the mix of things that happen in the course of the quarter. Dan Fannon : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ari Ghosh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Ari Ghosh : Could you remind us of the size of your international AUM, is this primarily still the fixed income business out of Germany and Asia at this point? And then perhaps related, as you think of potential M&A opportunities, is the main consideration adding product scale or is that more towards increasing your footprint in any key non-U.S. markets? Thomas E. Faust Jr.: So, in terms of AUM in our international business is about 6% of the total. Maybe somebody here is looking to pull up the number, but\u2026 Laurie G. Hylton: So, $25 billion roughly. Ari Ghosh : $25 billion? Laurie G. Hylton: Yes. That's 6%. Thomas E. Faust Jr.: Biggest single market is Japan, representing maybe slightly less than half of that. Australia would be probably the second biggest market. We have been adding \u2013 growing distribution presence in markets outside the United States. We have about 50 people in London. Roughly half of those are on the sales and distribution side. Roughly half of those are asset management. I think you might be referring to earlier this year we did a transaction or we took on a team, I should say, based in Frankfurt that added about I think $600 million to $700 million in managed assets in fixed income. The mix of our assets outside the United States is, as your question suggests, I think is primarily on the income side. We have a well-established business in bank loans, particularly in Japan. As we think about growing further outside United States, I would say, big picture, to me it doesn't feel like the right ratio to have only about 6% of our business represented by the 95% or so of the world's population that lives outside the United States. So, probably not the right balance. We need to grow primarily I would say on the distribution side. We feel like we've made good progress in developing a range of really global investment capabilities, highlighted I would say by our global income capabilities and our range of emerging market strategies offered through Parametric and now also through Calvert. We are interested in and open to ways to jumpstart our business outside the United States, including potentially on a transaction basis. We certainly look at properties that become available outside of the United States with the goal to jumpstart that. But the main thing we're looking for more than anything else is a bigger distribution platform outside of the United States. We think we've got largely the product that we need to be successful around the world. Ari Ghosh : Got it, very helpful. And then just back to NextShares and comments around new efforts that you are doing right now, is this in the form of new distribution platforms that you are in talks with, or is there a way you could license or sell the NextShares IP, and are there any internal targets that you have before you consider maybe like shortening the initiative or removing the earnings drag which I believe is around $8 million a year? I'm just trying to get a sense of the different options that's under consideration here. Thomas E. Faust Jr.: So, I think our current spending in the most recent quarter was about $2 million. So, your $8 million a year estimate is accurate. We have been able to pull that down a bit. So the run rate I think is more in the range of $5 million to $6 million we'll say. But we need to figure out what we're going to do here. As you pointed out, one of the options would be to shut it down. If no one wants to buy NextShares, we don't want to spend $5 million or $8 million a year. We think we have something of value here. We've spent a lot of time and effort developing this. This remains the only approved, less than fully transparent active exchange traded product structure approved by the SEC. It's performing in the marketplace. It's trading well. We have I think six or seven different partner firms that are up with product in the market. But we haven't been able to sell anything and the reason we haven't been able to sell anything is because we don't have distribution access. If we could maybe wave a magic wand and make that problem go away, we would, but that's the world we live in. How we break through that is the challenge at hand. Is there something we can do in partnership with some other financial organization, either another asset manager or potentially a distributor that would break that logjam and distribution access, that's what we're focusing on. But at the end of the day, we're going to decide what to do based on what's best for our shareholders, and if that means continuing to invest in a significant way or it means moving down to a lower-level spending or it means declaring that this thing isn't going to work, we're going to make that determination based on ultimately what good it does for the Eaton Vance shareholder. Ari Ghosh : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. William R. Katz: So just coming back to the spending outlook, Laurie, as you think about the next 12 to 24 months, are there any big picture projects coming down the pike that could otherwise absorb some of the incremental margin opportunity that you highlighted? Laurie G. Hylton: Nothing that's outside of things that we're already doing today. I think that we have referenced on previous calls that we are engaged in some larger scale technology projects. We haven't called those out separately and I wouldn't intend on doing that now, but we have been standardizing some platforms on the investment management side and I would anticipate we're going to continue to have like projects, whether it's in Boston at Eaton Vance or whether it would be in Seattle at Parametric. So I wouldn't anticipate that you're going to see a sudden spike as I think the spend has been continuous. I think that we have noted in the past, we continue to invest in the business. Not that we are immune to being mindful of margin, but we do recognize that in order to be a growth company and have a scalable platform, we have to continue to make those investments, and we don't view those as being outside the ordinary course of business. So, no, I don't say that I would call anything out specifically, but I also would not anticipate that we would see a diminishing in our spend in technology and platform scalability projects anytime soon. Thomas E. Faust Jr.: I might add that one other area that I would say that's an area of focus that certainly involve some spending is the technology underlying Calvert and more connecting the Calvert research process to the Eaton Vance fundamental analysts is an ongoing project that we'll be spending more money on over the next year or so. William R. Katz: Okay. And then just, Tom, for you, or maybe Laurie, you've mentioned that you're still sort of prioritizing your capital to the benefit of shareholders. Could you sort of walk through how you sort of think about that today, where the stock as trading particularly at today's reaction? Seems like you're drawn pretty close to the end of your existing buyback authorization. Maybe sort of tick off your sort of top two or three priorities as we look at over the next several quarters. Thomas E. Faust Jr.: I will say they remain the same. There's only so much, so many different categories, the things we can do with our cash. We can pay dividends and look to expand our dividend rate, which we have evaluated annually typically in conjunction with our October meeting. So we'll be making a decision there at our next Board meeting. Share repurchases, we've been active, we have not historically been constrained by current authorizations because we've been able to get those reauthorized so that doesn't interfere. We can invest in our business through seed capital, and we have a pretty large seed capital portfolio, we don't see any particular call on that near-term. And we can do acquisitions. You may recall, at the end of 2016 we bought Calvert which was we think a very good purchase for us both financially and even more so strategically, really putting Eaton Vance in a position to emerge as the leader in responsible investing. So, we feel like over time our record of growth through acquisitions has been quite good. The Eaton Vance as it exists today would be a very different company if we had not acquired Parametric in 2003, Atlanta Capital in 2001, Calvert in 2016, and assorted other acquisitions along the way. We will probably not be the high bidder if there's an auction for property. That doesn't tend to be our style. But if we can find something that strategically makes sense, helps us meet our goals, and is attractive at a price, that can certainly be a call on corporate capital. We have a lot of liquidity on balance, we think that's a good thing, and we're certainly committed to using that to the benefit of our shareholders. William R. Katz: Thank you for taking the questions today. Eric Senay : We have time for one more question. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually [indiscernible] for Brian Bedell. So just really going back to the flows for a second, there seems some strong flows in fixed income over the past few quarters. I was wondering if you could just give a little more detail on the drivers behind that including by product and distribution channel. Thomas E. Faust Jr.: Sorry, it's a little hard to hear you. So, the key drivers of our growth in fixed income over recent quarters by product and distribution channel, I think you said? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Thomas E. Faust Jr.: Okay. And just to be clear, are you including bank loans in that or not? Unidentified Analyst : No, but both would be helpful. Thomas E. Faust Jr.: Okay, all right. So, the biggest single driver of our flows into fixed income over the last several quarters have been laddered bond separate accounts, which are both municipals and corporate. In the quarter we had positive flows in high-yield, we had positive flows in mortgage-backed securities, we had the laddered business was positive. Calvert, which became part of Eaton Vance at the end of 2016, has a nice portfolio of fixed income business which is on balanced, have been growers. So, most of all of our munis outside of the ladders have been modest growers. Core fixed income outside of the short-duration strategies haven't really done a whole lot. So, I would say it's been primarily, in recent quarters it's been primarily high-yield, it's been mortgage-backed securities, and it's been ladders, the laddered bond separate accounts sold to the retail market that have been the primary drivers. And if you want to look at it by channel, I mentioned that we have a large high-yield mandate, part of which is already funded, part of which is coming in the next quarter. That was noticeable in the current quarter on the institutional side. The balance was primarily in retail strategies, either funds or separate accounts. Eric Senay : Okay, I think that concludes our call for today. Thank you very much and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Hylton - VP and CFO Analysts : Gerald O'Hara - Jefferies & Company Ken Worthington - JPMorgan Chase Robert Lee - KBW Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Bill Katz - Citigroup Operator : Good morning. My name is Stephanie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Eaton Vance Corp Fourth Fiscal Quarter Earnings Conference call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Eric Senay, you may begin your conference. Eric Senay : Thank you and good morning and welcome to our Fiscal 2018 fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. With me this morning are Tom Faust, Chairman and CEO of Eaton Vance, and Laurie Hylton, our CFO. In today's call, we will first comment on the quarter and then take your questions. The full earnings release and charts we will refer to during the call are available on our Web site, eatonvance.com under the heading, Press Releases. In today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainty in our business, including, but not limited to, those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings, including our 2017 Annual Report and Form 10-K, are available also on our Web site or upon request at no charge. I will now turn the call over to Tom. Thomas E. Faust Jr.: Good morning. Thank you, Eric, and thanks, everyone for joining us. Earlier today Eaton Vance reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.21 for the fiscal year ended October 31st, which is an increase of 29% from the $2.48 of adjusted earnings per diluted share we reported for fiscal 2017. In the fourth -- for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.85, which is up 21% from the $0.70 per diluted share of earnings we reported for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and up 4% from $0.82 per diluted share in this fiscal year's third quarter. Both the annual and quarterly results we reported today are new record highs for the company. While lower income taxes have contributed significantly to this year's earnings growth, pre-tax adjusted operating income increased 14% for fiscal 2018 as a whole and was up 4% in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter of last year. We ended fiscal 2018 with consolidated assets under management of $439.3 billion, up 4% from 12 months earlier with a volatile October raising the fiscal year's previous market gains, all our AUM growth in fiscal 2018 was attributable to net inflows. We generated $17.3 billion of consolidated net inflows in fiscal 2018, representing 4% internal growth in managed assets. Excluding exposure management, which has lower fees and more volatile flows than the rest of our business, net inflows for the year were $25.6 billion in fiscal 2018. This equates to 8% internal growth in managed assets and nearly matches the $26.4 billion of net inflows we delivered in the -- in fiscal 2017. Fourth quarter fiscal 2018 consolidated in -- net inflows of $2.1 billion represent 2% annualized internal growth in managed assets or 5% annualized internal AUM growth, excluding the $2.5 billion of exposure management net outflows we had in the fourth quarter. While net outflows -- while net flows in internal growth and managed assets are customary measures of an asset managers organic growth. We also focus on internal growth in management fee revenue. Organic revenue growth as we define measures the change in consolidated management fee revenue resulting from net inflows and outflows, taking into account the fee rate applicable to each dollar in or out and excluding the impact of market action, adjustments in the fee rates of continuing managed assets and in the acquisitions of managed assets. In fiscal 2018, organic management fee revenue growth was 5%, slightly above our 4% organic growth in managed assets for the year. In the fourth quarter, management fee revenue grew organically at an annual rate of 2%, the same as the quarter's organic AUM growth rate. Although peer companies typically do not disclosed organic revenue growth numbers, we believe Eaton Vance continues to rank highly among public asset managers by this measure with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 representing our 11th consecutive quarter of positive organic revenue growth. A number of factors have contributed Eaton Vance's -- this to Eaton Vance's sustained run of positive organic revenue growth, starting with strong investment performance. As of October 31, we had 66 U.S mutual funds with an overall Morningstar rating of four or five stars for at least one class of shares, including 28 five-star rated funds. As measured by total return, 50% of our U.S mutual fund assets ranked in the top quartile of their Morningstar peer groups over 3 years, 63% in the top quartile over 5 years and 56% top quartile over 10 years. In the rising interest rate environment of 2018, our floating-rate bank loan franchises demonstrated strong appeal to investors generating net inflows of $5.9 billion for the fiscal year, and $2 billion in the fourth quarter, representing annualized internal growth in AUM of 15% and 18%, respectively. For both the fiscal year as a whole and the fourth quarter, our bank loan flows were driven primarily by strong sales of our floating-rate income mutual funds offered in the U.S., a market in which we are the share leader. Our lineup of fixed income mutual funds positioned as short or ultra-short duration, short-term or adjustable-rate has also proved attractive in the rising rate environment of 2018, gaining $1.8 billion of net inflows for the fiscal year, which equates to 29% internal growth in managed assets. In the fourth quarter, annualized internal growth in managed assets accelerated 40% with net inflows of $700 million. Among our leading funds in this category are the five-star rated Eaton Vance short duration government income and Eaton Vance short duration municipal income -- municipal opportunities funds. These funds are well-suited for income investors who have limited appetite for interest-rate risk and also seek to avoid exposure to corporate credit markets. Our lineup of custom index equity and the laddered bond separate accounts offered to retail and high net worth investors also contributed significantly to growth in fiscal 2018. As we have described in prior calls, we frequently market Parametric Custom Core equity strategies in combination with EVM managed customized municipal and corporate bond ladders and refer to the combined offering as custom beta. As shown in Slide 12 of our presentation, managed assets in our custom beta strategies increased 24% from $68.3 billion at the end of fiscal 2017 to $84.3 billion at the end of fiscal 2018. The $14.8 billion of net inflows for the full fiscal year and $4.3 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter represent annualized internal growth in managed assets of 22% and 21%, respectively. These market-leading offerings combine the benefits of passive investing with the ability to customize portfolios to meet individual preferences and needs. Responsible investing continues to be a leading trend in asset management and a significant driver of growth for Eaton Vance. When we acquired the assets of Calvert Investments at the end of December 2016, I talked about the opportunity we saw to apply our management and distribution resources to help this longtime leader in responsible investing become a larger and more impactful business. Now less than 24 months later we are achieving that vision. Total Calvert managed assets, including amounts sub-advised by other Eaton Vance affiliates, increased 14% from $12.9 billion on October 31, 2017 to $14.7 billion at fiscal 2018 year-end. As measured from the close of the Calvert transaction on December 30, 2016, total managed assets of Calvert strategies are up 24%. Net inflows in the Calvert strategies were $1.9 billion in fiscal 2018, representing 15% internal growth in managed assets. Fourth quarter net inflows of $600 million equate to 16% annualized internal growth in AUM. While the appeal of responsible investing does not rest solely on performance, it certainly helps to have competitive returns as of October 31, 2018, 15 Calvert funds were rated four or five stars by Morningstar for at least one class of shares with high-performing Calvert offerings across a broad range of equity in common multi-asset categories. While Calvert is the centerpiece of our responsible investment strategy, our commitment to responsible investing doesn't end there. In fiscal 2018, the investment teams at Eaton Vance management launched programs to integrate the consideration responsible investing criteria into their fundamental research processes, capitalizing on the proprietary research that Calvert provides. Atlanta Capital also maintains a significant focus on responsible investing and Parametric manages over 20 billion of assets based on client directed responsible investment criteria. The Parametric responsible investment offerings incorporate portfolio screens and tilts and index customization capabilities to enable investors to tailor their investment holdings to align with their individual values. We continue to believe that responsible investing is here to stay and that it represents a major growth opportunity for Eaton Vance. While fiscal 2018 was a strong period for Eaton Vance in many aspects, the year was not without its challenges. Within equities, two leading Parametric franchise experienced significant outflows as their investment styles moved out of favor with investors. The Parametric structure emerging market equity strategies had net outflows of $2.6 billion for the fiscal year as a whole and $900 million in the fourth quarter. On a net basis, Parametric single stock and portfolio call writing programs outflow of $800 million for the fiscal year and $500 million in the fourth quarter. Despite the bleeding of managed assets, we see reason for optimism that the outlook for these strategies maybe improving. After a period of below-average returns, Parametric structure EM equity strategy has been a standout relative performer over more recent periods. At the end of October, the Class I-shares of both the Parametric emerging market equity mutual funds ranked in the top decile of their Morningstar peer groups for three-month year-to-date and one year total returns. While covered call writing programs don't lend them self to comparative investment performance, we believe the market appeal of equity call writing, which is fundamentally a risk mitigating strategy will likely improve its equity markets and become more defensive as equity investors become more defensive in response to choppier markets. Another leading franchise where we\u2019ve faced performance headwinds and deteriorating flows is global macro, which constitutes most of the assets and flows of our alternative assets reporting category. Managed by the EVM global income team, global macro absolute return and global macro absolute return advantage strategies hold long and short positions in currency and short duration sovereign debt instruments of emerging and frontier market countries, seeking returns that are substantially uncorrelated with global equity markets in U.S interest rates, and that exceeds short-term treasury returns. As performance fell off in conjunction with weakness in selected emerging and frontier markets in which we\u2019ve held the long exposures, our global macro strategies had net outflows of $700 million in the fourth quarter, reversing the $1.5 billion of net inflows in the first nine months of the fiscal year. Another leading franchise were we've been seeing net outflows is exposure management. As a reminder, exposure management is a Parametric business offering primarily future space overlay of strategies to institutional investors, so they can add or remove or hedge market exposures within their portfolios in a transparent efficient and customized manner without disrupting their underlying investment holdings. At an average fee rate of 5 basis points, this is our lowest fee business, but historically a contributor to company growth. Since entering this business through the acquisition of the former Clifton Group at the end of 2012, we\u2019ve more than double the assets in this franchise from $32 billion to $78 billion. While exposure management had net outflows of $8.3 billion in fiscal 2018 as a whole and $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, it's important to understand that the outflows we've experienced here do not reflect the loss of clients rather lower average balances in ongoing client relationships. We do not budget for or attempt to forecast changes in the average balances of our exposure management clients, which can vary considerably due to changes in their portfolio cash levels or other investment considerations. In most year since we entered this business, existing clients have on balance added to their portfolio -- over to their Parametric overlay exposures. While that was not the case in fiscal 2018, our client roster in this strategy has continued to expand with a net increase of nine new or significantly expanded relationships booked in the fourth quarter alone. Despite the volatility of quarterly and yearly asset flows, we continue to view exposure management as an important business franchise for us and a growth driver going forward. A key to Eaton Vance's long-term success continues to be our ability to grow our higher fee actively managed investment strategies, at the same time as we expand our lower fee more passive businesses. Our active investment strategies, which encompass a diverse range of equity, fixed and floating-rate income, alternative and multi-asset capabilities had net inflows of $10.6 billion for the fiscal year, representing 5% internal growth in managed assets. Growth in actively managed strategies was complemented by momentum and more passive strategies, including Calvert index funds, Parametric portfolio implementation and exposure management strategies and services, and EVM's laddered bond separate accounts. Excluding exposure management, our more passive strategies had $15 billion of net inflows in fiscal 2018, which represents 12% internal growth in managed assets. As we enter fiscal 2019, Eaton Vance is focused on five strategic priorities. First, building upon and defending our leadership position in specialty strategies and services for high net worth institutional investors. Second, capitalizing on the current interest rate environment to grow our market position in floating-rate and short duration fixed income strategies. Third, expanding our leadership position in responsible investing. Fourth, increasing our global investment capabilities and distribution reach outside the U.S., and fifth, positioning Eaton Vance to profit from a changing environment for the asset management industry. Constant change has long been a hallmark of the investment industry, changing market conditions and demographic trends, shifts in investor sentiment and outlook, advances in information technology, changes in the business strategies of wealth advisory firms, investment consultants and other key intermediaries and gatekeepers, and new tax and regulatory initiatives. Over time what distinguishes the most successful investment management organizations is often how they manage change. Do they offer strategies and services that respond to the changing needs of clients and business partners, do they evolve their business models to the changing opportunities and risk facing the asset management industry. While change is a constant in asset management, the pace of change appears to be accelerating, positioning Eaton Vance for continued success amid accelerating change in our industry, is job one for our leadership team and is the driver of all our strategic thinking. With the successful 2018 under our belts, we now look forward to the opportunities and challenges of a new fiscal year. That concludes my prepared remarks. And I'll now turn the call over to Laurie. Laurie G. Hylton: Thank you and good morning. Tom mentioned fiscal 2018 was a record year for Eaton Vance in terms of revenue, net income and earnings per share both on a U.S GAAP and adjusted basis. As you can see in attachment two of our press release, we are reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.21 for fiscal 2018, an increase of 29% from $2.48 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the prior fiscal year. Adjusted earnings exceeded U.S GAAP earnings by $0.10 per diluted share in fiscal 2018, reflecting the add back of $24 million of income tax expense recognized in relation to the nonrecurring impact of the tax law change that became effective in January. And a $6.5 million charge recognized upon the expiration of the company's options to acquire an additional 26% ownership interest in our 49% owned affiliate Hexavest. These add backs were partly offset by the reversal of $17.5 million of net excess tax benefits that new accounting guidance requires us to recognize in connection with the exercise of employee stock option and vesting of restricted stock awards during the year. In fiscal 2017, adjusted earnings exceeded GAAP earnings by $0.06 per diluted share, reflecting the add back of $5.4 million of costs associated with retiring the company's senior note that were due in October 2017. $3.5 million of structuring fees paid in connection with the 2017 initial public offering of a sponsored closed end fund and $0.5 million related to increases in the estimated redemption value of noncontrolling interest in our affiliates redeemable at other than fair value. Adjusted operating income, which excludes the closed-end fund structuring fees paid in fiscal 2017, increased by 14% year-over-year. On the same adjusted basis, our operating margin improved to 32.6% in fiscal 2018 from 31.8% in fiscal 2017. As Tom mentioned, we\u2019re also reporting record quarterly adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.85 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, up 21% from $0.70 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and up 4% from $0.82 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. GAAP earnings exceeded adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 by $0.02 per diluted share to reflect the reversal of $2.4 million of net excess tax benefits recognized from the exercise of employee stock options and vesting of restricted stock awards during the period. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, adjusted earnings exceeded GAAP earnings by a penny per diluted share, reflecting the add back of $0.6 million related to increases in the estimated redemption value of noncontrolling interest and affiliates redeemable at other than fair value. GAAP earnings exceeded adjusted earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 by a penny per diluted share. To reflect the reversal of $1.3 million of net excess tax benefits recognized from the exercise of employee stock options and vesting of restricted stock awards during the period. Operating income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by 4% from the same period a year-ago and 2% sequentially. Our operating margin was 33.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 versus 34.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and 33% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Ending consolidated managed assets of $439.3 billion at October 31, 2018 were up 4% from the end of fiscal 2017 driven by positive net flows. Consolidated managed assets were down 3% from the prior quarter end, reflecting positive net flows offset by the market price declines experienced in the final month of our fourth fiscal quarter. The decrease in our managed assets due to market price declines in the month of October totaled $20.1 billion, effectively wiping out market driven gains of the previous 11 months. Despite a difficult October, average managed assets in fiscal 2018 increased 16% from the prior fiscal year, driving a 12% increase in management fee revenue. Growth in management fee revenue trailed growth in average managed assets during the fiscal year due to 3% decline in our average management fee rate from 34.5 basis points in fiscal 2017 to 33.5 basis points in fiscal 2018. This decline in our average management fee rate is primarily attributable to the shift in our business mix year-over-year as lower fee portfolio implementation and bond ladder businesses grew as a percentage of our assets under management. Performance fees which excluded from the calculation of our average management fee rate reduced income by $1.7 million in fiscal 2018 and contributed $0.4 million to earnings in fiscal 2017. As Tom noted, our fiscal 2018 internal growth in management fee revenue of 5% outpaced our internal growth in managed assets of 4%, primarily reflecting the impact of net inflows into higher fee strategies during the year. This compares to 7% internal growth in management fee revenue and a 11% internal growth in managed assets in fiscal 2017. Comparing fourth quarter results to same quarter last year, 10% growth in average managed assets drove an 8% increase in management fee revenue. Sequentially, average managed assets increased 2%, driving management fee growth of 1%. Our average annualized management fee rate of 33.4 basis points in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, down 1% from 33.9 basis points in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and substantially unchanged from 33.5 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Although strong flows into our lower fee strategies continue, net inflows into higher fee strategies helped mitigate the overall fee rate decline. Performance fees reduced income by $0.3 million in the fourth quarters of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, and reduced income by $0.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we realized 2% annualized internal growth in management fees and 2% annualized internal growth in managed assets. This compares to 5% annualized internal growth in management fees and 8% annualized internal growth in managed assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and 5% annualized internal growth in management fees, and 3% annualized internal growth in managed assets in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The deterioration in our annualized internal growth in management fee this quarter was driven by reduced net inflows in a less favorable mix of higher fee and lower fee strategies within our inflows and outflows. Turning to expenses. Compensation expense increased by 9% in fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting higher salaries and benefits associated with increases in headcount and year-end salary increases from the previous fiscal year, higher operating income and performance based bonus accruals driven by increased profitability and an increase in stock-based compensation, partially offset by lower sales-based incentive compensation. Compensation expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 35.5% in fiscal 2018 from 36.2% in fiscal 2017. We anticipate the compensation as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 will be closer to 36%, given seasonal pressures associated with payroll tax clock reset 401(k) funding and year-end based salary increases. Controlling our compensation costs and other discretionary spending remains top-of-mind as we moved into -- as we move into the new fiscal year, particularly given the more challenging market environment of late. Non-compensation distribution related costs, including distribution and service fee expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commissions increased 4% in fiscal 2018. The increase primarily reflects higher marketing and distribution related costs, mainly driven by higher average managed assets and open end funds and an increase in service fees and commission amortization for private funds. Backing out the closed-end fund structuring fees paid in fiscal 2017, which we do in calculating adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per diluted share. Our non-compensation distribution related costs in fiscal 2018 were up 6%. Fund related expenses increased 32% in fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting higher fund subsidy accruals and sub-advisory fees, driven by strong asset growth in certain Calvert and Global Macro strategies, and an increase in fund expenses borne by the company on funds for which we earn an all in fee, partially offset by $1.9 million in fund reimbursements made by the company to certain funds in fiscal 2017 that were one-time in nature. Other operating expenses increased 13% in fiscal 2018, reflecting higher information technology spending attributable mainly to expenditures associated with the consolidation of our trading platforms and enhancements to Calvert's research system. Higher facilities expenses related to an increase in rent expense due to the expansion of space and the acceleration of 1.59 of depreciation expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and higher professional services expenses, primarily attributable to an increase in corporate consulting engagements and external legal costs. We continue to focus on overall expense management and identifying ways to gain operational leverage. Net gains and other investment income on seed capital investments contributed a penny to earnings per diluted share in each of the comparative quarterly periods presented. When quantifying the impact of our seed capital investments on earnings each quarter, we take into consideration our pro rata share of the gains, losses and other investment income earned on investments in sponsored strategies, whether accounted for as consolidated funds, separate accounts, or equity method investments, as well as the gains and losses recognized on derivatives used to hedge these investments. We then report the per share impact net of income taxes and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. We continue to hedge the market exposures of our seed capital portfolio to the extent practicable to minimize the associated earnings volatility. Net gains and other investment income in fiscal 2018 included a $6.5 million charge related to the expiration of the company's Hexavest option in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Non-operating income expense in fiscal 2017 included $5.4 million of debt extinguishment costs incurred in connection with retiring the remaining $250 million aggregate principal balance of the Company's 6.5% senior notes that were due in October 2017. These one-time charges are excluded from our calculations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fiscal years in which they occurred. The $3.9 million decrease in interest expense year-over-year reflects the impact of last year's debt retirement, partially offset by the April 2017 issuance of $300 million of 3.5% senior notes due in April of 2027. Non-operating income expense in fiscal 2018 also includes $1.6 million of income contribution from consolidated CLO entities. Net gains and other investment income in fiscal 2017 included a $1.9 million gain recognized upon the release from escrow of payments received in connection with the sale of the Company's equity interest in Lloyd George management back in fiscal 2011. Turning to taxes. Our effective tax rate was 28.8% in fiscal 2018 and 37% in fiscal 2017. The Company's income tax provision for fiscal 2018 includes a nonrecurring charge of $24 million to reflect the effects of the U.S federal tax law changes that were enacted in the first quarter. The tax increase associated with the nonrecurring charge was partially offset by net excess tax benefits of $17.5 million related to the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock awards during fiscal 2018. Accounting guidance adopted in the first quarter requires these net excess tax benefits to be recognized in earnings. As shown in attachment two to our press release, our calculations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share removed the nonrecurring impact of the tax law changes and the net excess tax benefits recognized under the new accounting guidance. On this basis, our adjusted effective tax rate was 27.6% in fiscal 2018. On the same adjusted basis, we estimate that our effective tax rate will range between 25.9% and 26.4% for fiscal 2019. We estimate that the reduction in our statutory U.S federal income tax rate due to the enactment of the tax law changes resulted in tax savings of approximately $59.7 million or $0.49 per diluted share for fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of these tax savings, our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per diluted share would have been approximately $2.72, an increase of 10% from the $2.48 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the prior fiscal year. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we used $35.3 million of corporate cash to pay the $0.31 per share quarterly dividend declared at the end of our previous quarter and repurchased $2.1 million shares of nonvoting common stock for approximately $100.6 million. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $122.9 million at fiscal 2018, up 6% from a $116.4 million at fiscal 2017. We finished our four fiscal quarter holding $873.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term debt securities and approximately $358.8 million in seed capital investments. These amounts compare to outstanding debt obligations of $625 million at fiscal year-end. We continue to place high priority on using the Company's cash flow to benefit shareholders. Fiscal discipline around discretionary spending will remain top-of-mind in fiscal 2019. We are very mindful of the more difficult market environment its now upon us, and the associated pressure on revenues that this bring. Given our strong liquidity and overall financial condition, we believe we are well-positioned to continue managing our business for long-term growth, but also continuing to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This concludes our prepared comments. At this point, we would like to take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Gerald O'Hara: Great. Thanks. Actually Jerry O'Hara sitting in for Dan this morning. Just a question around fee rates, and specifically the alternatives. It looks like that segment despite some outflows that you cited has continued to kind of march forward or higher with that fee rate, perhaps you could give a little color or context around that dynamic? Thomas E. Faust Jr.: Yes. So the assets in that category are unusually concentrated in the global macro absolute return and global macro absolute advantage mutual funds. The fee rate on the advantage strategy, which has effectively built-in leverage is significantly higher than the base strategy. So as Eaton Vance global macro advantage grows relative to Eaton Vance global macro absolute return fund, which has happened, you will see the fee rate in that asset category move up. Gerald O'Hara: Understood. That\u2019s helpful. And then perhaps one on Hexavest flows just sort of looking at Slide 7, it seems to be little -- I guess, a little choppy. Perhaps you could talk a little bit about kind of what the trends look like there. And then one maybe kind of follow-on, if there's any color you might be able add on quarter-to-date flow trends. I know it's still early, but that would be appreciated. Thank you. Thomas E. Faust Jr.: Yes, maybe I will add. Laurie or Eric, take the quarter-to-date, but just on Hexavest, Hexavest is a top down global equity manager based in Montreal. We own 49%, acquired that position in 2012. Since then, they\u2019ve for the most part been pretty defensively positioned and certainly have been over the last, I will say 2.5 years. Not surprisingly, that meant that until recently they\u2019ve lagged the market in terms of their performance, and again, not surprisingly, given that they lag the market, they\u2019ve seen harder times winning new business and have seen some acceleration of outflows not surprising, but given that they\u2019re defensively positioned and that\u2019s well known to their clients, we'd think that performance during the market rallies of 2017 and earlier parts of this year. It shouldn't have been, it shouldn't have been a surprise. Given the turn in the market recently, not surprisingly, they\u2019ve been performing better. They\u2019ve had good performance, well above market performance since the market started to correct. May not happen immediately, but certainly our expectation is that as that happens, they will see less pressure on outflows and potentially be in a position to see a greater trend of new business won as well. Gerald O'Hara: Great. Thanks. And then -- yep, go ahead. Thomas E. Faust Jr.: Go ahead. Gerald O'Hara: No, I was just going to say then any additional on quarter to date would be helpful. Laurie G. Hylton: This is Laurie. We don\u2019t have a lot of visibility into the current quarter to date, given that we are only a couple weeks into it, but I think that as Tom noted, their performances has improved significantly. We are waiting to see how that\u2019s actually going to play out in largely institutional business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. On the bank loan product, it seems like the industry is focusing maybe a touch more on the credit deterioration more so than higher interest rates, and at least we\u2019ve seen a reasonable step up in the outflows from the bank loan ETFs. To what extent do you think the ETF outflows is sort of a leading indicator for what you will see in floating rate products? And then maybe just how are the floating rate products holding up more recently given what we are seeing elsewhere? Thomas E. Faust Jr.: Yes. Just focusing on the U.S mutual fund business, we\u2019ve seen outflows from the bank loan categories. So similar to what you are describing on the ETF side in the last -- based on industry data that we\u2019ve seen in the last four weeks of industry flows for bank loans have been negative. As you point out that, we believe that relates to increasing concerns about credit. We\u2019ve not been immune to these effects. We\u2019ve seen some outflows at least on some days from our bank loan strategies this month. So there has been a reversal at least partly from the strong inflows that we experienced over the course of fiscal 2018. It's a little hard to say whether there's carry through on this current concern. There has been a little bit, but not much price volatility in the bank loan sector and in some ways that\u2019s healthy, because one of the concerns has been that as new loans are brought to market, they\u2019re brought with tighter spreads or that rates reset on existing loans, which brings down the spread we earn over LIBOR. With the softening of the market, there's we think a healthy effect of mitigating some of those downward pressures on spreads. So -- but everything cuts both ways here, right. So people are more concerned about credit. So that means spreads on new issues are better from the standpoint of buyers, but it also means that at least in the short run we are experiencing some retail flows in connection with growing concerns about credit markets. I would say that looking at the underlying fundamentals, which ultimately will govern whether this is a good time or a bad time to be selling or buying bank loans, certainly, our team is not seeing anything in our portfolios to suggest that there's been a change in credit market conditions. That doesn\u2019t mean that there won't be at some point. We\u2019re pretty long into the current economic cycle. We\u2019re mindful of that just like everyone else is, but we\u2019re not seeing anything in our portfolio that would appear to justify the market concern or the softness in prices that we\u2019ve been seeing in loans over the last couple of weeks. And that softness -- pricing softness has been quite modest. It is not surprising, given the flow dynamic we've experienced. Ken Worthington : Okay, great. Thank you for that. And then just maybe an update on NextShares. I believe during the quarter one of your partners either announced or did dissolve, I think two of their NextShares funds. Maybe what happened there and what were the -- you usually call the expenses that you\u2019ve incurred. If you did, I apologize, I missed it. But if not, what were the expenses you incurred for NextShares this quarter? Thomas E. Faust Jr.: Yes. So the announcement that you are referring to was not during the quarter. It was actually the last week that Gabelli announced that they would be converting two of their four NextShares funds into mutual fund. Hasn't happened yet, but they\u2019ve announced that they will be doing that. I don\u2019t know exactly when, but sometime coming up. I guess, the implications of that maybe are obvious, which is that they\u2019ve been disappointed with the sales success that they\u2019ve had with those strategies and think they might be able to sell more with the same strategy and our conventional mutual fund structure. That doesn\u2019t surprise us. We\u2019ve seen -- we look closely at all the mutual -- all that flows into NextShares' funds, not just our own, but those of our licensees and there really hasn\u2019t been a lot of activity, which is reflective of the limited distribution that we\u2019ve had. We\u2019ve been as talked about on the last quarter, we\u2019ve in the absence of significant sales, we\u2019ve been ramping down our marketing activities and bringing down expenses related to NextShares. We are in the range roughly of $2.5 million to $3 million annual spending currently. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is open. Robert Lee : Great. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe starting with you Tom, I would like to -- maybe like dive into a little bit more about your comment about positioning Eaton Vance for kind of a changing environment. Maybe give us some sense of specific initiatives that maybe you\u2019ve underway that you think are doing that? And then, as part of that, has the kind of rapidly changing environment in your view at all maybe changed how you think about perspective M&A. Obviously, you -- Calvert and others in the past, you\u2019ve done these bolt on transactions, but -- now you kind of maybe change how you are thinking in light of M&A, particularly given what investors are doing that kind of change the landscape at all? Thomas E. Faust Jr.: Yes. Thanks, Rob. The -- there are several things going on related to changes in the industry dynamics that I'd point to. Maybe first and most obviously with the market sell off over the last few weeks that has an immediate effect on revenues and so we\u2019re -- we will be tightening up certain spending initiatives in response to that, assuming that there are some carry forward of that. You shouldn\u2019t expect large changes from us on the expense side. We\u2019ve generally taken the view that our strong financial position and margins and cash balances give us the flexibility to invest during periods of market weakness and we will continue to do that. Some of the things on the new initiative side that I'd point to relating to a changing industry environment, clearly our lineup of customized index and laddered bonds, separate accounts, very much play to a couple of current themes in the market. One of those is the growth of passive versus active and the other is the increased desire among investors and intermediaries for customized positions. We\u2019re the market leader in each of those markets and while we expect increased competition, we also see those as significant growth areas where we\u2019re very committed to maintaining our leadership position. Another thing I would point to is our long-term initiative related to responsible investing. You mentioned the acquisition of Calvert, we think we are still in the early stages of growing out our capabilities in responsible investing and seeing that translate into increasingly important part of our business. This is more cyclical than long-term, but we do see a cyclical benefit to us from our floating rate, short duration, adjustable rate, ultra short, a lot of categories of income strategies where we\u2019ve planted seeds and are now seeing strong growth in strategies that are designed to appeal to investors who are concerned about rising interest rates. So at some point that changes, but we made the decision maybe four or five years ago that we were nearing the end of a long bull market in bonds and that it made sense for us to add to our portfolio, a number of bonds that typically carry like short duration, sometimes variations on that, but that enable income investors to invest with less exposure to interest rate risk. And so we think we are quite well positioned to benefit from that theme as well. In terms of industry consolidation and how Eaton Vance might or might not fit into that idea, I certainly believe that our industry is ripe for consolidation. We think that for our key intermediaries there are far more people knocking on their door requesting shelf space than there are available slots and that one way or another that will translate into increased consolidation. By its nature, the passive businesses is an economy of scale business where it makes sense that market share will be relatively concentrated, although that\u2019s not true on the same basis. In active management, we feel like the decreased opportunity will ultimately lead to consolidation there as well. In terms of the specifics of the Invesco transaction, I certainly won't comment on that, but one thing we and other potential acquirers look at is how transactions are received in the marketplace. So critical to us or anyone else looking at a potential acquisition is not only what an acquisition might do for us in terms of increasing our earnings power or improving our strategic position, but we are also very mindful of how that -- how acquisitions are perceived in the marketplace. So if we lose more in PE than we gain in E, we don\u2019t view that as a positive transaction. Of course, you don't know those things in advance, but we want to look at things that we might do that will add to the long-term value of our franchise, both in terms of earnings near-term, but also in terms of our ability to grow over the long-term. Our earnings acquisition is nice, but if it comes at the expense of long-term growth potential, that\u2019s not particularly interesting to us. But if we can do as we did in the case of Calvert, add something that really enhances our strategic position, which has positive implications for a multiple, at the same time as we do something that\u2019s accretive to our earnings, that\u2019s the kind of transaction that we are -- that we would be potentially very interested in. Robert Lee : I mean, would it be fair to say that you don\u2019t feel that you particularly have say a scale issue in the U.S mutual fund business or anything that you feel kind of your size and scale that\u2019s good? Thomas E. Faust Jr.: I fell like our size and scale is good, not in the context of $500 billion is necessarily at scale. It might or might not be. What we believe is more relevant is the scale of our leading investment franchises. We are certainly at scale world class by any measure in bank loans. We are certainly at scale world class in the Parametric Custom Indexing business and their exposure management business, in the muni and corporate ladder business with Eaton Vance, our global income business, our high yield business, certain of our equity strategies, we could go on. But that to us is critical is that when an advisor or gatekeeper or consultant is thinking about introducing an asset class into a client's portfolio, what providers are on the short list of names that they consider while performance is important there, so also is scale. You need to have a critical mass to be on that short list and in places where we are active, by and large we think we are big enough to be on that shortlist. We are looking to diversify our business. A key part of that is playing into the trend and responsible investing that continues to emerge. But if I had a choice of doing an acquisition that took Eaton Vance from, let's call it $500 billion in AUM to a trillion in AUM, that did nothing for us in terms of our growth rate and did nothing for us in terms of our current earnings power, I wouldn\u2019t see a lot of point in doing that kind of a transaction. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe just Tom, you made some good comments earlier in the presentation on the portfolio implementation in custom beta on the equity side and the covered call writing outflows. Maybe you could just give a little perspective on your outlook for flows within the portfolio and Parametric portfolio implementation products and the sales environment moving into 2019 and whether you see any competition that is emerging that might mute that or do you view this as continuing to be an exceptional growth at that growth category in the industry? Thomas E. Faust Jr.: Yes. So the -- so within the portfolio implementation segment that we report, that\u2019s all Parametric business. A smaller part of that is what they call centralized portfolio management, lower fee, relatively modest flow expectations in that business. But the bigger opportunity there's, the bigger business, the higher fee business and the bigger opportunity is what they refer to as custom core. So this is customized index-based strategies offered in a variety of markets, but U.S retail into the high net worth, multi-family office market and also offered in institutional versions of that strategy. This is a big business for Parametric and one where we\u2019ve very measure, we know market leadership today. There have been announcements of players that are either bringing out new products into this business or increasing their offerings there, that doesn\u2019t surprise us. We think this is today something on the order of maybe let's say $100 billion to $200 billion in assets across the industry, hard to say exactly what that is. But when we look at the opportunity versus multiple trillions of dollars in indexing, just reflected in index mutual funds and index ETFs, we see significant opportunity for custom indexing to grow relative to what we call bulk indexing. Custom indexing has clear tax advantages, in that if you own the same portfolio of stocks in an individual separate account, you can do tax loss harvesting and recognize the value of losses currently, which you cannot do in a fund structure. Also in a fund structure, typically you cannot fund positions in kind, therefore the deferring recognition of gains on initiating a position. Also in a separate account format, you\u2019ve the ability to customize holdings to fit the clients' responsible investing criteria or to account for oversight positions the investor might have in other parts of his or her portfolio. These are things you can't do in a bulk index fund or index ETF. We are quite convinced that custom indexing is positioned to grow and to grow rapidly. And we are quite determined that as that happens, that we will maintain our leadership position in that market. We think increased competition is inevitable, but we also think extensive growth of that market is also inevitable and we\u2019re happy to welcome competitors, because in part, they are going to help make the case that this is a better way to invest in indexed strategies than what many investors are doing today, which to our thinking, if you are investing significant amounts of taxable money in an index-based strategy, with very limited exceptions, you are going to be better off being in a custom index type strategy just -- such as Parametric offers. So we think there is lots of growth opportunity and while we expect more competition, we see lots of room for Parametric to grow in that market even with more competition. Brian Bedell : This is a pretty durable positive net flowing segment of your business even with that and obviously if we do get into tougher market environment in '19, you have a lot of confidence in this still being a positive net flow contributor. Thomas E. Faust Jr.: Certainly based on everything we can say. Brian Bedell : Yes, okay. And then just follow-up on expenses. Thanks for your comments, Laurie on that. Just two of the buckets, the fund related expenses and the other categories those are obviously elevated this quarter. So the comments -- at least on that, but as we think about our run rate going forward in fiscal '19, do we expect to revert back on that? And then, I guess, just from an operating margin perspective for fiscal '19, if we have say a flat market environment and you continue doing what you are doing on the organic growth side, is that a good recipe for significant positive operating leverage. Laurie G. Hylton: Well, just addressing the first question related to fund expenses, I would think that I would not anticipate that our fund expenses in the first quarter are going to go down for all the reasons we highlighted on the call as well as in our text. There are couple of products that have been performing well, where we do have sub-advisory expenses and we\u2019ve also got some funds subsidies associated with those. I don't anticipate given the growth in those franchises that we are going to see a decrease there. So I would not anticipate seeing that go down. In terms of our other expense categories, there are a few significant drivers both for the quarter and for the fiscal year that I would highlight. Facilities, I think we talked a little bit about some increased depreciation expense we took earlier in the year, but looking forward, Parametric is in the process of moving their corporate offices and we will have some incremental headwinds there in terms of our rent expense and other facilities expenses associated with that move. And I would think if you are thinking about your sort of the first quarter of fiscal '19, I would think a mid single-digit expense increase there would be appropriate something in the neighborhood of 5%. In terms of technology, as we\u2019ve noted, we\u2019ve been making some significant investments in terms of our trading platforms and also making investments in Calvert's research platform. I would anticipate, we will continue to make investments in 2019 and also in that sort of investment technology category you got market data that is just going up as a function of doing business in this industry. So I would also anticipate in those areas you are going to see some probably mid single-digit percentage increases just given the level of investment. Maybe just as we think about trying to prognosticate what margins might look like in the first quarter and I\u2019m not going to give a percentage, but if you think about our overall cost structure, about 45% of our costs are variable and about 55% are fixed. The fixed we kind of covered as we talked about the expenses related to facilities into software and market data etcetera, but in terms of our overall comp structure within that, 40% of our comp is variable, around 60% is fixed. And if you look at what we did in fiscal '18, our revenue was up 11%, our operating income was up 15%, our variable compensation was only up 8%. So we are very, very mindful of the rates at which we pay out on our variable compensation and manage that carefully. In terms of the fixed portion of our comp structure, which is again about 60%, you are largely looking at headcount driven expense and our ending headcount was up 8%. Our average is about 7% for the year. Our fixed compensation was up about 9%. Again, we are very, very careful, we are mindful of that headcount adds because we recognize that adding to our fixed cost base that we are not necessarily going to be able to pull levers on immediately in the event of a downturn. So, I think that going into the first quarter, if you kind of keep those metrics in mind, I think the one thing you\u2019ve to also keep in mind is we\u2019ve got seasonal pressures every year in compensation, we highlighted a couple of them in my comments. I would anticipate that sort of the benefit in payroll tax clock reset a headwind that we're going to be facing is roughly in the neighborhood of about $3.5 million to $4 million. We see that every first quarter. We are also going to have the impact of base increases and you will probably have some increase in stock compensation associated not only with retirements in our fourth fiscal quarter, which generally will recognize in terms of the accelerated stock-based compensation expense in the first, but also just increased new grants, the impact of those grants on stock-based compensation in the first quarter. So, some seasonal headwinds that you will see going into the new fiscal year, but we are very, very mindful of how our cost structure works. Very mindful of the triggers that we can pull as we are trying to control the margin. And as we noted on the call, we are just going to be very, very mindful of how we think about expenditures going into fiscal '19 recognizing that we are coming out of a pretty volatile market environment. Operator : I would now like to turn the conference call back over to our presenters. Eric Senay : Do we have any other questions left in the queue. I think we\u2019ve time for maybe one more. Operator : We\u2019ve a question from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Bill Katz : Okay. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. I really appreciate it. So just maybe a two-part question. Tom, you mentioned that doubling your AUM for sort of marginal growth or earnings power is probably not likely. So you step back and think about your franchise. You think about the five initiatives you laid out. Where, if any, do you see some product gaps or geographic opportunity maybe to potentially expand the platform? Thomas E. Faust Jr.: Yes, we\u2019ve a pretty big geographic gaps in almost everything we do. We\u2019ve good coverage of the U.S and limited coverage outside the United States. So we are still about 95% of our assets and revenues are sourced from the U.S. So finding the right partner and finding the right opportunity to grow outside the United States is certainly something that we'd consider, in terms of acquisition activity. Having said that, I feel like a bit of a broken record, we\u2019ve been thinking that way for a long time, but haven't found a suitable partner and frankly don\u2019t know that there's a suitable partner that could -- would make sense for us to jumpstart our business growth outside the United States. We have been growing organically outside the United States, we\u2019ve expanded our office in Tokyo. We added a new facility earlier this year in Frankfurt, we are opening an office in Dublin. So we are growing incrementally, but still would love to find an opportunity to jumpstart that international acquisition -- international expansion through an acquisition, but haven't been able to find it yet. In terms of product areas, I think we\u2019ve pretty good coverage across the landscape of most equities that we -- equity categories, public equities that we carry about fixed income, floating rate income, multi asset strategies. We\u2019ve looked a bit at private assets, maybe there are places either in real estate, private real estate or private debt that might make sense as a complement to our public market securities businesses. So those are things that are possibly of interest and we kick the tires on a few things there, but haven't bitten on anything as yet, but we were interested. We look at lots of different things on the acquisition front. But today have yet to bite on anything. Bill Katz : Okay. And just one last one. Thanks for that answer. Just as I think about your distribution margin and maybe we are not capturing all these ins and outs between what\u2019s going through the management fee line versus what goes through the distribution expense line. How do you sort of see that ratio evolving over the next several years given your focus of where you are growing other products or by distribution segment? Thomas E. Faust Jr.: So just to clarify, what do you mean by distribution margin, Bill? Bill Katz : Well, just if I look at the [indiscernible] revenues less the expenses and think about that ratio, again I apologize if some of that might be embedded in the manufacturing fee space on private mix or even geographic contribution, but it just looked to me like the distribution expenses relative to the revenues were disproportionate over the last couple of quarters, I\u2019m trying to see if there's more of a trend that [indiscernible]. Thomas E. Faust Jr.: Yes, so you are looking at distribution relative to revenues, relative to distribution expenses, is that right? Do you want to try and answer that? Laurie G. Hylton: I think the only thing I would say is obviously there's significant pass-throughs in terms of distribution, service fee income and distribution expense and one other component that's in the distribution expense obviously is other marketing expenses associated with for example, our marketing support payments to our third-party intermediaries, which is never an expense line item that\u2019s going down, given that it's largely driven by asset growth. So we haven't noticed anything structurally in terms of a significant change there. So I\u2019m not sure what is driving your question, but hopefully recognizing that there are other distribution line items including promotion and marketing that are going into the distribution expense line item that might actually be factoring into what you're seeing. Thomas E. Faust Jr.: I think, we may have lost the line. Okay. Very good. Well, operator I think this concludes our call for today. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. Thomas E. Faust Jr.: Thank you.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Eaton Vance Corp fiscal first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Eric Senay, please go ahead. Eric Senay : Thank you and good morning and welcome to our fiscal 2019 first quarter earnings call and webcast.  With me this morning are Tom Faust, Chairman and CEO of Eaton Vance, and Laurie Hylton, our CFO. In today's call, we will first comment on the quarter and then take your questions. The full earnings release and charts we will refer to during the call are available on our Web site, eatonvance.com under the heading, Investors Relations. Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainties in our business, including, but not limited to, those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings, including our 2018 Annual Report and Form 10-K, are available on our Web site or upon request at no charge. I will now turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Faust : Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us.  Earlier today, Eaton Vance reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.73 for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, a decrease of 6% from the $0.78 of adjusted earnings per diluted share we reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and a decline of 14% from the record $0.85 of adjusted earnings per diluted share we reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. The market backdrop for the first two months of our fiscal first quarter was challenging in our respects. From the end of October till the close of trading on Christmas eve U.S. equity market is represented by the S&P 500 fell 13.4% as investors fled to safety amid concerns about a really hoc issue as monetary policy and rising trade tensions. In November and December Eaton Vance lost approximately $15.4 billion in managed assets to market price declines. During the first two months of the quarter, we also saw a sharp downward shift in our floating rate bank loan fund flows reflecting rising apprehension about the future course of the economy and tax motivated sign [ph] as the end of the calendar year approached. Across our lineup of us floating rate loan mutual funds, we moved from that inflows of approximately $500 million per month and the August to October timeframe to net outflows of nearly $600 million in November and net outflows of $1.8 billion in December. Flows of our global macro absolute return, mutual funds were told long and short positions in currency and sovereign credit instruments in emerging and frontier market countries were similarly affected with net outflows accelerating from an average of just over $200 million per month in August to October, to nearly $500 million in November and over $1.1 billion in December. Fortunately, January saw a big improvement in both market performance and our flow trends as investors responded to positive economic reports and Fed signaling of a more accommodative policy. From the Christmas Eve market bottom, the S&P 500 rallied 14.9% through the end of January, driving market related gains and are managed assets of $19.2 billion in the month of January, more than offsetting the November-December market related AUM declines. January also saw sharp abatement in our bank on mutual fund outflows to just over $200 million and a recovery in our global macro mutual fund flows to just about breakeven. On an overall basis, excluding exposure management, we improve to consolidate and then inflows of nearly $3 billion in October it's in excuse me, we improved to consolidate in that inflows of nearly $3 billion in January from that outflows of $1.3 billion in December, and that net inflows a $500 million in November.  Despite the strong December headwinds, we closed the first quarter with consolidated net inflows at $1.5 billion or 2.2 billion excluding exposure management. This is our 18th consecutive quarter of reporting positive net flows, demonstrating the benefits of offering investment strategies that span the spectrum. The quarter\u2019s net flow is equated to 1% annualized growth and consolidated managed assets. Our internal growth in management fee revenue was minus 4% annualized in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 but improved as the quarter progressed from not from minus 7% annualized in November-December to plus 4% annualized in January.  As we have described previously, this measure of our underlying business growth subtracts management fees attributable to consolidated outflows from management fees attributable to consolidated inflows, and then measures that difference as a percentage of beginning of the period consolidated management fee revenue. We ended the first fiscal quarter with $444.7 billion of consolidated assets under management of 1% over the prior quarter end. For the quarter individual separate account assets under management increased 5%, private fund assets increased 2%, institutional separate accounts grew 1% closed in funds fell 2% and open in fund assets shrank by 3%. Among investment mandate reporting categories, changes in consolidated assets under management during the first quarter ranged from growth of 6% for fixed income and 4% for portfolio implementation to two kinds of 9% for floating rate bank loans and 18% for alternatives, a reporting category dominated by our global macro absolute return strategies. Fixed Income quarterly net inflows of $3.2 billion benefited from strong investor demand for short and ultrashort duration and high-quality income investments in what was primarily a risk off environment. With net inflows have over $1.6 billion during the quarter, the five-star rated Eaton Vance short duration government income fund was by a wide margin our top selling fun on a net basis. Other flow leaders among our fixed income funds or the Eaton Vance short duration municipal opportunities and floating rate miniscule income funds with over $250 million of combine net inflows. Fixed income net flows in the quarter also included $1.5 billion into municipal and corporate ladder bond individual separate accounts and $600 million into high yield bond institutional separately managed accounts. Portfolio implementation quarterly net inflows of $3.4 billion were dominated by parametric custom core equity separate accounts. Per metric remains the largest player in the rapidly growing market for custom indexing, sometimes also referred to as direct indexing.  Custom indexing provides potential advantages over index funds and index ETFs that include greater tax efficiency and the tailoring of holdings to reflect client specified responsible investment criteria and other client directed portfolio exclusions. As this market continues to expand, we're committed to invest into support business growth drive increased operating efficiencies and to further extend our service capabilities. As in past quarters, we have included in the slides coming this presentation, a chart showing to managed assets inflows of what we refer to as our custom beta businesses, which are individual separately managed accounts offered to retail and high net worth investors that are invested in Parametric Custom Core equity or EVM laddered bond strategies. These high value offerings combine the benefits of passive investing with the ability to customize portfolios to meet individual preferences and needs. As shown in slide 12, our custom beta managed assets increase 6% from $84.3 billion at the end of fiscal 2018 to $90 billion at the end of our first fiscal quarter. The $3.9 billion of first quarter custom beta net inflows equates to annualized internal growth and managed assets of 19%. While these businesses are attracting each increased competition. We continue to believe they offer vast growth opportunities. Our Calvert responsible investment subsidiary was also significant driver of growth this quarter. Total Calvert managed assets including amount sub-advised by other Eaton Vance affiliates increased by approximately $700 million to $15.4 billion at the end of the first quarter covered $600 million of net inflows for the quarter equates to 17% annualized internal growth and managed assets. Ranking is the best growth quarter since we acquired the Calvert business just over 2 years ago. Our Calvert offerings spend a wide range of equity income and multi asset strategies managed in accordance with responsible investment principles. In support of building our leadership and responsible investing, we continue to invest in Calvert to expand their ESG research in corporate engagement capabilities. We are also investing to build greater connectivity across our investment organization to support the integrated consideration of responsible investing criteria into the fundamental research processes of Eaton Vance Management and Atlanta Capital. Capitalizing on the proprietary ESG research the Calvert provides. We are also working to expand Calvert's presence and influence in the growing dialogue around responsible investing. Earlier this month, Calvert collaborated with barons for the second year in a row to provide the research supporting the annual barons cover story identifying and ranking the 100 most sustainable of the thousand largest public companies headquarter in U.S. Based on measures of how each of these companies treat shareholders, employees, customers, their communities and the planet. Away from Calvert, our first quarter equity flows were mixed. We saw net inflows of $800 million into Parametric defensive equity mandates and over $600 million into Eaton Vance investment council's private wealth management business offset by $700 million of outflows from Parametric emerging market equities. Across all our affiliates, we realized approximately $750 million of consolidated net inflows into equity mandates in the quarter. As mentioned previously, we saw net investor outflows from our floating rate loan mutual funds, offering the U.S. totaling $2.6 billion in the quarter within that net withdrawals concentrated in December. Across the balance of our floating rate business net outflows were a more modest $300 million as institutional withdrawals were partially offset by higher borrowing balances in leverage loan funds. Within our floating rate loan business. We announced yesterday, the promotion of our long-time director of loan trading and capital markets Andrew Sveen to become Co-Director of the loan group effective March 1st. In that role, Andrew will serve alongside Craig Russ and replace Scott Page, who becomes the Senior Advisor to the group. Andrew's promotion reflects his outstanding contributions to Eaton Vance over his 20 years with the firm and our confidence in his leadership abilities. Scott's movement into a Senior Advisor role closes his remarkable leadership of the bank loan group dating back to 1996, a time when Eaton Vance's bank on business and the asset class as a whole were just beginning to emerge. We are fortunate that Scott will remain closely involved with the loan group of Senior Advisor and Andrew is ready to take the step in his career advancement. Turning to our alternatives reporting category, the quarter's net outflows of $2.2 billion were driven by $1.6 billion of net withdrawals from our global macro absolute return and global macro absolute advantage U.S. mutual funds. As previously mentioned like our floating rate mutual fund withdraws global macro net outflows were concentrated primarily in December and substantially abated in January. In exposure management, we saw $700 million in first quarter net outflows as net reductions in existing client positions more than offset assets gained in the net addition of three new client relationships during the quarter. What changes in client positions can move exposure management assets up or down from period to period the underlying growth in this business is measured by the number of active client relationships remains in place? Close readers of our financial statements will be noticed that we modified our reporting of assets inflows this quarter to combine the previously separate retail managed account and high network separate account reporting categories into a single individual separate account reporting category. This change recognizes the narrow distinctions between the previous reporting categories and better highlights our large and growing business of managing separate accounts for individuals and families. Led by the per metric custom core equity and EVMIR bond offerings that we group under our custom data label this business continues to expand at a rapid cliff. Today we are among the market leaders in individual separately managed accounts with managed assets of a 126.7 billion and some 80,000 in-house managed customized individual accounts. As we scale this business, we recognized the need for ever increasing operating efficiency and continue to invest in technology to advance that objective. You may have seen the press release issued last week announcing that Eaton Vance\u2019s filed an exemptive application with the SEC seeking permission to offer ETFs that would employ a novel method of supporting efficient secondary market trading in their shares which we call the clear hedge method. Because disclosure of current holdings would not be necessary and ETFs portfolio trading activity could remain confidential. In addition to facilitating the introduction across fund asset classes of ETFs employing proprietary active investment strategies the clear hedge method could also be used by existing ETFs holding foreign and less liquid investments to enhance their secondary market trading performance. Aspects of the clear hedge method are subject to issued and pending U.S. patents held by Eaton Vance. In conjunction with filing an exemptive application Eaton Vance has formed a new subsidiary advance to fund solutions to manage the development and commercialization of ETFs utilizing the clear hedge method and other fund related intellectual property. Our next year solution subsidiary becomes part of advanced fund solutions and Steven Clarke President of Next Share Solutions is assuming the same roll at advanced fund solutions. We don\u2019t know how or when the SEC will respond to the clear hedge method application or other proposals to offer proprietary active ETFs, we do believe there is a compelling case supporting our proposed approach. Positive action could set the stage for broader range of proprietary active strategies becoming available to ETFs investors for the first time, negative action could summit next year\u2019s position as the only exchange related product structure that is compatible with proprietary active management. Either outcome could provide a significant opportunity for Eaton Vance. In closing let me say that these are busy active times at Eaton Vance as we continue to advance multiple growth initiatives and work to position our business for continued success in the evolving asset management industry. That concludes my prepared remarks and I will now turn the call over to Laurie. Laurie Hylton : Thank you and good morning.  As Tom mentioned we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.72 for the first quarter fiscal 2019 a decrease of 6% from $0.78 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the first quarter fiscal 2018 and a decrease of 14% from $0.85 of adjusted earnings per diluted share reported in the fourth quarter fiscal 2018. As you can see an attachment to our press release GAAP earnings exceeded adjusted earnings by $0.02 per diluted share in the first quarter fiscal 2019 to reflect reverse full of $2.9 million of net excess tax benefits recognized during the period related to stock-based awards.  In the first quarter of fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings exceeded GAAP earnings by $0.15 per diluted share reflecting the add back of $24.7 million of income tax expense recognized in relation to the non-recurring impact of the tax law changes and a $6.5 million charge recognized from the exploration of the company\u2019s option to acquire an additional 26% ownership interest and our 49% owned affiliate additional 26% ownership interest in our 49% own affiliate Hexavest, partially offset by the reversal of $11.9 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based awards.  In the fourth quarter fiscal 2018, GAAP earnings exceeded adjusted earnings by $0.02 per diluted share to reflect the reversal of $2.4 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based awards. As Tom mentioned, the market backdrop for the quarter, particularly for the first two months was particularly challenging. Operating Income decreased by 11% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, primarily driven by the decrease in management fee revenue this quarter. Our operating margin was 29.8% in the first quarter fiscal 2019 versus 32.3% in the first quarter fiscal 2018 and 33.5% in the fourth quarter fiscal 2018.  Having exited our fiscal year 2018 reporting new highs in terms of both quarterly and annual earnings, it was disappointing to take a market driven step back and operating income in this quarter ending consolidated managed assets of 444.7 billion at January 31, 2019 were down 1% year-over-year as positive net flows over the past 12 months were more than offset by market price declines versus the end of our fiscal 2018 consolidated managed assets were up 1%, reflecting modestly positive market returns and net flows during the quarter. Although average managed assets were up 1% from the same period last year, management fee revenue was down 3%, reflecting a 4% decrease in our average annualized management fee revenue rate from 33.3 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 to 32 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Average managed assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 were down 4% sequentially driving a 6% decrease in management fee revenue. The decline in management fee revenue exceeded the decline in average managed assets, primarily due to a 2% decrease in our average annualized management fee revenue rate from 32.7 basis points in the fourth quarter fiscal 2018 to 32 basis points in the first quarter fiscal 2019. The decline in our average annualized management fee rate over the comparative periods was driven primarily by shifts in our business mix from higher fee to lower fee mandate. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, annualized internal growth and management fee revenue of negative 4% trailed annualized internal growth and manage assets of 1%, primarily due to the mix of higher fee and lower fee strategies within our outflows and inflows during the quarter. This compares to 4% annualized internal growth in management fee revenue on 7% annualized internal growth in managed assets in the first quarter fiscal 2018 and 1% annualized internal growth in management fees on 2% annualize internal growth in managed assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Turning to expenses, compensation decreased by 1% from the first quarter fiscal 2018, primarily driven by lower operating income-based bonus accruals, and a decrease in stock-based compensation partially offset by higher salaries and benefits associated with increases in headcount and year end merit adjustments.  Sequentially, compensation expense increased by 4% from the fourth quarter fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting an increase in stock-based compensation related to the annual awards granted to employees in November, higher salaries and benefits driven by increases in headcount and seasonal compensation factors including payroll tax clock resets 401-K funding and fiscal year end merit increases, all partially offset by lower operating income based bonus accruals. Non-compensation distribution related costs, including distribution and service fee expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased 6% from the same quarter a year ago, and 7% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower distribution service fee expenses driven by a decrease in average managed assets and share classes that are subject to these fees and lower marketing and promotion costs partially offset by higher commissioning amortization for certain private funds. Funds related expenses were up 5% year-over-year reflecting higher average managed assets and sub advised funds versus a year ago quarter and were down 2% sequentially reflecting lower average managed assets and sub advised funds versus the prior quarter. Other operating expenses increased 13% from the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and decreased 2% from the fourth quarter fiscal 2018. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher information technology spending attributable mainly to expenditures associated with the consolidation of our trading platforms and enhancements to Calvert's research system and higher facilities expense related to expansion of rental space and higher depreciation of leasehold improvements.  The sequential quarterly decrease primarily reflects lower professional services expenses due to a decrease in corporate consulting and external legal costs, partially offset by an increase in charitable contributions. We continue to focus on overall expense management and identifying ways to gain operational leverage. Net gains and other investment income on seed capital investments were negligible in the first quarters of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 and contributed a penny to earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter fiscal 2018. When quantifying the impact of our seed capital investments on earnings each quarter, we take into consideration our pro rata shares the gains losses and other investment income earned on investments in sponsored strategies, whether accounted for us consulted funds, separate accounts for equity investments, as well as the gains and losses recognized on derivatives use to hedge these investments.  Within report the per share impact net of income taxes and net income attributable to non-controlling interest. We continue to hedge the market exposures of our seed capital portfolio to the extent practicable to minimize the associated or in volatility. Net gains and other investment income in the first quarter fiscal 2018 included a $6.5 million charge related to the exploration of the company's option to acquire an additional interest in Hexavest. We excluded this one-time charge from our calculation of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter fiscal 2018. Non-operating income expense included $2.9 million of net expense allocation from consolidated CLO entities in the first quarter fiscal 2019 and that income contribution of $1.6 million and $0.4 million from consolidated CLO entities in the first quarter fiscal 2018 and the fourth quarter fiscal 2018 respectively. Year over year and sequential decreases in income contribution from consolidated CLO entities primarily relates to a decline and fair value of the company's beneficial interest in these entities, resulting from a downturn in the loan market during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Turning to taxes. Our effective tax rate was 23.4% for the first quarter fiscal 2019, 36.3% in the first quarter fiscal 2018 and 26.4% in the fourth quarter fiscal 2018. The company's income tax provision for the first quarter fiscal 2019 includes $0.6 million of charges associated with certain provisions of the 2017 Tax Act relating to limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation that began taking effect for the company in fiscal 2019. The company's income tax provision was reduced by net excess tax benefits related to stock-based awards totaling $2.9 million in the first quarter fiscal 2019. $11.9 million in the first quarter fiscal 2018, and $2.4 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2018. The company's income tax provision for the first quarter fiscal 2018 also included a non-recurring charge $24.7 million to reflect the estimated effects of the U.S. federal tax law changes that were enacted in the first quarter fiscal 2018. As shown an attachment 2 to our press release, our calculations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share remove the net excess tax benefits related to stock-based awards and the non-recurring impact of the tax law changes.  On this basis, our adjusted effective tax rate was 25.9% in the first quarter fiscal 2019, 26.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and 28.6% in the fourth quarter fiscal 2018. On the same adjusted basis, we estimate that our quarterly effective tax rate for the balance of fiscal 2019 and for the fiscal year as a whole will range between 25.9% and 26.4%. During the first quarter fiscal 2019, we use $43.2 million of corporate cash to pay the $0.35 per share of quarterly dividend declared at the end of our previous quarter, and repurchased 3.1 million shares of non-diluting common stock for approximately $115 million. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding $115.5 million in the first quarter fiscal 2019, down 7% year-over-year, and 5% sequentially, reflecting share repurchases and exits of new shares issued upon investing of restricted stock awards and exercise employee stock options and a decrease in the diluted effect of in the money options and unvested restricted stock award. We finished our first fiscal quarter holding $698.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term debt securities, and approximately $337.4 million and seed capital investments. These amounts compared to outstanding debt obligations of $625 million. We continue to place high priority on using the company\u2019s cash flow to benefit shareholders. Given revenue weakness and growth in fixed expenses fiscal discipline around discretionary spending remains top of mind in fiscal 2019. Based on our strong liquidity and overall financial condition we believe we are well positioned to continue managing our business for long term growth through the current weakness while also continuing to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This concludes our prepared comments and at this point we\u2019d like to take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Daniel [ph] of Jefferies. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks. Actually, Gerry O'Harris [ph] sitting in for Dan this morning. Appreciate the color around the bank loan flows for into quarter but perhaps you could maybe elaborate a little bit on the outlook for flows products was a flat to even potentially declining interest rate environment going forward? Thomas Faust : Yes, so there were a couple of things that occurred in the quarter that adversely affected the flows. One, relating to a changing view on where short-term interest rates might be going. Second, relating to where it looked like the economy might be going is the potential there for credit losses in full investment grade assets like floating rate loans. And the third was, yearend tax law [ph] selling. And as we look at the outlook from here, we\u2019re not in a position where we\u2019re going to see yearend tax law selling at least not anytime soon. From our read of the economy, there is not a substantial chance of a recession or a dramatic weakness occurring over the next few quarters anyway for what\u2019s visible.  In terms of where rates are going, I think we\u2019re in a position where investors could see long term rates frankly move either way and also where there is some potential albeit diminished for continuing upward movement in short term rates. What people need to understand about bank loans is that you don\u2019t need increases in short term rates for this to be a favorable investment. If you can look at yields on the funds today based on where rates are today and the potential for recovery overtime of some of the old ground that was lost on valuations in the December declines, we think we\u2019re positioned for high single-digit type annualized returns in the asset class even in the absence of upward movement in short term rates which we believe many investors will find attractive. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s helpful. And perhaps one for Laurie looks like there is an accounting change in early November could you perhaps help us unpack this solo maybe which line items and revenue or even expense side of the P&L were impacted? Laurie Hylton : Yes, the most significant impact of the new accounting pronouncement related to the reclassification of fund subsidies so previously under the old accounting guidance, we recorded fund subsidies as a component of fund expenses and under the new guidance we need to actually bring that up to the top line and actually report that as a contour revenue amount against the management fees. So, you\u2019ll see that we adopted the new account pronouncement using a full retrospective application so the numbers you\u2019re seeing are full apples-to-apples comparison going back for all periods presented. But just to kind of give you the numbers that really kind of moving the numbers around a little bit on the revenue side.  The subsidies that we moved from expense up to a control management fee representation where a total for the quarter were $9.2 million for the previous quarter so Q4 of 2018 were $8.7 million and then for the first quarter of 2018 more felt $5.7 million so those are the numbers that are now being netted against management fees and are affecting not only the obviously the absolute dollar amount of management fees presented but also impacting our affective fee rates and then all the calculations. So again, we did the full retrospective application all prior periods had been changed to reflect those that movement including our effective fee calculation by mandate category. Unidentified Analyst : So, the net impact of that is that the revenues go down and reported expenses also go down. So, margins go up. There was also a second aspect of that change, although smaller had the opposite effect on margins. You want to talk about that? Laurie Hylton : Yes. At the end of the day and just be clear, operating income didn't change at all, this is all just movement around categories. But on the distribution side, there was a modest required between distribution expense and distribution income. And by quarter, it was somewhere in the neighborhood of $3.5 million to $4.5 million.  So that was far less impactful, because obviously one of the biggest drivers of the business right now is looking at our effective fee rates in terms of our management fees. So that had far less impact, but it muted the impact on margin of the management fee change. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for taking our questions. Operator : Your next question today comes from the line of our Ari Ghosh of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Ari Ghosh : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe the first one for Laurie back on expenses. I know that the restatement impact of the distribution and services lines on this quarter. But can you help us think about comp and other expense line for 2019? Is the 36% still a reasonable called margin range for fiscal '19 and then on the other expenses? Should we expect the 53 million per quarter to drift low a little bit, just given that you're done our platform in creation projects? Laurie Hylton : Yes, I think we're still continuing to invest. So, I wouldn't make any assumptions about our longer-term investments on the technology side. I think that we've got, and Tom identified in his comments earlier. We're continuing to invest both in Calvert and also on our platforming around separate accounts and will be thinking more about that as the year progresses. From a comp perspective,  I think that the comp range is reasonable. I think that obviously in periods like we saw this quarter, where you had a significant downturn -- down take in the management fees, the mix between variable and fix is going to shift a little bit. But we would not anticipate seeing anything significantly changed in terms of our overall comp ratios. Ari Ghosh : Got it. And then on the fee rates. Can you talk about the core trends that drove the lower fee rate this quarter? Was more mix shift driven by product to channel within these asset classes? Any additional color here would be helpful. And then you mentioned the improvement in the organic revenue growth in January and throughout the quarter. Is -- are you seeing that in Feb as well? Can you just give us an update on how that's tracking for that? Thomas Faust : Yes. So, let me just -- I'll start with the organic revenue growth. We don't calculate work, it's a fairly involved calculation. So, we don't do a daily updated organic revenue growth this was actually the first time, we've broken it out on a monthly basis into quarter. So, we don't -- I have a sense of exactly where we are in February, but it feels like the tone of the business remains positive. We do see daily flow data, we can approximate what that looks like from an organic revenue growth perspective. So, generally the positive tone of January continues with solid net inflows for the month to date in February. In terms of drivers of -- our declining average fee rate. It's 2 things, it is mix of business that is both across categories and within reporting categories. Generally, we're adding business or adding more business at lower fee rates. And in some cases, we're losing higher fee assets. There was also some, I would say it's a secondary effect, but also there was some re-pricing of existing mandates. Particularly in the first quarter, I highlighted in my comments. The net outflows from our bank on mutual funds and our global macro mutual funds, both of which happened to be among our higher fee strategies.  So, in this particular case, it was really the outflows from those plus the fact that our inflows are in things like custom beta that are lower fees. That really accounts for the continuing movement downward. But we view this as a long-term secular trend and expect to manage our business accordingly. Ari Ghosh : I'll get back in the queue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Patrick Devin : Thank you, good morning. On the exposure -- on the parametric side and custom data stuff, I know you\u2019ve always kind of highlighted how high touch that can be. As a part of the investment process, working towards ways to maybe automate that business a bit more in order to eke out a bit more operating leverage? Thomas Faust : Well, so we manage across parametric. I think it's something on the order of 40,000 individual separate accounts. So it has to be highly automated for that to work, particularly given average fee rates across that business in 20 basis point range. So let's say -- so we're -- we think we're already pretty good at serving customized individual separate accounts investors on an cost effective basis. We expect over time to get even better to continue investing in technology and improving our operating efficiency to drive down service costs. And those costs are primarily reflective of the number of accounts. So it's -- although our fees tend to be AUM-based or [indiscernible] O-AUM base, our cost in that business are primarily account based.  So the margin is sensitive to average account size and also to our costs per account. And we very much focus on trying to drive those down as much as possible because we expect and we hope that as our business grows, we will expand the range of assets and investors that we serve. That will likely have the effect of driving down average account sizes.  So we need to drive up our operating efficiency so that we can drive down our per unit operating costs, so that we can maintain profitability levels as we bring down average account sizes. Patrick Devin : Helpful. Thank you. And then I think you just mentioned the re-pricing of some existing mandates. Could you expand on that a bit? And is it something that you think was fairly idiosyncratic to the quarter or a trend developing with -- a certain core climates or something? Thomas Faust : No. There were no material individual repricings during the quarter, certainly nothing to call out. I was just commenting on the general trend in our business that fees are moving lower. Sometimes that's in response to agreements with individual clients, or intermediaries or fund trustees, but frankly more often it's driven by competitive forces where our sales teams or marketing organization generally recommends that we lower prices in a particular asset class because we think that will make our strategies more saleable. Patrick Devin : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks, good morning. Maybe just following on that question on the pricing pressure; obviously mix shift there as you alluded to is a major driver of that. But within the two buckets where we saw the biggest compression in the equity area and the alternative area, I guess maybe Tom, if you could comment on to what extent that was caused by the repricing versus just simply mix shift within those categories. And if it's mix shift, should we expect that fee rate to bump back up in the next quarter, given that positive trends within geography. Thomas Faust : Yes, Brian in both of those categories, it would certainly be overwhelmingly mix shift. I can't promise that it's going to reverse in future quarters. If you look at the alternatives category, the Global Macro Absolute Return Advantage Fund, which has embedded leverage in it, and therefore has a higher return potential commends a higher fee. We saw an increase in the average fee rate within that category a year ago or over the early quarters of fiscal 2018 as the global macro advantage version grew relative to the category as a whole. With the outflows from the global macro strategies including global macro advantage in the fourth quarter that reversed. Within equities, I would say the primary driver, there has been new business gained at relatively low fee rates. That includes a large investment council client, that includes our parametric defensive equity mandates which are at lower than average equity fee rates.  Also, some of the inflows at Calvert are in index-based strategies, including their largest index-based bond, which is at 19 basis point expense ratio for the institutional share class. So it's really very much in those two cases in particular, very much driven by mix shift for. Laurie Hylton : Parametric emerging markets. Thomas Faust : Yes, thanks, Laurie. To go on the other direction parametric emerging markets where we had I think about $700 million of net outflows in the quarter, is an above average fee rate. So it's gaining assets in lower fee strategies and losing assets in higher fee strategies. Unfortunately that's the way of the world these days in asset management. Brian Bedell : Yes. Now it's very clear. Thank you. And then just to follow up, I mean maybe Tom if you could talk a little bit about the clear head application, how you think that's differentiated from the I think it's probably closest to sort of a T row [ph] type of application as opposed to precision. But maybe how you see that differentiated and you mentioned also if there's negative action -- no action on it. Do you think that will become a catalyst for the ETM app and maybe you could give a sense of timing on that I guess if that's possible? Thomas Faust : Sure. So the clear hedges one of now a series of half dozen or so exempted applications before the SEC, relating primarily to the ability to offer ETFs that don't disclose their full holdings on a current daily basis. Most of those the proposition is that the fund will disclose on a daily basis using different technology, but different terminology. But I'll call them a reference portfolio that was something that looks like smells like behaves like the fund's actual portfolio but does not include all the current holdings where the delta is designed to preserve the confidentiality of current trading.  The concern has been that a proxy portfolio, I'll call it, while on clear days may perform adequately particularly in asset classes like U.S. equities that in harder asset classes like international securities or less liquid securities, or across all asset classes during periods of significant market volatility, that, that won't be good enough. And that the reference portfolio and the actual portfolio will be subject to what's called basis risk, which market makers will deal with in a very clear way, which is during those times, and for those types of funds they'll deal with, by widening their bid-ask spreads and causing investor trading costs to go up.  Our proposed approach called Clear Edge builds on that approach by not only disclosing a reference portfolio, but also by incorporating a swap facility whereby a market maker or other arbitrage --could enter into transactions with the fund to an effect lay off the relative performance risk between the known hedge portfolio, and the unknown underlying portfolio, so providing a much more reliable basis for ensuring that the funds can be arbitrage effectively across all market environments and across all fund asset classes.  As mentioned in my comments, we were issued a patent on this approach back in October. And it's on that basis that we're looking to not only get approval for these application, but also potentially to license that technology across the fund business. We don't claim to be unbiased but we certainly think that we're all that to the other applications our proposed approach up stacks up very well, in terms of broad applicability and the most assured level of strong secondary market trading performance.  In terms of the impact of this on NextShares, we continue to support our NextShares initiatives. We still face the issue that we have very limited distribution access. As we\u2019ve talked about in previous quarters one of the biggest challenges perhaps the biggest challenge with NextShares has been the competition against the idea that the SEC is about to approve something else that is an ETS, not something like next year\u2019s exchange trader managed fund that requires more of an education process to the advisor and to the underlying and investor as to what this is. What the clear hedge method exemptive application does for us is essentially puts us with a significant leg in both camps, that is if the SEC were to act to approve some or all of these exemptive applications for ETS that don\u2019t disclose their holdings on a daily basis we think we have an idea that stacks up very-well against the competition, and we hope that would translate into approval for our idea and potentially broad market application. If things go the other way and the SEC somehow puts a nail on the coffin on the idea that these things will become approved, that opens up we believe a much greater opportunity to introduce NextShares across the broader range of distribution. As it stands now the NextShares effort is largely on hold in terms of adding new distribution relationships, pending what many perceive as maybe a near term resolution of this issue at the SEC.  Many people are saying we don\u2019t know if this is true or not, that 2019 will decide one way or another whether some of these or all of these concepts get approved. Brian Bedell : Okay very good, great, thanks for that. And then cost for the turnout are relatively immaterial I guess continues to stop [ph] in the distribution in the ETMF? Thomas Faust : Relatively in material yes. Brian Bedell : Okay great. Thomas Faust : And we don\u2019t expect the same kind of cost to be incurred in connection with launching Clear Edge if we\u2019re so lucky to have that opportunity. Our expenses for next years if you look back on it were principally related to training of advisors educating the market and developing technology at the broker-dealer level to accommodate the special way in which NextShares trade.  ETFs involving the Clear Edge method will still be ETFs and will trade in exactly the same way as other ETS and don\u2019t require significant investor education. Brian Bedell : Okay, great, thank you so much. Thomas Faust : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee of KBW. Your line is open. Robert Lee : Good thanks good morning everyone. Could you maybe just follow up a little bit on some of the investment priorities I mean obviously time you called out, contained investment in scaling the separate account business and investing in Calvert in ESG but can you maybe talk a little about some other initiatives and I guess maybe particularly you built out London a few years ago kind of your thoughts about on progress there as well as maybe more globally. Thomas Faust : Yes thanks so just check off you hit most of our list strategic priorities for the year, so building out our specialty solutions for high net worth investors led by the custom beta offerings, responsible investing and when you did mentioned but which I\u2019ll just highlight is floating rate and short duration strategies building on our historical basis of market leader and [indiscernible] to encompass a broader range of short, ultra-short duration strategies. Some of them connected to Calvert some not, some primarily fund vehicles some offered a separate account but broadening our portfolio of businesses relating to short duration floating rate type assets. The fourth priority and the one you\u2019re asking about specifically is growing our business internationally. We seem to be in a holding pattern with about 95% of our assets managed for clients in the U.S. and that\u2019s [indiscernible] of trying to grow our business outside of the United States. You mentioned an effort that we undertook about 3.5 years ago to put in place an equity investment team in London that team continues to operate there.  We are at a point where our lead strategies managed by that team recently gained three year track records and in some cases those were quite attractive three year track records. Particularly in small cap global and international equities, we see an opportunity to gain significant business in 2019, driven by the strength of that three year track record, the reputation of the team that precedes their coming to Eaton Vance.  And also just the fact that small cap is an area of the market where good managers tend to talk with capacity. And so there tends to be more demand for let's call it new managers. And also there's maybe a broader belief that active managers can add value in small cap then in the larger cap asset classes. So I would point to first what we hope will be expanding business in small cap there.  Another angle that we're pursuing to growing our international business relates to Calvert and specifically to the integration of Calvert source ESG Research into our menu of internationally offered, both equity and income strategies, particularly in Europe having a demonstrated integration of responsible investing criteria into your research process is a must have not a want to have, and having Calvert is part of Eaton Vance.  And the work we've done over the last couple of years to integrate their research into our investment offerings -- and when I say our I mean things branded Eaton Vance management as well as things branded Calvert, we hope will begin to pay dividends in the market in 2019. Very strong demand in the market for responsibly invested solutions, very strong respect in the market for what Calvert stands for in that market and the capabilities of its research team, the challenge and the opportunity for us to marry those two things, and to bring out a range of strategies that incorporate that research inside Eaton Vance managed equity and income strategies, particularly focused on the European market. Robert Lee : And maybe, thank you. Maybe kind of corollary or follow up to that. I mean look historically the firm has been reasonably acquisitive. And then looking at well, it was Calvert or Parametric many years ago, along the way in acquiring new capabilities. So when you think of the industry landscape, can you may be helpful if it's possible, kind of thinking about how are you thinking about it incremental, inorganic, opportunities are there specific -- whether it is regions or distribution channels or asset classes that are would be most interested in if there was an inorganic opportunity that came along. Thomas Faust : Yes, we certainly subscribed to the view that the industry needs to consolidate and is likely ripe for consolidation. There have been some challenges to that, in that the rising equity markets of let's say 2017, 2016, 2017 covered a lot of sense for companies that while they were experiencing organic declines in their business, we're seeing top line growth driven by rising prices.  With the declines in the market last year, particularly the acceleration of those in the fourth quarter. I think more companies are aware of the fact that on the active side and unless you have scale also in the passive side, this is a pretty tough business and that there can be significant advantages by combining to gain market strength and potentially also to realize some cost synergies.  We have not done what we would consider consolidation type acquisitions. For the right kind of target we would certainly be interested, they would have -- they would have to be a cultural complementarity, there would have to be clear potential to save costs. But probably most importantly, we would have to have a clear path to understanding that revenues were going to be sustained post transaction.  Always in these things that the risk is that you lose more in revenues then you save in costs. But we're looking at this, Laurie and I spent a fair bit of time chasing down different potential opportunities in most cases we proved to be to price sensitive to be the cases, we proved to be to price sensitive, to be the winners that things come to an auction, where it's outside of an auction situation where people are more focused on the past, supportive owner and supportive investment culture, we tend to do pretty well in those conversations.  Objectives that we have in considering acquisitions, I'd say, first and foremost, adding to the value of our firm. That's number one. So that's a function of -- if we buy something, what does that do potentially for earnings and what does that do potentially to the multiple that the market applies to those earnings recognizing that, if we were to merge with a lower growth company. We might get back more in multiple then we gain in terms of earnings accretion.  If you go down a bit and say, well, what strategic objectives would we like to perhaps advance by growing inorganically. Certainly making our business more global would be one objective. There are certain asset classes that perhaps we would be interested in growing. We don't have a fundamental emerging market equity capability within our company, at least not of size. We have been interested in expanding and leverage credit perhaps into private markets. That's probably covers the landscape. We're interested in growing the Parametric business, if there are complementary businesses that perhaps, we can acquire, that fit in with their systematic rules based approach to investing that would perhaps either add scale or add complementary features or perhaps help us gain new geographies. But we kick the tires on a fair bit of things and so far haven't come up -- haven't emerged victorious in anything since the Calvert transaction two years ago. Robert Lee : Great. Very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions. Thomas Faust : Thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from the line of Mike Carrier of Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Carrier : Thanks, and good morning. Just one for me. Just given some of the mix shift trends that we've seen and then some of the strength that you're seeing in the individual separate accounts, I just wanted to get maybe some color on how we should think about or how you guys are thinking about like the fee rate trends, but then, you probably more importantly, the incremental margins in that channel and the business overall. Laurie, I think you mentioned just given like the market dynamics and expense discipline and then some of the investments to try to drive down like improving efficiency overtime. So just any color on -- what you guys are working on? Or what can give some of the fee rate in the trends in the industry? Laurie Hylton : That's a -- that's pretty broad question. I think that we're very mindful as Tom mentioned, that when we start entering and continue to scale the separate account business, that the margin profile is a little bit different, because it is far less about the variable costs as it is about that sort of fixed cost base that you have to deal with, because it really is an account driven business.  So I think we're really being very thoughtful about that business right now. Because we do recognize that going forward, if we want to scale way beyond the roughly 80,000 separate accounts across the complex that we're currently managing. And we certainly have every intent and desire to do so. We're going to have to make some investments to ensure that we can remain as efficient as possible and ensure that our platforms are scalable as possible. So I would anticipate that we will see incremental investment there, I don't think we have anything that we're quantifying at this point, but we will be making incremental investment. But to that end, if we're able to make those investments, we would hope that we would become on an account-by-account basis, effectively more -- will be able to leverage the business in a more efficient way.  So we continue to think that both sides of the business sort of, our traditional active, as well as the direct indexing and other separate account parts of our business are equally attractive to us and are certainly capable of generating significant operating leverage. But we need to be really thoughtful as we continue to grow these businesses going forward. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Thomas Faust : Okay. Very good. I think we're out of time for today. So at this point, I want to thank everybody for your participation. And we look forward to speaking with you soon. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. You may now connect.",

My name is Julie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Eaton Vance Corp, Second Fiscal Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast.  All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.  Mr. Eric Senay, you may begin your conference. Eric Senay : Thank you and good morning and welcome to our fiscal 2019 second quarter earnings call and webcast. With me this morning are Tom Faust, Chairman and CEO of Eaton Vance, and Laurie Hylton, our CFO.  In today\u2019s call, we will first comment on the quarter and then take your questions. The full earnings release and charts we will refer to during the call are available on our website, www.eatonvance.com under the heading Investors Relations. And today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainties in our business, including but not limited to those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings, including our 2018 Annual Report and Form 10-K are available on our website or upon request at no charge. I will now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Faust : Good morning and thank you for joining us. Earlier today Eaton Vance reported $0.89 of adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, an increase of 16% from the $0.77 of adjusted earnings per diluted share we reported for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and up 22% from the $0.73 of adjusted earnings per diluted share we reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  Our adjusted earnings per diluted share this quarter included a $0.03 contribution from seed capital investments and a $0.07 contribution from investments in consolidated collateralized loan obligation or CLO entities. By comparison seed capital and consolidated CLO entities investments reduced adjusted earnings per diluted share by $0.02 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and contributed $0.01 to adjusted earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of last year.  We ended the second quarter of fiscal 2019 with a record $469.9 billion of consolidated assets under management, up 6% over the prior quarter and up 7% from 12 months earlier. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019 we have $4.6 billion of consolidated net inflows or $2.6 billion excluding exposure management. This represents our 19th consecutive quarter of positive net flows.  Appreciation and the market value of managed assets contributed $20.7 billion to growth in consolidated assets under management this quarter, reflecting continued recovery from the sell-off in stocks and other risk assets in late 2018. Our second quarter net flows represent 4% annualized internal growth and consolidated managed assets or 3% excluding exposure management mandates. As you can see on slide 11, we reported 1% annualized internal growth and consolidated management fees for the second quarter. To calculate this measure of our internal growth, we subtract management fees attributable to consolidate the outflows for the period from management fees attributable to consolidated inflows and then measure the difference as percentage of beginning of period consolidated management fee revenue, taking into account the fee rate applicable to each dollar in and out.  The quarters 1% annualized internal growth and management fee revenue represents a sharp bounce back from the minus 4% result for the prior quarter. Among our investment mandate reporting categories, changes in consolidated assets under management during the second quarter range from growth of 9% for portfolio implementation, 8% for equity and 5% for fixed income and exposure management to declines of 6% for alternatives and 3% for floating rate bank loans. Growth in our portfolio implementation reporting category was driven by higher managed assets and parametric custom core equity separate accounts. Custom core net inflows of $1.7 billion this quarter were partially offset by approximately $0.5 billion of net outflows from centralized portfolio management mandates, primarily related to the termination of a single turn-key asset management program during the quarter.  The quarter\u2019s $480 million of equity net inflows, reflect positive net flows into Parametric defensive equity and covered call writing strategies, EVM large cap growth and Calvert emerging market and responsible index strategies and net outflows from Parametric emerging markets and the Atlanta Capital\u2019s mid-cap strategy, which is closed to new investors. Appreciation and asset values contributed $8.2 billion to growth in equity manager assets for the quarter.  Our fixed income quarterly net inflows of $2.9 billion benefited from continuing investor demand for tax exempt municipal bond strategies in a range of taxable bonds strategies that we offer, including U.S. Corporate Core Bond, short and ultra-short duration and emerging market debt strategies.  Among our fixed income mutual funds, the quarter\u2019s flow leaders were Eaton Vance Short Duration Government Income Fund with nearly $600 million of net inflows, Eaton Vance National Municipal Income fund with over $200 million of net inflows and Calvert Bond Fund and Eaton Vance Corp Plus Bond Fund with over $300 million of combined net inflows. Net inflows of more than $150 million into our emerging market debt strategies push managed assets pass the $1 billion mark in these strategies as of April, 30, 2019. Measured by assets under management, our largest taxable fixed income business is High Yield Bonds with just over $11 billion in managed assets.  Last week we announced that two veterans of the EVM High Yield Group, Steve Concannon and Jeff Mueller will assume leadership of the team at year-end replacing Mike Weilheimer. Mike retires after a very distinguished 29 year career at EVM, including 24 years as Director of High Yield Investments. While Mike\u2019s leadership will we missed, we are fortunate to have high yield investors of Steve\u2019s and Jeff\u2019s caliber to lead the group going forward.  Returning to our second quarter fixed income net flows, it included $2.1 billion into Municipal and Corporate Bond laddered individual and separate accounts, when combined with the $1.7 billion of net inflows into Parametric Custom Core Equity Individual separate accounts, inflows into our industry leading suite of custom beta strategies offered as individual separately managed accounts, total $3.8 billion in the second quarter, which equates to an annualized internal growth in managed assets of 17%.  As shown on slide 12 of our presentation, our custom beta strategies are offered as individual separate counts, now total $99.1 billion of managed assets, reflecting continued strong customer demand for these high value offerings that combine the benefits of passive investing with the ability to customize portfolios to meet individual preferences and needs. We continue to commit significant resources to expanding our leadership position in this growing market. In both our alternatives and floating rate income reporting categories we saw net outflows in the second quarter that would significantly reduce the levels versus the prior quarter. Net outflows in the alternative category declined to approximately $475 million from $2.2 billion in the prior quarter, with outflows driven primarily by withdrawals from our Global Macro Absolute Return Mutual Fund and Institutional Sub-Advisory Mandates.  Floating rate income, net outflows of $1.6 billion this quarter were considerably improved from the $2.9 million of net outflows reported for the prior quarter, reflecting better flow results across both retail and institutional mandates. We continue to believe that floating rate bank loans offer an attractive risk return proposition in the current environment, with high current yields, favorable credit market conditions and little or no exposure to interest rate risk.  In exposure management we returned to positive net-flows this quarter with changes in existing client positions and the net amount of assets managed for clients gained or lost in the quarter, each contributing to the positive flow results. Looking at the different categories of investment vehicles we offer, our industry leading position and individual separate accounts continue to be a primary driver of growth in the second quarter. The $3.7 billion of net inflows into individual separate accounts we manage represent a 12% annualized organic growth rate.  A key strategic objective for Eaton Vance over the past several years has been to expand our position and responsible investing. At the center of our ESG efforts as our Calvert Affiliate, which this quarter experienced the strongest growth since we acquired Calvert just over two years ago.  Calvert\u2019s investment strategies, including those sub-advised by other EV affiliates realized $860 million of net inflows in the second quarter, which equates to annualized internal growth in managed assets of 22%. As of April 30 Calvert\u2019s assets under management totaled $17.1 billion, representing a $2.5 billion increase since the beginning of the fiscal year and a $5.2 billion or 44% increase since we acquired Calvert 28 months ago.  The success of Calvert has been driven by strong investment performance as evidenced by the number of four and five star rated funds in the Calvert Fund Family and the leading reputation of Calvert within responsible investing.  In early April, Calvert President, CEO John Streur was the sole industry representative to testify before the Senate Committee on banking, housing and urban affairs on the subject of the Application of Environmental Social and Governance Principles in Investing and the role of Asset Managers, Proxy Advisers and other intermediaries. John\u2019s testimony provided a forum for him to address how ESG investment strategies have evolved in recent years and to discuss public policy and regulatory matters relevant to the investment industry and investors.  Last week we announced the hiring of John K.S. Wilson as Director of Corporate Engagement to lead Calvert\u2019s expanding corporate engagement activities. In this role John will manage a growing team of engagement specialist who monitor issuers for engagement opportunities, develop a business case for change and participate in industry coalitions. As other investment manager struggle to gain credibility and responsible investing, Calvert continues to build strength on strength.  That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Laurie. Laurie Hylton : Thank you and good morning. As Tom mentioned we are reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.89 for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, an increase of 16% from $0.77 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and an increase of 22% from the $0.73 of adjusted earnings per diluted share reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. excess: Operating income decreased by 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher compensation costs related to increases in headcount and approximately $1.6 million of one-time costs associated with employee terminations in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.  Operating income was up 5% sequentially, primarily driven by an increase in management fee revenue, which was up 1% even with three fewer days in the second quarter. Performance based fees were a positive $1.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 versus a negative $0.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and a negative $0.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Our operating margin was 30.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, 32.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and 29.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  Ending consolidated managed assets at April 30 reached a new record high of $469.9 billion, that\u2019s an increase of 7% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, driven by strong market returns and net flows. growth: Average managed assets were up 4% sequentially, driving an increase in management fee revenue of 2%. Revenue growth, trailed growth and average managed assets sequentially, primarily due to the impact of three fewer free days in the second quarter and a modest decline in our average annualized management fee rates from 32 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to 31.8 basis points in the second. The decline in our average annualized management fee rate over the comparative periods was driven primarily by shifts in business mix. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, our annualized internal growth and management fee revenue of 1%, trailed annualized internal growth in managed assets of 4%, primarily due to the mix of higher fee and lower fee strategies within our inflows and outflows during the quarter. This compares to 6% annualized internal growth and management fee revenue and 4% annualized internal growth in managed assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and shows a sharp improvement from the negative 4% annualized internal growth in management fee revenue and 1% annualized internal growth in managed assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  Turning to expenses, compensation increased by 4% from the second quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily driven by higher salaries and benefits associated with increases in headcount, higher stock based compensation and the impact of certain one-time costs associated with employee termination, partially offset by lower sales based incentive compensation and lower operating income based bonus accruals.  As previously mentioned, compensation expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 included approximately $1.6 million of costs associated with employed termination. Sequentially, compensation expense slightly decreased, reflecting lower salaries and stock based compensation, driven by fewer payroll days in the second fiscal quarter and lower sales based incentive compensation, offset by higher performance and operating income based bonus accruals and the impact of the employee termination costs recognized during the second quarter. Non compensation distribution related costs, including distribution and service fee expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased 5% from the same quarter a year ago and 2% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower Class C distribution and service fee expenses, driven by a decrease in average managed assets of Class C mutual fund shares.  This decrease was partially offset by higher service fee expense and commission amortization for private funds, driven by higher average managed assets and private funds strategy.  Funds related expenses increased 6% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, reflecting higher average managed assets and sub-advised funds. Other operating expenses increased 3% from the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and were up 1% from the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase, both year-over-year and sequentially primarily reflects higher information technology spending, attributable mainly to expenditures associated with the consolidation of our trading platforms, enhancements to Calvert\u2019s research system and ongoing system maintenance costs, as well as higher corporate consulting costs related to new product launches. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets that were fully amortized during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We continue to focus on overall expense management and identifying ways to gain operational leverage.  We also continue to invest in our business through our Seed Capital program. Net gains and other investment income on Seed Capital investment contributed $0.03 to earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, a penny to earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and were negligible in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  When quantifying the impact of our Seed Capital investments on earnings each quarter, we take into consideration our pro-rata share of the gains, losses and the other investment income earned on investments and sponsored strategies, where they are accounted for as consolidated funds, separate accounts or equity investment, as well as the gains and losses recognized on derivatives used to hedge these investments. We then report the per share impact net of income taxes and net income attributable to non-controlling interest. We continue to hedge the market exposures of our Seed Capital portfolio to the extent practicable to minimize the associated earnings volatility. Although we hedge a majority of our Seed Capital portfolio, gains on the un-hedged portion drove deposit contribution to earnings this quarter.  Non- operating income expense included net income from consolidated CLO entities of $11 million and $0.8 million in the second quarters of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 respectively, and net expenses of $2.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  On an earnings per diluted share basis, net income from consolidated CLOs contributed $0.07 in the current quarter, were negligible in the second quarter of last year and reduced earnings by $0.02 in our first fiscal quarter of 2019. The year-over-year and sequential increases and income contribution from consolidated CLO entities primarily relates to an increase in the fair market value of the company\u2019s beneficial interest in these entities, resulting from the rebound in the loan market during the second quarter of fiscal 2019.  Our strategy for CLO equity remains to commit prudent amounts of EV Capital to support growth of this business, taking advantage of new opportunities to recycle equity and existing CLOs to help fund new CLOs in the future.  Turning to taxes, our effective tax rate was 25.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, 26.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and 23.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The company\u2019s income tax provision for the second and first quarters of fiscal 2019 include $0.7 million and $0.6 million respectively of charges associated with certain provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, relating to limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation that began taking expect for the company in fiscal 2019.  The company\u2019s income tax provision was reduced by net excess tax benefits related to stock based awards totaling $0.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, $1.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and $2.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. As shown on attachment two to our Press Release, our calculations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share removed the net access tax benefits related to stock based awards and the non-recurring impact of the tax law changes. On this basis our adjusted-effective tax rate was 25.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, 28.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and 25.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  On the same adjusted basis, we estimate that our quarterly effective tax rate for the balance of fiscal 2019 for the fiscal year as a whole will range between 25.9% and 26.4%.  During the second quarter of fiscal 2019 we used $39.3 million of corporate cash to pay the $0.35 per share quarterly dividend declared at the end of our previous quarter and repurchased 1.7 million shares of non-voting common stock for approximately $68.5 million.  Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $114.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, down 8% year-over-year, reflecting share repurchases and excess of new shares issued upon investing a restricted stock awards and exercise employee stock options and a decrease in the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and un-invested restricted stock awards. Sequentially, weighted average diluted shares outstanding were down 1%. We finished our second fiscal quarter holding $728.3 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term debt securities in approximately $336.4 million in Seed Capital investments. We continue to place high priority on using the company\u2019s cash flow to benefit shareholders.  Fiscal discipline around discretionary spending remains top of mind in fiscal 2019. Based on our strong liquidity and overall financial condition, we believe we are well positioned to continue to invest in our business to support long term growth, while returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This concludes our prepared comments, and at this point we\u2019d like to take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from a line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is open. Gerry O'Hara: Great, thanks. Actually Gerry O'Hara sitting in for Dan this morning. Tom you mentioned the Calvert experience from its strongest growth quarters since acquisition. Perhaps you could elaborate a little bit on what some of the drivers beyond just performance, but perhaps new distribution channels that have been driving this or perhaps some side lines on future distribution opportunities and new client channels, segment, etcetera would be helpful. Tom Faust : Yes, thank Gerry. A couple of things; I mentioned one is we have quite strong performance across the board in Calvert strategies. The particular strategies that are leading the growth today include on the equity side there is an emerging market, equity fund, that\u2019s one of our larger funds. The single largest Calvert fund is called Calvert Equity Fund which is managed by our affiliate Atlanta Capital and has had quite exceptionally strong performance over the last year and good performance over the long time and that has turned around the full picture for that fund quite meaningfully.  Calvert also sponsors a range of index based equity strategies which have been in positive flows and also has a range of fixed income strategies, again, also in positive flows. So really it\u2019s across the board strength in the Calvert line up of mutual funds.  In terms of products structures, Calvert, when we acquired them at the end of 2016 was essentially a mutual fund company with limited institutional business, limited business in individual separate accounts, no business to speak of outside the U.S. and no ETF presence. We are certainly looking to expand Calvert's positioning in the market place beyond that historical base in mutual funds, looking for ways to grow in institutional investing, individual separate accounts and also potentially also in an ETF structure.  Beyond the performance, we think another contributing factor to Calvert\u2019s success has been their recognition as one of the true thought leaders in responsible investing. I highlighted John Streur\u2019s testimony before the Senate; some of the other things that we do that that provide us with strong visibility is Calvert\u2019s sponsorship of the Barron's 100 list of the most responsibly run companies in Corporate America.  But I would say in a time when there\u2019s been a lot of attention on responsible investing driven primarily by underlying investor demand, but with significant interest in terms of major intermediaries, most of whom have some kind of initiative around responsible investing, what sets Calvert apart and has allowed Calvert to succeed in a time when others have in many cases struggled to really gain traction here, one is the performance I mentioned, two would be bringing the Eaton Vance distribution to bear on responsible investing. And then I'd say probably most important, it's just been the credibility of the Calvert brand. There\u2019s a heightened sensitivity what\u2019s sometimes referred to as green-washing that is firms that talk about response investing, but can't really back it up in terms of actions and capabilities. Because of Calvert's leadership in the space that goes back into the 1980s, they have an unusual credibility that combined with good investment performance and good distribution strength has allowed us to take a leading role in translating broad market interest in response investing into growth in managed assets for that part of our business. Gerry O'Hara: Great, that\u2019s helpful color and then perhaps one follow-up. Laurie, in your prepared remarks you mentioned a little bit of operating expense pressure or less exposed related to you new product offerings or at least I guess consulting fees related to that. Could you perhaps either time yourself, maybe elaborate or add a little color as to what new product offerings we might expect in the pipeline? Tom Faust : I would say that this may be nothing in particular that we want to highlight at this point, but there's an ongoing effort across a range of strategies, U.S., international funds and separate accounts. But no one thing that we would point to as being a particular focus of things we want to highlight today. Gerry O'Hara: Okay, fair enough. Thanks for taking our questions today. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. Maybe just to try to follow-up on that, so Eaton Vance is a legacy of innovation; the industry I think is less so. With an SEC that seems more willing to allow for innovation, are there areas where you see opportunity to leverage maybe a more asset friendly SEC? Tom Faust : Yeah, Ken well the most, maybe the most obvious is our clear hedge method approach to less transparent activity ETS. I\u2019m sure probably most people on the call are aware that a competitive approach of Precidian got approval I think just yesterday on their approach to a less transparent activity ETS. We want to be part of that conversation. I think as people are aware we were pioneer in introducing next year\u2019s exchange, traded managed bonds, which were approved initially back in 2014 and then launch in 2016, I believe.  The market seems to have moved in the direction of less transparent activity ETS as opposed to exchange traded managed bonds for some distribution related reasons that we\u2019ve talked about, but we\u2019re certainly of the view that the introduction of less transparent active ETS could be a quite meaningful development for the industry. Our position in that is, we're a relatively recent file. We filed our exemptive application there back in February, different from some of the other competitors in that space, not only Precidian, but some of the other ones were approval maybe close. What separates us we believe is two things : One, we think that the method that we're proposing which we are calling clear hedge offers the most assured trading, most assured high trading performance that is trading of shares close to underlying net asset values, that's number one. And number two, is the application across all asset classes. So that's really our focus in terms of innovation that requires something new from the SEC. They've shown or given Precidian a green light, which we think is also likely to lead to other approvals in this space and we want to be a part of that.  Other things we're doing don't require the cooperation necessarily of the SEC. We continue to build out and are quite proud of our position as the leader in individual separate accounts, which is a big growing industry for us and a big growth area for the industry that is playing into investors desires for a more customized, personalized approach to investing and we deliver that both through our custom core equities platform offered by our parametric subsidiary, but also our line-up of muni and corporate ladders offered through our EVM subsidiary. Ken Worthington : Great, great, thank you. And for a follow-up, just the equity market experienced much volatility in the December quarter. We\u2019ve seen a nice rebound this year. Can you help us understand to what extent if any, these market moves have seem to influence interest or concern in parametrics various businesses. Maybe where were the ebbs and flows and any lessons learned there, you know from the sell out for the rebound that you'd be willing to share. Tom Faust : Sure. So the biggest piece of Calvert\u2019s \u2013 sorry, Parametric\u2019s business are a broad market exposure vehicle. So their custom core equity give us a benchmark and we will perform similar to that benchmark and would expect to outperform on an after tax basis, that's the primary value proposition.  Also they have a large business in what we call exposure management, which is a derivatives based securitization approaches. So instead of having 4% residual cash in your portfolio, you can put that to work in the market using primarily few futures [ph].  Neither of those I would say is particularly sensitive to market levels in terms of flows, because we get paid generally and in terms of assets under management when the market goes up or market goes down, we are more or less in revenues, but there's not a lot of market sensitivity to that business in terms of flows.  One thing I would highlight within Parametrics business that is perhaps sensitive to market levels is their options business. They have a decent sized business in covered call writing programs, where selling covered calls can be a, we think a nice additive strategy in down markets and flat markets and modestly up markets, but in a strongly rising market often investors get what sometimes we refer to as call writing [ph] fatigue from the fact that when stocks are going up the nature of writing covered calls is that you cap the upside and so you realize less in return than you would have had you not written those call options. A small part of their business, but it is an element of their business that has some bit of market sensitivity that we see. Ken Worthington : Great, thank you very much. A - Tom Faust : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks. Good morning folks. I need you to go back on the now transparent ETF or best transparent ETF offerings. Tom, I guess just your view on the industry for these products in general. Obviously you have your application; there's a couple of other ones. Do you feel it is better for the industry to have multiple different structures in a place or would you think it would you know \u2013 this could be really handled by the clear hedge and the Precidian structure? Tom Faust : I think the way that I would expect this to play out is there will be multiple different structures approved. At the end of the day I don't think all those structures necessarily will find a broad audience. I think the market will naturally identified the one or two or whatever that seem to work the best and will probably focus on those. I don't \u2013 it's just a guess, but that would be my expectation.  As I mentioned, we think clear hedge offers of the things that are in the public domain, that is for which there have been SEC filings, we certainly have the greatest confidence and the ability of an ETF using clear hedge method to trade the best, that is the tightest NAV and for that advantage to carry over to asset classes outside of U.S. equities which is where the Precidian and I believe all the other ones are focused at least initially. So I think this has the potential to be a major development. I would caution people that it may not happen overnight. There are still a number of regulatory steps that are required. I'll just remind people that when we got our approval to \u2013 we got our exemptive application approval and our 19 before application approval for next years in early November of 2014 and it was \u2013 I think it was about 16 months, 15 or 16 months later that we launched product. So I wouldn't expect this timeframe to be much different. It could be, but we don't expect that. So there's an additional regulatory process and this will not happen overnight.  I also think that while this could be a quite significant development in the whole active versus passive debate, because I do think that for many applications ETFs offer clear advantages in terms of convenience and tax efficiency and performance over a traditional mutual fund structure, I think it'll take a little bit of time. There will be some distribution challenges for these strategies, not in terms of the mechanics of distribution, but more in terms of the economics of distribution that will have to be worked out with key intermediaries.  So we think this is a major development; we want to be a part of this. Over time we would expect active ETFs to be a meaningful part of the actively managed business. There's a reason that most managers of traditional active strategies have heretofore been reluctant to offer their strategy as ETFs, because you can't really maintain a strategy as proprietary if you are disposing your holdings every day.  So with yesterday's approval of the Precidian model, it won't happen tomorrow, but it certainly offers the prospect in a traditional ETF structure as opposed to exchange traded managed bonds is what I mean by that. But in an ETF structure, having the ability to offer a proprietary active strategy in an ETF forum, we view as a quite significant market development that we want to be very much a part of. Brian Bedell : Thank you and that\u2019s great perspective. Maybe switching over to the back to the individual separate accounts and the really strong organic growth, the 12% for the category, maybe if you could just comment on the two or three major drivers that I would suspect that to bomb letters and portfolio implementation, but maybe just also comment on what degree CLOs and floating rate individual separate account products are contributing and is that coming mostly through a broker dealer channel? Tom Faust : No, so that number I reported is for what we call individual separate accounts and so there are no floating rate loans in there, no CLO\u2019s in there. That comment, that category is very much nominated by what we call custom beta, so that\u2019s the parametric custom for in the muni and corporate ladders, and the drivers of that business I would say remains the same, which is the \u2013 maybe starting on the equity side, the broad embrace of passive investing generally that has led to the growth of Index ETS and Index Mutual Funds that's number one, we're planning on that trend.  And then second really driving home the advantages of owning equity securities through a separate account as opposed to a fund and those advantages are generally in two categories, and one is the ability to customize portfolios so that you can for example take into consideration your own individual responsible investment criteria. What it is you really care about than might be different than what is reflected in a particular fund and then second, to the extent you have either concentrations in other parts of your portfolio and individual companies or individual sectors, you can index around those on a customized basis using a separate account.  The other advantage of separate account which for many people is the bigger one is the better tax treatment. That is if you own securities in a separate account, when those security some of those inevitably will go down in price, you can sell those, take a loss and use that loss currently the offset gains in other parts of your portfolio if you own them as separate account, whereas if you own those same securities in the fund, that loss is in effect trapped inside the fund vehicle and not available for use currently. So those are the primary drivers on the equity side. On the fixed income side, this is a rules based passive approach to investing like benchmarked based equity investments that offers the benefits of low cost. A primary driver for this part of our business has been the continuing migration in the broker dealer channel of assets from traditional brokerage accounts to fee based accounts. Here in particular we've been helping to drive and benefiting from a movement of individual advisor overseen bond ladders to the notion of using a third party manager that has expertise and focus on ladder construction and ladder oversight, multi-year now probably approach a decade long trend of assets moving away from what I think you could fairly say as lightly overseen bond ladders to professionally manage bond ladders and we are the market leader in that business. And I would say in in in terms of these two pieces, the Parametric Custom Core and the muni and corporate bond ladders, we've been increasing looking for opportunities to cross sell those and to offer those in conjunction with each other, because they're really quite similar strategies in their underlying philosophy and investment construction. Brian Bedell : Great overview. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hey, thanks very much. A follow-up on the custom beta conversation; you had great growth innovator in the product, but you still I think are primarily a single stock selection process and now I think some cheaper ETF, all ETF versions exist. I'm curious if that's in the process is that a version of the product that you can manufacture or do manufacture. Is it a competitive threat? Can you offer both? I'm just curious on your thoughts on that? Tom Faust : Yeah, if I\u2019m following you right, the strategies that we offer today, this is Parametric Custom Core own underlying individual securities in almost all cases, in some asset classes that may make sense to own ETF as a proxy for individual securities. You mentioned that there are potential competitive approaches that would own ETFs as an alternate to underlying security which is certainly true. There are a couple of disadvantages of that approach. The first then maybe the most obvious is that to the extent those ETFs have underlying fees, those fees gets passed through and so its inherently more expensive to own ETFs than it is to own the underlying securities directly. So that\u2019s one difference that would normally argue in favor of individual securities.  The second one is the cross sectional volatility in performance that allows you to harvest tax losses will always be greater at the individual security level than will be in pools of securities like exist inside of an ETF. So all else being equal, you'll have both lower expenses for a direct security separate account as opposed to ETF separate account and you\u2019ll also have better tax loss harvesting opportunities by owning individual securities. The advantages of using ETFs do exist however. One is the potential to offer maybe similar strategies with lower minimums, where you own fewer individual securities. It may seem more convenient to have only you know 15 or 20 ETFs represent in your portfolio than a couple of 100 stocks, so its simpler and that may make it easier to operate at lower account minimum.  The bigger advantages is probably, just in terms of the range of asset classes that can be represented by ETFs versus equity, which can be interesting because in non-equity asset classes, particularly ones that have a meaningful amount of volatility to think things like high yield bonds, you may have much better opportunity to own those in a tax managed portfolio through ETFs than the underlying security.  But in terms of our capabilities at Parametric, we do offer ETF based portfolios and I have done a fair bit of research on that. It's a quite small part of our business currently, but it is something that we have the capability to do and can provide upon customer demand, but for most people really what they want is the underlying securities, because you get both the lower cost and the higher level and effectiveness in terms of tax loss harvesting potential. Glenn Schorr : Awesome! I appreciate that. One quick follow-up on the floating rate discussion. You still have $40 billion great performance, great strategy, but definitely comes and goes sometimes with market fears and right now fears are rates are going to be low and inflows are going to be flat forever.  So you mentioned all the different areas you are inflows and fixed income. Is there a specific process in place that tries to get in front of some of the floating rate outflows and move them into some of your other fixed income products? Like how do you do that in the channel, because clearly fixed income working, I just don't know if there's an actual cross sell process that's happening? Thanks. Tom Faust : We certainly try. The way advisors use funds is no one really views themselves as a captive to Eaton Vance. Someone is selling out of an Eaton Vance loan fund, they are often not directly looking to replace that with another Eaton Vance strategy. It would be nice if that's how the world works, but that's not really the way the business works today. We certainly feature a number of low duration fixed income strategies, both in this quarter and the preceding quarter, our quarter ending January. Our largest selling mutual fund in terms of net flows was the Eaton Vance short duration government income fund, which in some ways is similar to bank loans and that it\u2019s short duration, low exposure to interest rate risk, but quite different in the credit profile of these are government backed mortgages that we're investing in primarily.  So it's, I would say that over the last, it\u2019s probably now five or six years, we have sponsored and offered a suite of short durations, so we have short duration government income, short duration high income, short duration strategic income, short duration inflation protected income. I think it is \u2013 those were all introduced as complementary strategies to bank on, recognizing that if people are investing with Eaton Vance in floating rate assets and that there may not always be times when their credit outlook is such that they want to take investment risk like its reflected in the below investment grade bank loans that we offer.  The idea with having that suite of strategies is to give our customers in the \u2013 the users for bank loans also the ability to invest in other strategies that have a similar duration profile that is low duration, but don't have the same credit risk exposure. I think it works reasonably well, in the fourth quarter or in the, I\u2019ll say the end of calendar 2018, when money was pouring out of our bank loan funds, which it was over the last four or five weeks of the year. Money was also pouring into our short duration government income strategy, largely for the same reason. Unfortunately during that time period, the net of the two we were losing more in bank loans that we were gaining in short duration government income and that carried over into the New Year as well.  But I think it makes sense for us to do what you suggest which is to offer complimentary strategies, so that when people are redeeming out of bank loans because for whatever reason it's out of sync with what they are trying to do with their clients\u2019 portfolios, we offer a complimentary or replacement strategy. So I'll pass that on, that suggestion on to our sales and marking people. Glenn Schorr : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier from Bank of America. Your line is open. Mike Carrier : Good morning thanks for taking the question. Two cleanups, Laurie given some of the termination costs you mentioned in comp, can you provide an outlook on comp or the ratio ahead. And then second just given some of the spending in support of the business growth and the healthy flows that you are seeing, how are you thinking about you know may be the margin going forward? Laurie Hylton : Yeah, from a comp perspective, I don't think we see any structural changes in our comp structure going forward for the remainder of this fiscal year. I think that we are kind of in that \u2013 I think first quarter was a little bit rough obviously, because as a percentage of revenue in a period where revenue was down due to market, it was a little bit higher than we would have anticipated; it was closer to 37.9%. This quarter we closer 37.3%. I would anticipate we're going to be closer to that range and potentially trending down a little bit. As we move forward we've got obvious leverage that we can pull in the course of the year and we refine our expectations about our operating income based, bonus accruals as we move into the third and fourth quarter. But again, I would not anticipate seeing anything really structurally change in terms of our compensation in the way we think about it for fiscal \u201919.  In terms of \u2013 and the second question, margin, yeah again 2019 for us because we're incorporating November and December into our first quarter. We obviously took a little bit of a hit in the first quarter and we are going to be digging our way out. We did see some improvement this quarter. We\u2019d like to think that there's leverage in our business and we are hoping we'll be able to continue to see a little bit of an uptick as we move. But again, I don\u2019t see anything structurally change in either our compensation or discretionary spending profile for the remainder of the year. So I wouldn\u2019t look for any real significant changes. Mike Carrier : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Eric, I will turn the call back over to you sir. Eric Senay : Thank you very much, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you everybody. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Julian, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Eaton Vance Corp Third Fiscal Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Eric Senay, Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Eric Senay : Thank you, Julian, and good morning and welcome to our fiscal 2019 third quarter earnings call and webcast. With me today this morning are Tom Faust, Chairman and CEO of Eaton Vance; and Laurie Hylton, our CFO. In today\u2019s call, we will first comment on the quarter and then take your questions. The full earnings release and charts we will refer to during the call are available on our website eatonvance.com under the heading Investors Relations. I will remind you that today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainties in our business, including but not limited to those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings, including our 2018 Annual Report and Form 10-K are available on our website or upon request at no charge. I will now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Faust : Good morning and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported $0.90 of adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, an increase of 10% from $0.82 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and up 1% from $0.89 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share this quarter include $0.04 of combined contribution from seed capital and consolidated CLO entity investments. By comparison, seed capital and consolidated CLO entity investments contributed a combined $0.10 to adjusted earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and had negligible impact in the third quarter of last year. We ended the third quarter of fiscal 2019 with a record $482.8 billion of consolidated assets under management, up 3% over the prior quarter and up 7% from 12 months earlier, and up 10% for the fiscal year to date. By mandate, reporting category changes in consolidated assets under management versus the prior quarter end ranged from growth of 5% for fixed income, 4% for exposure management, 3% for portfolio implementation, and 2% for equities to declines of 4% for alternatives and floating rate bank loans. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we had $8 billion of consolidated net inflows or $5.3 billion, excluding exposure management mandates, which have lower average fee rates and more variable flows than our other reporting categories. This represents our 20th consecutive quarter of positive net flows. For the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we had $14.1 billion of consolidated net inflows or $10.1 billion excluding exposure management. Barring unforeseen fourth quarter reversals, we're poised for fiscal 2019 to become our 24th consecutive year of positive net flows. The consistency of our organic growth over the long term speaks to the diversity of our leading investment strategies, the strength of our distribution organization, the performance excellence our investment teams have delivered, and the compelling value proposition offered by the distinctive wealth strategies and services we provide. Our third quarter net flows represent 7% internal growth in consolidated managed assets on an annualized basis or 5% excluding exposure management. Annualized internal growth in consolidated management fee revenue was 2% in the third quarter, which compares to 5% in the third quarter of last year and 1% in the prior quarter. To calculate this measure of internal growth, we subtract management fees attributable to consolidated outflows for the period from management fees attributable to consolidated inflows, and then measure the difference as a percent of beginning of period consolidated management fee revenue taking into account the fee rate applicable to each dollar in and out. This quarter's $1.6 billion of net -- equity net inflows were led by $1.2 billion into Parametric volatility risk management mandates, which include defensive equity, covered call writing, dynamic hedged equity, and other strategies incorporating equity options. Calvert emerging markets, large-cap growth, and responsible index strategies, EVM large cap growth and Atlanta Capital large-cap core and growth strategies also contributed to the quarter's positive equity flows, offsetting net outflows from Parametric emerging markets and the Atlanta Capital SMID-cap and small-cap strategies, which are closed to new investors. Across a broad range of investment categories, active equity strategies managed by EVM, Calvert, and Atlanta Capital have delivered strong return versus benchmarks and peers over recent periods. As of July 31, actively managed mutual funds whose iShares total returns ranked in the top quintile of their Morningstar category over each of the year-to-date 1-year and 3-year periods, included the Eaton Vance large-cap value, balanced tax managed equity allocation, global income builder, and Atlanta Capital focused growth funds as well as the Calvert equity mid-cap, small-cap, international equity, and balanced funds. In fixed income, approximately half of the $3.4 billion of net inflows in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 were attributable to laddered corporate and municipal bonds, separate accounts, which had $1.7 billion of net flows. Among our taxable fixed income funds, the quarter's flow leaders included Eaton Vance short duration government income fund with more than $400 million of net inflows, core plus bonds with $200 million of net inflows, and emerging markets local income with nearly $200 million of combined net inflows into the U.S mutual fund and offshore versions of the strategy. Having recently surpassed $1 billion in net assets, our top-performing emerging markets local income strategy is an increasing focus of our institutional sales efforts, particularly in offshore markets. Across our family of municipal income mutual funds, net flows totaled just over $500 million led by the Eaton Vance National Municipal income, short duration muni opportunities, muni opportunities, and high yield muni income funds. As of July 31, we offered 24 municipal income funds with one or more share classes currently rated 4 or 5 stars by Morningstar, including a 11, 5-star-rated municipal income funds. Our floating rate bank loan strategies had net outflows of $1.2 billion in the third quarter, improving from $1.6 billion of net outflows in the second quarter and $2.9 billion of net outflows in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Third quarter net outflows reflect approximately $800 million of net redemptions from U.S retail bank loan funds, $500 million of institutional separate account withdrawals, and a $200 million reduction in bank loan fund leverage amounts, offset in part by $400 million of new collateralized loan obligation assets under management added during the quarter. Although positioning floating rate investments for sales success during periods of falling interest rates can be a challenge, we continue to be pleased with the resilience of our bank loan business, particularly in U.S retail. As the bank loan mutual fund category has experienced unprecedented net outflows this year, our managed assets and flows have held better than most competitors, enabling us to expand our industry leading-market share. Although we can't predict when the market\u2019s appetite for high-yielding floating rate investments will improve, we know that it will. With distribution rates now in the 6% range for the iShare classes of each of the three Eaton Vance bank loan[ph] mutual funds we offer, not a lot of change in sentiment may be required for each retail interest in bank loan investing to pick up. Our funds and separate accounts classified as alternative had net outflows of approximately $650 million in the third quarter, a deterioration from approximately $475 million of net outflows in the quarter ended April, but a sharp improvement from $2.2 billion in net outflows in the quarter end of January. Managed assets in this flow -- inflows in this category are dominated by our two global macro absolute return mutual funds offered in the U.S., which ended the quarter with a combined $7.1 billion under management. Flows into these funds tend to rise and fall with their returns. When returns of our global macro funds are well in excess of U.S risk-free rates, as they have been this year, net inflows normally follow. While not insulated from event risk, our global macro funds offer the potential for attractive levels of absolute returns that are substantially uncorrelated to U.S equity and bond market returns, which could be especially appealing an environment of low bond yields and high economic uncertainty. In our portfolio implementation reporting category, third quarter net inflows of $2.1 billion, reflect $2.5 billion of net contributions to Parametric custom core equity individual separate accounts, $250 million of net contributions to custom core institutional accounts and $650 million of net withdrawals from centralized portfolio management mandates. As mentioned previously, our municipal and corporate laddered bond individual separate accounts contributed $1.7 billion to net inflows in the third quarter. When combined with the $2.5 billion of net inflows into custom core equity individual separate accounts, inflows into our industry leading suite of custom beta strategies offered as individual separate accounts totaled approximately $4.2 billion in the third quarter. As shown on Slide 12 of our presentation, our custom beta individual separate accounts crossed the $100 billion AUM mark this quarter with nearly $105 billion of managed assets as of July 31. For the fiscal year-to-date, net inflows into our custom beta individual separate accounts have totaled approximately $12 billion, representing annualized internal growth of 19%. In late June, we announced the key strategic initiative involving our Parametric and Eaton Vance Management investment affiliates. The initiative has three principal components, rebranding EVM's rules based systematic investment grade fixed income strategies as Parametric and aligning internal reporting consistent with this revised branding. Second, combining the technology and operating platforms supporting the individual separately managed account businesses, as Parametric and EVM; and third, integrating the distribution teams serving parametric and EVM clients and business partners and a registered investment advisor and multifamily office market. As announced in June, the initiative will bring to Parametric industry-leading expertise and systematically managed investment-grade municipal taxable and crossover tax-free taxable fixed income strategies. Based on assets under management as of July 31, approximately $42.5 billion of systematically managed fixed income assets will transfer from EVM to Parametric, representing approximately 9% of Eaton Vance's consolidated assets under management. Along our driver of Eaton Vance's above industry growth trajectory, Parametric becomes even more of a differentiator going forward. As a result of this strategic initiative, Parametric's custom core benchmarked based separate account offerings will expand to encompass fixed income securities and maturity base and liability driven portfolio benchmarks. Customized benchmark separate accounts, which are for sometimes referred to as custom indexing, compete against index ETS and index mutual funds on the basis of enhanced tax efficiency, increased client control over portfolio construction and management and the avoidance of pass-through fund operating and trading costs. Industry observers have identified custom indexing as one of the most promising trends in investment management. This is a market we lead today and are committed to growing aggressively. By expanding Parametric solutions set and customized benchmark based separate accounts and investing in technology to enhance client service and realize operating efficiencies and scale economies, our goal is to further solidify Parametric's position as market leader and position this business for accelerated growth. In late June, we announced that Ranjit Kapila will join Parametric as Chief Technology Officer and Head of Operations. And the promotion of Desmond Gallacher to become Chief Technology Officer of Eaton Vance Management and Calvert. Ranjit formally served as Global Head of Portfolio Management Investment Systems for BlackRock, where he was responsible for leading strategy and development for portfolio management applications across equity, fixed income and multi-asset portfolios for BlackRock and Aladdin clients. Des, joined Eaton Vance in 2014 and served most recently as EVM's Division Head of Investment Technology. This appointment support the Parametric strategic initiative of continue to advance the technologies underpinning the EVM fundamental active and Calvert responsible investment offerings and related services. Although Ranjit does not arrive at Parametric until next month, the change process supporting our strategic initiative is now well underway. Dedicated teams have been established to execute on each of the major components, turning go live dates principally in the first quarter of our fiscal 2020. While we anticipate a period of elevated investment to support the newly combined SMA platform, spending will be less than if we had continued to maintain separate platforms for Parametric and EVM. We expect these investments to be offset by increased revenue growth and cost savings realized from greater operating efficiencies. As we consider our strategic position in the evolving asset management industry, we feel very good about where Eaton Vance sits. Through the expanded Parametric, we are the leader across asset classes and customized benchmark based separate accounts, a market with strong current momentum and limitless growth potential. In Calvert, we hold one of the foremost brands and deepest research and engagement capabilities and responsible investing with a track record of significant sales success over the two and two-thirds years Calvert has been part of Eaton Vance. Eaton Vance Management is a market leader across a range of specialty income investment areas : bank loans, high yield bonds, mortgage-backed securities, emerging market debt and municipal bonds were active strategies continue to compete effectively against passive alternatives. EVM equities focus primarily on distinctive growing niches, focused on risk control and after tax income and returns. Atlanta Capital now offers an array of exceptionally well performing active equity strategies, their poise for accelerated growth. The strength of our investment offerings is supported by one of the top sales and marketing organizations in the business, a culture of innovation and excellence in client service and a capital structure and leadership team, we believe are supportive of long-term success. While these continued to be challenging times for the asset management industry, we remain optimistic about the future of Eaton Vance, both near-term and long-term. That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Laurie. Laurie Hylton : Thank you and good morning. As Tom described, reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.90 for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, up 10% from the $0.82 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and up 1% from $0.89 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. As you can see in attachment two to our press release, adjusted earnings per diluted share in the third and second quarters of fiscal 2019 equaled earnings per diluted share under US GAAP with no material adjustments. GAAP earnings exceeded adjusted earnings by a penny per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, reflecting the reversal of $1.3 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards. In the third quarter fiscal 2019, operating income decreased by 4% year-over-year, reflecting a 2% increase in management fee, a 7% decline in non-management fee revenue and 3% growth in operating expenses. Operating income was up 8% sequentially, reflecting a 5% increase in management fees, 6% growth in non-management fee revenue and 3% higher operating expenses compared to the prior quarter. Our operating margin was 31.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, 33.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 30.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Ending consolidated managed assets reached a new record high of $482.8 billion at July  31, up 7% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, driven by strong net flows and positive market returns. Average managed assets this quarter were up 6% from the same period last year. Management fee revenue growth trailed growth in average managed assets year-over-year, primarily due to decline in our average annualized management fee rate from 33 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to 31.8 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Versus the prior quarter, average managed assets were up 3%. On a sequential basis, management fee revenue growth exceeded growth in average managed assets, primarily due to the impact of three more fee days in the third quarter. This quarter's average annualized management fee rate of 31.8 basis points was flat in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Changes in our average annualized management fee rates over the comparative period primarily reflects shifts in our business mix and variations in fund subsidies. Included in management fees is a contra-revenue item, fund subsidies were down the $1.8 million year-over-year and $3.2 million sequentially, primarily due to a reduction in fund custody expenses resulting from the renegotiation of a service provider contract. Performance based fees, which are excluded from the calculation of our average management fee rate were a positive $0.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, a negative $0.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and a positive $1.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, our annualized internal growth and management fee revenue of 2% trailed annualized internal growth in managed assets of 7%, primarily due to a mix of higher fee and lower fee strategies within our inflows and outflows during the quarter. This compares to 5% annualized internal growth in management fee revenue and 3% annualized internal growth in managed assets in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 1% annualized internal growth in management fee revenue and 4% annualized internal growth in managed assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Turning to expenses. Compensation costs increased 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher salaries and benefits associated with increases in headcount and higher stock-based compensation, partially offset by lower operating income based bonus accruals and lower sales based incentive compensation. Sequentially, compensation expense increased 3%, primarily reflecting higher salaries driven by increases in headcount and the impact of three more payable days in the third fiscal quarter, higher stock-based compensation, higher operating income based bonus accruals and higher sales based incentive compensation, all partially offset by decreases in payroll taxes, benefits and performance based bonus accruals. Non-compensation distribution related costs, including distribution service fee expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased 2% from the same quarter a year-ago, primarily reflecting lower Class C distribution and service fee expenses, driven by a decrease in average managed assets of Class C mutual fund shares. This decrease was partially offset by higher service fee expense and commission amortization for private funds driven by higher average managed assets in these funds. Sequentially, non-compensation distribution related costs increased 6%, primarily reflecting higher marketing and promotion costs, an increase in Class A and private fund service fee expenses, driven by higher average managed assets and Class A mutual fund shares and private funds. Funds related expenses increased 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher sub-advisory fees due to an increase in average managed assets in sub-advised funds. Sequentially, funds related expenses decreased 2%, reflecting a decline in other fund expenses paid for by the company, partially offset by an increase in sub-advisory fees due to higher average managed assets in sub-advised funds. Other operating expenses increased 6% from the third quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting higher information technology, facilities in travel expenses, partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets that were fully amortized during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Other operating expenses were flat sequentially, reflecting increases in information technology, facilities and travel expenses offset by a decrease in professional services expenses. We continue to focus on overall expense management and identifying ways to gain operational leverage. Net gains and other investment income on seed capital investments contributed $0.06 to earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. A penny to earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and $0.03 to earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. When quantifying the impact of our seed capital investments on earnings each quarter, we take into consideration our pro rata share of the gains, losses and other investment income earned on investments and sponsored strategies, whether accounted for as consolidated funds, separate accounts or equity investments as well as the gains and losses recognized on derivatives used to hedge these investments. We then report the per share impacts net of income taxes and net income attributable to non-controlling interest. Looking through the hedge to the market exposures of our seed capital portfolio to the extent practicable to minimize the associated earnings volatility. Although we hedged majority of our seed capital portfolio, gains on the unhedged portion drove deposit contribution to earnings this quarter. Non-operating income expense includes net expenses from consolidated CLO entities of $3.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. This compares to net expenses of $1.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and net income of $11 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Other income and expense amounts related to consolidated CLO entities reduced earnings per diluted share by $0.02 in the current quarter, a penny in the third quarter of last year and contributed $0.07 per diluted share in our second fiscal quarter of 2019. Other income expense amounts related to consolidated CLOs reflect changes in our economic interest in these entities, including the fair market value of our investment, distributions received and management fees earned. Our strategy for CLO equity remains to commit prudent amounts of EV capital to support growth in this business, taking advantage of opportunities to recycle equity in existing CLOS to help fund new CLOS in the future. Turning to taxes. Our effective tax rate was 25.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, 26.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 25.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The company's income tax provision for the third and second quarters of fiscal 2019 includes $1.1 million and $0.7 million respectively of charges associated with certain provisions of the 2017 Tax Act relating to limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation that began taking effect for the company in fiscal 2019. The company's income tax provision was reduced by net excess tax benefits related to stock based awards, totaling $0.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, $1.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, and $0.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. As shown in attachment two to our press release, our calculations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share remove the net excess tax benefits related to stock based awards and the nonrecurring impact of the tax law changes. On this basis, our adjusted effective tax rate was 25.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, 27.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 25.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. On the same adjusted basis, we estimate that our quarterly effective tax rate for the balance of fiscal 2019 and for the fiscal year as a whole will range between 25.9% and 26.4%.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we used $38.6 million of corporate cash to pay the $0.35 per share quarterly dividend declared at the end of our previous quarter and repurchased 1.5 million shares of nonvoting common stock for approximately $61.3 million. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 113.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, down 8% year-over-year, reflecting share repurchases in excess of new shares issued upon investing a restricted stock awards and exercise on employee stock options and a decrease in the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and unvested restricted stock awards. Sequentially, weighted average diluted shares outstanding were down 1%. We finished our third fiscal quarter holding $777.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term debt securities and approximately $368.6 million in seed capital investments. We continue to place high priority on using the company's cash flow to benefit shareholders. Fiscal discipline around discretionary spending remains top of mind as we contemplate both volatile market and significant corporate initiatives. As Tom noted, the strategic initiative we announced in June will include investments in technology to support a consolidated individual separate accounts platform geared towards enhancing scalability and achieving higher levels of operating efficiency. We do not currently anticipate that there will be significant adds to staff associates with these investments. We can provide additional color on related headcount and spending when we report our earnings for the fiscal year. Based on our strong liquidity and overall financial condition, we believe we are well positioned to continue to invest in our business to support long-term growth, while returning capital to shareholders. This concludes our prepared comments. And at this point, we would like to take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Patrick Davitt : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I might be splitting hairs here, but I feel like when you announced the repositioning in June, you kind of pushed back on the view that it could drive more incremental efficiency on the cost side. But Tom's comments this morning highlighted cost savings and efficiency. Just curious if you maybe identified a bigger operating leverage opportunity on the cost side as you\u2019ve gone through the process just over the last couple of months. Tom Faust : Yes, I would put it -- maybe I would agree with your assessment that it's maybe splitting hairs here. I don't think we're far enough into this to have a really very different view on kind of what the spin levels will be and what the resulting impact on operating efficiencies and scale economies would be. We are working on, we put a lot of effort into this. We made some real progress. As I noted, Ranjit, who will be joining Parametric towards the end of next month, isn't here yet, so we can lay a little bit of this uncertainty on the fact that the person that\u2019s going to be driving this isn't here yet. It's not like we haven't done anything. In fact, we\u2019ve done quite a bit to prepare for the launch of this new platform. But in terms of quantifying the margin impact of how this is going to impact our overall business or even impact the profitability of that particular part of our business, I think it's quite premature to say that. I will say that this is a business where continuous investment in technology are just par for the course. We\u2019ve scaled this thing up to something like 80,000 separate accounts, and we are looking for ways to continue growing that business to a multiple of its current size. We know if we do this right, there will be significant CL economies. It does not take twice as many people to run 160,000 accounts as it does 80,000 accounts, particularly if we invest in technology the right way. So, a little bit vague in the answer. Sorry, I can't be more helpful. Directionally, we know we are going to be spending a bit more money in the near-term, but we're highly confident that\u2019s going to pay off with operating efficiencies and scale economies down the road as we grow that business. Patrick Davitt : Thank you. And as a follow-up, there has been some chatter about some larger asset management properties in Europe becoming available. As we think about M&A as a piece of the capital return story, could you update us your thinking around your appetite for deals like that and within that any detail on what kind of asset classes, wrappers, or distribution pipes would be most attractive to you? Tom Faust : I certainly can't comment on anything specific. We're not aware of -- there aren't major opportunities that we're looking at in Europe that we are at a point where we could comment on, not that we would. I would say areas of interest to us relate primarily to rounding out our business in ways that are -- that we view as complementary to what we're doing now. I would put on that list extending our credit capabilities into private assets. We\u2019ve also looked at things recently expanding our small wealth management business to leverage our capabilities in wealth management solutions. Beyond that, I would say we\u2019re opportunistic. We'd like to grow in responsible investing. We have a -- we think very strong platform, really a couple of platforms there with Calvert and what Parametric does in customized separate account solutions with responsible investing being one of the key value adds there. Those are probably the areas I would highlight for us. We are -- our business continues to be approximately 95% in the U.S and 5% outside. We\u2019ve stated our long-term goal to become more diversified internationally. But we are only going to do an acquisition that we think makes sense to us and we are highly confident it's going to bring value to our shareholders. Patrick Davitt : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Melinda Roy : Hi. This is actually Melinda Roy filling in for Brian Bedell. Maybe just a couple more on the retail SMA business. Can you talk about what portion of the business is concentrated in Parametric strategies and where you see most growth coming from an intermediate term? And then on the culmination of the EVM and Parametric's platforms, how specifically do you think that could improve organic growth once the combination is kind of complete? Tom Faust : Yes. So, I think I scaled the business at about $105 billion of what we call custom beta. So that's the Parametric custom core business as well as the municipal and corporate bond laddered offer -- laddered products offered at individual separate accounts. We have additional individual separate account businesses. There are actively managed muni pieces, there are active managed equity businesses as well. Laurie Hylton : [Indiscernible]. Tom Faust : What do you have for the total there? Laurie Hylton : It\u2019s [audio disturbance]. Tom Faust : The -- but the biggest growth opportunities we see are in what we call custom beta, which is I believe slide 12 of the handout had the growth trajectory. We\u2019ve been on there. Year-to-date, 19% annualized internal growth. We think we're positioned to see -- we hope, we bet we don't know this, but we hope an acceleration of that growth as we move the muni and corporate capabilities there under Parametric. We think there will be new product strategies that will emerge out of that, that will give us the potential to do things that we don't do today. We think the investments that we're making in technology to enhance service levels and drive scale economies will position us more attractively versus competitors where our goal would be that to gain market share over time. We think there is a -- there is room in this market for multiple competitors, but we intend to maintain our position as the market leader. Melinda Roy : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Carrier from Bank of America. Your line is open. Mike Carrier : Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe first just on the operating leverage. So, Laurie, you guys had positive operating leverage quarter-over-quarter. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s the days in the markets. But it sounds like, you guys are focused on that, in terms of the expense discipline. You also mentioned just some of the investments with the Parametric initiative. So just wanted to get your thoughts on how we should be thinking about expenses, maybe operating leverage, particularly just given the strength that you guys are seeing on the flow side? Laurie Hylton : Yes, we are not prepared to provide any guidance at this point. But in terms of the way that we\u2019re thinking about we recognize that we got a significant investment that we are looking to make in this project. And I think what we are very much aware of is that we are going to have to stay very, very tight on all of our other spending in order to ensure that we can focus our attention and our resources on this initiative and be as efficient as we can in terms of deployment of capital. Now recognizing that when you are talking about technology projects, obviously they\u2019re going to be -- there's a portion of this that will be operating a portion of this will be capital. And as we finalize our thoughts around our longer term strategic vision for the platform, we are going to figure those components out and we certainly will hope to be able to provide more guidance as we move into the fourth quarter. But I would say that overall, we are looking to really keep our spent tight as we are moving into the fourth quarter on all of our other general corporate spending recognized and that we want to be able to put as much as we can into this project and -- because we do believe that there's tremendous long-term leverage to be gained by building a scalable platform that\u2019s going to be highly efficient and it's going to have a solid operational foundation for us to do the types of product initiative as Tom mentioned earlier. Mike Carrier : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just on the overall like investment performance inflows. Things have been very strong, particularly relative to the industry. The shorter term performance, it's probably a little bit weaker that we\u2019ve seen. Just any color on maybe what\u2019s driving that? Any concerns, the 3, 5, 10 is still very solid, but just any concerns on the shorter term side? Tom Faust : I guess it depends where you're looking. We\u2019ve got pretty broad business. If you look at our equity performance to starting there, we're really having a quite strong year where Calvert strategies, Eaton Vance managed equities and particularly the Atlanta Capital strategies, which in many ways are our purest for compete on performance equity mandates, really exceptional, high performance there. That group as you may know also runs the Calvert equity fund, which also has had strong performance. So we are seeing flows into -- positive flows into active equity strategies that are not completely, but we would assume are being driven largely by that -- the strong performance numbers that we\u2019ve been putting up over the last, let's say, year and 3-year periods. On income side, I think generally a good story. Our -- because our bank loan assets are fairly large percentage of our total. We have seen a -- maybe somewhat of a falling off in performance there, nothing that we're worried about. But we had a significant boost to performance last year that came as some loans that we had held through restructuring process, paid off in a major way as -- to us is equity holders as they came to a restructuring. We haven't had that same effect this year, so our bank loan performance has been more muted across fixed income. The primary driver of relative performance year-to-date and particularly over the last three months has been duration exposure. So if you're long relative to your peers, you\u2019ve had the wind at your back. If your shorter duration relative to peers, you had the wind a bit in-your-face. We have an array of short duration income strategies. The biggest being our short duration government income fund which really had a exceptional performance run. It's been facing a bit of a performance headwind this year, primarily because relative to its peers it is shorter duration than its peers. And in the government category duration is going to be a primary driver of short-term periods, particularly during months like we've seen recently when we\u2019ve had sharp movements. Sharp movements in this case down in treasury yields. So it's really nothing that from a competitive point of view we're fighting against. We continue to see good flows into that short duration Government Income Fund, despite a fall off in relative performance versus other funds in that government category. Same with bank loans, a relative performance versus peers over the year-to-date period has fallen a bit. The longer-term track record there is exceptional and as I mentioned our market share there based on the numbers we see continues to grow. So there's certainly -- we don't see a performance problem for Eaton Vance over all or for any of our major strategies. In fact, I would point to performance of our active equity strategies, Calvert branded and Atlanta Capital managed in particular, as creating opportunities for us to sell places that we wouldn\u2019t if we had more pedestrian returns. Mike Carrier : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Worthington from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi. Good morning. First on the leverage loan market. We've seen some leverage loan deals slip in recent weeks. Talk about the CLO market, the floating rate market more broadly, any implications for Eaton Vance including any balance sheet exposure you might have here? Tom Faust : So we have a relatively small CLO business. I think they\u2019re 4 or 5 active CLOs that we managed. It is a pretty small balance sheet exposure. Overall, bank loans are important business for us. We have been in net outflows there as described. There is nothing systemic there that we're particularly worried about. We believe the outflows have been primarily driven by the fact that these are floating rate assets and people are expecting short-term rates to come down, that's a strong market consensus probably will prove right. But we don't see significant issues on the credit side. Nothing is showing up in our portfolios to date. We're very aware that these are below investment grade loans and that these are subject to credit risk. We maintain broadly diversified portfolios. To date, we have not had issues with liquidity or -- so we generally feel that things are okay. On balance, we think that the stimulative moves that are starting to happen in the U.S and in other Western economies are broadly supportive of good credit performance and bank loans. So on the one hand, shorter rates make -- can make floating rate assets less appealing from a yield perspective. They also have the effect generally of reducing economic risk of significant credit losses. But we're mindful that we're at -- we are -- we're long into the current economic cycle. We are mindful of the fact that flat or inverted yield curves are sometimes viewed and have been markers of coming prudence of economic weakness. But to date, we are not seeing that in our bank loan portfolios. Ken Worthington : Okay. Okay. Thank you. In terms of the $42.5 billion transferred to Parametric, do your clients need to affirm the transfers in any way, or their new contracts that result with this transfer? Trying to get a sense if there's any risk to either the fee agreements that you have, or even the assets. Is there any chance that assets may slip here. Tom Faust : No. That the key is that it is not deemed an assignment for purposes of the contracts. And we have a legal opinion to that effect, which we\u2019re making available through our business partners, primarily this is the separate managed account business where this is -- potentially an issue. But we've gotten -- I would say, no pushback from clients or intermediaries about the change. There is no change in control. We control these businesses through Eaton Vance Management today. We will control them in the future through Parametric, which is a control subsidiary. The same people will be running the strategies, the same investment style. It's a change in branding and ultimately organizational reporting responsibilities. But nothing that we think clients should be concerned about and nothing that we think based on evidence that clients are concerned about performance records will carry over. No change from a client's point of view other than a different name associated with the brand. Ken Worthington : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Katz from Citi. Your line is open. Ben Herbert : Hi. Good morning. Its Ben Herbert on for Bill. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up on Mike's question regarding operating leverage. And Laurie, last quarter you mentioned the comp ratio should trend down going forward. And then recently you said -- today you said no headcount change with the strategic initiatives announced at the end of June. So can we still think that comp ratio should kind of move down over time here into 2020? Laurie Hylton : Into what? Ben Herbert : 2020. Laurie Hylton : Oh, into 2020. I wouldn\u2019t be making any prognostication at this point about 2020. I would anticipate that the comp ratio in the fourth quarter is probably not going to look dramatically different from the comp ratio in the third quarter. So I think that\u2019s probably a fair assessment. But I wouldn\u2019t be making any prognostications beyond that. Ben Herbert : Okay. And then a follow-up would just be on the ALPS [ph] fee rate. There was a significant tick up quarter-over-quarter. Just wanted to understand kind of the underlying dynamics behind that. Tom Faust : Yes. We talked about how we benefited during the quarter of a renegotiation of a custody fee agreement where -- because the custody fees are highest for emerging markets, non-U.S markets, which are -- were those assets tend to be concentrated in alternative strategies. The impact of that on our effective fee rates was positive during the quarter which reflect that -- reflects the fact that a fair bit of the subsidy activity that we\u2019ve been had in our funds is connected to those strategies and where the relief in terms of lower custody fees fell in part to benefit of the fund, then also fell in part to us to the extent we're providing subsidies to keep fund fee levels at a flat level. Ben Herbert : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is open. Robert Lee : Great. Thanks for taking -- excuse me, thanks for taking my questions. Can you maybe just talk a little bit, Tom, you had mentioned early on some pretty good success and what I would call more defensive equity strategy. So could you maybe break that down a little bit kind of how that's compares in a retail versus institutional and then maybe any color you may have on any institutional pipeline, whether it's through those strategies, Calvert or otherwise? Tom Faust : Yes, we don't have much of a pipeline in active equity institutional accounts. Most of the sale success we are seeing for active equity is retail either funds or in some cases individual separate accounts. Most of that active business is through model programs. But the places where we're seeing sales success are primarily high-performing equity strategies, branded Calvert, sorry. So it's the one-two punch of strong performance, which is a distinctive factor and also the strong brand of Calvert and responsible investing. So we're benefiting, I would say, across the board. Almost without exception across. Calvert active strategies from strong performance and this wind at the back in terms of marketing, because although there are a lot of players that have come into the responsible investing space, few of them have the credibility and reputation that Calvert has, you marry that with strong performance and we\u2019ve been able to grow Calvert's business in active equities pretty meaningfully. The other brand manager I would point to is our Atlanta Capital affiliate, which although Atlanta Capital in total has been a net redemptions in the last couple of quarters, primarily because their largest strategies which are the SMID-cap and small-cap strategies are at capacity. They've had very strong across the board performance, small-cap, SMID-cap, large cap in their active equities. Atlanta Capital's mantra is high quality investing, which they\u2019ve practiced for decades. We are in a market cycle where high-quality is performing very well. They have not just top quartile, but top decile performance across most of their equity strategies. And they\u2019re seeing growing interest in that as you would expect. This is a group of funds and separate accounts that are distinguished not only by strong performance over time, but also a consistent investment approach, low turnover investing in high-quality companies that resonates with a lot of investors that are looking at alternatives to passive investing. So beyond that I would say, a small cap generally as a place where we're seeing positive flows both branded Calvert and branded Eaton Vance, both U.S and international. So you don't think about active equities as a place where there's a lot of growth opportunity, but we're seeing some potential for our business to grow there based on performance and based on the distinctiveness of the Calvert brand. Robert Lee : Great. And maybe as a follow-up. Could you maybe talk a little bit about the competitive environment within custom beta and the ladders? And specifically, look any time I guess you\u2019ve good growth opportunities, people try to come into the markets, often try to compete on price. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing and to what extent do you feel like you have there's maybe a barrier to entry, so to speak, given that it is a technology-heavy kind of business. I mean, kind of talk about how you see that? Tom Faust : Yes, this is a -- it's a lot harder business than managing funds. 80,000 separate accounts gives us a scale that's hard for anyone to come close to, we think we are based on industry data, the largest player in this market. We compete on service more than anything. And when I say we, this is both Parametric and what are today Eaton Vance Management branded strategies that would be -- in some cases moving over to Parametric. We have over the last, I would say, two years seen a number of new competitors coming to the market both in terms of laddered bond separate accounts, but also on the custom core equities. So competing against us on both the income side as well as the equity side. You\u2019ve seen our numbers. We continue to grow that business. 19% organic growth for the year-to-date on a combined basis. We will see no doubt more competitors into this. Other people, we think will be attracted to the same opportunity to grow in the space, but we think we have today a differentiated position based on our reputation for service. And so far we've been able to hold off competitors and keep that business growing. Some of our competitors have not surprisingly try to compete largely on the basis of price. For the most part, we\u2019ve held the line on price, but have the flexibility to be competitive when necessary. This is a value proposition. If we can deliver value relative to cost, which we think we can, we think this business will continue to grow. For the most part, our competition here is more about competing against on the equity side index funds and ETS as opposed to other managers of customized individual separate accounts. And in the case of munis and taxable bond portfolios, it's primarily competing against unmanaged portfolios. So, yes, there are more competitors into the space, but at $100 billion we are by far the largest player in this business, but tiny compared to the size of the addressable market, which we view as consisting of most of the index ETF and index mutual fund market held outside of qualified retirement plans. And maybe away from institutions that are using ETFs as a short-term market exposure vehicles. But we think this is you sketch it out. This is -- these are potentially trillion dollar plus markets. You look at the number of municipal bonds, the value of municipal bonds that are owned by individuals, how much of that is managed versus how much is unmanaged. We think there's a huge potential for that market to convert to from unmanaged to managed. You look at the growth of index investing. How much of that is held through funds, where there's not the advantages of customization, not the advantages of pass-through tax -- pass-through treatment of realized tax losses that you can achieve with customized separate accounts. We think there's enormous growth potential here. Our objective is to grow our market share over time as this market continues to grow, maybe that's a challenge because we will see new entrants into this market. But there aren't many people that are in a position like we are to make the kind of investment in technology to drive service levels that other people I think are going to look at this and say I don't want to do that. That looks really hard. I don't think I can compete with Parametric and Eaton Vance on the basis of service excellence. I think I will do something else. Robert Lee : Great. That was helpful. Thank you. Tom Faust : I think we have time for two more participants before we wrap up the call today. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is open. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. My question is on fee rate. If we look on a year-over-year, you\u2019ve seen compression across the longer-term categories. I guess as you think about the mix of business today and where you\u2019re seeing strength in the ins and outs, do you see that stabilizing, improving, or kind of continuing kind of the rate of decline we\u2019ve seen? Tom Faust : I don't see any improvement. The last I checked fee rates aren't going up across any parts of asset management that we participate in. Our primary driver of those fee rates that will continues to be mix, even both across categories and inside categories. The biggest changes in average fee rate has been within fixed income. That really reflects the growth of this business that we call custom beta, the muni and corporate ladder business which is fundamentally quite different than managing high yield bond portfolios or mortgage-backed securities portfolio. We are seeing some price competition, some level of fee concessions in existing businesses. I don't think it's accelerating. It feels like it's more on a steady modest decline in average fee rates across most of our businesses if you look at true apples to apples comparison. We think we can manage through that. I\u2019ve been in the investment business well over 30 years and there has never been a time when fee rates have been going up, how you grow and how you achieve attractive margins in this business tends to be based on scale. The ability to offset reductions in a fee rates tied to per dollar of assets by growing up the base of assets you managed and leveraging the spending in support of that asset management. So no real change in our business mix. We expect continued modest declines in our average fee rates. Daniel Fannon : Okay. And then as a follow-up, the global macro product seemed improved performance. You mentioned historically that's dovetailed with, or correlated with improved flows. Can you talk about just the positioning of the fund and kind of historically it's had a fair amount of currency exposures and other things to it. But any kind of near-term dynamics in terms of shift in terms of flow outlook for that segment as well would be helpful. Tom Faust : Yes. So this is -- these strategies are a little hard to pigeonhole in terms of what -- where they\u2019re positioned relative to broad market trends. We describe ourselves as country pickers, investing both long and short in emerging and frontier markets using primarily currency and short duration sovereign credit instruments. We -- returns, you can look this up, I think are like 6% or so in the range of 6% year-to-date through yesterday, for the iShares of these funds. So we think that's pretty good. Some years 6% returns are nothing to get too excited about in other years. If you can deliver something like that, in a way that is less volatile than long-duration fixed income or less volatile than most equity strategies, that can be quite appealing, particularly given the very low correlation of the performance of these strategies to the major asset classes that most U.S investors are heavily weighted in, namely developed market equities and U.S. duration assets. There have been some upsets in the world recently, maybe putting that thing modestly. So far we're weathering the storm quite well. And those performance numbers are current numbers for the year-to-date. Daniel Fannon : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Tom Faust : Good morning. Craig Siegenthaler : I just have a follow-up to Rob's last question, on the competitive landscape and custom beta. I wanted to see if you saw a pickup in product launches SMA wins, fund registrations from some of your competitors just given the success of Parametric? Tom Faust : There have been absolutely -- so let me answer the question in two parts. One is on the equity side, which is the Parametric business and the other is the -- is on the fixed-income side, which is the Eaton Vance Management business that is going to become part of Parametric. So on the equity side, the traditional player in this market that we\u2019ve competed with is a firm focused on this business called Aperio that I think continues to grow in our business, but is an established competitor. No particular change that I\u2019m aware of in the Parametric versus Aperio competitive dynamics. There are other players who have been in this market and put more of a focus on that. Goldman Sachs has an investment offering here. Natixis has a subsidiary that has an offering here. The competitive landscape is first about getting access to platform. So are you offered at major broker-dealers or are you available through a particular registered investment advisor and what kind of strategies are you offered though? So is it tied to a single index, is it across a range of indexes? What\u2019s the expectation in terms of product features? Are you -- what kind -- what approach are you taking to tax loss harvesting? What kind of your business is funding -- funded in kind? Do you do after tax performance reporting? Is that performance reporting appropriately tranched by the age of the account? These are all things that that differentiate players in this market. It is a very customized business. If your level of customization is not as good as the next guys, you\u2019re going to struggle to be successful here. An element of customization is that service is often challenging. So what kind of turnaround is there for whatever customization that a particular advisor or client is looking for. So far we\u2019ve been able to withstand the competitive challenge and continue to grow that business, despite no secret that this is a growing market. People look at the success we've achieved and said, yes, that doesn't look all that hard. But one of the things we're trying to do with this strategic initiative is to make it less attractive and make it harder for other asset managers to try and get into this space by doing a better job for clients. On the fixed-income side, the story is probably similar. The names are different. Aperio, I don't believe has a fixed-income offering. Names here are Nuveen, Lord Abbett. I think BlackRock has an offering in this market. There might be a couple of other players there. By and large, we\u2019ve -- we continue to be successful in that market. One of the things that\u2019s notable about our competitive offering is that earlier this year we launched a systematic year-round tax law -- tax loss harvesting service as part of our core offering, no upcharge in price, something we make available. We\u2019ve been in the process of rolling that out, getting approval at various platforms to offer that for clients. We view that as a bit of a raising of the bar to differentiate us from competitors, not everyone. Most people don't offer something similar. Again, beyond the service, beyond the features that we offer, a lot of this comes down to service, how good are we at responding to requests to evaluate a particular hypothetical transaction? What's our turnaround relative to somebody else's? What kind of service do we provide to advisors? In general, fee rate differentials in this market are small and that these are not viewed as commodity products because of the intensity of the service experience and the high-level of satisfaction we deliver on the service side has allowed us to in many cases when business we're not a low-cost provider, but we're at or near the top end of the fee range for people bidding on the business. But we think it's a business that has the potential to grow to accommodate a number of competitors. We expect fairly soon the competitive landscape to shake out where this won't be a competitive market -- this won't be an interesting market for new people to get into simply because we and perhaps some others will set such a high bar in terms of scale in technology and service levels that people look at this and say, I don't think I can be successful here. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks, Tom. Very comprehensive. I just had one follow-up on your retail SMA strategy, which I know you\u2019re in the process of upgrading here. What do you see as the key qualities of asset managers that have succeeded in the RA market? Because this has been a very challenging segment for traditionals to crack. Tom Faust : Sorry, so you said RIA market? Craig Siegenthaler : Yes. So I believe most of your strategic positioning that you are going through now is a big chunk of that is targeting the RIA channel. So I wanted to see what qualities you think will make Eaton Vance successful? And maybe what are some qualities that you\u2019ve seen at peers that have been successful in those channel, because very few happen. Tom Faust : Yes, I got it. So, one of the -- you\u2019re referring to the strategic -- part of the strategic initiative is that we're combining our sales organization covering the RIA channel here heretofore. Parametric has had a dedicated sales team covering an array of their strategies, but primarily custom core in that channel and then Eaton Vance's separately offered mutual funds and separate account offering there. And as you've said, like most asset managers, it's been a bit of a struggle for us from the Eaton Vance side to be successful there, whereas by contrast Parametric has built quite a business with dominant market share in that custom core product offered into the RIA channel. What we\u2019re hoping to do is not surprisingly leverage the success that Parametric has achieved there across a broader array of asset classes. And so if we\u2019re leader today in custom equity index separate accounts, we want to be the leader in custom bond separate accounts, both indexed and laddered and otherwise. But it's really leveraging the strength of the Parametric brand, the relationships that they built up over the last 25 years to allow us to successfully introduce fixed income strategies into that channel beyond the small success that we've had to date there. I think as your question implied, most of the assets that we have today on the fixed-income side are in the wirehouse and independent side. Through this reorganization and rebranding and changing in this -- in the sales coverage for the RIA channel, it is very much our objective to extend that success into RIA for fixed-income separate accounts. Craig Siegenthaler : Got it. Thank you, Tom. Tom Faust : Yes. Thanks, Craig. Eric Senay : All right. I think this concludes our call. Thank you very much for everybody participating into this call and we will speak with you in fourth quarter earnings webcast. Thank you very much.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentations, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today. Eric Senay, Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations. Thank you Please go ahead, sir. Eric Senay : Thank you, Lisa. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 earnings call and webcast. With me this morning are Tom Faust, Chairman and CEO of Eaton Vance; as well as our CFO, Laurie Hylton. In today\u2019s call, we will first comment on the quarter and fiscal year and then take your questions. As always, the full earnings release and charts we will refer to during the call are available on our website eatonvance.com under the heading Investors Relations. Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainty in our business, including, but not limited to, those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings, including our 2018 Annual Report and Form 10-K are available on our website or upon request at no charge. I will now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Faust : Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Earlier today, Eaton Vance reported $3.45 of adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year ended October 31, which is an increase of 7% from $3.21 per diluted share in fiscal 2018. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we reported $0.95 of adjusted earnings per diluted share, up 12% from $0.85 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, and up 6% from $0.90 in this year\u2019s third fiscal quarter. Both the annual and quarterly results represent new record highs for the company. We ended fiscal 2019 with $497.4 billion of consolidated assets under management also a new record high, and up 13% from the end of last year. By mandate reporting category, changes in consolidated assets under management versus the prior fiscal year end ranged from growth of 22% for exposure management, 21% for fixed income, 20% for portfolio implementation, and 14% for equity, to declines of 22% for floating rate income and 31% for alternatives. Fiscal 2019 marked Eaton Vance\u2019s 24th consecutive year of positive net flows. For the fiscal year, we generated $23.9 billion of consolidated net inflows, or $12.9 billion, excluding exposure management mandates, which have more volatile flows and lower average fee rates than our other mandate reporting categories. Fiscal 2019 net flows represent 5% internal growth in managed assets. Consolidated net inflows for the fourth quarter were $9.8 billion, or $2.8 billion, excluding exposure management, making the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 our 21st consecutive quarter of positive net flows. Fourth quarter net flows represent 8% annualized internal growth in managed assets. Internal growth in consolidated management fee revenue was a modest 0.1% for fiscal 2019 as a whole, as growth achieved in the second, third and fourth fiscal quarters was substantially offset by first quarter declines. Annualized internal growth in consolidated management fee revenue was 2% in the fourth quarter, which compares to 2% in the prior quarter and 1% in the fourth quarter of last year. To calculate, internal growth in consolidated management fee revenue, we subtract management fees attributable to consolidated outflows for the period from management fees attributable to consolidated inflows, and then measure the difference as a percent of beginning of period consolidated management fee revenue, taking into account the fee rate applicable to each dollar in and out. While other public asset managers generally do not disclose similar growth metrics, we believe Eaton Vance continues to rank among the industry leaders by this measure. Looking at our annual flows by mandate reporting category, equity net inflows for the year totaled $4.8 billion from $1 billion of equity category net inflows in fiscal 2018. Each of our principal investment affiliates contributed positively to equity net inflows in fiscal 2019. Eaton Vance management\u2019s 2019 equity net inflows of $2.3 billion included a corresponding amount of net inflows into privately offered wealth management funds and $1.3 billion into wealth management separate accounts under Eaton Vance Investment Counsel, partially offset by aggregate net outflows from other EVM equity strategies. Atlanta Capital\u2019s $350 million of equity net inflows for the fiscal year were driven by nearly $700 million into the Calvert equity fund, for which Atlanta Capital serves as sub advisor, $250 million into other large-cap growth mandates, and nearly $500 million into the select equity mid large cap strategy, all partially offset by net outflows from Atlanta Capital\u2019s small cap and SMID-cap franchises, which are generally closed to new investors. Excluding the Atlanta Capital managed Calvert equity fund, Calvert generated $2.0 billion of net \u2013 of equity net inflows in fiscal 2019 led by emerging market small cap and responsible index strategies. Parametric\u2019s equity strategies had approximately $250 million of net inflows for the fiscal year, as growth in defensive equity and other volatility risk management mandates more than offset net outflows from Parametric\u2019s emerging market equities. Eaton Vance\u2019s fixed income strategies had $11.9 billion of net inflows in fiscal 2019, up 24% from $9.5 billion of net inflows in fiscal 2018. As in fiscal 2018, our fixed income net inflows was added by laddered bond separate accounts, which contributed $6.5 billion across municipal and corporate mandates. Net inflows in the Eaton Vance and Calvert brand in the U.S. fixed income mutual funds totaled $6.1 billion in the fiscal year, including $4.3 billion into taxable fixed income mutual funds and $1.8 billion into national and state specific municipal bond funds. Full leaders among fixed income funds included Eaton Vance short duration government income, with net inflows of $2.65 billion and Eaton Vance core plus bond fund with net inflows of $575 million. Calvert fixed income mutual funds saw net inflows of $1.1 billion for the fiscal year. In our portfolio implementation reporting category, net inflows of $8.4 billion in fiscal 2019 were substantially unchanged from the prior fiscal year and reflect $8.7 billion of net contributions to Parametric custom core equity individual separate accounts and $1.4 billion of net contributions to custom core equity institutional accounts, partially offset by net withdrawals from centralized portfolio management and multi-asset implementation mandates. Combining the $8.7 billion of custom core equity individual separate account net inflows, with the $6.5 billion of laddered bond individual separate account in inflows, what we refer to sometimes as custom beta, contributed nearly $15.3 billion to Eaton Vance\u2019s net inflows for the fiscal year. As shown on Slide 12 of our presentation, managed assets in custom beta individual separate accounts increased 33% year-over-year to end fiscal 2019 at almost a $112 billion. Parametric\u2019s exposure management mandates generated $11 billion of net inflows for the fiscal year versus net outflows of $8.3 billion in fiscal 2018. The positive change year-over-year in exposure management net flows, primarily reflects continuing clients on balance adding to their overlay positions in fiscal 2019 versus net reductions in outstanding positions of continuing clients in fiscal 2018. Net flows from entering and leaving clients were positive in both fiscal 2018 and 2019, as they have been throughout Parametric\u2019s ownership of this business dating back to 2012. In our alternatives reporting category, net outflows of $3.9 billion for the fiscal year, compared to net inflows of $700 million in fiscal 2018 and were driven by $2.7 billion of outflows from our two global macro absolute return mutual funds offered in the U.S. and nearly $1 billion of outflows from global macro institutional sub-advisory mandates. These strategies, which hold the long and short positions in currency and short duration sovereign debt instruments of emerging and frontier market countries generated disappointing returns in calendar 2018, but have rebounded to solid performance in 2019. For the year-to-date through yesterday, total return net of expenses of the Class I Shares of the Eaton Vance global macro absolute return and global macro absolute return advantage funds were plus 7.9% and plus 11.7%, respectively, far outpacing their benchmark in peer groups and restoring these funds long-term performance to competitive levels. Our floating rate bank loan strategies faced similar forward pressure in fiscal 2019, although not driven by performance. On an overall basis, our floating rate category flows moved from net inflows of $5.9 billion in fiscal 2018 to net outflows of $8.3 billion in fiscal 2019. Retail bank-owned funds we offer in the U.S. and internationally had net outflows of $5.8 billion and institutional bank-owned funds in separate accounts contributed another $2.5 billion to fiscal 2019 net outflows. Demand for floating rate loan strategies contracted in fiscal 2019, as investors responded to changing expectations for short-term interest rates. While the outflows we experienced are disappointing, we\u2019re pleased that we have been able to increase our market share among U.S. bank loan mutual funds, reflecting our loan team\u2019s position as an industry leaders and the strong track record the team has developed over time. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, flow trends across mandate reporting categories generally mirrored results for the fiscal year as a whole with continuing net inflows into equity fixed income, portfolio implementation and exposure management mandates and continuing net outflows from floating rate income and alternative mandates. Compared to the preceding quarter, notable swings in net flow results were $4.3 billion increase in exposure management net inflows, a $1.1 billion decline in fixed income net inflows, and a $1.4 billion increase in floating rate income net outflows. Consistent with the year-over-year improvement in exposure management flows, the growth in fourth quarter net inflows for this category was driven primarily by existing clients adding to their overall overlay exposures during the period. In fixed income, the quarterly decline in net inflows reflects reduced flows into Eaton Vance short duration government income fund and somewhat lower net sales of laddered bond separate accounts. In floating rate income, the quarterly increase in net outflows was attributable primarily to higher mutual fund redemptions, as retail investors responded to the Fed\u2019s rate cuts of 25 basis points each instituted on July 31, September 18, and October 30. With the Fed now officially in pause mode with no more rate cuts anticipated and the loan funds offering quite attractive relative yields, we anticipate improvement in our floating rate flows over coming quarters. While flows in and out of our floating rate loan strategies have always cycled up and down with movements in short-term rates and changing economic conditions, we see no reason to believe this business won\u2019t resume its long-term growth trajectory when external conditions are right. A notable positive development over fiscal 2019 was Calvert\u2019s strong overall flow growth. Including the Atlantic Capital managed Calvert equity fund, Calvert generated net inflows of $3.7 billion in fiscal 2019, which corresponds to 25% internal growth in managed assets and growth accelerated as the year progressed. Calvert\u2019s fourth quarter net inflows of $1.3 billion equate to an annualized organic revenue growth of 29%. Since becoming part of Eaton Vance in December 2016, Calvert\u2019s managed assets, including Calvert equity fund, have grown from $11.9 billion to $19.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2019, an increase of 66%. With strong investment performance across Calvert\u2019s diversified lineup of equity income and multi-asset strategies and accelerating market demand for investment strategies that achieved both positive returns and positive social impact, we continue to believe that Calvert represents a significant growth opportunity for Eaton Vance. On an overall basis, fiscal 2019 was a period of continuing strong investment performance across our principal investment affiliates. As of October 31, we sponsored 76 U.S. mutual funds with an overall Morningstar rating of four or five stars for at least one class of shares, including 32 five-star rated funds. As measured by total return, at fiscal year-end, 46% of our U.S. mutual fund assets ranked in the top quartile of their Morningstar peer groups over three years, 62% in the top quartile over five-years, and 58% in the top quartile over 10 years. Amid continuing skepticism about the value of active management, our teams are delivering market beating performance across a broad array of investment mandates. I would next like to provide an update on the strategic initiative involving our Parametric and Eaton Vance management investment affiliates that we announced in late June. As described in August on our third quarter call, the initiative has three principal components. First, rebranding EVM\u2019s rules-based systematic investment-grade fixed income strategies as Parametric and aligning internal reporting consistent with this revised branding; second, combining the technology and operating platform supporting the individual separate \u2013 separately managed account businesses at Parametric and EVM; and third, integrating the distribution teams serving Parametric and EVM clients and business partners in the register and investment advisor and multi-family office market. The internal change process supporting this initiative is now well underway with completion targeted for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. As we move closer to finalizing implementation, we\u2019re increasingly convinced that these changes will meaningfully enhance Parametric\u2019s position as a market leader in the rapidly growing customized individual separate account business and position the company overall for faster growth. As we enter fiscal 2020, Eaton Vance is focused on four strategic priorities. First, capitalizing on the near-term growth opportunities presented by our market-leading positions in customized individual separate accounts, responsible investing and specialty wealth management strategies and services, as well as the array of high-performing active strategies we offer across asset classes and investment styles. Second, defending our franchise businesses now experiencing declines, most notably floating rate bank loans and global macro absolute return strategies. Third, evolving the company to enhance our competitive position by developing new value-added investment offerings, achieving greater operating efficiencies and opportunistically pursuing acquisition opportunities. And fourth, investing in the company\u2019s future, both in terms of our infrastructure and our people. As the investment industry continues to weather challenging times, we remain confident in the strength of Eaton Vance\u2019s competitive position and our ability to thrive amid industry adversity. Few peer companies have realistic prospects for near-term and long-term business growth on the same scale as afforded by our leading positions and customized individual separate accounts, responsible investing, especially wealth management strategies and services and high-performing active investment strategies. And few peers are blessed with similar strengths in corporate culture, financial resources, business focus, and marketplace reputation and relationships. We entered fiscal 2020 with confidence in our strengths and optimism about our future. That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Laurie. Laurie Hylton : Thank you, and good morning. Tom described, we are reporting reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.45 for fiscal 2019, up 7% from $3.21 in the prior fiscal year. As you can see in attachment two to our press release, earnings under U.S. GAAP exceeded adjusted earnings by $0.05 per diluted share in fiscal 2019, reflecting the reversal of $5.4 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards. Adjusted earnings exceeded GAAP earnings by $0.10 per diluted share in fiscal 2018, reflecting the add-back of $24 million income tax expense recognized in relation to the non-recurring impact of the U.S. tax law changes enacted in December 2017, and a $6.5 million charge recognized upon the expiration of the company\u2019s option to acquire an additional 26% ownership interest in our 49% owned affiliate, Hexavest, partially offset by the reversal of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based awards a $17.5 million. In fiscal 2019, operating income decreased by 6% year-over-year, reflecting substantially flat management fee revenue, a 6% decline in non-management fee revenue and 2% growth in operating expenses. Our operating margin was 30.9% in fiscal 2019 and 32.8% in fiscal 2018. The difference between our reported 7% increase in adjusted earnings per diluted share and the 6% decline in operating income is explained principally by a $50 million positive change year-over-year in non-operating income and expense, a decline in the company\u2019s adjusted effective tax rate from 27.6% in fiscal 2018 to 25.2% in fiscal 2019 and a 7% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The improvement in non-operating income and expense was driven principally by higher net gains and other investment income from the company\u2019s investments in sponsored strategies and an increase in income contribution from consolidated CLO entities. As Tom described, we are reporting record adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.95 for the fourth quarter fiscal 2019, up 12% from $0.85 in the fourth quarter fiscal 2018, and up 6% from $0.90 in the third quarter fiscal 2019. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share this quarter include $0.08 of combined contribution from seed capital and consolidated CLO entity investments, compared to the $0.01 contributed in the fourth quarter of last year and $0.04 of contribution in the third quarter fiscal 2019. Earnings under U.S. GAAP exceeded adjusted earnings by a $0.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and $0.02 per diluted share in the fourth quarter fiscal 2018, reflecting the reversal of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based awards during those periods of $1.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively. Adjusted earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 equaled GAAP earnings per diluted share with no material adjustments. As Tom noted, ending in consolidated managed assets reached a new record high of $497.4 billion at October 31, 2019, up 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, driven by strong net flows and positive market returns. Average managed assets in fiscal 2019 were up 5% from the prior fiscal year. Management fee revenue was substantially unchanged year-over-year, as growth in average managed assets was offset by decline in our average management fee rate from 33 basis points in fiscal 2018 to 31.6 basis points in fiscal 2019. Changes in our average management fee raised year-over-year, primarily reflect shifts in business mix. Performance-based fees, which are excluded from the calculation of our average management fees, contributed $1.7 million to revenue in fiscal 2019 versus a negative $1.7 million in fiscal 2018. Comparing fourth quarter results to the same quarter last year. 8% growth in average managed assets drove 2% growth in management fee revenue. Sequentially, average managed assets increased 4% driving management fee revenue growth of 1%. Management fee revenue growth trailed growth in average managed assets for each of the comparative quarterly periods, primarily due to declines in our average annualized management fee rates of 6% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Performance fees were a positive $0.1 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2019 and negative $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and a positive $0.1 million in the third quarter fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2019 operating income decreased by 6%, or $34.3 million, primarily reflecting a 1%, or $9.2 million decrease in revenue and a 4%, or $21.9 million increase in compensation expense. Fiscal 2019 revenue was adversely affected by the market declines experienced in November and December 2018. While approximately $8.7 million of the increase in compensation expense year-over-year is attributable to higher severance expense, $6.2 million of which was recognized in the fourth quarter. Operating income increased by 6% in the fourth quarter fiscal 2019 from the same period a year ago, reflecting a 2% increase in management fees, offset by a 5% decline in non-management fee revenue and a 4% growth in operating expenses. Operating income was down 1% sequentially, reflecting a 1% increase in both management fees and operating expenses compared to the prior quarter. Our operating margin of 31.2% in the fourth quarter fiscal 2019, compared to 33.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and 31.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Turning to expenses. Compensation costs increased 4% in fiscal 2019, primarily driven by higher salaries and benefits associated with increases in headcount, salary increases instituted for rank and file employees, higher stock-based compensation and the $8.7 million increase in severance, partially offset by lower sales-based incentive compensation operating income-based bonus accruals. One-time severance costs associated with employee terminations totaled $10.2 million in fiscal 2019 versus $1.5 million in fiscal 2018. Based on what we know today, we do not expect to incur meaningful amounts of employee termination costs in the first quarter fiscal 2020. Compensation expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 37.2% in fiscal 2019 from 35.7% in fiscal 2018. We anticipate the compensation as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 will likely be modestly higher than the 37% we experienced in the fourth quarter fiscal 2019, given seasonal pressures associated with payroll tax clock reset 401(k) funding, the acceleration of stock-based compensation expense associated with first quarter retirements and year-end base salary increases. Controlling our compensation costs and other discretionary spending remains top of mind as we move into the new fiscal year. Non-compensation distribution-related costs, including distribution and service fee expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased 3% in fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting lower Class C distribution and service fee expenses, driven by a decrease in average managed assets of Class C mutual fund shares. This decrease was partially offset by higher service fee expense and commission amortization for private funds, driven by higher average managed assets in these funds. Fund-related expenses increased 7% in fiscal 2019, reflecting higher sub-advisory fees due to an increase in average managed assets to sub-advised funds. Other operating expenses increased 5% in fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting increase in information technology spending, facilities expenses and travel expenses, partially offset by decrease in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets that were fully amortized during our first fiscal quarter of 2019, and a decrease in professional services expenses. We continue to focus on overall expense management and identifying ways to gain operational leverage. Net gains and other investment income related to seed capital investments contributed $0.13 and $0.03 to earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. On a quarterly basis, net gains and other investment income on seed capital investments contributed $0.04 to earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter fiscal 2019, a $0.01 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and $0.06 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. When quantifying the impact of our seed capital investments on earnings, we take into consideration our pro rata share of the gains, losses and other investment income earned on investments and sponsored strategies, whether accounted for as consolidated funds, separate accounts or equity investments, as well as the gains and losses recognized on derivatives used to hedge these investments, we then report the per share impact of net of income taxes and net income attributable to non-controlling interest. We continue to hedge the market exposures of our seed capital portfolio to the extent practicable to minimize the associated earnings volatility. Although we hedge the majority of our seed capital portfolio, gains on the unhedged portion drove with the positive contribution to earnings in the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. Other income and expense amounts related to consolidated CLO entities contributed $0.07 and a $0.01 to earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. On a quarterly basis, amounts related to consolidated CLO entities contributed $0.04 to earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter fiscal 2019 were negligible in the fourth quarter fiscal 2018 and reduced earnings by $0.02 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Other income and expense amounts related to consolidated CLOs reflect changes in our economic interest in these entities, including the fair market value of our investments, distributions received and management fees earned. Our strategy for CLO equity remains to commit prudent amounts of EV capital to support growth of this business, taking advantage of opportunities to recycle equity in existing CLOs to help fund new CLOs in the future. Turning to taxes. Our effective tax rate was 24.2% in fiscal 2019 and 28.8% in fiscal 2018. The company\u2019s income tax provision for fiscal 2019 included $3.2 million of costs associated with certain provisions of the 2017 tax act relating to limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation that began taking effect for the company in fiscal 2019. The company\u2019s income tax provision was reduced by net excess tax benefits related to stock-based awards of $5.4 million in fiscal 2019 and $17.5 million in fiscal 2018. The company\u2019s income tax provision for fiscal 2018 further included a non-recurring charge of $24 million related to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act. As shown in attachment two to our press release, our calculations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share remove the net excess tax benefits related to stock-based rewards and the non-recurring impact of the tax law changes. On this basis, our adjusted effective tax rate was 25.2% in fiscal 2019 and 27.6% in fiscal 2018. On the same adjusted basis, we estimate that our effective tax rate will range between 26.5% and 27% for fiscal 2020. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we use $38 million of corporate cash to pay the $0.35 per share quarterly dividend declared at the end of our previous quarter and repurchased 1.2 million shares of nonvoting common stock for approximately $55.1 million. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $114.4 million in fiscal 2019, down 7% from $122.9 million in fiscal 2018, reflecting share repurchases in excess of new shares issued upon vesting of restricted stock awards and exercise employee stock options, and a decrease in the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and unvested restricted stock awards. We finished our fourth fiscal quarter holding $855.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term debt securities, and approximately $323.8 million in seed capital investments. We continue to place high priority on using the company\u2019s cash flow to benefit shareholders. Fiscal discipline around discretionary spending remains top of mind as we contemplate, both volatile markets and significant corporate initiatives. As Tom noted, the strategic initiative we announced in June includes investments in technology to support a consolidated individual separate account platform geared towards enhancing scalability and achieving higher levels of operating efficiency. We anticipate that the operation efficient \u2013 operational efficiencies gained with this initiative will enable us to grow our customized individual separate account business without making significant additions to our headcount. Based on our strong liquidity and overall financial condition, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to invest in our business to support long-term growth, while returning capital to shareholders. This concludes our prepared comments. At this point, we\u2019d like to take any questions you may have. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is open. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. Just a clarification on some of the comments, Laurie, around severance. So did I hear right that it was $6.2 million here in the fourth quarter and you don\u2019t expect much in the first quarter? And I guess, it sounds like in the aggregate number for the year was a little high, can you talk about where the changes are coming from a headcount perspective, and if there are any other one-time kind of expenses in this fourth quarter number? Laurie Hylton : Sure, Dan. The severance is largely focused around the initiatives that we announced in June associated with the separate account project with Parametric and Eaton Vance management. So I think, we had announced we have made some significant \u2013 we\u2019ve made a very significant hire at Parametric in terms of the Chief Technology Officer and some of the severance related to some employee changes around that initiative. And in terms of other significant fourth quarter impact items, there really was nothing else that would identify as being significant in the quarter. Daniel Fannon : Okay. And then, so I guess just now that you\u2019re a little bit further along in terms of that restructuring and some of those changes. As you think about next year, I get the comments that you\u2019re focused on efficiency, but is there increased savings or operational leverage as a result of some of these changes that you maybe have greater clarity on today than you did when you first announced this? Laurie Hylton : Dan, we\u2019re still in very early days. Obviously, we\u2019re working through a lot of the internal changes. I think that we had identified that we\u2019re going to be consolidating sales professionals into a one single channel to cover RIA and multi-family offices, and we\u2019re well underway in actually making those changes. We\u2019re also, as we identified, consolidating under the Parametric brands, our tabs laddered in our corporate laddered businesses, so all those changes internally are well underway. We do anticipate that we will have, as we identified previously, incremental technology spends that we will be \u2013 and we will be making those investments throughout fiscal 2020. I would anticipate that we\u2019ll see a modest uptick in our technology spend related to those efforts. We do firmly believe, however, that those efforts over time will result in a significantly more efficient platform, and therefore, we will not be seeing significant increases in headcount associated with that. Daniel Fannon : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question and really just to kind of follow-up on Dan\u2019s question at first. As we think about 2020, if we\u2019re in normal markets, if sales are sort of similar to the pace that you guys see this year, are margins expected to kind of rise/fall, or do they see the same based on your outlook for these investments? Laurie Hylton : I would not anticipate that we would see a significant change in margins. I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind that roughly 55% of our costs at this point are fixed, 45% are variable. As I mentioned, we would anticipate seeing a modest uptick in the technology spend. But given the parameters that you outlined in terms of the forecast for next year, I would not anticipate seeing a significant change in margin. Ken Worthington : Okay. Tom Faust : And I would just add, that\u2019s assuming that market levels\u2026 Laurie Hylton : \u2026right. Tom Faust : \u2026stay in the range at where we are today. Ken Worthington : Okay. Okay, thank you. And I know you\u2019ve been at a couple of conferences and probably addressed this question a bunch. But just on UBS, the changing of pricing for SMAs beginning in, I think, January of next year, so a couple of questions around that. Is Eaton Vance going to opt into the UBS Access or UBS Strategic Wealth Portfolio offerings that have the new pricing? And if so, what might the impact be of that? UBS is calling SMA strategies this month, was Eaton Vance impacted by the calling? And then, ultimately what is the move by UBS mean for Eaton Vance, particularly if UBS becomes sort of the industry standard in how they\u2019re treating the SMAs? Tom Faust : So a few things in there, I can respond to. So as far as I know, we were not impacted by any calling of products to use your words, so I don\u2019t \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen any changes yet. My understanding of the timing of the UBS initiative in separate accounts is that, they\u2019re offering some, what I\u2019ll say, internally or maybe technically managed by not UBS Wealth Management, but UBS Asset Management, but affiliate company offerings will begin entering the market in January 2020, and that they\u2019re looking to add third-party managers to this new program that they announced, I believe starting in July. So we\u2019re still some months away and we certainly have not committed to being a part of that program. Whether or not or to what degree it affects this business, I think, will largely be based on participation levels and I mean, that in two different respects. First, how active are UBS Financial Advisors in introducing these programs to their clients or converting their client business into these new programs. So is there a significant opt-in to these internal programs that will take effect in January? And then second, when the program becomes available to third-party managers, such as ourselves in the second-half of next year, what\u2019s the participation rate among asset managers? And also, again, what\u2019s the participation rate among UBS Financial Advisors? So it\u2019s pretty early days. My impression is that some of the pricing and terms of these offerings are still at least somewhat in flux. One of the things we do like about this is importantly, that it recognizes the distinctive value of tax management and responsible investing with the \u2013 I believe under their proposal, this would \u2013 there would be a extra client charge, extra payment that would be passed through to the investment advisor associated with assets that are tax managed and assets that offer responsible investing as a component of that, and we are \u2013 we believe the market leader in both tax advantage and responsibly managed individual separate accounts. So in some ways, that\u2019s an endorsement of our position in this business. They have described this as a move to bring institutional pricing to the individual separate account business. But from what we understand, the pricing levels that we\u2019re proposing are generally quite a bit lower than our understanding of where institutional prices are. So I think it\u2019ll be a challenge for advisors to embrace the UBS pricing without potentially adversing pricing of other business, where, in many cases, that most favored nation provisions will limit the ability to offer better prices to UBS clients, for example, than are offered to compliance of other broker dealers or other institutional clients. So I think, it\u2019s pretty early days in terms of trying to anticipate what the impact of this will be, but maybe I\u2019ll stop there on that topic. Ken Worthington : Okay. Well, that was helpful. I really appreciate it. Thank you very much. Tom Faust : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous. Your line is open. Patrick Davitt : Good morning. Thank you. You mentioned, the Fed \u2013 the change in Fed stance on rates potentially helping flows in the bank loan business, but there has been a lot of increasing chatter about credit weakness in leveraged loans. So could you kind of parse out that view through the lens of potential concerns about credit weakness? In other words like, how could we expect that much better flow picture, people are worried about credit in that product? Tom Faust : Yes. And that\u2019s the \u2013 you\u2019re right. That\u2019s \u2013 why do people buy or sell bank loan strategies? These are below investment-grade strategies. So in addition to being floating rate, there is a credit component, that\u2019s what you get paid for as a loan investor as to take credit risk during periods when credit risk is perceived as widening prices of loans typically fall. We have not seen a lot of price action. Bank loan prices have actually been quite stable. Overall moves in terms of the stock market and other sort of broad measures of economic expectations have generally been positive over the last couple of months. There\u2019s certainly nothing in our portfolio of loan exposures, at least to the extent I\u2019m aware, that suggests there are major concerns about credit emerging in the bank loan asset class. At some point, there will be a turn in the economic cycle. We certainly don\u2019t believe that economic cycles have been in some way repealed, but there\u2019s nothing in our crystal ball that suggests that a downward trend is imminent. And from the perspective of our team, the spreads offered and \u2013 the spreads and rates offered by floating rate bank loans are quite low today, are quite \u2013 sorry, quite attractive today and that the risk of a near-term downturn is seemingly quite low. I would also observe that the history of this asset class through market downturn has been generally quite attractive rates of recovery on loans that default reflecting the senior secured status of these assets. So we don\u2019t see a cycle turning down anytime soon. We know at some point it will turn down, but the history of this asset class is that based on spreads in the market today and in the market over time that investors are being well compensated for the credit risk they\u2019re taking by investing in floating rate bank loans. Patrick Davitt : That\u2019s all I have. Thanks. Tom Faust : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citi. Your line is open. William Katz : Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question. Maybe just, Tom, sticking with maybe your thinking a little bit more, you had mentioned in some of your prepared comments some of the three or four things you want to focus on for this year. Could you expand a little bit on maybe two of those points just in terms of \u201cthe spending\u201d some of the franchise, parts of the business, the bank loan and global macro? And then, just sort of how you sort of see the industry from a consolidation perspective and how you might think about capital deployment? Tom Faust : Sure. So let\u2019s first talk about bank loans and global macro. So our bank loans have been in this pretty significant outflow. I\u2019m really focused on U.S. retail, where the flow numbers are quite visible. Remarkable outflows over the last 12 months after a period of inflows and, yes, it pretty well attracts changes in interest rate expectations, though it feels like this cycle of inflows and outflows has been rather amplified relative to the changes in short-term rates that we\u2019ve seen and certainly what we expect from here. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re pleased that we\u2019ve gained market share in that environment. We are the flow leader in the category in terms of market share and are gratified that through the downturn, we\u2019ve seen smaller shrinkage in our business than the retail market as a whole, so that\u2019s good. So we feel like we\u2019re entering this \u2013 we\u2019re going through this down period by strengthening our position. And I would say broadly that one of the benefits of being an industry leader, and certainly this is a category where we are an industry leader, is that that\u2019s often the case is that opportunities to hold and build market share, capitalizing on leadership positions tend to be the greatest during periods of market weakness and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going through, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re experiencing. And while we don\u2019t like to see the shrinkage in our business, we\u2019re pleased that we are seemingly adding to our position based on industry statistics. In terms of our global macro, this is a business that we\u2019ve grown over the last maybe 10 or so years pretty significantly. Here, too, there\u2019s a certain cyclicality of performance and flows. What tends to happen is that, during periods of general equity market strength and strong returns in bond markets, the value of this asset class as a diversifier is maybe somewhat underrepresented, underappreciated in the marketplace. But during periods when people are concerned about equity risks or concerned about interest rate risk or concerned about certain types of credit risk, the diversifying impact of this asset class and these two funds, in particular, has caused these to be significant flow winners in those environments. So they play an important role in diversifying our book of business in the same way that they play an important role in diversifying the asset class exposures of investors in these strategies. They are \u2013 just as a reminder, we have a country picking approach taking long and short positions in emerging market and frontier market debt and sovereign currency \u2013 currency and sovereign debt instruments of emerging and frontier market countries. So a quite distinctive return profile. It\u2019s been good this year, approaching 8% for our lower risk, less volatile core offering and close to 12% for our somewhat more aggressive offering in that business. This has been a business, where historically flows have tracked returns. The fact that we\u2019ve got good returns this year to us suggest that we will see improvement next year in the flow picture there. In terms of our overall \u2013 just the \u2013 maybe with the broader question of our competitive position, as I mentioned, I feel really good about where we are that there are in addition to the two sort of businesses that are in defend mode, that is bank loans and global macro, both of which \u2013 it feels to me they either are or should be nearing a point of bottoming in terms of the trajectory of down flows. But also we\u2019ve got a nice group, a very strong group of growth vectors that we think put us in very strong position, starting with the leading position of Parametric in customized individual separate accounts, sometime referred to as direct indexing or custom indexing, where we do see significant opportunities for incremental growth likely to develop out of this initiative to combine our municipal and corporate laddered business under Parametric, which gives us the ability to offer, among other things, multi-asset class structures, all tax managed and managed and reported in a single coherent way. Overall, I think that\u2019s likely to be a tremendous growth driver for us. As I mentioned, our business in wealth management strategies and services is growing our, what we call, Eaton Vance Investment Counsel, had a very strong year of inflows, which we\u2019re certainly hopeful we can build on next year. Clearly, there has been an explosion in interest and responsible investing. Calvert is one of the leading brands in that marketplace. In the U.S. retail space, we see significant opportunities in the next fiscal year to grow not only in U.S. retail, but to start to move beyond that into institutional markets in the U.S. and also growing internationally. We are one of the most recognized brands in responsible investing, and that\u2019s an area where people still struggle for definition and clarity, where our role as an industry leader positions us to really help define and help drive the growth of this business segment going forward. So I really think we\u2019re in the early days of what can be very strong \u2013 many years of strong growth for Calvert and more broadly for Eaton Vance in responsible investing. As I look at the industry landscape, sort of trends that we see are likely to be increasing pressures on many parts of the business, I think, we\u2019re likely to see more pressure on top line, driven by continuing price competition in the business. At some point, we\u2019ll see an equity downturn that will put more pressure on companies, where we think we enter that environment from a position of clear strength with not only a number of market-leading franchises, but also strong balance sheet, strong culture, strong leadership, continuity of approach focused on this business, great relationships in the market, history of innovation. We think all of those things will be rewarded in the hard times that we expect our industry to be going through certainly compared to the periods of strong growth that we\u2019ve experienced over most of my 30-plus-years in the business. So we\u2019re not all that optimistic at the moment about near-term trends in our industry, but are quite optimistic about our relative position within asset management. William Katz : Okay. And just as a follow-up, and thanks for taking these questions. Maybe a two-part or one, can you just \u2013 Tom, I lost you a little bit when you were talking about some of the pricing complexities with the UBS in terms of the most favored nations. Just wondering if you could sort of flush that out? And then, stepping back, there has been a bunch of sea chain events on the retail broker/dealer models just in terms of combination of moving to the zero pricing on certain trading, as well as some potential M&A. How full would those events impact Eaton Vance\u2019s pro or con? Tom Faust : Yes. I guess to be determined, but let me start with the UBS question just to clarify. So maybe I use the term most favored nation provision, which I assume most people would know means that we have arrangements with broker dealers who offer retail managed account platforms. And also in some cases with institutional clients that that say broadly, that we want to offer the same strategy at a better price to a competitor. That is put in there typically at the insistence of the customer. But it also has a somewhat protective effect by enforcing an element of price discipline. So if somebody says within our organization, jeez, this is a great opportunity. We ought to offer this at a discounted fee level. It\u2019s somewhat helpful to our business discipline, if we can say, no, we can\u2019t offer that at that discounted fee level, because that means we have to reprice that same strategy to everyone, but to everywhere where we have a most favored nation provision in place. So that\u2019s the \u2013 I think that\u2019s the general idea. I\u2019m not going to get into the specifics on contracts with individual organizations. But I think it\u2019s fair to understand that there are most favored nations provisions employees covering these managed account programs of the type that UBS is \u2013 that we participate in a UBS. The other question was about, I guess, specifically the Schwab, TD Ameritrade merger proposal or announcement. And back a few weeks earlier, the elimination of trading commissions in certain retail brokerage transactions initiated also by Schwab. In the short run, I would say those changes, at least, the second, but the first one hasn\u2019t happened yet. The merger of the two companies hasn\u2019t happened yet. But what has happened is the elimination of trading commissions in both the direct business of Schwab and its competitors and they\u2019re serving a registered investment advisors. So far, the short-term impact of that on our business has been positive. The effect is, on our individual customized separate account business is, clients aren\u2019t paying commissions on trades and those accounts, which makes at the margin, owning separate accounts more attractive than owning similar exposures through a fund. And broadly speaking, when we sell customized individual separate accounts, in some cases, we\u2019re competing against fund costs \u2013 fund structures, and to the extent, there\u2019s a lower cost for implementing our strategies. That\u2019s a benefit to our growth in those businesses and we have seen that. We have seen benefits from that and a few specific cases. I would say more broadly, as these changes take place with distribution partners and we are partners with all of these firms, increasingly, they will be looking for opportunities to either replace revenues in the case of the loss commissions or to build on existing relationships to otherwise drive revenue growth, that creates opportunities for us. So, I\u2019d say, it cuts both ways. There\u2019s a \u2013 there\u2019s business growth opportunity. No doubt, as that industry consolidates, there will be some pressure to also consolidate the number or types of vendor relationships they have, including with asset management firms. And the imperative for our relationship management teams and sales teams is to make sure that if there is a reduction in relationships to include only the stronger relationships that were on the winning side of that, not the losing side. William Katz : Thanks, Tom. Tom Faust : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is open. Robert Lee : Great, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, Tom, could you just update us \u2013 I think it was back in the spring or so exactly when you had kind of filed for your clear hedge non-transparent ETF technology and, obviously, we\u2019ve seen some others get approvals on their submission. So could you kind of update us kind of what you\u2019re thinking about timing with getting some \u2013 getting through the SEC, I mean, more optimistic less? And then I guess, I have a follow-up to that. Tom Faust : Yes. Thanks, Rob. So we are in discussion with the SEC. They control the timing of that, not us. So we can\u2019t really speculate on timing. But I can confirm that we did submit a proposal. We\u2019ve gotten comments back. We\u2019ve been in dialogue with the SEC. We view the approval or the \u2013 I don\u2019t think it was the final approval, but notice of intent to approve something to that effect, and being a positive for their openness to innovation in the space. We looked carefully at the terms of those approvals. One thing we would note is that, none of the approaches approved so far permit investments in asset classes other than cash and things that trade on exchanges during U.S. market hours. So generally, U.S. stocks and a few other categories of things, but it does not include traditional fixed income investments, which don\u2019t trade on U.S. exchanges. It doesn\u2019t trade \u2013 it doesn\u2019t include foreign stocks. And we certainly believe that there is an advantage to the clear hedge method that should enable it, if approved, to provide funds that follow this method to invest across asset classes with greater confidence of maintaining tight trading markets and also greater confidence that they can maintain tight trading markets across all types of market conditions. So we think the window is open. We don\u2019t know the timing. We\u2019re up \u2013 we\u2019re a newer submission than any of those that were approved. So nobody \u2013 nobody has jumped us in line in terms of the applications that got a favorable nod last week. But we feel good about the opportunity that\u2019s here. Clearly, it\u2019s going to be a very competitive landscape assuming some version of these now five approved ideas will make their way to the marketplace and time. In some ways, who wins or who loses will be defined by product features, relationships also will come into play, also, pricing will certainly come into play. But we want to continue to be active in this space and think that we have a differentiated technology that potentially, if we can persuade the SEC of this positions us to facilitate the offering of less transparent ETFs across all markets \u2013 across all asset classes. Robert Lee : Okay, great. And this is my follow-up. Tom, you mentioned kind of, obviously, continuing to look at strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, and I guess, really, maybe it\u2019s a two-part question. Can you maybe update us on some of your non-U.S. ambitions three, four years ago or so, you \u2013 obviously, you spent time and money kind of building out London. And that kind of almost feels like it\u2019s been, I don\u2019t want to say back-burnered a bit, but there was so much to do in the U.S. kind of hasn\u2019t been front of mind and update us on that? And then if you are thinking about incremental M&A, could you maybe kind of refresh our memories on what some of your priorities would be? Tom Faust : Sure. Just talking about our initiative in London, it certainly has not been a back burnered. We\u2019ve continued to maintain and grow staff in our London office. We recently opened a small satellite office in Dublin as well. So we are committed to and expect to maintain a presence in the UK and Europe. And what maybe has been back burnered a bit is our ambitions and hopes to do a significant acquisition that would bring us broader non-U.S. distribution and investment capabilities outside of the United States. And it\u2019s not for a lack of wanting, it\u2019s for a lack of confidence that there\u2019s a partner out there that makes sense for us. We kick the tires on a number of potential opportunities. And after, as you said, a few years of trying to do this in a significant way, I know that we\u2019ve concluded that there\u2019s no good partner for us. But we certainly are a bit frustrated that we haven\u2019t found the right partner that in a transaction structure that would make sense for us. So that part of it has been has been back burnered. But certainly, our ambition to grow our business outside the United States organically or through strategic partnerships remains. In terms of things that we are looking for in potential acquisitions, I guess, I would highlight a couple. I\u2019ve talked about our ambitions and our strong platform and responsible investing, if there\u2019s a way to grow that, incrementally, we would be certainly open to that. In the past, I\u2019ve talked about our strong position in credit markets, primarily through bank loans and high yield bonds. But the idea that that can provide a natural springboard for us into the private credit space is also something that we have looked at and continue to pursue. But as always we\u2019ll be price-sensitive as we look at potential opportunities there. A third thing we\u2019ve talked about, I think, I\u2019ve been in this on a call earlier this year is the growth of our private client business or wealth management business, where we\u2019ve seen a good organic growth and where we think there could be opportunities to benefit by participating in industry consolidation among wealth management firms, increasing our global \u2013 increasing our footprint across the U.S. and creating avenues for selling our wealth management strategy. So those are the three areas I would focus on. I would identify as focus areas responsible investing private credit in various forms and then wealth management businesses. Robert Lee : Great. And if I could maybe squeeze one last one in the the exchange fund business, which has been around a while. I mean, we\u2019re pretty far into a decade or so bull market. Just kind of curious if you\u2019re seeing how that business is doing? Is it still kind of resonating as much with investors as it used to and kind of status on that? Tom Faust : Yes, that remains a good business for us. Those are private offerings. So we don\u2019t provide a lot of detail on how that business is progressing. But it\u2019s a \u2013 these are strategies offering diversification out of concentrated stock positions into broadly-based equity portfolios. And you would imagine, as the market cycle matures and people have large gains that those strategies continue to have broad appeal. Robert Lee : Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Have a great Thanksgiving. Tom Faust : Thank you. I think, we have time for one more question on our call today. Operator : Okay. Your last question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much for getting me in. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But maybe, Tom, if we could just maybe one more on the active ETF approvals. Just in terms of the two different models that have been approved the Precidian model versus the T. Rowe model, maybe just your perspective on what investment managers might do if they\u2019re keeping that information proprietary in \u2013 which appears to be the structure of the T. Rowe model. And then how your clear hedge model would fit in into that and whether you see the demand not to pick a winner or loser, anything like that. But whether \u2013 to what extent you see demand in future demand in what your clear hedge model would you for that type of structure? Tom Faust : Sure. So, I guess, maybe first to say that what I think people here know, but just to clarify, none of these things are actually approved in the marketplace and there are still some significant steps involved. With our next year\u2019s initiative, we got a \u2013 we got an exemptive order issued, I think, in December of 2014, and we launched our first product in February of 2016. So I can\u2019t say what the time window will be for these other strategies, but that was our experience. And we also got a listing and trading approval in the November, December 2014 timeframe. And I don\u2019t believe any of these concepts have listing and trading approval. And I think for many of them, there\u2019s not even an application that\u2019s been filed. So I think it\u2019ll be a while before these still come to market. I think, there have been some speculation that these might be in the market before the end of 2019. I think that\u2019s not going to happen. In terms of clear hedge and where clear hedge \u2013 where funds utilizing the clear hedge method might fit into this. We are broadly in the camp of disclosing our proxy portfolio. So in that sense, similar to what you\u2019re calling, the T. Rowe Price proposals, these four different ideas that got preliminary approval last week. What\u2019s different about our approach is that, we include a second step, not only disclosing a proxy portfolio, but adding a second step whereby market makers can lay off the basis risk, that is the relative performance risk between the disclosed proxy portfolio and the funds are underlying assets by transacting with the fund itself through a swap type arrangement. The \u2013 so based on this sort of belt-and-suspender approach to achieving better trading efficiency, our case that we\u2019re making to the SEC is that, funds relying on the clear hedge method because of this two step or belt-and-suspender approach to ensuring tight trading can be comfortably applied in places, where the SEC has not to date has been comfortably applying these other concepts, which would be funds that own things other than U.S. equities and cash or things that trade on U.S. exchanges, plus cash, which is the way the market is currently limited. So that\u2019s our case. And also, our case is going to be that, because of this belt-and-suspenders two-stage approach that even in U.S. equity, where these other ideas are approved, our approach can be expected to trade better during periods of market stress, because we\u2019re not in effect asking market makers to place blind bets on the relative performance of the known proxy portfolio versus the unknown portfolio that they are also going long and short in. So it\u2019s a \u2013 think about it as a two-step process, one of which is very similar to this recent round of approval. But the other with this ability that we\u2019re providing, where market makers could lay off the relative risk between the unknown fund holdings and the known proxy portfolio, which none of these other ideas incorporate, and that is subject to a patent that was issued to us about a year ago. So we\u2019ll see how it goes. We\u2019ve been in this game for quite a long time. I think we\u2019ve learned a lot and are optimistic that we can put that learning to good use and hopefully see that translate into an approval and market success for funds utilizing the clear hedge method. Brian Bedell : That\u2019s great color. And then, just I guess in terms of the investment managers going down this path in the future, do you think they would prefer to have proxy portfolios with if they could develop those and thereby keep the \u2013 their information private or proprietary to their shops? Tom Faust : Well, I think, the underlying premise of all these ideas is that disclosing your holdings every day, which is the current fully transparent ETF model, is not consistent with proprietary active management. So if I\u2019m telling the world what my holdings are every day, I don\u2019t consider that proprietary. And if I do that, they\u2019re at least a couple of adverse effects on me that\u2019s the investment advisor or my clients. One is other people can by seeing my changes in daily holdings can learn to anticipate my trades and potentially front run my trades and drive up my trading costs and then drive down returns. The other one is to the extent that on disclosing what is in effect my intellectual property, that is my model portfolio, giving that away to the market for free, I\u2019m inviting other people to take advantage of that by offering the same or similar strategies at a lower price point similar to a generic drug. You don\u2019t want to give away the $4 million and put it out in an unprotected form, which is what fully transparent ETFs do. But also, you\u2019re providing significant information about if it\u2019s a bond portfolio, how you\u2019re feeling about the world in terms of how you\u2019re shifting your duration exposure, how you\u2019re shifting your credit exposure in a way that could give you insights in \u2013 give insights to your competitors to take or potentially use to improve their performance potentially and harm your performance. So it\u2019s \u2013 do you believe in proprietary management and do you believe there\u2019s something that\u2019s worth protecting about that? If you do, the fully transparent structure, we think falls short. All of these ideas, including our own, are seeking to provide the benefits of truly proprietary active management to end customers in an ETF form, which is not heretofore been available. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. Thanks for the color. Tom Faust : Yes. Thank you. Eric Senay : Okay. Well, this concludes today\u2019s earnings call. I want to thank everybody who participated in the call today and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you very much.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentations, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Eric Senay, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Eric Senay : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our fiscal 2020 first quarter earnings call and webcast. With me this morning are Tom Faust, Chairman and CEO of Eaton Vance; as well as our CFO, Laurie Hylton. In today's call, we will first comment on the quarter and fiscal year and then take your questions. As always, the full earnings release and charts we will refer to during the call are available on our website eatonvance.com under the heading Investor Relations. And today's presentation contain forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainties in our business including but not limited to those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings including our 2019 Annual Report and Form 10-K are available on our website or upon request at no charge. I will now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Faust : Good morning and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported $0.86 of adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 which is up 18% from $0.73 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and down 9% from $0.95 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. On a combined basis seed capital and consolidated CLO entity investments contributed $0.03 to adjusted earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and negative $0.02 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and $0.08 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Excluding these items, first quarter fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share were up 11% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. We ended the first quarter of fiscal 2020 with $518.2 billion of consolidated assets under management which is up 17% from a year ago and up 4% from the previous quarter end. First quarter consolidated net inflows were $6.1 billion or $5 billion excluding what we now call Parametric overlay services what we formerly referred to as exposure management. This was our 22nd consecutive quarter of positive net flows and a solid beginning to what we expect will be our 25th consecutive year of positive net flows. Our first quarter net inflows equate to 5% annualized internal growth in managed assets as calculated both with and without Parametric overlay services. Looking at our flow results on a revenue basis. In the first quarter, we achieved 5% annualized internal growth in consolidated management fee revenue, which compares to minus 4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and positive 2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Although revenue-based internal growth rates are not widely reported by other public asset managers, we continue to believe that Eaton Vance ranks among the investment industry leaders by this key growth measure. As we assess the performance of our business in the first quarter, achieving mid-single-digit organic revenue growth is certainly among the highlights. By this measure, the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was our best growth period since the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Last June, we announced an important strategic initiative involving our Parametric Eaton Vance Management and Eaton Vance Distributors affiliates. As we described at that time the initiative has three principal components; rebranding EVM's rules-based systematic investment-grade fixed-income strategies as Parametric and aligning internal reporting consistent with this revised rebranding; internally -- integrating under Eaton Vance Distributors the sales teams serving Parametric and EVM clients and business partners in the registered investment adviser and multifamily office market; and then third, combining under Parametric the technology and operating platforms supporting the individual separately managed account businesses of Parametric and EVM. I'm pleased to report that the internal change process supporting this initiative is substantially complete and that we are already starting to see real benefits to our business. Combining our systemic -- systematic equity and investment-grade fixed-income strategies within the same investment affiliate and consolidating our separate account technology and operating platforms positions Parametric and Eaton Vance to build upon our market-leading positions in custom indexing and laddered bond separate accounts as market demand for these strategies continues to surge. As you can see in our press release and accompanying call slides, we have made certain changes in how we categorize our managed assets and flows for reporting purposes. The new Parametric Custom Portfolios reporting category consists of individual and institutional separate accounts managed by Parametric for which customization is a primary feature. The new classification includes the Parametric equity and multi-asset strategies that formerly composed our old portfolio implementation reporting category which are primarily Custom Core and centralized portfolio management as well as the laddered bond separate accounts that were formerly managed by Eaton Vance Management and previously categorized as fixed income for reporting purposes. In the press release and call slides, the presentation of managed assets flows for all prior periods has been revised to reflect the new classifications. As noted earlier, we have already -- we have also changed the name of our former exposure management reporting category to Parametric overlay services. This reporting category consists primarily of futures-based overlay strategies and services offered to institutional clients to enable them to efficiently add or remove market exposure without affecting underlying portfolio holdings. While this is our lowest fee business with an average current fee rate of 4.9 basis points, it is also nicely profitable and growing. Since entering the business through the acquisition of the former Clifton Group in December 2012, our managed assets and overlay services have more than tripled growing from $32 billion at acquisition to a record $97.5 billion at the end of January. Looking at our first quarter flows in more detail. We had positive net flows for all of our mandate reporting categories except floating-rate income. Annualized internal growth in managed assets range from a high of 9% for Parametric custom portfolios, to 7% for fixed income, 5% for equity and Parametric overlay services, and 4% for alternatives. Although, our floating-rate income business saw $1.4 billion in net outflows and minus 15% annualized internal growth in AUM in the first quarter that's a significant improvement from $2.9 billion of net outflows, and minus 26% annualized internal AUM growth in the first quarter of 2019, and $2.6 billion of net outflows, and minus 27% annualized internal AUM growth in the fourth quarter of 2019. The abating of outflow pressures has been especially pronounced in our floating-rate U.S. mutual funds, where net outflows fell from $2.1 billion in last year's first quarter and $1.9 billion in last year's fourth quarter to approximately $450 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Through Monday of this week, month-to-date outflows from our floating-rate mutual funds had slowed to barely a trickle. Although, net inflows into our alternative strategy were less than $100 million in the first quarter, here too we have experienced substantially improved flow trends compared to fiscal 2019 when we saw net outflows of $2.2 billion in the first quarter and approximately $550 million in the fourth quarter. Our managed assets and flows in the alternative category are dominated by the two Global Macro Absolute Return mutual funds we offer in the U.S. As a reminder, these funds hold long and short positions in currency and short-duration sovereign debt instruments of emerging and frontier market countries. After a disappointing performance in 2018, our global macro funds roared back to strong performance in 2019, no doubt contributing to the improved flow results and flows outlook for the category. February month-to-date flows remain modestly positive for both our global macro mutual funds and the alternative category as a whole. As mentioned earlier, annualized internal growth in our equity mandates was 5% in the first quarter. Calvert EVM and Atlanta Capital each made significant contributions to the quarter's $1.6 billion of equity net inflows. Calvert equity strategies contributed nearly $900 million with the Calvert Emerging Markets and Calvert Equity U.S. mutual funds each generating over $250 million of net inflows. EVM equity strategies contributed approximately $850 million to first quarter net inflows, driven primarily by privately offered funds in the U.S. On top of the more than $250 million net inflows into the Atlanta Capital sub-advised Calvert Equity Fund, Atlanta Capital contributed approximately $450 million of equity net inflows in core and growth mandates. In the first quarter, our fixed-income strategies had $1.1 billion of net inflows, which equates to 7% annualized internal growth in managed assets. On a combined basis EVM and Parametric municipal bond strategies contributed over $700 million to quarterly net inflows and EVM, Calvert and Atlanta Capital taxable bond strategies contributed approximately $400 million. Flow leaders across our fixed-income mutual fund lineup, included Eaton Vance Emerging Markets Local Income Fund with nearly $200 million of net inflows and Calvert Short Duration Income Fund, Eaton Vance Core Plus Bond Fund and Eaton Vance National Municipal Income Fund each with over $100 million of net inflows in the quarter. The newly constituted Parametric custom portfolios reporting category had net inflows of $3.5 billion in the first quarter, generating 9% annualized internal growth in managed assets. This reflects net contributions of $2.7 billion to custom core equity separate accounts and $1.4 billion into laddered bond separate accounts across municipal and corporate mandates, partially offset by approximately $575 million of net withdrawals from centralized portfolio management mandates. Sorted by client type, Parametric custom individual separate accounts had $43 billion of net inflows and Parametric custom institutional separate accounts had $800 million of net outflows. Focusing on custom core equity and laddered bond individual separate accounts the quarter's $4.3 billion of net inflows equates to 15% annualized internal growth in managed assets. As shown on slide 12, Parametric custom portfolios reached a record $175 billion in managed assets as of January 31, 2020. This is a high-growth, highly differentiated investment management business in which Parametric is far and away the market leader across all key segments. We are investing to grow this business by expanding our product offerings, extending our service capability and achieving greater operating efficiencies to drive down costs. We continue to believe that Parametric custom portfolios business is only scratching the surface of its long-term potential. Turning to Calvert. We continue to be very pleased with the business results and investment success we are achieving. In the recently completed first quarter, Calvert generated net inflows of $1.3 billion, which equates to 26% annualized internal growth in managed assets. Including the Calvert Equity Fund sub-advised by Atlanta Capital, Calvert's managed assets reached a new high of $21.8 billion at the end of the first quarter with continued strong investment performance across Calvert's diversified lineup of equity income and multi-asset strategies. As of the end of January, 21 Calvert U.S. mutual funds were rated four or five stars from Morningstar for at least one class of shares including seven five-star rated funds. We continue to see strong demand for Calvert's distinctive lineup of investment strategies that combine a record of investment excellence and a deep multi-decade-long commitment to the principles of responsible investing. As the investment management industry as a whole continues to struggle to grow revenues net of market effects, Eaton Vance's ability to deliver internally sourced, top line growth sets us apart. The strength of our high-growth franchises and customized individual separate accounts, responsible investing and wealth management strategies and services, the range of active strategies that with top-tier performance that we offer across investment asset classes and the prospects for continued recovery in our floating-rate income and alternatives category flows combine to give us confidence that we can continue to grow our business at rates well above the overall asset management industry average. While market action over recent days reminds us that unforeseen forces can upset even the best-laid plans, we approach the balance of 2020, and our long-term future with optimism for continued growth and success. That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Laurie. Laurie Hylton : Thank you, and good morning. As Tom described, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.86 for the first quarter fiscal 2020, up 18% from $0.73 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and down 9% from $0.95 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share this quarter, includes $0.03 of combined contribution from seed capital and consolidated CLO entity investments, compared to a negative $0.02 contribution in the first quarter of last year, and an $0.08 contribution in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. As you can see in Attachment two to our press release, earnings under U.S. GAAP exceeded adjusted earnings by $0.05 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 $0.02 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and $0.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, reflecting the reversal of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards during those periods of $4.9 million, $2.9 million and $1.5 million respectively. Operating income increased by 11% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 from the same period a year ago, reflecting an 11% increase in both revenue and operating expenses. Operating income was down 1% sequentially, reflecting a 4% increase in revenue and a 7% growth in operating expenses. Our operating margin was 29.8% in both the first quarters of fiscal 2020 and 2019 and 31.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. As Tom noted, ending consolidated managed assets reached a new quarter-end high of $518.2 billion at January 31, 2020, up 17% year-over-year and 4% sequentially driven by strong net flows and positive market returns. Average managed assets this quarter were up 17% from the same period last year, driving management fee revenue growth of 13%. Management fee revenue growth trailed growth in average managed assets year-over-year, primarily due to a decline in our average annualized management fee rate from 32 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to 30.8 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Changes in our average annualized management fee rates over the comparative period, primarily reflects shifts in business mix. Sequentially, growth in average managed assets of 4%, matched growth in management fee revenue as our average annualized management fee rate of 30.8 basis points was unchanged. Performance-based fees, which are excluded from the calculation of our average management fee rates, contributed $0.2 million to revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 versus negative $0.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and positive $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Turning to expenses. Compensation costs increased 12% year-over-year, reflecting higher salaries and benefits associated with increases in headcount and year-end merit adjustments, higher stock-based compensation and higher performance-based and operating income-based bonus accruals, partially offset by lower sales-based incentive compensation. Stock-based compensation in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 included approximately $5.5 million of accelerated expense recognized in connection with employee retirements. Sequentially, compensation expense increased 7% reflecting higher salaries and benefits driven by increases in headcount, seasonal compensation effects, higher stock-based compensation driven by employee retirements, and higher operating income-based bonus accruals, all partially offset by a decrease in severance costs. First quarter seasonal compensation pressures traditionally include the impact of payroll tax clock resets, the timing of our 401(k) funding and year-end base salary increases. The majority of these seasonal compensation pressures will continue into the second fiscal quarter, before we see relief in the third. That said, we would not expect to see a recurrence of the roughly $5.5 million of stock-based compensation associated with first quarter retirement in the second quarter. In addition, we would anticipate seeing an incremental $1 million to $1.5 million decrease in stock-based compensation in the second quarter as the impact of divesting of stock-based compensation under our phantom equity plan for outside directors and the recognition of expense associated with our employee stock purchase plan tend to be heavily weighted to the first quarter of each fiscal year. Non-compensation distribution-related costs, including distribution and service fee expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commissions, increased 10% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher marketing and promotion costs; higher upfront sales commissions, due to increased sales of closed-end funds, private funds and Class A mutual fund shares; and higher service fee expenses for Class A, and private funds driven by higher average managed assets in those funds. The year-over-year increase further reflects higher private fund commission amortization, partially offset by lower Class C distribution and service fee expenses. Fund-related expenses increased 15% year-over-year, reflecting higher sub-advisory fees due to an increase in average managed assets of sub-advised funds. Fund-related expenses were flat sequentially, reflecting an increase in sub-advisory fees paid offset by a decrease in fund expenses borne by the company. Other operating expenses increased 11% from the first quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting increases in information technology spending, market data services, professional services and travel expenses partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets that were fully amortized during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Other operating expenses increased by 9% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting increases in information technology spending, market data services, professional services, travel expenses and charitable contributions. The increase in other expenses reflects investments we are making to support our strategic initiatives as well as the overall growth of our business. We continue to focus on expense management and identifying ways to gain greater operating leverage. Net gains and other investment income related to seed capital investments contributed $0.04 to earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 were negligible in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and contributed $0.04 to earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. When quantifying the impact of our seed capital investments on earnings, we take into consideration, our pro rata share of the gains, losses and other investment income earned on investments in sponsored strategies, whether accounted for as consolidated funds, separate accounts or equity investments, as well as the gains and losses recognized on derivatives used to hedge these investments. We then report the per share impact net of income taxes and net income attributable to non-controlling interests. We continue to hedge the market exposures of our seed capital portfolio to the extent practicable to minimize the associated earnings volatility. Non-operating income and expense also includes net expenses from consolidated CLO entities of $1.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. This compares to net expenses from consolidated CLO entities of $2.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and net income from consolidated CLO entities of $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The sequential decrease in contribution from consolidated CLO entities primarily reflects the sale of our subordinated interest in a CLO entity during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, which resulted in the deconsolidation of that entity. Other income and expense amounts related to consolidated CLO entities reduced earnings per diluted share by $0.01 in the current quarter and $0.02 in the first quarter of last year and contributed $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Other income and expense amounts related to consolidated CLOs reflect changes in our economic interest in these entities, including the fair market value of our investment distributions received and management fees earned. Our strategy for CLO equity remains to commit prudent amounts of EV capital to support growth of this business, then taking advantage of opportunities to exit our CLO position as market conditions allow, generating cash to help fund new CLOs for other -- or for other corporate purposes. Turning to taxes. Our U.S. GAAP effective tax rate was 22.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, 23.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 22.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The company's income tax rate was reduced by net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards totaling 3.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, 2.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. As shown in Attachment two to our press release, our calculations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share removed the net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards. On this basis our adjusted effective tax rate was 26.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, 25.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 23.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. On the same adjusted basis, we estimate that our quarterly effective tax rate for the balance of fiscal 2020 and for the fiscal year as a whole will range between 26.5% and 27%. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we used $45.5 million of corporate cash to pay the $0.375 per share quarterly dividend we declared at the end of our previous quarter and repurchased 1.4 million shares of our nonvoting common stock for approximately $66.6 million. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 114.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, down 1% year-over-year, reflecting share repurchases and excess of new shares issued upon vesting of restricted stock awards and exercise of employee stock option partially offset by an increase in the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and unvested restricted stock awards. Sequentially weighted average diluted shares outstanding were up 1%. We finished our first fiscal quarter holding $824.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term debt securities and approximately $315.9 million in seed capital investments. We continue to place high priority on using the company's cash flow to benefit shareholders. Fiscal discipline around discretionary spending remains top of mind as we contemplate both volatile markets and significant corporate initiatives. Based on our strong liquidity and overall financial condition, we believe we are well positioned to continue to invest in our business to support long-term growth, while returning capital to shareholders. This concludes our prepared comments. At this point, we'd like to take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Fannon : Thank. Yes can you clarify -- I think you -- Tom you discussed some of the quarter-to-date flows for certain segments, but left out I think fixed income and equities and some of the other metrics. So maybe just given that you did mention bank loans and alternatives I guess give us a kind of a broader update on the rest of the business. Tom Faust : Yes. Just to clarify the only thing I talked about was our mutual fund flows for the period just continuing the context of improvement. I'm not really prepared to talk about our overall flow trends for the quarter-to-date as that may or may not be a good indicator of what the quarter as a whole will be. I will say generally that in the same way that we had strong flows across the -- across our businesses in the fourth quarter we've had good flows for the month-to-date. But it's -- we're only a little over three weeks into the quarter, so I don't want to talk too specifically about anything other than those couple of exceptions I made in my remarks. Dan Fannon : Okay. And then just a follow-up on kind of expenses and margins, I guess if we think about the last 12 months in the growth of both the beta in the market as well as your flows and essentially margins are flat year-over-year, so can you talk about an environment where you actually could see margin expansion? And then on the contrary given what's happened more recently with market how we should think about flexibility if that market tailwind is no longer there for a sustained period. Laurie Hylton : Hi. It's Laurie. I think we've talked a little bit about the pressures that we obviously see in the first quarter. It's difficult when we start the new fiscal year because we've got these seasonal pressures that we see each first quarter. And most of them relate specifically to compensation. We did our best to call those out. I would say as we're moving into the second quarter, I did call out specifically on stock-based compensation that we would anticipate seeing some level of relief recognizing that we had some material first quarter retirements that forced us to recognize about $5.5 million of incremental stock-based compensation expense and we've got some seasonal stuff that happens relating to our employee stock purchase plan and our directors plan that probably will provide us some relief as we move into the second quarter to the tune of about $1 million to $1.5 million. In terms of other operating expenses and the way we're thinking about the year, I think we had been telegraphing fairly clearly that we anticipate we're going to be continuing to make some significant investments in technology. I think that there was some \u2013 a little bit of first quarter noise associated with normal first quarter events and operations associated primarily with things like charitable giving which tend to be front-end loaded for us, the way that we actually interact with United Way. But we would anticipate that if we see a decrease in the charitable giving in the second quarter we are seeing a modest ramp-up in our technology spend. So overall, we're \u2013 we'd like to see margin expansion. We do think that there is opportunity for that. Obviously, the volatility of the last several days has got all of us a little bit cautious about how we're thinking about the next quarter but we would anticipate that there is opportunity. That said, we are taking advantage of the initiatives that we've announced to start to really invest in some of our technology platforms to provide for future long-term growth and we're committed to that. If we anticipate, we have to start making some changes because there's something very disruptive that happens, I'm sure we will address that in the coming quarters. But I think that we all recognize in our business that we are getting pressed from above and pressed from below there. But obviously pressures in terms of fee rates, we've talked about those in \u2013 on numerous calls but there's also pressure in terms of the overall cost structure. And we recognize that things like technology and market data are going to be significant components of our overall cost structure and we're going to have to continue to invest in both. So good markets. I think there is opportunity for market \u2013 I mean, margin expansion. Just if we get a lift from market that's a \u2013 that goes straight to the top line. But we also recognize we've got to continue to invest to actually grow the company. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. On the custom portfolios, Tom you indicated that you're only scratching the surface. So maybe where are those large opportunities that you alluded to, say over like the medium term? And what is the strategy here to tap them? Tom Faust : Okay. Pretty open ended. So just maybe \u2013 just to take a second to talk about what custom portfolios are. What's in that? Three broad categories of things. One is equity portfolios that are managed on a basis that broadly replicates a stock market index but with customization to achieve enhanced tax efficiency, so funded in kind to \u2013 at least in part in kind to minimize upfront tax realization; incorporating tax loss harvesting and gain deferral as part of the strategy; and also customization for ESG and other client-specified characteristics. So one piece is what we used to call Custom Core or still \u2013 it's what we call Custom Core equity under Parametric. So that's one big piece. A second piece is laddered fixed-income separate accounts. This is the business that recently moved over from Eaton Vance Management Parametric. And then the third piece is a Parametric business called centralized portfolio management. That is where Parametric is engaged by a platform that does multi-manager strategies where those strategies or where the model \u2013 where each of the underlying manager's fee is a model for Parametric for implementation on a centralized basis, typically with ongoing tax management as a key part of that. So those are the three key pieces. There's a couple of small odds and ends in addition to that. But when talking about generally where we are with each of those in terms of the comment I made about, we think we've just scratched the surface of this first and talking about what we like to call custom indexing or what the market seems to be calling, primarily direct indexing, so that's \u2013 instead of investing in a index mutual fund or index ETF to achieve an index-like exposure, own a significant representative fraction of the underlying stocks in a separate account with the benefits of customization. If you look at the size of the index ETF business and the index mutual fund business, certainly in the trillions of dollars just in the U.S. and you compare that to our business, which is about I think about $110 billion across both institutional and individual separate accounts, the bulk of that being individual, we're the biggest player where a tiny fraction of the percent of the overall market has invested in index strategies through funds. To me for a taxable investor or someone who's motivated significantly by their own personal values, the ability to achieve better results by owning the underlying holdings approach is being self-evident. If this is a relatively easy case to make that in applications where after-tax returns matter, where responsible investing matters, where particularly if you're funding that in kind or in part in kind for investors in higher tax brackets, we don't know this for a fact but our strong supposition is that there are trillions of dollars invested in mutual fund \u2013 index mutual funds and index ETFs that would be ideal candidates for achieving a very similar market exposure in what we think of as a better vehicle. So number one is thinking about direct indexing as an opportunity. Number two, switching over to the fixed income side. That business which is on the order of for us I think about $40 billion in this category maybe I think between $35 million and $40 million, this traditionally developed as financial advisers who had used the laddered separate accounts for their clients, increasingly saw the benefit of using a third-party manager that brings ongoing credit oversight, that brings institutional-quality trade execution and the other things we offer in that strategy. That business we think has significant growth opportunities as well but we also see the potential for these two businesses to converge that is for direct indexing to move from being what is today an equity concept to being a concept that's embraced not only by equity investors, but also by fixed-income investors and also the potential to combine equity and fixed income together in multi-asset solutions. So you can imagine a multi-asset target date or multi-asset target risk kinds of portfolios or custom LDI lots of different ways you can think about putting equity and income strategies together in customized individual separate accounts that are demonstrably value-added versus either fund products that are available in the marketplace or perhaps more fully bespoke that is non-automated approaches that are -- that may be used by financial advisers today to achieve similar underlying exposures. No doubt there will be growing competition in this market. No doubt in places we'll see price competition. But we see strong momentum across these markets. As I mentioned, if you isolate the laddered bond individual separate accounts and the Custom Core equity individual separate accounts the quarter's organic growth rate was about 15%. So we're still growing pretty nicely in that business off of a relatively large base. The third piece of this business which has been kind of stagnant of late what we referred to as centralized portfolio management I also think has significant long-term growth potential. That's about a $30 billion business within I think roughly $175 billion of our Parametric Custom Portfolio business. Again, this is Parametric implementing multi-manager separate accounts on a consolidated basis where we act essentially as the implementation specialist for that manager. Growth opportunities here also are not hard to imagine as efficiency of execution as the ability to tilt portfolios to achieve better tax results and as the ability to tilt portfolios to achieve desired ESG exposures those are not concepts that only apply to passive portfolios and you can certainly imagine a world where that business also sees accelerated growth. Today, we're not really growing much in that business. But we think it has potential also to be a driver for us within this category of Parametric Custom Portfolios. So I hope that's helpful, Ken? Ken Worthington : Yes. That was pretty comprehensive. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Mike Carrier : Good morning. And thanks for taking the questions. So overall another quarter strong diversified flows. It looks like just the one area a little lighter was on the institutional side. So just more curious what drove it if there was any rebalancing? And any color in terms of the pipeline? Tom Faust : The institutional pipeline overall is quite good. We've had -- we have I guess three multimillion dollar -- multi-hundred million dollar pieces of institutional business that we're expecting in the second quarter that gives us certainly confidence in -- and general momentum in our institutional business. And I'm separating out the exposure management business, which is in our institutional flows, but we show those separately. So in -- think about my comments in institutional separate from exposure management. One of the things that has been working against us and worked against us in this quarter we have a large institutional client in bank loans I think which over the last several quarters has been drawing down their position over time. This was a -- this was and is a multibillion dollar client. So there will be some pressure there. We're most of the way through that drawdown. But this is a long-term allocation that over the last maybe four or five quarters has seen a fairly significant drag on both our bank loan business looking at it from a mandate point of view, but also from our institutional separate account business. Not to double-count those, but we report both of those things. So we're -- we think we're getting near the end of that on a -- more broadly we expect good flows in institutional. Some of the thing -- places where we're achieving institutional success one is our emerging market local income strategy, which is a big quite a big asset class outside the United States where we are seeing some success growing that with institutional clients. Also under the Calvert banner, we recently landed a significant institutional fixed income core fixed-income mandate. And also in the offing is a large high-yield bond individual -- institutional separate account offering that we expect to fund in the current quarter. So I would say overall maybe a mixed bag with one fairly significant negative. That's this bank loan client that's been pulling down over time their exposure to us and other managers that they've hired in this category offset by pretty broad strength in other things. Maybe on the equity side just a comment. You probably have noticed that Atlanta Capital has had a quite strong performance over recent years very strong 2019 numbers. And they also have seen a pickup in their institutional business. And that's what you can think of as traditional large-cap U.S. business, which has been as everyone knows a very tough place to grow institutionally. But their -- the distinctiveness of their performance record and their investment approach has allowed them to grow over the last few quarters and have a decent growth pipeline even in an industry environment where very few people are growing actively managed large-cap U.S. equity mandates. Mike Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert Lee with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Your line is open. Jeff Drezner : Hi. Good morning. This is Jeff Drezner on for Rob Lee. Just a quick question. I know you touched on the compensation line. I just wanted to circle back to that for a second just to make sure I caught everything. So there was a $5.5 million expense and then a decrease of about $1 million to $1.5 million that we should not expect to occur again in fiscal Q2, is that correct? Is it -- was there anything else there that I had -- that I missed? I just want to make sure. Laurie Hylton : No. Hi, it's Laurie again. No. Actually what I said was that there was $5.5 million of stock-based compensation expense this quarter associated with retirements that would not recur in the second quarter. And then there was approximately $1 million to $1.5 million of incremental stock-based compensation expense that is in the first quarter that will not repeat in the second quarter. So I would just say -- I think what we're saying is effectively that stock-based compensation expense is likely to go down between $6 million and $6.5 million in the second quarter. Tom Faust : Yeah. So just to add the two numbers up -- add the two numbers up not to subtract one from the other to get the expectation for second quarter versus first quarter. Laurie Hylton : Correct. Jeff Drezner : Got it. Yeah. I appreciate that. And then a quick question on institutional business. And if you can get -- give some color around some ESG strategies at Calvert and how you see that playing out? Tom Faust : So Calvert's the -- we acquired Calvert at the end of 2016. At that time very close to 100% of their business was U.S. mutual funds and we've grown that business. We've just about doubled Calvert business. We're not quite there but just about doubled Calvert's business from I think $11.9 billion at the end of 2016 when we acquired Calvert. So that business to date -- the business growth has to date still been primarily mutual funds, mutual funds in the U.S. But our ambitions for Calvert and Calvert strategies and the Calvert brand are certainly much broader than U.S. mutual funds. We're implementing a variety of Calvert strategies as institutional separate accounts in conjunction with Parametric as an offering under our Parametric Custom Portfolios banner. So these are both Calvert indexes as implemented by Parametric also the opportunity to offer Calvert active strategies as implemented by a Parametric. Institutionally, as I mentioned we recently had a significant win with a U.S. pension plan that is -- that was attracted to Calvert based on both the strength of their investment performance capability, but also on the strength of their commitment and support of responsible investing. There are many, many, many mission-driven organizations around the U.S. and internationally that we think there's an excellent potential fit between their desire to achieve both strong investment returns, but also alignment of their portfolio holdings with the mission of that organization. So think about all kinds of mission-driven non-profits as well as pension funds and broader organization endowments where responsible investing is a key initiative and a key focus of those organizations. So not to overplay the term, but again we think we're just watching the surface in terms of our ability to take the Calvert brand from heritage as a U.S. mutual fund provider to making that broadly known and broadly represented not only in mutual funds in the U.S. but also funds outside the United States and individual separate accounts and institutional separate accounts in the U.S. and internationally. Clearly this is a time when Calvert is in many respects ideally positioned to grow with surging interest in the market, in the general category of responsible investing. A lot of confusion about what that is and what that means that Calvert based on its long history there can help educate the market on and all that backed by really quite an exceptional investment performance record across a wide range of strategies. So I mentioned that Calvert had 26% organic growth rate in the first quarter. We're certainly optimistic that we can continue to grow Calvert at a well-above average rate not only drawing upon mutual fund clients, but increasingly separate account clients in both institutional and individual markets. Jeff Drezner : Great. I appreciate the color on that. If I could just get one quick follow-up just on custom beta products. And just any competition you're seeing there? And maybe competition on price or whatnot? Tom Faust : So when -- in Parametric custom portfolios there is competition. We will -- and growing competition. There's also a growing opportunity. And so we'll see how that plays out. We think there is a much bigger market opportunity for us and other competitors. It's not surprising given the growth profile of this business that there are other people that are trying this. We think there are significant advantages of scale, significant advantages of experience that we have that new market entrants do not have. But we don't expect this to be a one-player market. There are a handful of other significant players and a few around the edges that are maybe dabbling with this. I don't think there's room for a lot of dabblers to achieve success, but there will be likely a handful of market leaders in this business, of which we would expect Parametric to continue to be the largest among those market leaders as we are today. Price is and always has been one element of the competition in the customized individual separate account business. Mostly it's been about features and service and to some degree also access. Can you get in front of the financial adviser? Can you get access to that adviser? Can you articulate the advantages of a customized individual separate account better than the other guys? Can you demonstrate that you're achieving those advantages better than the other guys? And also, importantly, can you service that relationship better than the competition? And service here is both as-needed high-touch service, but also ideally an element of -- an increasing element of low-touch service, that is using technology to drive enhanced service, which we think is going to be critical to maintaining profitability in this business, if prices on average continue to fall, which we expect, by and large, they will over time in this business. On the fixed-income side, it's a bit of a different story. There are several competitors in the laddered bond space. It doesn't feel like the price competition there is intensified. We worry a bit about equal market access in that market relative to broker-dealers offering in-house strategies that can compete against third-party strategies. Also as I mentioned in my earlier comments in response to Ken's question, we do think there's a significant emerging opportunity for fixed income, direct indexing best solutions that we think we're in a far better position to offer those today, than literally anyone else in the marketplace, based on the development work we've done on those kinds of strategies, which we're pretty excited about the potential for long term, to expand how people think about this category. It's not just replicating or roughly replicating an equity index. It's taking that, combining it with fixed income and over time developing solutions that move well beyond replication or tracking of a benchmark, to helping clients and financial advisers meet their financial needs more broadly, including concepts of target risk and target date and custom LDI. Jeff Drezner : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi. Your line is open. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate all the color. Maybe just two questions. Tom, maybe start with you. Just big picture down, there's been a fair amount of M&A in the landscape, both on the sort of manufacturing side as well as on the distribution side and in varying forms. What if any impact, do you think, that has in your business? Tom Faust : Okay. Well, I guess, I'll start with time will tell. We don't know -- most of the acquisitions that have been announced haven't been completed. So, the ones that I think we feel most comfortable, we know the answer to, are consolidation within the asset management industry. And how that usually plays out may not play out in the case of the recently announced transaction. But how that usually plays out is that, during a fairly prolonged transition period, there's some amount of migration of assets from the two companies that are merging two competitors. Strategies get put on hold, there are changes, disruptions to investment teams. Those are the kinds of things that the firms that are merging are trying to minimize and those are the things that their competitors are trying to take advantage of and those are the things that their customers and gatekeepers are watching for and very concerned that there may be negative fallout of this transaction from the point of view of them and their clients. So there's always some opportunity. How big that is, is always very hard to gauge. But, in general, consolidation among competitors in the short run creates opportunity for those competitors, just because of the disruption associated with the merger. Longer term, once the thing happens, it very much depends on their ability to execute and lots of things that are very hard to foresee during the period when acquisitions are being announced. In terms of the more distribution oriented or ones affecting wealth management more than asset management, so this would be the Schwab TD Ameritrade or E TRADE Morgan Stanley that's just to be clear what I'm talking about, those are a little hard to judge. What is important to us is that, we continue to maintain market access. And that is, obviously, critical to our business success. What we have to do to maintain that is demonstrate that we're worth that, that we provide value added relative to what they can do themselves. That's always been true. That continues to be true in our business. With limited exceptions, we sell to financial intermediaries where build versus buy is a decision that they always have. Any one of these firms could decide if they're going to do asset management in-house. How they get there? Who knows. And the record generally of these firms has not been good. These are very different businesses, asset management versus wealth management, and few companies are able to do both well. As I think about industry change, I take comfort in the fact that Eaton Vance, while we're up, I guess, a meaningful company in many respects, with about $0.5 trillion of assets under management, we are in the grand scheme of the asset management business, a pretty small pimple with a tiny market share in the range of 1% or 2%. As you think about the addressable wealth management marketplace and where our $0.5 trillion stands versus the size of that market. I continue to believe that that size is a big -- is a significant advantage for us, allowing us to grow if we execute effectively on our plan, if we're nimble, if we're smart, if we're innovative, if we can deliver for our clients, even as things happen around us that might be viewed as adverse to our overall industry's prospects. If we can be better than most of the rest of the other guys, we can continue to be very successful as a firm. We're not slavishly limited in our growth by the growth prospects of our industry. Bill Katz : Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And Laurie just one for you a little bit of a nasty question, so I apologize in advance. Can you break down a little bit on where you're sort of spending the technology? What kind of time line you talk about here? Is this a multiyear effort? And then just as I think about the ins and outs of flows versus fee rates it sounds like a very good flow story. But also I hear nothing about the competition in lower-fee products. So, how do you sort of see the dynamic between organic growth versus revenue growth notwithstanding this was a very good quarter of itself? Laurie Hylton : Yes. Maybe I'll address the technology question first. I think as we think about technology spend, I'm starting to think about this in terms of new normal. I don't think we're necessarily talking about a one-time big bang we're going to replace a big system and then all of a sudden we're going to be able to stop spending on technology. I don't think that's what we're talking about. What we are talking about is a slightly more consistent incremental spend on technology recognizing that a lot of this is in relation to the initiatives that we've recently announced associated with Parametric and Eaton Vance that we're combining technology platforms, we are looking to invest in technology to ultimately increase our efficiency, increase our effectiveness, bring down the cost of what it actually takes to manage separate accounts on an account-by-account basis. So our goal is to continue to make those investments and we will see an increase in our technology spend over a longer term period. But our goal is to ultimately then be able to leverage that to reduce our overall operating expenses in the future. So, this is from our perspective very much a long-term play and a long-term investment. In terms of revenue, I think as we're looking at our effective fee rates and I think if you look at Attachment 10 in our press release, you can see that they're really on a category-by-category basis. We are not seeing a diminution in our effective fee rate by equity fixed-income alternatives et cetera. What we are seeing is just shifts in mix quarter-over-quarter that ultimately impacts the average effective fee rate for the period. So, I know there's a lot of talk about decreases in effective fee rates. We are not necessarily seeing that by mandate, but we are seeing a decrease year-over-year in our average effective fee rate at the top of the house recognizing that that is being driven by mix. But I think what is positive from my perspective is that as you look at the this quarter ending January -- the quarter ending January 31 versus the quarter ending October 31 we saw no decrease in our overall average effective fee rate. So, we feel very, very positive that we have got some level of stability at the mandate level and that we've got every opportunity to see our average -- our organic growth in assets, if you will, to actually see our organic growth in revenue mirror our organic growth in assets going forward if we are able to continue to advance the ball on our active equity strategies where there are higher fees while growing our somewhat more passive strategies where the fees are lower. So, I think that we demonstrated this quarter that we could effectively do that by producing 5% organic growth in assets and 5% organic growth in revenue. Tom Faust : And maybe I can just jump in with a couple of comments. If you look at our charts accompanying -- the slides accompanying the call, you can see that over the course of fiscal 2019, there was a bit of a disconnect from our in our ability to grow to achieve organic growth in assets versus our ability to achieve organic revenue growth. So, that's comparing slides nine and 11. If you look at the slides, I guess, it's slides 10 and 11. 10 looks at annualized internal growth in consolidated managed assets on a percentage basis and then 11 looks at that same those same numbers just converted into revenues. The real difference -- the driver of the differences in 2019 was primarily the fact that we saw over the course of that year we saw I think roughly $14 billion of net -- no, I think 12 -- sorry $12 billion of net outflows over the year in two relatively high-fee categories; floating-rate income and global macro strategies that dominate our alternative strategies. The best thing that can happen for us in terms of our ability to achieve organic revenue growth in the same range as our organic asset growth is to stop the outflows in those two strategies. We came we got there in alternatives in the first quarter. We think we're getting very close to that happening in bank loans. Our expectation is for the balance of the year subject to markets is that you'll see a much closer alignment between our ability to grow assets and our ability to grow revenues tied to those assets simply because we don't expect that negative which drove that disconnect last year to continue into this year. Bill Katz : Its all very helpful. Thank you for the detail. Tom Faust : Maybe its time for one more question. Operator : Okay. Our last question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi thanks. Two quick follow-ups on sustainable investing if I could the conversation. One is I'm curious to get your thoughts on the client interest that you noted and are clearly seeing in terms of dedicated product versus just part of the process of ongoing product. And two is how you think passive plays a role ESG investing. It's counterintuitive but there are products they are getting flows. So, curious on how you think passive impacts pricing and flows yes and sustainable-- Tom Faust : Yes. So, we're -- Calvert has a broad-based menu of strategies in the responsible investing space, including both active and passive. We have \u2013 we are growing in active. We're growing in passive. We have good performance in active. We had good performance in passive. That's on the equity side. Fixed income, we really it's \u2013 it's an all-active strategy business. I think there's an element of responsible investing that doesn't really cut quite neatly between active and passive and that's the aspect of engagement. So what are you doing to help drive value creation and help improve performance of the companies in which you invest? And you do that through how you vote your proxies, how you participate if at all and shareholder resolutions and the conversations that you engage either individually or as part of groups with the management to try to get them to achieve better results. Those kinds of activities to some degree can cut across both active and passive strategies. As it's \u2013 as this business is developing, there's still lot of \u2013 this is a pretty fast-moving turf. Lots of confusing terms that out there things that \u2013 I use on-term you use another. What I \u2013 the term I use might mean something different to me than it does to you. It's going to take a while for that to sort out. But one of the things that I think is clear is that the role of engagement is becoming more and more important in differentiating strategy A from strategy B or manager A from manager B. How do they vote their proxies? How do they participate in shareholder resolutions? How do they, if at all engage with management? So that's a second level of performance beyond the normal way that we measure return. The other things that's I think \u2013 I'd say, we're in the early innings of is measuring performance not only in terms of financial results, but also in terms of non-financial results, that is, how does my portfolio compare to an index or some other competitor in terms of tons of ESG, tons of carbon omitted or tons of carbon shaved, lots of different metrics. And again, it's pretty early days, the information is not great. But I think over time as this information develops, we're going to see more and more and better and better reporting on this, so that there's going to be multiple dimensions to how you think about different categories of responsibly invested strategies. Lots of other \u2013 I was just on a ICI call on this topic, yesterday, but lots of efforts ongoing to try and bring some clarity to the categorization of different funds, what do these words mean. But if it was and is, and likely will be for the near-term pretty fluid in terms of the terminology and we certainly support industry efforts to bring a little more consistency to that terminology. But what's driving our growth, we think is pretty clear. It's the combination of strong performance plus very credible thought leadership, discipline and performance in terms of the ESG efforts that back our investment teams. Its research, its engagement, its impact measurement, and all that backed by having done this under the Calvert brand, since the early 1980s. So, credibility as a manager, depth of resources as an ESG manager and the tie to strong-performing teams. We think that's the \u2013 that's a key to success. Active versus passive, we'll see how that plays out. We tend to think that this is a place where there's greater opportunity for active managers to add value. But as you point out there are also flows going into passive products in this category. Glenn Schorr : All right. Thanks so much. Eric Senay : All right. Well, thank you very much for those of you who participated in today's call and we'll speak with you when we have our next webcast for the second fiscal quarter. Thank you very much and have a good day. Operator *: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Eric Senay. Please go ahead. Eric Senay : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our fiscal 2020 second quarter earnings call and webcast. With me this morning are Tom Faust, Chairman and CEO of Eaton Vance; as well as our CFO, Laurie Hylton. In today's call, we will first comment on the quarter and then take your questions. As always, the full earnings release and charts we will refer to during the call are available on our website eatonvance.com under the headline Investor Relations. Today's presentation contains forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainties in our business, including but not limited to, those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings including our 2019 Annual Report and Form 10-K are available on our website or upon request at no charge. I will now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Faust : Good morning and thank you for joining the call. Amid the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, I want to start by offering my sincere best wishes for good health to each of you and your families. Over recent months, we've seen a tragic loss of human life in nearly every country around the world, as well as massive disruption to the global economy and the world's financial markets. We see genuine heroism displayed by the countless healthcare workers, first responders and other essential service providers who are putting themselves in harm's way serving others. All of us at Eaton Vance are deeply grateful for their service. In recognition of the sacrifices of the COVID-19 heroes, and the suffering of those experiencing ill health or economic hardship due to the pandemic, the company and our employees have contributed $1 million to support COVID-19 relief efforts in our communities and around the world. In this challenging period Eaton Vance\u2019s primary concern are the health and safety of our employees and their families, the resilience of our business and serving the needs of our clients and business partners each and every day. Over the last couple of months, the creativity, adaptability and teamwork of our staff have been put to good use meeting the challenges of operating amid a pandemic. Since the middle of March, nearly all Eaton Vance employees have been working from home, connecting with each other and our clients and business partners chiefly through video technology. While not the same as being together physically, our businesses function seamlessly. We've not experienced any notable disruptions due to operational issues, loss of communication capabilities, technology failure or cyber attacks.  Throughout a period of heavy account activity and highly volatile markets, our trading and operations team have consistently kept up with unprecedented demand even while working from home. We don't take these successes for granted and recognize that our ability to respond to changing market conditions is a tribute to the planning and hard work of our technology and operations teams, the commitment and discipline of our employees as a whole and the strength of our corporate culture. Our resiliency is also a testament to the stability and longevity of our relationships with critical operations and distribution business partners and the benefits of the workforce, where turnover is low and working relationships are long established. From a distribution standpoint, our sales teams have adapted quickly to a world of virtual interactions with clients and intermediaries. With business travel shut down and in-person meetings canceled across the board, we are leveraging digital communications tools to remain connected. We have dialed up our digital engagement with financial advisors and consultants, increasing the frequency of calls, webinars and blog posts. We increased the update frequency of our popular Monthly Market Monitor to weekly in order to help clients and business partners stay abreast with the markets and stay informed about Eaton Vance strategies. And we are leveraging the Eaton Vance Advisor Institute to provide financial advisors with invaluable advice for connecting with clients in these unprecedented times. Financially, Eaton Vance's longstanding commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity has been well awarded. As of April 30th, we had over $950 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term income investments, $300 million of available capacity on our corporate credit facility and no debt maturing until 2023. Over the course of the quarter, we successfully demonstrated our ability to generate incremental liquidity if needed, and continue to closely monitor our financial resources on a daily basis.  In terms of capital management, we slowed the pace of share repurchases during the fiscal second quarter to maintain an ample supply of dry powder. During the quarter, we prioritized spending on initiatives that support future growth and create operational efficiencies. Turning to our financial results. Earlier today, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.80 for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, unchanged from the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and down 6% from $0.85 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Adjusted earnings differ from our earnings under U.S. GAAP principally to remove gains and losses and other impacts of consolidated investment entities and the company's other seed capital investments. Adjusted earnings also reflect the reversal of net excess tax benefits related to the company's stock-based compensation. Combined, these adjustments added $0.15 to adjusted earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, subtracted $0.09 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and subtracted $0.06 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. By any measure, financial markets were challenging to navigate over the first two months of our second fiscal quarter, as the full scope of the global pandemic became apparent. Between the end of January and March 31st, the U.S. equity market, as represented by the total return of the S&P 500, dropped 19.6% and was down 30.4% at the low on March 23rd. During this two month period, we lost $72.5 billion in managed assets to market price declines. In contrast, in the month of April saw market related gains in our managed assets of $28.9 billion, recovering almost 40% of the market related declines for the first two months of the quarter. We ended the second quarter of fiscal 2020 with $465.3 billion in consolidated assets under management, down 1% from a year earlier and down 10% from the end of the prior fiscal quarter. Second quarter consolidated net outflows were $9.3 billion or $2.8 billion excluding Parametric overlay services. Excluding this business, our flows fluctuated from $2.4 billion of net inflows in February to $5.4 billion in net outflows in March to $200 million of net inflows in April. Again, excluding Parametric overly services, annualized internal growth in managed assets was minus 3% for the quarter, up 7% in February, minus 16% in March and plus 1% in April. Looking at flows on the basis of managed fees -- management fees generated, our annualized internal growth in management fee revenue was minus 6% for the quarter, plus 5% in February, minus 23% in March and minus 2% in April. Besides Parametric overlay services, which I will return to in a few moments, the primary driver for net outflows in the second quarter was floating-rate income index. Floating-rate net outflows for the quarter totaled $3.2 billion, about $2.4 billion of that occurring in March, as benchmarked short-term interest rates plunged and fears of recession related credit losses escalated. While prices fell sharply, the loan market did not experience interruptions in liquidity seen in other income markets during this period. Our floating-rate net outflows for the quarter were concentrated primarily in U.S. mutual funds, with institutional and sub-advisory mandates experiencing approximately $300 million of outflows in the quarter. Although loan prices have now recovered nearly halfway back from the March lows, our loan professionals believe the asset class represents exceptional value at current levels, given the historical default and recovery experience of senior secured floating-rate loans in prior periods of economic distress. Our alternatives category had net outflows of just under $700 million in the second quarter driven by outflows from our two Global Macro Absolute Return mutual funds, and the final liquidation of the Global Macro sub-advisory account that gave notice of termination in 2019. While not insulated from event risk, our global macro strategies offer the potential for generating returns that are substantially uncorrelated to U.S. equity and bond market returns, which can be especially appealing in an environment of high economic uncertainty. In equities, a continuing highlight of our business is the strong growth of Calvert which contributed $1.1 billion to equity net inflows in the second quarter, and $1.9 billion in the first half of fiscal 2020. Net inflows in the Calvert equity mandates were up 85% in the first half of fiscal 2020 compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. In the second quarter Calvert equity funds had net inflows of over $400 million, Calvert Small-Cap Fund over $200 million and Calvert Emerging Markets and Calvert International Equity Funds over 100 million on a combined basis. Calvert's strong equity flows reflect both the power of the Calvert brand as a leader in responsible investment and the outstanding investment performance of the Calvert equity strategies.  As can be seen on Page 17 of the slides that accompany this call, as of April 30th, 14 Calvert equity and multi-asset funds were rated four or five stars by Morningstar for at least one class of shares, including five Calvert funds that are rated five stars. Atlanta Capital equity strategies contributed over $600 million to net inflows in the second quarter with both the Atlanta capital core equity and growth equity teams generating net inflows. Including the Calvert Equity Fund, which is managed by the Atlanta Capital growth team, net inflows into Atlanta Capital managed equities exceeded $1 billion in the second quarter. As in past periods of economic uncertainty, Atlanta Capital's brand of high quality investing holds particular appeal in the current environment. Flows into Eaton Vance management equity strategies were substantially flat, with net inflows into privately offered funds offset by outflows from other equity strategies. Parametric saw equity net outflows of $2.15 billion, driven principally by withdrawals from Parametric\u2019s emerging markets equity strategy. This engineered strategy applies a modified equal weight approach to investing in emerging markets, seeking to benefit from diversification and rebalancing alpha. Relative performance for the year-to-date and over longer periods have suffered from a systematic underweight in China, by far the largest constituent of emerging market indexes, and a top performer among the emerging markets over recent periods.  Turning to fixed income, second quarter net inflows of approximately $200 million were driven by high yield bonds, short-term government income and emerging market local debt mandates, and high yield both retail funds and institutional separate accounts contributed to net inflows of $600 million. We're especially pleased with the growth of our institutional high yield business, with a pipeline of new mandates expected to fund in the third fiscal quarter now totals more than $1.3 billion. Amid an extraordinarily unstable period in the municipal securities markets, our muni funds and separate accounts had approximately $600 million of net outflows. In the second quarter, Parametric custom portfolios had $1.3 billion of net inflows, led by $2.7 billion of net contributions to custom core equity separate accounts matching first quarter net inflows of this Parametric flagship offering. Net inflows into laddered bond separate accounts across municipal and corporate mandates declined to approximately $250 million in the second quarter from $1.4 billion in the first quarter, reflecting declining interest rates and bond market turmoil.  Within Parametric custom portfolios, centralized portfolio management mandates had net outflows of $1.6 billion during the second quarter, driven primarily by client decisions to reduce their exposure to equity investments during a period of high economic uncertainty and equity market volatility. Periods of extreme market volatility like we have been experiencing create significant opportunities for Parametric to add value to custom client portfolios. Declines in securities prices enabled Parametric to harvest tax losses that can be used to offset client gains realized elsewhere in the portfolio, either currently or in the future. We continue to believe that the value proposition offered by custom separate accounts for systematic tax means remains as attractive as ever. Turning to Parametric overlay services second quarter net outflows of $6.5 billion compared to net inflows of $1.1 billion in the first quarter. The outflows reported for this category reflect decisions by continuing clients to lower their risk of exposure by reducing their derivative overlay positions managed by Parametric. These overlays functioned exactly as intended in this period of exceptional market volatility, enabling clients to quickly and easily shift market exposures without disturbing underlying positions and security by accessing the highly liquid futures markets.  Pointing to the value of this service in the current environment is the new client relationships established during the second fiscal quarter, and the sizeable pipeline of new overlay business expected to fund in the third fiscal quarter. Funding by new Parametric overlay clients totaled a net $1 billion in the second fiscal quarter, with a pipeline of over $3.7 billion expected to fund in the third fiscal quarter. As we look ahead, we continue to focus on building on the distinctive strengths of our major business franchises to achieve positive organic revenue growth. Through Eaton Vance management, we're the dominant provider of fund solutions for concentrated stock positions, the leading manager of equity income closed end funds, and the largest manager of floating-rate bank loans. In fixed income, we have top tier positions in municipal bonds, higher corporates, and emerging market local debt. Parametric is the market leading provider of custom index separate accounts, municipal and corporate bond ladders, outsourced centralized portfolio management and portfolio derivative overlay services. Atlanta Capital is among the leading equity managers focused on high quality investing with a strong lineup of high performing strategies. And Calvert is among the largest and most respected specialists in responsible investing, number one in responsibly managed U.S. mutual fund flows over the past 12 months, and number two in managed mutual fund assets. As we consider the current environment, we see significant opportunities to build on these strengths even as competitors face a more uncertain future. While we don't know the path of the pandemic from here, or how financial markets will perform, we're pretty sure our industry will continue to trend increasingly in the direction of customized individual separate accounts, responsible investing, and specialty wealth management strategies and services, each an open-ended opportunity in which Eaton Vance has a dominant or leading market position.  Since the founding of our predecessor Eaton & Howard back in 1924, our business has weathered many storms, and I have no doubt that we will get through this one as well. As in prior periods of disruption, our goal is for Eaton Vance to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, a stronger and better Company. Based on the continuing high growth potential of our leading investment franchises, the strength of our financial position and culture and the resolve of our people, I have every confidence that objective will be achieved. That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Laurie. Laurie Hylton : Thank you and good morning. Our second Tom\u2019s hope that each of you and your families are healthy and well. As Tom described we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.80 for the second quarter fiscal 2020, unchanged from the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and down 6% from $0.85 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Effective this quarter, our calculation of non-GAAP financial measures excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored funds and consolidated collateralized loan obligation entities, collectively consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments.  Adjustments to GAAP operating income include the add back of management fee revenue received from consolidated investment entities that are eliminated in consolidation and the non-management expenses of consolidated sponsored funds recognized in consolidation. Adjustments to GAAP net income attributable to Eaton Vance Corp shareholders include the after tax impact of those adjustments to operating income and the elimination of gains, losses and other investment income expense of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments included in non-operating income expense, as determined net of tax and non-controlling and other beneficial interest. Our goal in making these adjustments is to provide investors and analysts alike a clear line of sight to the company's core operating results. All prior periods\u2019 non-GAAP financial measures have been updated to reflect this change. If you can see in attachment 2 to our press release, adjusted earnings, exceeded earnings under U.S. GAAP by $0.15 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 reflecting the reversal of $16.8 million of net losses of consolidated investment entities and our other seed capital investments, the add back of $1.8 million of management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities, and reversal of $1.1 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards.  Earnings under US GAAP exceeded adjusted earnings by $0.09 per diluted share in the second quarter fiscal 2019 reflecting the reversal of $11.4 million of net gains of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments, the add back of $1.8 million of management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities, and reversal of $0.3 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards. Earnings under U.S. GAAP exceeded adjusted earnings by $0.06 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 reflecting the reversal of $3.6 million of net gains of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments, the add back of $2.4 million of management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities, and reversal of $4.9 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards. As shown in attachment 3 to our press release, our operating income as adjusted to include the management fee revenue and exclude the non-management expenses of our consolidated investment entities was down 4% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. Our adjusted operating margin was 30.5% in the second quarter fiscal 2020, 31.4% in the second quarter fiscal 2019 and 30.3% in the first quarter fiscal 2020. As Tom noted, ending consolidated managed assets were $465.3 billion at April 30, 2020 down 1% year-over-year, reflecting COVID-19 related negative market returns partially offset by positive net flows over the last 12 months. Ending consolidated managed assets were down 10% from the prior quarter end reflecting sharply lower market prices and quarterly net outflows driven by investor uncertainty in the midst of the global pandemic. Although average managed assets this quarter were up 5% in the same period last year, management fee revenue was down 1%, reflecting a 7% decline in our average annualized management fee rate and 31.8 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 to 29.7 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The decline in our average annualized management fee rate was partially offset by the impact of one additional fee day in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the leap year. The decline in our average annualized management fee rate versus the comparative period was driven primarily by shifts in our business mix from higher fee to lower fee mandates. Versus the prior quarter average managed assets were down 6% driving a 10% decrease in management fee revenue. Decline in management fee revenue exceeded the decline in average managed assets sequentially, primarily due to a 4% decline in our average annualized management fee rate from 30.8 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to 29.7 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and the impact of two fewer fee days in the second quarter. Performance based fees which are excluded from the calculation of our average management fee rates contributed $2.5 million, $1.8 million and $0.2 million to revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the second quarter of fiscal 2019, and the first quarter fiscal 2020 respectively.  Management fees earned by consolidated investment entities which are eliminated in consolidation and excluded from the calculation of our average management fee rates were $1.3 million, $1.1 million and $1.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the second quarter fiscal 2019 and the first quarter of fiscal 2020 respectively. Turning to expenses, compensation costs decreased 3% year-over-year, reflecting lower operating income dbase and investment performance based bonus accruals, lower stock based compensation and lower severance costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales based incentive compensation and higher salaries associated with increases in headcount, year-end compensation increases for continuing employees, and the impact of one additional payroll day in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Sequentially, compensation expense decreased 13%, reflecting lower operating income based and investment performance based bonus accruals, lower stock based compensation driven by the impact of employee retirements in the first quarter, decreases in seasonal compensation expenses that are recognized primarily in the first fiscal quarter, lower salaries and benefits driven by two fewer payroll days in the second fiscal quarter, and a decrease in severance costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales based incentive compensation. Non-compensation distribution related costs including distribution and service fees expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased 1% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower distribution and service fee expenses and commission amortization for Class C mutual fund shares driven by lower average managed assets and a decrease in discretionary marketing expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher upfront sales commission expense, service fee expenses and commission amortization for private funds. Sequentially non-compensation distribution related costs decreased 12%, primarily reflecting lower distribution expenses for Class C mutual fund shares, lower service fee expenses for Class A mutual fund shares and private funds, a decrease in intermediary marketing support payments, lower discretionary marketing spending and lower upfront sales commission expense. Fund related expenses increased 9% year-over-year reflecting higher sub-advisory fees due to an increase in average managed assets of subsidized funds. Sequentially, fund related expenses decreased 2% reflecting lower sub-advisory fees due to a decrease in average managed assets with sub-advised funds and the impact of two fewer fee days in the second quarter, partially offset by an increase in fund expenses borne by the company. Other operating expenses increased 7% from the second quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily respecting increases in information technology spending and facility expenses, partially offset by lower travel expenses, professional services and other corporate expenses. Other operating expenses decreased 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting decreases in travel expenses and professional services partially offset by increases in information technologies and facility expenses.  As Tom noted, we're continuing to invest in areas that are important for the future growth of the company that are otherwise focused on highly expense management and reducing discretionary spending. In this period of volatility we benefit greatly from the fact that more than 40% of our operating expenses are variable in nature, moving up and down with changes in operating income, managed assets or sales results. Non-operating income expense was down $93.7 million from the second quarter fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting a $65.7 million negative variance in net gain or loss and other investment income of consolidated sponsored funds and the company's investments in other sponsored strategies, a $27.5 million negative variance in net income of expense or expense of consolidated CLO entities and $0.5 million increase in interest expense. Losses related to consolidated investment entities are partially offset by related variances in non-controlling and other beneficial interests. Now our operating income expenses down $81.7 million sequentially, primarily reflecting a $66.6 million negative variance in net gain or loss and other income from the company's investments in consolidated sponsored funds and other sponsored strategies, $14.7 million increase in the net expenses of consolidated CLO entities and $0.5 million increase in interest expense. As a reminder, our calculation of adjusted earnings per diluted share now backs out the gains and losses and other impacts of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments. Turning to taxes. Our U.S. GAAP effective tax rate was 45.3% in the second quarter fiscal 2020, 25.1% in second quarter of fiscal '19 and 22.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The company's income tax provision was reduced by net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards totaling $1.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, $0.3 million in second quarter of fiscal 2019 and $4.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. As shown in attachment 2 to our press release, our calculations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share removes the impact of gains, losses and other investment income expense of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments, add back the management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities and exclude the effective net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards. On this basis, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, 26.9% in second quarter fiscal 2019 and 27.6% in the first quarter fiscal 2020. On the same adjusted basis, we estimate that our quarterly effective tax rate for the balance of fiscal 2020 and for the fiscal year as a whole will range between 26% and 27%. We finished our second fiscal quarter totaling $951.3 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term debt securities, and approximately $257.1 million in seed capital investments. We are carefully managing our cash flow to maintain our financial flexibility, while continuing to prioritize return of value to shareholders. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we repurchased 900,000 shares of our non-voting common stock for approximately $31 million and used $41.7 million of corporate cash to pay the $0.375 per share quarterly dividend we declared at the end of our previous quarter. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 111.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, down 2% year-over-year, reflecting share repurchases in excess of new shares issued upon vesting of restricted stock awards and exercised employee stock options and a decrease in the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and unvested restricted stock awards. Sequentially weighted average diluted shares outstanding were down 3%. Fiscal discipline, tight management, discretionary spending and maintaining a strong balance sheet are among our top priorities these unprecedented times. We are well positioned to weather the current environment and are continuing to invest in our business to support future growth.  This concludes our prepared comments. At this point, we'd like to take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. So just a follow-up on some of the monthly trends, certainly appreciate the additional disclosure. But can you talk about kind of the variance between March and April? And if you can comment about May so far with regards to gross sales versus redemptions in terms of the improvement, it was mainly just the slower redemptions or if you saw kind of gross sales also starting to pick up during those most recent months? Tom Faust : Yes, Dan, this is Tom. The -- maybe somewhat odd thing about March was that although we had significant net outflows, as we described, gross flows were very strong, up approximately 50% from February to March. So it wasn't like there was no activity. In fact there was hyper activity on both of the inflows and outflows side. Things have slowed a bit on both sides of that thankfully. As indicated we had positive flow results for the month of April and May, have been -- I guess I would say May to date has been broadly similar to what we saw in April. So, we're -- we got hit pretty hard in the crisis period. We bounced back in trying to find this report. I was going to -- I can't pull it up. But we've stayed positive in March and starting May to-date with flows. Dan Fannon : And then I guess just another one on flows. You mentioned $1.3 billion in high yield that's going to fund in the third quarter. I guess, just thinking about risk profiles and clients engagement, would you say that you're seeing kind of re-risking or just opportunistic where you have good performance or certain strategies that are doing well, you're seeing the kind of uptick. So I guess, just broadly, any other commentary on the institutional portfolio and kind of client behavior based on what you're hearing and seeing? Tom Faust : Yes, I would say it's mixed. There are certainly clients that are looking at where risk assets are priced and where they have been priced and have stepped in, in some cases those might have been clients that were early to take off risk exposures. The fact that we're seeing high yield inflows I think is indicative of that, where we've seen a good period of -- we had actually a quite strong month in high yield in April, and we are as indicated expecting some quite important significant institutional flows. And I think you'd say in both cases that represents maybe I think generally sophisticated clients looking at prices of risk assets and concluding that from a long-term investment perspective that these are attractive entry points. We've seen some of that in bank loans as well, flows there have continued on an improving path in May. So we're -- they're not -- they're modestly negative but better than they were in April and vastly better than they were in March. So it feels like that our experience has probably been consistent with what just the trend of the equity market would suggest that people have been increasingly willing to take the view that we've likely seen the bottom of the cycle in terms of both stock prices and economic activity. And while there's obviously a lot of pain to be still absorbed, as we tentatively start to come out of the pandemic period, investors want to work through that and we see that in our core results, which have been certainly much better in April and our positive trend is continued in May for let\u2019s call it risk assets, so equities and floating-rate income, and high yield bonds principally would be exposure there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Craig Siegenthaler : My first one is on the fee rate and I heard Laurie's earlier comments on the day count. But I was looking for additional color on the 2 basis point decline in both the equities and the all -- blended fee rate from last quarter? Laurie Hylton : Hi Craig, it's Laurie. In terms of equities, I think why we're seeing the decline is due to the net outflows that we've seen in Parametric emerging markets. Within that category tends to be one of the higher fee products. And then all it's the same issue. So it's just a question of product mix within the category. Craig Siegenthaler : And then just a follow up to the last question. Can you provide us an update on the bank loan business? I'm just thinking with very low interest rates today and rising corporate defaults in the U.S. how is this product sold to both retail institutional investors? And do you have any updated thoughts on the forward flow trend from this business? Tom Faust : So, as I mentioned flows for May to-date have been modestly negative less than $100 million of outflows for the month-to-date through -- I think that\u2019s through Monday. So we're not seeing a significant continuation of the negative trend that we saw in March. The appeal of this asset class, I would say for many investors is from a total return perspective. As we pointed out, rates are absolutely -- benchmark rates are low, but spreads are wide. So in a place where it's -- in an environment where cash yields are zero, we're headed close to that, this asset class offers true floating rate exposure, so you can get high levels of current income without being exposed to meaningful amounts of interest rate risk, and also the opportunity for a significant price appreciation. Yes, and this is a big if. This economic cycle is similar to others where the experience of past cycles has been that the default and recovery experience of senior secured floating-rate bank loans is such that from current prices, there's a significant opportunity for price appreciation. Certainly no guarantees, these are risk assets below investment grade securities, but high current yield negative -- no exposure to interest rate risk to speak of, and a price that reflects still a pretty dire outlook for the economy, which again looking at the historical defaulting recovery experience of bank loans, this is proving to be a good price point for entry. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous. Your line is open. Patrick Davitt : Yes, just as a follow-up to Dan's question, I appreciate the pipeline guidance, are there any known offsetting redemptions to the unknown wins? Tom Faust : Not really to speak of. Generally, you don't have a whole lot of -- generally there is not a whole lot of visibility on outflows. So, I wouldn't take too much comfort from the fact that we don't have a significant pipeline of outflows, but the fact is that we don't. We've said in previous quarters that we have a large bank loan client that for a multi-year period has been redeeming out of their position, that's not over with yet, but there is still some outflows there to go, but that's something we've been living with. I think in total, we're expecting, maybe -- in the range of $1.5 billion over a extended period of likely multiple quarters, potentially even multiple years, for that to come out. But that's really the only significant net outflow where we have visibility on. The rest of our business, I would say, generally we're not expecting to see significant net outflows, but we live in a volatile world and we don't always get a heads up when redemptions are coming, but the pipeline looks good in terms of outflows, but I'd take that with a bit of a grain of salt because that's generally true that there is not much in a way of outflow pipeline. Patrick Davitt : Helpful. Thanks. And then, obviously, the ESG investing theme continues unabated and obviously helping Calvert. Could you update us on any plans or discussion around perhaps backward integrating the Calvert process across the whole complex? Tom Faust : Yes. So, that I would describe as well under way. I hesitate to say finished, but certainly well established. A priority for us, I'll say beginning two years ago was to integrate Calvert Research into the investment -- the fundamental investment processes of both Eaton Vance Management and Calvert, and to build systems connections and relationships among analyst teams and portfolio managers to accommodate that. So we've been working on this for two years. We have full access to the Calvert Research system and the Calvert Research analysts by all of our equity analysts and fixed income analyst and portfolio managers at both the Atlanta Capital and EVM, and that's been true for several quarters now. Like anything, the amount of inflow that has in our investment decision making is maybe a bit hard to measure. But certainly the connectivity is there and if you talk to our portfolio managers and hear them describe what we view with our competitive advantage is, the fact that we have access to this team of Calvert specialists, analysts who bring a very different perspective and a very different skill set than traditional fundamental analysts. It's something I would say that consistently, our PMs have been talking about for several quarters. It varies a bit by asset class, it's bigger in equities, but it's also becoming increasingly important in fixed income. The other place where we're increasingly integrating Calvert is relative to Parametric. Parametric is not in the business of making active calls on stocks or bonds. So, there's no fundamental process to integrate into. However, a significant part of the customized separate account business of Parametric relates to the ability to do customization to reflect client-specified ESG sensibility. To the extent that we can back that up with Calvert Research that we can provide with Calvert impact measurement that we can provide with collaboration and engagement with issuers, that strengthens the value of those Parametric offerings. And so, that's a -- I would say that's more of a current priority than something we've been focusing on historically and still some work to do there, but are optimistic that at the conclusion on this process that in Parametric, like Atlanta Capital and Eaton Vance Management, we will see a significant enhancement of their offerings in the marketplace, based on the connection, through Eaton Vance to Parametric -- I'm sorry to Calvert. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Maybe first on your changes to the reporting of adjusted earnings. So, it looks like the changes make this quarter's results look much better and prior quarters look a little bit worse. So, maybe a couple of questions around this. It looks like if the changes were not in place, your earnings would be $0.17 lower this quarter as per Page 10 of the release. I guess, firstly, is that correct? And then the timing of the changes seem a bit gimmicky. You took the benefit when it enhanced earnings and now that the CLO outlook has changed, you're adjusting up the losses. So, can you further flush out your comments on why this version of earnings is better than the prior? Tom Faust : So, let me start and then Laurie can jump in. Laurie Hylton : Okay. Tom Faust : So, headline earnings or GAAP earnings, excluding all of these adjustments, we earned $0.65. That's the top-line. If you want to go with GAAP, go with GAAP. We earned $0.65. This quarter consistent with most recent quarter, certainly over the last several years, every quarter, we've called out the contribution of seed capital investments and CLO investments to our earnings. These are investments that are mark-to-market, not all, but, I would say, most analysts that look through to try and uncover the underlying earnings power of our business have excluded those. So, we've called out the numbers in terms of earnings per share impact. A read of what most analysts report on our earnings have backed those out of our reported earnings. As you point out, during past periods, these were positive contributors, so that's consistent with rising markets. Absolutely, this adjustment here made our adjusted earnings higher then if we had included the -- then if we had not reflected -- sorry, then if we had reflected the losses in our business realized on seed capital investments and CLO gains and losses. We've also tracked competitors among public companies. What we're doing is fully consistent with what we think the prevailing trend is of other managers. There's a lot of disclosure here about the impact. And you and every other analysts have the ability to pick and choose. You want to the GAAP number, it's $0.65. You want to know with or without different adjustments, we quantify every one of them to its cents per share, and you have the ability to choose whatever earnings you want to choose that's being most relevant. We believe that for most people, not out -- but not everyone perhaps, the most relevant measure of our performance is what we're today describing as adjusted earnings per diluted share. Laurie, you might want to add to that? Laurie Hylton : Yes, I would just add, Ken, that we may be putting in tabular form and actually including it as part of our adjusted earnings calculation, but we have consistently been actually providing that information quarterly for quite some time. And I think as we were actually looking at how other peers were handling their seed capital portfolios, we realize that our parenthetically disclosure was not necessarily consistent with what others were doing. And then, quite frankly, if we were going to provide it parenthetically, we should just provide it as part of the reconciliation, and we thought it would be cleaner and it would be easier to get at. So that was the rationale for actually providing it in the adjusted number. And I do believe, as Tom said, that this is a better indicator from our perspective, the earnings power of the Company and it takes out a lot of the noise associated with consolidating large portfolios of products that quite frankly have very little to do when you actually back out the non-controlling interest, had very little to do with what our core operations actually look like. Ken Worthington : Okay. Great. Thank you for that. And then on the muni business -- the muni ladder business, to what extent is COVID-19 still weighing on the outlook for sales? Or is that business sort of recovered, like some of your other businesses that you highlighted? Tom Faust : Let me just pull up some numbers. So, we have -- the... Ken Worthington : The rational being it's a good business for you and we've got municipalities under pressure. And we can see what muni funds are doing, but the ladder business is sort of a different entity or different animal and it's been a very good one for you. Tom Faust : Yes. I would say, that business has not really recovered to, I'll say, pre-crisis levels. We're not seeing outflows. We never really saw outflows in bond ladders during this period. But the first challenge we had, and this is more of a February challenge, was that, particularly in muni, rates got so low that income levels were not particularly attractive in investment-grade muni. So one of the issues we're dealing with is just when you layer in the advisor of the expenses at interest rates as they have been for muni sort of February timeframe, there wasn't a lot of income available. So that was one of the things that was weighing on it. And then as we got into March, yield picked up because muni spread versus treasuries started to gap out, but the muni market was not functioning particularly well during the month of March. And I think advisors were somewhat leery of but coming back to coming back to the asset class. So, it's been up. I guess, I'd say it's been up maybe partial recovery, but we're not seeing the kinds of activities that we did before. I am looking at -- for month-to-date, modestly positive flows. I guess, probably consistent with maybe a little better than the -- yeah, a little better than the trend of the second quarter, but not where we were in the first quarter and prior periods. So it sounds like it will -- it looks like it will take some time for that business to come back. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier from Bank of America. Your line is open. Mike Carrier : So, first, maybe on the Parametric overlay flows. Tom, you mentioned some of the drivers in the quarter as well as the pipeline of new clients. Just in terms of the current clients that derisked during the quarter, maybe based on past trends and these volatile backdrops, do you tend to see those clients like come back in and rerisk as kind of the markets start to stabilize? I just wanted to get some perspective on some of the kind of derisking that we saw in the quarter... Tom Faust : Yes. A good question. So, we've, obviously, been through different downturns before, and it is not uncommon as we're coming into or going through a crisis period, when there is a lot of volatility in the market where institutions and that's who these clients are, will say I want to pull back from market exposure at some point. Maybe it's early before the crisis hit, as it hit, a little bit after the worst, whatever it is, it's certainly not uncommon for people to derisk their portfolios during market declines. And again, these are sophisticated institutional investors. So this is not a -- there's not a knee-jerk reaction. Primarily how these -- how this service has used, the biggest application, there are lots of other ones, but the biggest application is securitizing cash that's in client portfolios. So if you've got 3% or 4% cash in your portfolio that's not there for a particular investment reason, it's there -- maybe just I'll say sloshing around at the bottom of the portfolio, we've made the case historically that the best way to put that cash to use is using futures. So you're not disturbing the investments of the underlying managers who are running different sleeves of the portfolio, you have ultimate liquidity as to be able to take on or take off exposures quickly. So this is designed to be quick twitch asset movement positions that historically when markets go down you see people take off exposures, But I think, as your question suggests, generally as you get beyond the crisis period, particularly in periods like now and cash returns are nothing, that you start to see the resumption of putting back on positions by existing clients. There's certainly nothing in our experience or nothing in our communications with clients through this period that would suggest anything other than those positions are likely to come back over time. What's exciting for us is, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is that this period has been a great reminder to the prospects -- some prospects we've been talking to for half a dozen years or more of the tremendous value of this service that if you put some of your assets in with us, you have the ability to, at very well cost and essentially immediately, to add or subtract market exposure consistent with whatever view there is of the policy committee or the CIO that's running the portfolio. Highly valuable service during this period, unfortunately, from our -- from a flow perspective, it contributed negatively to the reported flows. The revenue impact of that, I should probably mention, is pretty modest. Generally, the positions that were taken off were by larger clients, where incremental fee rates even relative to an overall average of 5 basis point for this business. In many cases, we're a fair bit less than that for those incremental assets that came off. Not a huge revenue impact, but because we report these as managed assets and they're included in our flows, we get to talk about them during periods when money is moving in or moving out of these exposures. Mike Carrier : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Laurie, just expenses are well-managed and the margin held up relatively well. And I heard your comments on -- focusing on kind of discretionary expenses. In the quarter, were there any like unusual declines or items in the expense base? And then, just how are you thinking about the outlook, given obviously uncertain backdrop, yet fairly strong rebounding market? So, any context on how we should be thinking? Laurie Hylton : Yes. And just in terms of the current quarter, I don't think there was anything that was sort of a one-time item that we would call out. There is obviously just a lot of unusual activity to the extent that we no longer have people traveling, and we no longer -- just generally speaking, you're going to have some decline in just sort of discretionary spend, partially that's being -- because it's being managed very carefully and partially just because people are working out of their homes and there's just not as much activity. I think that as you're looking at the quarter, I think what's probably what's most notable is just the decline in certain categories from last quarter. And I think that the biggest of that is obviously compensation. And we highlight every year in the first quarter that we've got seasonal compensation expense that hits related to benefits that reset, payroll tax clocks that reset and stock-based compensation that we recognize in relation to employee retirements. So I think you'll see that notable decline in terms of, what I would think of some of the more fixed components of our compensation. But other than that, roughly [40%] of our costs are variable. So in periods where you've got the volatility that we've seen in sales and decline in average assets, we're going to go with that and that's going to -- and to a certain extent, that's a testimony to the fact that our cost structure is pretty flexible in periods like this. Mike Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Laurie Hylton : As to getting any kind of forecasting, I think I had to decline to do that at this point, because I just don't think anybody knows where this is going. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is open. Robert Lee : Thanks. Thanks for taking my question, and I hope everyone is doing well in these tough times. Maybe starting with the expense initiatives, Laurie, about kind of pulling back expense guidance per se, can you and Tom maybe update us on what are some of your new business initiatives you're spending on? I know there was Parametric, clearly and technology to kind of keep your technological lead there. But, can you just refresh us on some of the key initiatives? Laurie Hylton : Yes. I can start and maybe Thomas there wants to comment as well. The two big ones that we had, that we're currently undergoing, I think we've talked about number of -- on a number of calls, the first is, as you referenced, the operations and technology platform, Parametric. We are really making the investments there to build out that platform, recognizing the opportunity that we see just in terms of growth of that business in Custom Core particular. The other big one that we're well under way with right now is migration to the cloud. I think that, like many competitors, we're moving off of our -- out of our data centers and trying to actually move into cloud technology. So, we've got a relatively large project that's going there that we are going to continue to invest in. I think that we're at the tail end of most of our initiative to effectively get our trading platform standardized across the organization. So, we've done a lot with our fixed income teams getting everybody on to the same platform. And I think that we've pretty much gotten to the tail end of that, but there is still some residual work being done. I don't know if there's anything else, Tom, that you think that we should comment on. Tom Faust : Yes. You highlighted the ones that I would point to. Certainly. the work at Parametric and the move to the cloud are the big -- the pretty big spend items that we've made the determination that these are strategically important to us, and they're going to continue. I would say also Calvert. as a business. is an area of obvious growth and growth opportunity for us. So there are Calvert-related spending initiatives that not necessarily technology-related, but just in general that continue to be reflected and will likely continue in the future, even though we're focusing on reducing discretionary spending. So, if you want to get funded or any kind of a project, two things, it's got to be supportive of business growth in areas of demonstrated pretty clear opportunity and/or quick payback cost savings. Beyond that, it's pretty hard to get new initiatives approved. Robert Lee : Maybe as a follow-up to that, I mean, I think historically, you guys have watched in the -- maybe relative to some peers to try new things. And just kind of curious with that in mind, you do have your own version of these non-transparent ETF on file, not ETFM, but your other technology that you put out some announcements on that. Just maybe update us on kind of where some of that stands and if there are any kind of things that your -- other things you make besides Calvert, may be investing in, that you think are -- if you look a year or two or three down the road and you think to be new businesses for you? Tom Faust : Yes. Thanks for that. I would just comment on the less transparent active ETF filing that was put in front of the SEC in, let's say, February of last year or may be January of last year. So, we've had a fair bit of back and forth with the staff there. I feel pretty good about the progress there and I think we're optimistic of a favorable outcome, but we certainly can't promise that that will be achieved and don't know the timing of that. But I feel good about the prospects of entering that growing field at a time and it's really just getting started. And I think the thing that we're watching about that space, maybe a couple of things, but the most important one I would say is on the uptake of these is, will sponsors allow the same or substantially identical strategy to be offered, both at the mutual fund and as an ETF. And there certainly has been a view at times that we've heard by distributors that causes concerns for them, I think primarily come up from a business risk management compliance perspective. There's certainly no absolutes there, but that was one of the things that slowed us down with NextShares. And if that changes, and I think there are signs that it may be changing at least at some distributors, we think that's a very bullish sign for the potential of these products. Obviously, the other key will be the ability to gain asset classes other than US equities. So far, all of the approvals have been just for US equities. And certainly, our ambitions, and I'm sure everyone else's ambitions in the space, would be to come out with a methodology that can provide for good assurance of good trading results in other asset classes where the challenge for efficient market making is greater than it is in US equities. So I think we're both increasingly optimistic about the potential of this business, having seen now a number of firms that are announcing products and apparently a better receptivity on the part of distributors to establish strategy. Our business, in general, remains very hard to bring a new strategy out. If you can take a successful strategy and make it available in what many people believe is a better structure, that has real potential. So, we're increasingly optimistic about that and certainly, very hopeful about our own ability to enter the fray with our patented technology that's in front of the SEC now. In terms of other initiatives that I would highlight, I think, certainly, Calvert is an area of a lot of interest from a new product development standpoint, lots of ideas. It was essentially a US mutual fund brand and our challenge -- our focus has been both to increase our share of that business and that really has been the driver of the growth to date of Calvert, but also to look for ways to extend the Calvert brand into other markets. And we started to have success in institutional and different approaches to investing, but those are, I would say, maybe two fertile areas of focus, the less transparent ETFs and Calvert generally. And maybe a third, I would add, is within Parametric, there are different ways of using and combining their customized individual separate accounts will be an area of growth and focus for us on new product development. Operator : Excuse me. Do we have time for one more question? Eric Senay : Yes, let's take one last question. Thank you. Operator : Your last question will come from Chris Shutler from William Blair. Your line is open. Chris Shutler : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I hope you're all well. Regarding, let's see, so the core equity separate accounts, Tom, maybe just provide an update on how you see the competitive environment evolving over the medium term in that space? I know that direct indexing is getting a lot more attention these days throughout the industry, including from some of the large custodians. Thanks. Tom Faust : Yes. So there is, I think, a fair bit of conversation about this topic, including some related to the acquisition activity just recently announced. The actual business that we're in, I would say, the competitive situation hasn't changed very much. There have been a few new competitors that have come in and they have a -- to my understanding, haven't really taken a lot of market share. I think our experience is, this is an easier place to put together an iffy brochure and in some cases, a nice looking website. But in terms of the blocking and tackling of customized individual separate accounts, literally delivering on the promise of customization, that means every account is managed separately. It's not so easy and I think one of the things that was demonstrated during the month of March was that this is not a business for the dabblers. This is a hard thing to do well. And we as the market leader, commit an enormous amount of resources and a tremendous amount of management energy and Parametric is focused on achieving a consistently high level of client service in all market environments, including the challenging environments like we went through in March. So it's more conversation about direct indexing, that term has entered the vernacular of our business. People recognize that one of the distinctive strengths of Eaton Vance is our leadership through Parametric in that business. Nobody had any real impact on reducing our market share. We're taking our business there. We continue to prosper in that business. But there's certainly the possibility, which we're very much open to that there will be more competition from credible players. By and large, we're of the view that, that can be helpful, because the visibility of the market opportunity is still relatively low. This is still a pretty small business in the range of maybe a couple of hundred billion dollars relative to index mutual fund and index ETF opportunity that many, many, many times that, trillions of dollars of assets. So, I think there is lots of opportunity. If there is going to be more competition, there is lots of opportunity for that competition to help drive market growth, not just take business from each other.

At this time, all participants lines are on mute. Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, Eric Senay, Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Eric Senay : Thank you. And good morning. And welcome to our fiscal 2020 third quarter earnings call and webcast. With me this morning are Tom Faust, Chairman and CEO of Eaton Vance, as well as our CFO, Laurie Hylton. In today's call, we will first comment on the quarter and then take your questions. As always, the full earnings release and charts we will refer to during the call are available on our website, eatonvance.com, under the heading Investor Relations. Today's presentation contains forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainties in our business, including, but not limited to, those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings including our 2019 annual report and Form 10-K are available on our website or upon request at no charge. I will now turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Faust Jr.: Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Since we reported our second quarter earnings results in late May, our business, our employees and the communities in which we live and work have continued to be significantly impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly all of our staff continues to work remotely. And that remains our expectations through at least the balance of this year.  Our employees have adapted quite effectively to working from home with minimal disruption to day to day operations and high levels of client service being maintained throughout the pandemic period.  The strength and resilience of our business in this difficult environment is testament to the adaptability and commitment of our employees across the company, for which I remain deeply grateful.  Since the sharp market sell off in March, the stimulus actions of governments around the globe and visible progress advancing the development of effective COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics have fueled a recovery in financial markets. Over the course of our third fiscal quarter ending in July, we regained $39.4 billion of the $43.6 billion of managed assets that we lost to market price declines in the previous quarter. While the pandemic is far from over, markets are increasingly willing to bet that the worst is behind us and the economic recovery will continue.  Earlier today, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.82 for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, up 3% from $0.80 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and down 7% from $0.88 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.  On a GAAP basis, we reported a loss of $0.01 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, reflecting a $0.90 per diluted share reduction in the carrying value of our position in 49% owned Hexavest, together with $.07 per diluted share of income and gains on seed capital investments in consolidated CLO entities and other items that we exclude from our adjusted earnings calculation.  The reduction in the carrying value of our position in Hexavest reflects outflows-driven declines in Hexavest managed assets and management fee revenue, which accelerated the spring and summer following disappointing investment performance in the pandemic-related March market sell-off. Throughout its history dating back to 2004, Hexavest has employed a value-leaning preservation of capital oriented investment style that typically generates its strongest relative returns during periods of market weakness.  Unfortunately for Hexavest, this year's market decline did not follow the usual pattern as value stocks significantly lagged growth stocks, both during the sell-off and in the market recovery to date. Reflecting net outflows of $2.7 billion during our third fiscal quarter, Hexavest closed the quarter with managed assets of $6.8 billion. That compares to managed assets of $11 billion at the time we acquired our position in Hexavest in 2012. Peak managed assets of $17.1 billion in 2014 and $13.4 billion of managed assets at the end of our fiscal 2019 last October. While we're disappointed that recent reductions in Hexavest managed assets and management fee revenue have necessitated writing down the carrying value of our investment, we continue to believe in Hexavest investment approach and fully support the company's management. Hexavest business remains solid and secure, and their talented investment team continues to engage actively in the markets, seeking to deliver value for their clients.  Turning to our core operating results. We ended the third quarter of fiscal 2020 with $507 billion of consolidated assets under management, up 9% from the end of the previous quarter.  Across our investment mandate reporting categories, increases in managed assets range from a high of 12% for fixed income and 10% for Parametric custom portfolios to a low of 3% for alternative assets and floating rate income. In the third quarter, we had $2.7 billion of consolidated net inflows or $1.2 billion excluding Parametric overlay services.  The quarter's net flows were driven primarily by fixed income mandates, open-end funds and individual separate accounts.  Annualized internal growth for the quarter was 2%, as measured both in terms of consolidated managed assets and consolidated management fee revenue. That represents a sharp recovery from the prior quarters annualized internal growth in managed assets of minus 7% and annualized internal growth in management fee revenue of minus 6%.  Flow results generally improved as the quarter progressed, with July showing 13% annualized internal growth in managed assets or 4% excluding Parametric overlay services. Looking at our third quarter flow results by investment mandate reporting category, fixed income net inflows for the quarter totaled $4.5 billion, which equates to annualized internal growth of 29%.  Within fixed income, the largest contributor to fund net inflows were our category-leading Eaton Vance short duration government income fund, with net inflows of $1.7 billion, high yield bond and municipal income mutual funds, each with approximately $650 million of net inflows and emerging market local debt bonds with $300 million of net inflows.  Fixed income institutional separate accounts saw over $1 billion of net inflows in the quarter, led by cash management, high yield bond and emerging market local debt mandates.  For the fiscal year-to-date, managed assets in our emerging market local debt strategies have increased 54% to over $2.2 billion, reflecting strong performance of our two five star rated mutual funds in this category, Eaton Vance Emerging Markets Local Income Fund and Eaton Vance Emerging Markets Debt Opportunities Funds, as well as initial success attracting intermediary and institutional clients in offshore markets.  Turning to equities, Calvert Equity strategies contributed nearly $800 million of net inflows in the third quarter. For the fiscal year-to-date, flows into Calvert Equity strategies have totaled more than $2.7 billion, generating 27% annualized internal growth in managed assets for the nine months.  Calvert Equity Fund and Calvert Small Cap Funds each contributed nearly $200 million of inflows in the third quarter, with Calvert Emerging Markets Fund and Calvert International Equity Fund together contributing nearly $175 million of additional net inflows in the quarter.  EBM equity strategies generated approximately $200 million of net inflows in the third fiscal quarter, driven primarily by privately offered funds and our Eaton Vance Investment Counsel wealth management business.  Atlanta Capital had equity net outflows of nearly $100 million in the third quarter as net inflows into their large cap growth and select equity strategies were offset by $420 million of net outflows from the Eaton Vance Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap Fund, their largest mutual fund, which has been closed to new investors since April 2018.  With net outflows since the fund's closure now totaling approximately $1.6 billion, the fund's board of trustees voted earlier this week to reopen the fund to new investors effective September 30. The portfolio team at Atlanta Capital views it as a particularly opportune time to invest in the types of high quality stocks in which the fund specializes as these stocks have moved to attractive relative valuations.  Parametric had $3.1 billion of net outflows from equity mandate in the third fiscal quarters. This reflects the termination of a single $1.7 billion institutional covered call writing mandate and $1.6 billion of performance-related net outflows from Parametric systematic emerging market equity strategies during the quarter.  Parametric systematic EME strategies apply a modified equal weighting approach to country allocation that results in a structural underweighting to the China market, which has been a performance leader among the emerging markets over recent periods. The quarter-end managed assets in parametric systematic EME strategies consisted of $1.5 billion of US mutual fund AUM and $2.6 billion of offshore private fund and institutional separate account mandates. Turning to floating rate income. Net outflows for the third fiscal quarter were just under $600 million, a significant improvement from nearly $3.2 billion of net outflows in the preceding quarter.  After a steep down draft in March, bank loan prices have now recovered most of the way back to pre-pandemic levels. With the recovery in loan prices, activity in the CLO market has also resumed. In July, we successfully placed a new CLO entity that closed earlier this week, which will contribute $450 million to our fourth quarter net flows. In our alternative asset mandate reporting category, net outflows improved sequentially from nearly $700 million in the second fiscal quarter to less than $50 million in the third fiscal quarter. The improved flow results are attributable primarily to reduced net outflows from our two global macro absolute return strategies, for which combined net outflows were under $50 million in the third fiscal quarter versus over $650 million in the prior quarter.  Net flows into our global macro absolute return strategies and alternative asset mandates as a whole turned positive for the month of July.  Parametric overlay services had $1.5 billion of net inflows in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $6.5 billion of net outflows in the prior fiscal quarter. Clients gains and loss contributed $750 million of net inflows in the third quarter versus $600 million in the prior quarter. Changes in positions held by continuing overlay clients contributed $750 million of net inflows for the third quarter, greatly improved from $7 billion of net outflows from continuing clients in the second fiscal quarter.  Consistent with prior market downturns, we've seen continuing clients increasingly put back on their overlay positions as markets have recovered. After three straight months of net reductions in positions held by continuing overlay clients, net flows from continuing clients swung to the positive in June and improved further in July. With a $4 billion pipeline of new overlay clients expected to onboard in the fourth quarter and the prospect of continuing net inflows from existing clients, our overlay services business is poised for a very strong close to the fiscal year. Parametric custom portfolios had $470 million of net outflows in the third fiscal quarter, which reflects continuing positive flow results for Custom Core equity and ladder fixed income individual separate accounts, offset by outflows from institutional and subadvisory mandates. What we sometimes refer to as custom beta individual separate accounts, which includes Parametric Custom Core equity plus municipal and corporate bond ladders, had $1.9 billion of net inflows for the quarter, which equates to 7% annualized internal growth in managed assets. The decline from $2.8 billion of net inflows and 9% internal growth annualized in the prior quarter primarily reflects the withdrawal by a single ultra-high net worth Custom Core client of $700 million to fund a major charitable contribution. Within parametric custom portfolios, institutional and subadvisory mandates had aggregate net outflows of $2.1 billion in the third quarter, which compares to $650 million of net outflows in the preceding quarter. These net outflows reflect negative flow results for the underlying third-party managed investment strategies, unrelated to Parametric's role there as implementation manager.  We continue to view customized individual separate accounts as a leading long-term trend in asset management and an open ended market opportunity in which Parametric is positioned for continued dominance. We recently announced the extension of the Parametric Custom Core franchise to include, for the first time, index-based fixed income strategies. Parametric Custom Core fixed income seeks to provide advisors and their clients with exposure to the fixed income markets they select, combining the benefits of index-based portfolio construction, active credit oversight, and direct ownership of securities.  Like Custom Core equity portfolios, Custom Core fixed income can be customized to reflect each client's individual responsible investment criteria and other desired portfolio tilts and exclusions to incorporate the client's preexisting securities holdings and to harvest tax losses on a year round systematic basis. Similar to our laddered bond separate account, Custom Core fixed income portfolios combined the rules-based approach to portfolio construction, with active credit oversight and available tax management. Different from laddered bond portfolios, Custom Core fixed income accounts seek to provide market exposures that approximate a client-specified fixed income index or combination of indexes. Beyond Custom Core equities and fixed income, we see broadly-ranging future opportunities for Parametric custom separate accounts across multi-asset portfolios, applications combining active and passive management, and customized individual target date and target risk portfolios. The future remains very bright for Parametric custom portfolios.  In June, we announced the launch of Calvert ESG Research Leader Strategies, a new series of equity separate account offerings for institutional and individual investors. These strategies invest in the stock of companies with leading environmental, social and governance characteristics as determined by Calvert. Through partnership with Parametric, tax managed separate account versions of selected ESG research leaders strategies are available to serve taxpaying investors. We also announced in June the creation of the Calvert Institute for Responsible Investing, an affiliated research institute dedicated to driving positive change by advancing understanding and promoting best practices and responsible investing.  Since we acquired the business assets of Calvert's predecessor company at the end of 2016, Calvert's managed assets have more than doubled, reaching $24.7 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020. With $3.4 billion of net inflows into Calvert fund and separate accounts over the past nine months, Calvert has realized 23% annualized internal growth in managed assets for the fiscal year-to-date.  Among dedicated responsibly invested mutual funds, Calvert is far and away the market leader in terms of net inflows over the past 3 and 12 months, and ranks second currently in total assets under management. The strength of Calvert's brand as a long-term leader in responsible investing, combined with strong investment performance, and Eaton Vance's leading distribution presence in the US intermediary channel has proven to be a winning formula for Calvert. We see much more growth for Calvert in the quarters and years ahead.  During the third quarter, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of WaterOak Advisors, a wealth management firm headquartered in Winter Park, Florida, with approximately $2 billion of client assets under management. With a shared focus on high touch client service and a commitment to long-term relationships, the combination of WaterOak and Eaton Vance Investment Counsel will strengthen our position in private wealth management, which is an important strategic priority, and allow us to develop a much larger business serving high net worth individuals and families in Florida and throughout the southeast.  Looking ahead to our fourth fiscal quarter, we are optimistic that the business momentum we saw building over the course of the third quarter will continue to accelerate. We entered the fourth quarter with managed assets and run rate management fees well above third quarter average levels. Net flows across our business have been quite strong over the month of August, with overall net flows, both with and without Parametric overlay services, back in the range of what we saw in our first fiscal quarter before the pandemic hit.  We have a robust pipeline of new business to fund in the fourth quarter, including the $450 million CLO that closed earlier this week and $800 million institutional high-yield mandates scheduled to fund in early October, approximately $700 million of Custom Core equity separate accounts in the pipeline, and over $5 billion of institutional portfolio overlay and LDI mandates scheduled to fund before the end of October.  Reopening the Eaton Vance Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap Fund, our largest mutual fund, to new investors after a two-and-a-half year hiatus should also contribute positively to the favorable flow trends we expect to continue.  We believe there is considerable reason for optimism about the growth and performance of our business over the balance of fiscal 2020 and beyond.  That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Laurie. Laurie Hylton : Thank you. And good morning. As Tom described, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.82 for the third quarter fiscal 2020, up 3% from $0.80 in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and down 7% from $0.88 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.  As you can see in attachment 2 to our press release, adjusted earnings exceeded earnings under US GAAP by $0.83 per diluted share in the third quarter fiscal 2020, reflecting the reversal of the $100.5 million impairment loss recognized on the company's investment in our 49% owned affiliate, Hexavest, the reversal of $8.5 million of net gains of consolidated investment entities and our other seed capital investments, the add back of $1.6 million of management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities, and the reversal of $0.2 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards. Adjusted earnings exceeded earnings under US GAAP by $0.15 per diluted share in the second quarter fiscal 2020, reflecting the reversal of $16.8 million of net losses of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments, the add back of $1.8 million management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities, and the reversal of $1.1 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards.  Earnings under US GAAP exceeded adjusted earnings by $0.02 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, reflecting the reversal of $4.6 million of net gains of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments, the add back of $2.3 million of management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities and the reversal of $0.6 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards.  As Tom discussed in more detail, the outflows driven decline in Hexavest managed assets and management fee revenue over recent months prompted the determination that, in the third fiscal quarter, the company's equity method investment in Hexavest [indiscernible] temporarily impaired. Accordingly, the company recognized an impairment charge of $100.5 million in the quarter to reduce the carrying value of our investment in Hexavest to $32.7 million, which is estimated fair value based on the independent appraisal. As Tom previously noted, we continue to have faith in Hexavest leadership and confidence in our investment team and approach. As shown in Attachment 2 to our press release, adjusted operating income was up 7% sequentially, down 5% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating margin was 31.6% in the third quarter fiscal 2020 compared to 30.5% in the second quarter fiscal 2020 and 32.4%. in the third quarter fiscal 2019.  Versus the prior quarter, average managed assets were up 1%. The management fee revenue increased 4%. The increase in management fee revenue exceeded the increase in average managed assets primarily due to a 2% increase in our average annualized management fee rate from 29.7 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 to 30.3 basis points in the third quarter fiscal 2020 and the impact of two more fee days in the third quarter.  Although average managed assets this quarter were up 3% from the same period last year, net management fee revenue was down 2%, reflecting a 5% decline in our average annualized management fee rate from 31.8 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 to 30.3 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The decline in our average annualized management fee rate versus the comparative period last year was driven primarily by shifts in our business, from higher fee to lower fee mandates. Performance-based fees, which are excluded from the calculation of our average management fee rates, contributed $0.9 million, $2.5 million and $0.1 million to revenue in the third quarter fiscal 2020, the second quarter fiscal 2020 and the third quarter fiscal 2019 respectively.  Management fees earned on consolidated investment entities, which are eliminated in consolidation and excluded from the calculation of our average management fee rate, were $1.2 million, $1.3 million and $1.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and the third quarter of fiscal 2019 respectively. Turning to expenses. Compensation expense increased 5% from the second quarter of fiscal 2024, reflecting higher operating income based, investment performance based bonus accruals; higher stock-based compensation primarily driven by additional expense recognized during the third quarter in connection with employee retirements; higher salaries associated with increases in headcount, primarily parametric; the impact of two additional payroll days in the third quarter and higher benefit expenses, driven by a $1.7 million insurance reimbursement recorded last quarter. These increases were partially offset by lower sales based incentive compensation and a decrease in payroll taxes.  Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compensation costs decreased 1%, reflecting lower operating income based bonus accruals, lower sales-based incentive compensation and lower severance costs. These decreases were partially offset by a higher stock-based compensation and higher salaries and benefit expenses associated with increases in headcount, again, primarily at Parametric. Non-compensation distribution-related costs, including distribution and service fee expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commissions, were substantially unchanged from second quarter fiscal 2020 as higher private funds service fee expenses and marketing support payments were offset by lower upfront sales commission expense.  Year-over-year non-compensation distribution-related costs decreased 7%, primarily reflecting lower distribution and service fee expenses for Class A and Class C mutual fund shares, driven by lower average managed assets, lower upfront sales commissions, lower discretionary marketing expenses, and lower intermediary marketing support payments. These decreases were partially offset by increases in service fee expenses and commission amortization from private funds.  Fund-related expenses decreased 12% sequentially and 2% year-over-year, reflecting lower fund expenses borne by the company, partially offset by higher subadvisory fees due to an increase in average managed assets of subadvised funds.  Other operating expenses decreased 2% from the second quarter fiscal 2020, primarily reflecting lower travel expenses, partially offset by an increase in other corporate expenses due to a one-time charge of $1.4 million related to a reimbursement to the company sponsored funds recorded in the third quarter. Other operating expenses increased 5% from the third quarter fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting increases in information technology spending and the above-mentioned one-time charge, partially offset by lower travel expenses.  Although we are continuing to invest in areas that are important for the future growth of the company, we are otherwise focused on tight expense management and reducing discretionary spending.  In this period of volatility, we continue to benefit greatly from the fact that more than 40% of our operating expenses are variable in nature, moving up and down with changes in operating income, managed assets or sales results.  Non-operating income expense was up $105.7 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2020, primarily reflecting an $84.2 million positive change in net gains or losses and other investment income of consolidated sponsored funds and the company's investments in other sponsored strategies, a $21 million improvement in net income or expense of consolidated CLO entities; and a $0.5 million decrease in interest expense.  Non-operating income was up $26.8 million from the third quarter of fiscal 2019, reflecting an $18.8 million increase in net gains and other investment income of consolidated sponsored funds and the company's investments in other sponsored strategies and an $8 million improvement in net income or expense of consolidated CLO entities. Turning to taxes. The US GAAP effective tax rate was 22.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, 45.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and 25.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.  The company's income tax provision was reduced by net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards totaling $0.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, $1.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and $0.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. As shown in attachment 2 to our press, our calculations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share remove the impact of gains, losses and other investment income of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments add back the management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities, exclude the effect of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards and remove the impairment loss recognized on the company's investment in Hexavest.  On this basis, our adjusted effective tax rate was 27.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, 24.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and 26.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. On the same adjusted basis, we estimate that our quarterly effective tax rate for the balance of fiscal 2020 and for the fiscal year as a whole will range between 26.4% and 26.9%.  In addition to the Hexavest impairment loss previously noted, equity net income of affiliates in the third quarter fiscal 2020 includes $1 million of income earned from the company's investment in Hexavest, which was partially offset by $0.8 million of losses related to the company's investment in a private equity partnership. Substantially all of equity net income of affiliates in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and the third quarter of fiscal 2019 related to the company's investment in Hexavest.  We finished our third fiscal quarter holding $1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term debt securities and approximately $280.5 million in seed capital investments. We are carefully managing our cash flows during this period of heightened economic and market uncertainty to maintain our financial flexibility. During the third quarter fiscal 2020, we used $41.2 million of corporate cash to pay the $0.375 per share of quarterly dividend we declared at the end of our previous quarter.  Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 111.7 million in the third quarter fiscal 2020, flat sequentially and down 2% year-over-year, primarily reflecting a decrease in the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and unvested restricted stock awards due to lower market prices of the company shares.  Fiscal discipline, tight management of discretionary spending and maintaining a strong balance sheet continue to be top financial priorities for us in these unprecedented times.  This concludes our prepared comments. At this point, we'd like to take any questions you may have. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : It looks like you had no share repurchase, I think maybe for the first time ever, at least in my model. Could you speak to maybe the thinking around that after the share price decline? Was there some sort of unique restriction this quarter? And how should we think about that going forward? Laurie Hylton : Hi. It's Laurie. As we were looking at this quarter and last quarter, it really has been top of mind for us to ensure that we've got financial flexibility, particularly in terms of our liquidity. And I think as we mentioned last quarter, given everything that's happening on the global stage, we felt it was prudent to cut back on our share repurchases and we just continue to look at it quarter by quarter. But again, we're really just trying to ensure that we've got the liquidity necessary to continue to grow the business. Patrick Davitt : And then also, just a quick follow-up. The parametric emerging markets strategy, you called out with some performance-related outflows. I think you said there was $1.5 billion and $2.6 billion left in that bucket. Should we take that to mean that you're worried that that might be AUM at risk given the performance issues? Thomas Faust Jr.: I think there's a reasonable chance that unless performance improves that it's an active strategy that competes against other attractive strategies in each of our businesses. If you if you can't deliver performance that exceeds benchmarks and peer groups over time, it's reasonable to expect assets to come down.  We have seen quite a bit of net outflows from that strategy. We think there's likely to be more stickiness to the assets on the mutual fund side perhaps than the non-mutual fund business. But certainly, for modeling purposes, we would assume that outflows there will continue. Ultimately, we're constrained by the amount of outflows by the assets that we have, which is down to just over $4 billion currently. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler : I'm interested in an update on what you're seeing on the competitive landscape at Parametric and Custom Core equity. And I'm especially interested in your comments around direct indexing. Thomas Faust Jr.: So, there's quite a bit of, I guess, you would say noise. There have been announcements of a number of potential competitors that have interest in the space, public comments. In many ways, have been gratifying that people acknowledge that this is an area that provides value added for clients and many people perceive to have growth potential. In terms of what's happening in the marketplace as opposed to what we're hearing in announcements, there really hasn't been a meaningful change in competitive position. There's no new competitor that we're aware of that's taking significant share. We're not losing business being replaced by someone else. So, there's no evidence that any of the announcements are translating so far into changes in the competitive dynamic.  This is a business that we and many others expect will grow quite substantially over coming quarters and years. It's not a surprise that others will try and compete in this business, given the growth profile that is there. I would say that our experience which goes back now several decades is that this is a hard business. It's not a business for dabblers, that there's a real commitment required to invest in technology, to invest in service and to invest in distribution to gain access across the markets.  So far, there haven't been any competitors that have emerged that we're worried about who check all those boxes in terms of the level of commitment and demonstrated expertise and technology and service and have similar distribution to us. But we think it will be a much bigger market. It's reasonable that there'll be more competitors. But we think that the position that Parametric has there is very solid, very strong and very secure. Craig Siegenthaler : And just a follow-up here. If you do see an increase in competition in direct indexing and new entrants offer comparable product at lower price points, can you comment on your ability to reduce pricing below the mid-teens, which is where I think the blended fee rate is today and still generate attractive margins? Thomas Faust Jr.: Certainly. We have the ability to respond selectively to competitors that compete on price. We will go toe to toe with anyone in terms of the quality and the value proposition that we offer as a leader in customized indexing. Competition in this space is not new. Throughout the time that we've been growing our custom indexing business, there have been other players in the market. The profile of those competitors really hasn't changed. The nature of the competition really hasn't changed. What has happened is that as the market has grown, its visibility has increased and we're seeing more conversation. But in terms of what's happening in the marketplace, we continue to compete as appropriately on price. We see nothing to suggest that we'll see wholesale reductions in average fee rates for this business. But we're certainly making the investments in technology and service and systems that will allow us to support a much bigger business and that ultimately will allow us to lower our operating costs, so that we can achieve attractive margins even at potentially lower average fee rates. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : Just to follow-up on kind of the flows and the momentum you cited heading into the fourth quarter. If you could just clarify again, I think you said the total number will be similar to the first quarter, I think either including or excluding some of the lower fee stuff, but just want to clarify that.  And then also, does that include some of the mandates you talked about or just trying to think about what still has been funded versus what you're saying has happened in August? Thomas Faust Jr.: Let me clarify, Dan. So, the comment what I was trying to make is that [indiscernible] for our August to date, this would not include any of the pipeline things that I talked about. We're seeing quite strong flows that if you exclude the Parametric overlay service business, puts us, we think, on pace for the same range of flows that we saw in the first quarter. Again, that's based on quarter-to-date results through yesterday and \u2013 through the day before yesterday, I guess. That is in the range of about, I think, $1.7 billion for our non-Parametric overlay business. You multiply that by three to account for the fact that we're less than a third of the way through the quarter. And that gets you sort of in the ballpark of the $5 billion of non-overlay net flows that we had in the first quarter.  Momentum is good. That includes strong sales with fixed income continuing, positive flows for equity, positive flows for floating rate income, positive custom portfolios. As I mentioned, we're expecting on top of that a quite strong quarter for the overlay services business where we've got meaningful amount \u2013 a couple billion dollars plus of net inflows for the quarter-to-date, plus a quite robust pipeline of new business that we're expecting to fund.  All these forecasts should be taken with a grain of salt. We're only a third of the way through the quarter. Things can happen as we saw back in March. But, certainly, we're on track for a quite strong fourth quarter in terms of flows, supported by an excellent first month of that quarter and a visible pipeline of new opportunities that we think will likely support continuing flow momentum through the balance of this month and then through September and into the end of October and the end of the fiscal year. Daniel Fannon : And then, Laurie, just with regards to expenses and kind of the outlook, clearly, with the revenue side looking better based on where markets and AUM sit, as we think about going into next quarter, is margin expansion from here still reasonable, given what's happening with revenue and then still some kind of operational leverage potential on some of the non-discretionary spending side? Laurie Hylton : I would certainly say there's always the possibility. I hesitate just given the volatility that we see in the markets to put money on anything at this point. But I do think that we're very comfortable in thinking that the year is going to be in this 31% range. I would not necessarily anticipate a significant uptick in the fourth quarter, but I do think we're very comfortable in the range that we're in. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Kenneth Worthington : I'll combine everything into one. Just following up on the equity outflows this quarter, it seemed to some extent that the weakness this quarter was as much a function of weaker gross sales versus the last couple of quarters as it was for the higher gross outflows. So, can you flesh out, if you agree, the gross sales side of the equation as well? And for the follow-up on the outflows, you mentioned, I believe, it was $1.7 billion of covered calls and the $1.6 billion of the systematic. For the covered call strategy, how do those strategies typically do in this type of market? And maybe how much is left there? And on the systematic side, you said it was performance based. I believe you called out China as the driver. Are there other issues besides exposure to China or was that really all of the issue? Thomas Faust Jr.: Starting with emerging market equities, systematic strategy, so they don't make market falls. So, think about this in the broad category of things as smart beta or multi-factor strategy. The premise of the fund is value added through diversification and rebalancing. The philosophy is a modified equal weighting approach to country allocation and alpha generation by rebalancing into underperforming countries.  That worked for a very long time. It has not worked recently simply because the China market has come to dominate the emerging market indexes both in terms of weighting, but also in terms of contribution to performance. So, a strategy that by design is underweight to the largest markets \u2013 in this case, China \u2013 is very much hamstrung in trying to perform in market environments which we've been in where you have sustained leadership of those largest countries in the index. So, we've had performance-related outflows. I guess you would say, in addition to the country allocation, given the rebalancing nature of the approach we take, there's an anti-momentum bias to the strategy that also has not helped during this period. But the outflows are, we think, going to abate. I highlighted that we're at $4 billion in assets. I think peak assets in this strategy were in the range of $20 billion. So, it's mostly behind us in terms of the outflows, with only a remaining $4 billion left.  How quickly we see that go away I think is anyone's guess. But we're certainly expecting based on performance that we've seen, as of current periods, still underperforming. So, we think it's reasonable to expect that outflows will continue.  A second part of the question related to the covered call writing business and what Parametric refers to as volatility, risk premium strategies that is monetizing the alpha that's created from the fact that options typically sell at a premium, where the implied volatility is typically higher than the realized volatility.  Those strategies generally perform well during trending markets when you collect your premium, but you don't get called away from the upside or have to buy in a position to avoid getting called away on the upside.  When they don't perform particularly well, as in the tight markets where there's a sharp upturn, which obviously is what we've had in the April/May period after the lows in March, so it's not surprising that we would see pressure on these strategies in market environments like this. Covered call writing is essentially trying to capture this premium that's frequently observed in the pricing of options. But it comes potentially at the cost of capping the upside in a sharply rising market. And when that happens, clients are prone to be disappointed.  After some period of clients taking off positions, I think generally we're in a mode of sort of neutrality to positive flows for our covered call writing business. So, I think that covers the second part. The third, which I don't really have information in front of me, it's like I'm going to have to guess at this. But did the quarterly flow results for equities reflect more a decline in gross sales or more an increase in redemptions? I would say \u2013 I guess I would maybe turn the question around, I guess, and say most of our business, the Calvert business had positive flows, the EBM equity business had positive flows, the Atlanta Capital business excluding the big fund there that's close to new investors had positive flows.  I would turn it around to say that the outflows that we saw in the equity category were very concentrated in the two things that I called out at Parametric. That being the covered call writing, the big institutional account that was lost there, the $1.7 billion, the emerging market equity strategies, and then the outflows from the Atlanta Capital S-MID Cap Fund, which was over $400 million.  So, in general, we feel our equity flows are good. A flash report through yesterday shows positive equity flows in the fourth quarter. And we certainly feel good about our ability to continue to grow in equities, subject to continuing pressure on that emerging market equity franchise that weighs against them. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. William Katz : Maybe just a two-parter. Maybe for Laurie. Just curious, in terms of capital management, what milestones should we be looking at macro-wise or otherwise, to think about the reengagement of repurchase given your free cash flow? And then, Tom, just a big picture perspective. As you're dialoguing with both the retail and institutional gatekeepers, what are you hearing in terms of allocation decisions, just given the V-shaped recovery of equity and credit markets? Thank you. Laurie Hylton : We really don't have any markers that I would say to look towards. We don't have a program for share repurchases. It's a discretionary decision. We have a small committee that thinks about this every quarter, and I think that we'll be considering all the possible inputs as we move out of our blackouts. So, more to come on that, but nothing specific to look for in terms of markers. Thomas Faust Jr.: Bill, in terms of markets and where we're headed, first, I'm generally not too involved in those decisions with gatekeepers about asset allocation. My own market view is that the markets will likely continue to grind their way higher, given what we see as likely to be continuing positive news on the on the pandemic, particularly from a therapeutic and vaccine standpoint, more so than public health, and the likelihood that the economy will continue to be paused. It's certainly one of the things we're watching carefully, is US election and what that might imply for future tax rates, future regulatory and spending initiatives.  I think as most of our listeners are aware, we have a large business serving tax paying investors, which represent \u2013 some version of tax managed strategies represent over 40% of our assets, including municipal bond funds and tax managed equities. We're not exactly sure what's going to happen, but we certainly think that there's a reasonable prospect that, following the election, we could see an increase in tax rates, which could be a significant positive for that business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : A lot of good questions and answers on the Parametric. Maybe if I could just add one comment. I guess what do you make of the importance of fractional share accounting in the costume indexing business in terms of the potential competitor responses down the road? And again, going back to \u2013 obviously, your business has performed very well and you have a leading position in this business, but going forward, if it's not competing on pricing, what other growth angles within the Parametric business, I guess, would you point to [indiscernible]? Thomas Faust Jr.: We compete primarily in high net worth markets for Parametric custom portfolios. For Custom Core equities, the account minimum at most places, I believe, is $250,000. So, the impact of fractional shares for someone that's putting to work $250,000 is pretty minimal.  There is the opportunity with fractional shares, and you've been reading about these, to do less customized or even non-customized direct indexing based strategies, which to us is not a particularly interesting product or interesting market, our perspective is that the value here is in the customization. And the cost of delivering customization is the service that's required. And to deliver customized accounts and high levels of service at the kinds of fee rates we're talking about and account minimums we're talking about is hard. And we're making investments in technology to put us in a position to continue to be a leader in doing that.  But I would say, broadly, the impact of fractional shares, while it will make it easier for us and other competitors potentially to go down market, the real name of the game here is customization. The primary value added for most investors, not all, but most, is tax efficiency, which is a concern primarily at higher tax rates.  We do see the business evolving in significant ways. I highlighted the fact that we've introduced Custom Core indexed products on the fixed income side. We certainly see lots of opportunity for product innovation down the road in terms of enhancing the features that we offer, expanding the array of capabilities, so that it's not just index based, but it's index plus active. It's not just equity or not just fixed income, but a combination of both. And then, very interesting applications potentially down the road in terms of target date or target risk, all customized to the individual.  So, we think there's lots of room here for lots of different ideas. The value added that we provide, again, is customization and service, primarily for higher net worth investors, primarily with the significant value add being tax. And some of the things that we're hearing about really just not relevant to that market and that market opportunity as we see it. Brian Bedell : And then, maybe a follow-up. Just on your perspective on the active ETF industry, now that we've got a number of ETFs live in the industry, I know you filed an amendment for the clear hedge strategy with the SEC, maybe just to comment on, I guess, the status on that and how you think that maybe conversations with potential users of the clear hedge strategy. And then, broadly, the potential for you guys to license active ETFs or create them under a proxy portfolio structure for your own funds. Thomas Faust Jr.: We remain very interested, very close to the space, as you point out. We did file a second amended application with the SEC for our clear hedge method of what we call portfolio protected ETFs. I'm going to call it less transparent of active ETFs. We filed that last month. You can read that as indicative of positive constructive dialogue with the SEC staff. We certainly can't predict when or ultimately what they will decide, but we certainly feel good about the dialogue that we're engaged in there and are hopeful we'll get a \u2013 ultimately get a positive result. The competitive landscape is really just beginning to emerge. I think there's five different concepts that have been approved by the SEC. We hope to be the sixth. Our business model here would include licensing our technology to others. We hope to compete on the basis of offering the highest level of assurance of strong secondary market trading, consistent with not having to disclose portfolio holdings or significant representative proxy portfolio on a daily basis. So, we think we've got a very competitive mousetrap. This market is starting to develop based on the assets and flow numbers that I've seen. And we certainly want to have a place in that.  Like the other approved applications, our application, at least initially, is limited to cash and exchange-traded securities that trade during US market hours. So, think of that as US equities and US ETFs and Canadian and perhaps other markets that trade during the same timeframe as the US. So, it would be limited in that respect initially, which we think \u2013 frankly, quite reasonably, the SEC says, let's see what how this works for this asset class before we consider other asset classes. But we're very hopeful, very optimistic that, ultimately, this class of products and our application and our technology in particular will see application across all asset classes. And so, we continue to be very much optimistic about the future of actively managed exchange-traded products based on the potential enhancement in operating efficiency, trading convenience and tax efficiency versus ETFs.  And so, while we have a long heritage in the mutual fund industry, we are very committed to the development of customized individual separate accounts as an enhanced way for investors to invest in an array of strategies. And then, similarly invested in less transparent ETFs or portfolio protected ETFs as a way to do similar things through a fund vehicle with structural advantages versus a traditional mutual fund concept. Brian Bedell : And just for licensing your own funds, would you more likely use a proxy model that's out there already or, let's say, the [indiscernible] model and then apply the clear hedge to the proxy? Thomas Faust Jr.: No, we would be using our model as an alternative to the \u2013 think of clear hedge as a sixth approach, not something that would be an add-on to one of the other approaches. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Michael Carrier : Tom, overall, the flow outlook looks promising. I just wanted to get an update on how you're seeing demand shift in the floating rate category and then if there was anything unusual and strange in the fixed income this quarter.  And then, just a small clarification as a follow-up, I think you mentioned one or two funds reopening. I caught one was Atlantic Capital, but I wasn't sure if there was another one that you mentioned as well. Thomas Faust Jr.: The only fund we have that's reopening is the Atlanta Capital S-MID Cap Fund, which is an important milestone for us. It is our largest and, I guess, by that measure, most popular fund and it's got a real strong following. And because it's been closed, we've seen fairly significant net outflows. I think I said $420 million in the quarter. So, once that's reopened, I would hope, at a minimum, we can stop the net outflows and potentially get that fund back into a growth mode again. It's not an open ended opportunity. We're potentially looking at closing it again, if we get significant net inflows. But at a minimum, we're hoping to abate the outflows there.  In terms of bank loans, it's an interesting position we're in currently. We are, I just said, modestly to the positive in terms of our bank loan flows for the month of August today through Monday of this week. But it's pretty small, positive, but closer to zero than some meaningful number. That does not include the CLO that I talked about as a big price this week. So, we're thinking that we've kind of bottomed out. We had a very rough quarter in the second quarter in terms of bank loan flows. Yields here are pretty attractive. And I just checked this morning. The yield on our unlevered floating rate fund is about 3.6%. The modestly levered version is at 4.4%. And the version that has allocation to high yield is at 3.8%. Those are pretty attractive yields for a floating rate product in today's marketplace. Obviously, you've got to be comfortable taking credit risk because that's a component of this asset class. These are below investment grade securities.  But if people are generally getting comfortable that we've seen the worst in the economy and you look at what kinds of yields are available in other instruments and you start to worry \u2013 at least some people do worry \u2013 about the possibility that loan rates could be moving up and we may have hit the bottom in terms of where those are, you start to build an environment in which falling rate bank loans could be, again, an attractive asset class.  Our history in this business, which goes back to 1989, is that it's a business of cyclical growth, in which our pattern has been over market cycles. We typically hit a new high in assets and then people's rate expectations change and we see outflows or people get concerned about credit and we see outflows.  But we see nothing about our industry position or about the fundamental attractiveness of the asset class to suggest that we can't again regain the former highs in managed assets, which were in the, I think, mid-40s billions of dollars. So, that's not going to happen overnight, but we certainly think that we're in the bottoming stage or we're maybe coming out of the bottoming stage and are hopeful that we'll see an improvement in flows. But it's not happening yet. The good flows that we've had for August have been much more driven by fixed income as opposed to floating rate income with continued very healthy flows for our short duration government income fund, for our high yield strategies and for our muni strategies being the primary drivers of our income products flows. The nice thing about bank loans is it's not a negative currently in the same way that it was a significant negative in the second quarter and a modest negative in the third quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Robert Lee with KBW. Jeffrey Drezner : Hi. This is actually Jeff Drezner on for Rob Lee. Thanks for taking my question. I've got a question. I was curious about the \u2013 if you can give us an update on the potential acquisitions, you see things accelerating, where your focus might be on that? Thomas Faust Jr.: We highlighted in my prepared remarks that we announced an acquisition of a $2 billion wealth manager in Florida called WaterOak Advisors. We announced it, I think, last month, and would hope to close that before the end of the year.  You should take that as a signal that we continue to be interested in expanding in wealth management. We're approaching $10 billion in managed assets there, including WaterOak after that transaction is closed, which is a meaningful sized competitor in the wealth management space and think that we have a lot to offer there and we'll look for other ways to grow there. Other things that we find potentially interesting and where we continue to have conversations include private credit, which we view as a potentially highly complementary to our strong industry position and capabilities in the public credit markets through bank loans and high yield bonds. So, those are maybe two areas of focus.  We continue to look for opportunities to grow our platform in responsible investing, particularly if we can do that outside the United States. Calvert is today primarily a US brand that, in an ideal world, we could grow our presence in responsible investing outside the United States. So, those are some of the things we're looking at. Jeffrey Drezner : And then, just another one on the muni ladder. In terms of the low rate environment, how do you see the demand for those and the outlook? Thomas Faust Jr.: That is frankly a challenge that, for investment grade muni ladders, there's just not a whole lot of yield available at current interest rates. One of the things we've been looking to do and are in the process of potentially bringing to market is a separate account product that includes a sleeve allocated to high yield muni issuance or corporate issuance for corporate ladders. That brings up the yield and does it in a diversified \u2013 an appropriately diversified way. So, it would be owning as a part of a ladder or a separate account structure, a sleeve dedicated to a diversified portfolio of higher yielding assets with the goal to bring up the overall income level for the portfolio in a managed controlled risk way. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Tom, I wanted to ask a little follow-up on your comments earlier, given tax managed importance to your overall AUM base. And I'm with you between the election and the huge stimulus that it's a good chance tax rates are going up at some point. So, the question is, what can you do to prepare either educating the clients, educating the wealth management channel? And is the post-election tax cut any indication in reverse of what we might see \u2013 how big of an opportunity do you see a higher tax rate environment across your platform? Thomas Faust Jr.: We've gone through this a few times. We've had a focus on tax managed equities and muni bonds for several decades now. And so, we've seen multiple cycles of rates going up and rates going down. So, we have some historical perspective on how this might play out.  There is certainly a lot of interest in the topic, and it's been a major focus of our communication efforts to talk about the importance of investment taxes. For a number of years, we used to do surveys of investors, asking about their thoughts on investment in taxes, and the results were always very consistent, which is that many investors appreciate the importance of taxes, but very few of them would say they understand what's involved. And increasingly, they look to their financial advisors as the source of information and guidance on tax efficient investing. And we think a great way for advisors to work with clients and add value, is providing information and solutions to help address concerns about taxes that they're going to be paying. So, we've done a lot of that over the years.  If you go to our website and look at our marketing materials, we have a fair bit on there about taxes. We have a calculator which \u2013 you enter where you live and what your filing status is and what your taxable income is and you can calculate what your current tax rate is. We're looking at expanding that, so that you can do a pro forma tax rate based on assumptions about where tax rates go. But for us, it's a great way to get in front of advisors to help them educate their clients and demonstrate their expertise on something where clients know they need help on, know they need advice on.  Exactly how that plays out for us in terms of what products that is or how our product lineup might change as a result of that, it's still way too early to determine what that might look like. But, certainly, superficially, municipal bonds becoming more attractive at higher interest rates, Parametric custom portfolios, tax managed investing generally becomes more attractive at higher rates. And that's very much a focus of our sales and marketing teams going into the election is to try and help position advisors to provide good advice for their clients in that environment. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Eric Senay for closing remarks. Eric Senay : Thank you. I've got to thank you for participating in our earning call today. And we hope everyone will stay safe and healthy. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release and strategic update. Within the strategic update, and reported information has been adjusted and is noted in the presentation. These adjustments were made to provide a transparent and comparative view of our operating performance against our strategic objectives. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP adjusted operating performance metrics are included in the notes to the presentation. On October 2, Morgan Stanley closed its acquisition of E TRADE, which impacts period-over-period comparisons for the firm and Wealth Management. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman. James Gorman : Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. And I fully appreciate we're competing with a historic day here, so particularly appreciate you listening in. We will be brisk, as we always try to be. Morgan Stanley delivered record results in 2020. We generated an ROTCE of 15.4%, while meaningfully driving our strategic vision forward. We successfully closed our acquisition of E TRADE, received an upgrade from Moody's to A2, we're placed on review for upgrade a second time, and announced our intent to acquire Eaton Vance. Then last month, following the Federal Reserve's release of its second stress test result, we announced the $10 billion buyback program that we intend to execute in 2021. Our performance and competitive position serve as hard evidence that Morgan Stanley has reached an inflection point. Jon will discuss the details of this year's performance in a moment, but first let me walk you through our vision for the next decade, and outlook focused on growth as outlined in our annual strategic update. This is something we've now done since, I believe, 2012. Let's turn to slide three. Our strategy revolves around demonstrating stability in times of serious stress, and delivering strong results when markets are active. 2020 for sure tested this thesis. In a rapidly evolving operating environment, we responded to heightened volatility and supported open and functioning markets and client needs. We delivered record revenues of $48 billion while remaining disciplined in our risk management. Those revenues, by the way, are up from $34 billion in the time period 2010 through 2014. Turn to slide number four. We enhanced our positioning in areas of secular growth with several strategic acquisitions. In 2019, as you know, we advanced our workplace offering with the acquisition of Solium. Then, in 2020, we took a leap forward when we announced our acquisitions of E TRADE and Eaton Vance. Combining with E TRADE positions us to reach clients in various stages of wealth accumulation in a scalable, economic way. E TRADE's technology, products, and innovation mindset enhance our growth model. Further, E TRADE serves a younger demographic, who are on average over 10 years younger than those we have historically served, and who we can continue to service as their needs become increasingly complex. With Eaton Vance, we will create a leading asset manager of scale. Eaton Vance brings new investment capabilities to our platform, and leading positions in secular growth areas, particularly customization and sustainability. The deal will also expand our client reach, combining MSIM's robust international distribution with Eaton Vance's strong U.S. distribution. Please turn to slide number five. Having experienced periods of fragility, healing, and stability, our firm is now at an inflection point. The next decade will be characterized by growth. Our growth drivers span across all three of our business segments. We'll focus on gaining market share, expanding and deepening our client relationships, realizing acquisition synergies and operating leverage, and finally, returning capital to our shareholders. Please turn to slide six. Scale in our interconnected businesses are the foundation for our first growth driver, gaining market share. Our integrated investment bank produced $26 billion in revenue on a pro forma basis, our wealth and asset management platforms is among the largest globally, with over $5 trillion in combined assets. Our breadth and depth of product offerings and services have enabled us to gain an increased share of client wallet, as you can see on slide seven. Our segments are working together to deliver holistic client coverage, and are capturing asset and revenue growth. In 2020, international securities generated over $300 million of revenues from transactions through Wealth Management referrals. Wealth Management in turn gained $20 billion of client assets, and Investment Management saw $6 billion of net flows and commitments all from Institutional Securities referrals. Our second growth driver, expanding and deepening our client base, begins with Institutional Securities, on slide eight. Our integrated investment bank benefits from our coordinated and client-focused approach. We built revenues meaningfully to a record $26 billion in 2020. The result of this growth coupled with risk and expense discipline was an operating margin of 35%. Turn to slide nine, which talks about our Wealth Management business. With the acquisition of E TRADE, we are now a top three player in each of the key channels in which investors manage their finances, and each presents unique growth opportunities. With our increased capabilities, we can deepen client relationships and provide more services to millions of households. If we look at E TRADE, on slide 10, you'll see the business had a remarkable year in 2020, setting new records across all material metrics. The unique backdrop dramatically accelerated digital adoption and meaningfully increased levels of engagement. Versus prior records, trading activity more than tripled, and net new assets more than doubled. Deposits reached record levels. Extraordinary growth versus prior records is hard additional evidence that our decision to buy E TRADE was indeed the right one. On slide 11, we illustrate our extraordinary accumulation of net new assets, bringing over $200 billion of assets this year new to our firm, that's 6% of beginning period assets on a pro forma basis. We've invested heavily over the years building our modern wealth strategy, enhancing our technology, and building new businesses. And the addition of E TRADE will only help. This year's net new asset growth was remarkable. And while net new assets tend to fluctuate obviously in any year, and this was likely the high end of what is a likely range, we still expect net new assets to remain well above historic levels. On slide 12, every year for the past decade, our revenues have increased. And with E TRADE, our daily revenues will be significantly higher in the future. In 2020, 65% of trading days saw revenues in excess of $70 million. That was compared to just 2% only four years ago. Let's talk about Investment Management, on slide 13. With our announcement to acquire Eaton Vance, we will create a premier global asset manager with $1.4 trillion in assets under management. Since 2017, Morgan Stanley Investment Management has grown assets under management by over $360 billion, and both MSIM and Eaton Vance have each individually attracted industry-leading long-term net flows over 20%. We're really excited about this transaction and the integration planning is going well. Eaton Vance's businesses remain strong, with increasing assets under management through the end of December. We expect to close the transaction no later than early in the second quarter. Slide 14 shows the power of our wealth and investment management platforms when taken together. On a pro forma basis, we will have over $5 trillion in client assets, creating further revenue opportunities. Our efforts to enhance and build out these businesses have led to strong growth. Pro forma client assets have more double the amount we oversaw in 2014. Consistent with our predominantly advance-driven business model, revenue on these assets, expressed in basis points on the right-hand-side of the page, is materially higher than our three larger competitors. Now, let's turn to slide 15, which includes an update on the acquisition synergies we expect to realize. The cost synergies we previously outlined are definitely on track. And on the funding side with additional liquidity and deposits we have added since the announcement, we expect $100 million more in synergies than originally projected. We also expect to capture significant incremental revenue opportunities through these deals. And there are outlined in little bit detail on the right-hand side of the slide. Now turning to 16, expense discipline is a fundamental tenant of the way we manage Morgan Stanley and has enhanced record pretax profits. And you see our efficiency ratio has come down from 2014 at 79% to just on 70% this past year. And obviously, that has driven the pretax profit expansion. So, our fifth growth driver is highlighted on Page 17. Over the past several years we have consistently improved our returns despite holding material excess capital. We are excited about the opportunity to return that excess to shareholders and announced a $10 billion buyback program for this year. We restarted our share repurchase program this month and plan to increase our dividend when restrictions are lifted by the Federal Reserve. I'll now conclude with our updated strategic objectives which are shown on slide 18. While this year will be a transition year as we observed two major acquisitions, our focus remains on positioning Morgan Stanley to achieve our long-term strategic targets. Our long-term aspiration and frankly our belief is that wealth management would generate a margin over 30%. By 2022 and in that period, we expect to range from 26 to 30% as we continue to work through the E TRADE integration. We also plan to invest in many aspects of our business for growth that will balance this with discipline. In so doing, we keep our long term efficiency ratio below 70% and within the range 69 to 72 over the next two years. Finally, our long-term aspiration for ROTCE is indeed to exceed 17%. How quickly that occurs depends not only on our business performance but also, of course, on distribution. In the meantime, we raised our two-year target to the range of 14 to 16%. As always, these targets are subject to major moves in the economic outlook and any big changes in the political and regulatory environment. However, based on what we see now we fully expect to achieve these as stated. That concludes the strategic part of the conversation. I'll now turn the call over to John who is going to go through the fourth and annual results, and together we look forward to taking your questions. Thank you. Jonathan Pruzan : Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $48 billion in 2020. Records both with and without E TRADE saw a continued momentum into the fourth quarter with revenues of $13.6 billion. Dynamic markets, incredible volatility, and consistent client engagement across all three businesses drove results. Excluding E TRADE integration related expenses, our ROTCE was 18.7% and 15.4% for the fourth quarter and full year respectively, and EPS was $1.92 and $6.58 respectively. We continue to deliver on operating leverage in 2020 led by institutional securities. Non-compensation expenses for the year increased 50% driven by increased volume related expenses and higher credit provisions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing and business and development. Compensation expenses increased 11% on a full-year basis on higher revenues. Revenues for the full-year up 16% resulting in efficiency ratio of 70%, down from 73 in 20 -- now to the businesses, in institutional securities, our business achieved various records throughout the full year. Our revenues were $26 billion, 25% higher than our previous best year. While all regions contributed to the results, growth in Asia was a standout. Revenues were $7 billion in the quarter marking the strongest fourth quarter in more than 10 years. The traditional seasonal slowdown was not experienced and clients remained active up until the week of Christmas. Investment banking revenues were $7.2 billion for the full-year, 26% higher in 2019 driven by record underwriting revenues, particularly equity. In response to the COVID environment, the year saw a rolling opening of markets beginning with debt and rescue financings, next with equity, and very recently leveraged loans and corporate M&A financing. Quarterly results were the strongest in over a decade, generating revenues of $2.3 billion, 46% higher versus the prior year driven by record underwriting and advisory results with each region contributing revenues well above average run rates. Overall, the investment banking pipeline continues to be healthy across products. The pace of M&A announcement has accelerated and client and boardroom dialogue is active. Equity issuance remains robust with a strong backlog from IPOs driven by leadership in healthcare and technology and follow on activity notably in the Americas and Asia. After a record breaking year and investment grade and high yield debt markets, strategic activity should support increased acquisition related financing. In equity sales and trading, we remain number one globally for the seventh consecutive year. Full-year revenues of $9.8 billion increased 22% from the prior period. This represents the strongest annual result in over a decade. This year's market backdrop was unprecedented and the strong performance across products reflected heightened client activity, emits elevated volatility, and a double-digit increase in global market volumes. Fourth quarter revenues of $2.5 billion and full-year results were robust across products and regions with the biggest growth drivers from derivatives and Asia. Fixed income sales and trading revenues were the highest in over a decade increasing 59% to $8.8 billion for the year. Clients were highly engaged in a year marked by higher volumes and volatility, active capital markets and wider bid offer spreads. Fourth quarter revenues of $1.7 billion, increased 31% year-over-year, results in the quarter and full-year were led by credit and foreign exchange, for the full-year Asia showed particular strengths. Across other sales and trading and other revenues, results this quarter improved versus the prior year. The increase primarily reflected lower provisions for loan losses and movements related to deferred cash compensation plan. Our ISG credit portfolio continues to perform well. Over 90% of our ISG loans and commitments are investment grade or secured. ISG loans and lending commitments are up $9 billion this quarter, as we continue to support our clients while our funded ratio on our corporate book has continued to decline, and it's now closed to pre-pandemic levels. After building our allowance for loan losses throughout the first three quarters, it was essentially flat in Q4. ISG provisions were $14 million, while net charge-offs were approximately $40 million primarily related to one commercial real estate loan secured by hotels. While risk remains concentrated in our vulnerable sector portfolio, the portfolio continues to decline. We de-risk this portfolio by close to $2 billion this quarter, and it now represents less than 10% of our portfolio. Over 90% of this portfolio like our entire ISG portfolio is either investment grade or secured. Our reserve coverage remains stable and forbearance for the ISG portfolio continues to decline. Turning to wealth management, on October 2nd, we closed our acquisition of E TRADE. This quarter's results include the combined business financials with virtually all of the E TRADE revenues in transactional and NII making comparisons to prior periods are difficult. So I will focus my comments on Q4 and how we are positioned for 2021. We have also included some new disclosure in the supplement on page seven regarding the combined business. In the quarter revenues were $5.7 billion, excluding integration related expenses of 231 million. The PBT margin was 22.9% and full-year margin was 24.2%. The underlying drivers of this business remain extremely strong, reflecting comprehensive capabilities and strong client engagement and activity. We saw record fee-based flows of $77 billion for the year, and fee-based assets are now $1.5 trillion. We added $18 billion of loans or 22% growth in 2020, and loans are nearly $100 billion. Asset quality continues to be excellent and loans in forbearance are under $400 million down from approximately $2 billion at the end of Q1. Deposits continue to grow and were supplemented by $54 billion from E TRADE and are at $306 billion. The network generated net new assets of $66 billion in the quarter and on a pro forma basis over $200 billion in the year. We remain a destination of choice for advisors and continue to add strong teams and retain our productive advisors. These underlying fundamentals and the realization of synergies position us well for the future. In the quarter, asset management fees were $3 billion, benefiting from higher asset levels and $24 billion of fee-based flows. Transaction volumes remained elevated and revenues were strong even after excluding approximately $350 million of DCP as clients were active across both advisor led and self directed channels. Net interest income was $1.2 billion in the quarter and benefited from the incremental deposits and investment portfolio that came with E TRADE. This is a reasonable exit rate to inform 2021 and includes the purchase accounting adjustments associated with premium amortization which is approximately $50 million a quarter. This year NII will grow due to the realization of our funding synergies and lending growth with limited impact from rates. On funding synergies, we onboarded approximately $4 billion of deposits that were previously swept-off E TRADE's balance sheet in the back half of Q4 and we expect to onboard approximately $20 billion in Q1. As we invest these deposits and shed higher costs wholesale funding, we would expect to realize 80% of our revised higher funding benefits in NII in 2021 with the full impact of these actions selected in Q2. On lending, we continue to see strong lending demand and expect approximately 10% loan growth to benefit NII. Lastly on rates we do not anticipate any change to policy rates in the near-term. However, we'll benefit from the eventual normalization of rates. The acquisition of E TRADE increases our U.S. banks sensitivity to rates and a 100 basis point increase in rates would now contribute an estimated $1.5 billion of additional NII prior to the estimated $1 billion we disclosed in our Q prior to completing the acquisition. We continue to expect $800 million of integration costs over three years with approximately 40% to be realized this year. Following the close of the transaction, we took actions to realize the $400 million of cost synergies we outlined. Our efforts have been aimed at limiting disruption to the customer experience during the integration and will be measured, 2021 we'll be exiting the E TRADE branches consolidating our bank entities and integrating HR and finance systems and we would expect to realize approximately 25% of the cost synergies during the year. Investment Management reported revenues of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter representing the second highest quarterly level in over a decade. For the full-year, revenues were $3.7 billion in line with the prior-period but reflecting a greater contribution for more durable management fee revenues and less from carried interest. Total AUM rose to a record high of $781 billion of which long-term AUM was also a record at $493 billion. Long-term net flows were $8.5 billion in the quarter. Our global equity strategies continue to deliver strong performance and attract positive flows. Total net flows were $25 billion. The global nature of our platform remains an advantage as inflows across regions led to record long-term net flows of $41 billion for the year, and an annual long-term growth rate of 12%. We're excited about the transaction with Eaton Vance across businesses and strategies Eaton Vance's assets under management across excuse me increased by over $65 billion since October. The overall tone of the business is strong and their momentum continues. Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets were $1.1 trillion and standardized RWA's increased to $454 billion, reflecting high levels of client activity and the closing of E TRADE. Our standardized CET-1 ratio was flat to the prior quarter at 17.4%. Our tax rates were 23% and 22.5% for the quarter and full-year respectively. We expect our 2021 tax rate to be in and around 23% which will exhibit some quarter-to-quarter volatility. We're pleased with our strong performance this year. Our franchise is better positioned for growth than we have been in well over a decade. We enter 2021 with strong asset levels, healthy pipeline, engaged institutional and retail clients, and an extremely strong brand. We are confident in our ability to deliver on our objectives. With that, we will now open the line to questions. [26:20] Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to start on the net new asset disclosure that you guys provided here this quarter for the first time, thanks for that, it's very, very helpful. It seems as though the net new asset growth, the organic growth profile in the wealth business accelerated here in 2020. What do you think is driving that? Is that a capturing a greater wallet share of existing clients, is that an expansion of the client base? And it seems as though the metric excludes fees and commissions. Is -- do you have an estimate of what that would mean for a headwind to that growth rate, because I believe most of the other competitors disclose it net of those fees, so just want to try to make a like-for-like? Thank you. James Gorman : Well, let me start, and Jon would talk about some of the disclosure stuff, and as you point out, Brennan, it's the first time I think we have done it in many, many years. And we just thought it was time to reflect the fact that the business has unbelievable growth. I mean we hear about a lot of competitors and a lot of digital players with frankly, in absolute dollars, modest assets. And we're able to bring in $200 billion in a year. Now, part of that is obviously it's pro forma based, part of that is if you look at what E TRADE is doing, they're doing great. Part of it is if you're in net attrition of financial advisors you will be in net attrition of assets on those advisors [indiscernible] for the first time in 20-plus years I've been doing this we're not in net attrition, which is interesting given the IFA channels continue to grow, but they're not growing from us. So we're keeping assets of our advisors. We're gaining assets from new advisors. Through the workplace initiatives, through Solium, and E TRADES we are gaining assets from the conversion and keeping those assets at high rate than we were. So it's a whole variety of things that have been done within the Wealth Management business to look for ways to continue to accelerate our client asset growth at the firm. And it's no single thing. I do think 6%, that's a -- as I've used the expression before, it's a sporty number, but it's a long way from the 2% or the 3%-4% we're operating at. And I think it will be elevated. I don't think we're going to go back to 2%, but maybe 6%, that feels high. And certainly best-in-class to what the Street offers. But maybe Jon has more on the disclosures. Jonathan Pruzan : Yes, so the two critical exposures, the net new assets and then the fee-based flows, and you can see from the footnotes on the net new assets, which is a concept of the assets that we bring into the organization net of the outflows, that does not exclude the fees. You can figure and see the fees on the asset base line in the disclosure, about $10 billion or $11 billion. The fee-based flows do exclude that, as it is a function about how much fee-based assets that we have that are generating a return on those asset base. Hopefully that clarifies the question. And I think for us the net new assets, given the different business models across the different business models it reflects, most people don't have the level of asset-based fees that we do, and we thought it was appropriate to disclose it then. Brennan Hawken : Yes. It's -- no, that's great. That's very helpful clarification. And agreed the growth rate looks robust. I mean you regularly hear about how the traditional wealth management firms are just the providers of share. And certainly a mid single-digit growth rate does not suggest you're providing or ceding share to anybody. So, agreed there. And then for my follow-up, sort of a related question, one of the things that a lot of people and myself included think is one of the more exciting opportunities for growth in the wealth business is the stock plan business where you really just have like a strong position competitively. And you flag a lot of in the deck, which is really helpful. You talk about the retention opportunity of the 15%-plus which is what E TRADE has pointed to historically. Are you -- what's the plan to integrate the stock plan platforms? How long do you think that might take? And is it right, when we think about the opportunity set, you've got these $435 billion of unvested assets, my guess is that's the opportunity set. About how much of that tends to vest per year, is it about a quarter or 30%, and it's right to think about that as evergreen, right, like invest and then they're replaced with new awards in subsequent year? Sorry about the multipart question, but I think it's an important one. Thank you. Jonathan Pruzan : That's okay. So, we have integrated the sales team. We're going to market through our corporate clients with a consolidated sales effort. As you would expect, we're going to be very mindful of the integration of these platforms. I would highlight that they were certainly different emphasis in terms of big companies, small companies, private companies, and we will converge those platforms over time and upgrade them both to sort of bring the best of both of those platforms together. You're right, the existing opportunity is the $435 billion of unvested assets, and roughly five million participants. Our expectation is we will continue to grow the number of corporate relationships we have, and therefore the number of participants. And we've seen good closure rates since announcing both the Solium transaction and the E TRADE transaction, so we feel very good about the momentum of the number of new corporate relationships we have in that channel. And then lastly, on the $435 billion, give or take 25% or 30% of that vest each year, I think that's a pretax number, so clearly there's tax impacting that. But as you say, our expectation is that number will continue to grow as we bring on more and more corporate relationships. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Mike Mayo : Hi. Well, you've clearly gained share this quarter of the year in capital markets and trading. Aside from your gaining share, what is your outlook for the industry wallet? As you know, it shrunk in trading for a decade, and now it may or may not have turned more permanently. So, some banks say we're planning for 2019 levels for trading, some think it can maintain this pace, some say it's in-between. Kind of where do you fall out, and why, what do you see as the structural changes? James Gorman : Mike, it's very difficult to say. I mean just look at what we've been through in the last 12 months, and look at activity in the first quarter versus the second quarter, and then where do you finish. So, clearly, there is a lot of activity in the market. There is enormous fiscal stimulus. Our rates remain very low. I think the global economies are recovering. And I think the vaccine; if we get in the U.S. to a million doses a day for the next 150 days would be spectacular. So, there are a lot of industries that are continuing to look at share issuance, new IPOs coming, recapitalizations of different kinds, raising debt. So there's a lot of market activity I think in the reasonable near-term. Whether it is at the level of 2020, I mean you'd have to bet against that just on pure odds, less than 50%, I think. But who knows, I mean the year has started off strong. And we count them one day at a time. And the year has started off strong, the markets are active, the economies are recovering globally, new administration has come in. It looks like we had a peaceful transition hopefully today. So, I am quite optimistic about it. I can't put a pin to say exactly where we're going to end up, but we're clearly gaining share. Our fixed income franchise has well recovered from the 2015 restructuring and 2012 lows. Our equities bounced and retain their number one spot again in what has been a growing equity fee pool. And clearly, that the banking revenue is about $2 billion for the quarter, there is a lot of M&A activity and a lot of underwriting activity. So, I'm pretty optimistic. I mean I can't put an exact number on it, but I certainly don't feel like we're going to make a major back-step at all here. Mike Mayo : On that last comment, in terms of backlogs, are they up quarter-over-quarter, near record, down? Jonathan Pruzan : Yes, generally, I think from my comments, Mike, we describe them as healthy across all products and all regions, with IPOs as a standout. As I said, M&A activity dialogues very active, pipeline very healthy. So, as James said, a very constructive start to the year with very healthy pipeline. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Your line is now open. Christian Bolu : Thank you, and good morning, James and Jon. Maybe back on Wealth Management organic growth, and again echo the earlier comments. Really appreciate the new information. But for James, you seem to be really playing down the 6% this year as not sustainable. So I guess can you just maybe help us understand what exactly was elevated in 2020, was just overall industry was elevated, was there something more specific to Morgan Stanley like higher recruiting? I'm just trying to understand why you think it was elevated. And then maybe more importantly, just looking forward, give us a sense of what you think the business can do sustainably, as sort of range for organic growth that you would expect for the business. Thank you. James Gorman : Christian, you probably know me well enough by now to know I'm not going to project a trend line based upon one point of data. Listen, we have had a decade of been growing net new assets around 2%-3% and then 3%-4%. Clearly E TRADE has fast-growing asset growth capability, that adds enormously. I think net positive financial advisor, our actual numbers of financial advisors went up this quarter, I think for the first time for years. So, I just trend to the conservative until I see more data. And do I think it's going to fall back to 2%, not at all. But if we could lock in 6% for the next 10 years, and we'd be bringing -- we're bringing $200 billion a year. I read about a lot of these online players that have got $20 billion in total. And we're brining in $20 billion every five weeks, so we're effectively creating these companies every five weeks. Now, if it's going to be 4.5%, 5.5%, I don't know. I just -- my instinct is 6% in $4 trillion is a lot of assets to bring in. And I think it's doable. I'm not saying it's not doable. But I'm not projecting that. And I wouldn't want to guide you to that. On the other hand, I don't think we're going back to where we -- I think we've got a different kind of company. The reason that the title of this presentation is called Morgan Stanley, an Inflection Point, the Next Decade of Growth is if there's one message I would like people to take away from it is we're in the growth phase of this company for the next decade. We've been in, as I said, from the crisis forward, sort of fragility, then healing, then stability. And we are unambiguously in a growth phase. We have the capital to invest in our business, we're gaining share across our businesses, we've got scale in the key businesses. We've invested in a lot of technology improvements to the businesses to increase their efficiency. And I believe we're in a growth phase in this company, and one of those indicators to growth will be very strong net new asset growth. Christian Bolu : Fair enough. Maybe switching over to capital, with the stock now trading well above book value, how are you thinking about prioritizing buyback versus dividends? I think in the past you have spoken to an aspirational target of paying out all of wealth and asset management earnings as a dividend. So maybe just some updated thoughts around how you're thinking about that prospect, and again, buyback versus dividend conversation here? James Gorman : Well, the third leg to that conversation, very importantly, is investing in the business. If we're going to grow, let's pretend we're growing, I don't know, net earnings of $10 billion, and we're paying out dividends at the moment of about $2.5 billion. So if we were doing a buyback this year of $10 billion we're only eating into our buffer $2.5 billion a year, we're not going to chip away at much for 17.4% and I think the threshold is 13.2%. I'm looking at Jon. Jonathan Pruzan : Yes. James Gorman : 13.2%. Let's assume we carry, what, a 50-100 basis point buffer on our SCB, so let's assume we want to run at 14.2%, we're at 17.4%. We've clearly got some room to move, obviously, we've got the Eaton Vance move coming in, which affects those numbers about 100 basis points. So, as I think about it, I've described this before, half our company asset sort of yield component to it, very stable revenues and earnings, and we could clearly move the dividend higher and we'll, once the regulators permit that we have, clearly we have the capacity. On the book value, yes, I would have preferred to be buying stocks last year when we were at $27. Unfortunately, we couldn't do that, but I'm not troubled by buying a little of book value. And I don't think we can be 2Q we have 1.8 billion-1.9 billion shares outstanding, obviously through the issuance from the deal. So, I'd like to get us back to 1.5 billion type range over the next few years and we've got the capital, on things we can invest, $10 billion, $15 billion a year in the business and generate the kinds of returns, we expect to generate. So it's a mix of all three. But clearly, we like to see more action on the dividend. Clearly, we're going to be aggressively buying back and consistently and clearly we have capacity to increase our investment in the core businesses. Christian Bolu : Great, high-class problem. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Your line is muted. Steven Chubak : Sorry, can you hear me? My apologies for that. I just want to start-off with a question on funding NII. I appreciate the disclosure on funding optimization and the drivers of some of the improved synergies from the initial guidance. I'm curious how much room there is to cut deposit costs further, it looks like your wealth management deposit costs are 24 bps, it's just running well above peers. And just a clarifying question regarding the NII guidance, is the growth you're contemplating in '21? Is that versus the 4Q '20 base, which reflects the full impact of the deal? Or was that a guide versus full-year 2020? Jonathan Pruzan : I'll do the first, last question first, which is that it was based on the fourth quarter, so sort of using a fourth quarter annualized as the right base to be thinking about again, we did have the full impact of both the transaction for the full quarter as well as the amortization of the premium from the investment portfolio. You're right; our deposit costs were 24 basis points which were down 14 basis points for the quarter. We also saw an improvement as you know, BDP or what we call our sweep deposits, obviously at a lower rate, basically a one basis points relative to our wholesale, that costs about 100 basis points. So part of the funding synergies is really coming from replacing those wholesale funding, CDs and other wholesale funding with the off balance sheet deposits that we're going to bring back on balance sheet. So we started the quarter, I think about 65% of our funding and the deposits were sweep. We're now at 75%, we would expect about $15 billion to $20 billion of CD roll-off. That's obviously based on the maturities. So we continue to think that we can drive our average deposit costs lower as we continue to replace the wholesale with the incremental deposits from E TRADE. Steven Chubak : No, that's great. And just for my follow-up, big picture question, James, if you'll indulge me, I was hoping you could help us reconcile versus your prior target of 15% to 17%. What rate market and capital assumptions are underpinning your 17% plus ambition, and I guess if we started to think about the inflection and growth that you cited and maybe even some tailwinds from normalization, just higher rates, which would be more than 100 basis point benefit, greater realization of revenue synergy opportunities, further progress on the SCB, the direction of travel, there's been quite favorable. The 17% plus longer-term still feels somewhat conservative. I'm wondering from your perspective, do you see even in upper teens are 20% plus ROTCE as a reasonable long-term ambition just given the significant transformation that's underway. James Gorman : You're beginning to replace Mike Mayo's. He usually asks me that. What about the plus? What's wrong with plus? Plus means more. Steven Chubak : You drive a truck with that range. James Gorman : Yes, listen, I wouldn't put -- I wouldn't try and model too much science into this. This is an expression of our aspiration, and as I said also happens to be out belief. It's not just Disney Land. We believe we will deliver these numbers, and for some of the reasons you listed, rates being one of them, obviously has a huge impact on this firm, but look at where we finished last year and what our numbers were, these obviously become very plausible, whether it should be 17 plus, 18 plus, 19 plus. We said to you three years ago, our aspiration was to have a 17 plus ROTCE, you know, we are also planning. So I'm very comfortable with these numbers. If we could achieve this, then obviously the stock should be trading much higher than it is today. And embedded in it, we do some math, we stopped with that budget, we stopped with that operating performance in 2018, 2019, 2020 look at our budget projections. We do sensitivities around revenues. We understand what our comp and non-comp look like over the next couple of years, whether we have major litigation exposures or not, the integration costs that have got to work through, and then the synergies of the various businesses. And then we of course look at the capital question, which I discussed earlier I think with Christian on buyback dividend or reinvestment in the business, and what our RWA growth is going to be in ISG and how that affects the CT1, and you put all of that in a big washing machine and out spits a number with a plus on it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Glenn Schorr : Thanks very much. James, I wonder if we could look at slide 14 and talk to something that comes up a bunch. You show your 5.4 trillion pro forma. If you look at that fee rate, there is only one other peer on that top 10 that has a fee rate equal or better than yours. And I think it's a good thing, but this comes up plenty. So I'd love to hear you talk about it. And the sustainability of that fee rate, I don't see price pressure in the wealth management business, but people ask on it all the time. Just curious to get your thought process over the coming years and what is kind of embedded in those, your immediate and long-term targets implicitly with that? Thanks. James Gorman : I don't think you're going to see price compression of any significance across the wealth/res management platforms. It's really functioning a blend of asset types. So, for example, the wealthy of the clients, if you have clients with a $100 million dollars, they're not paying 58 basis points, they're probably paying I don't know, closer to 10 basis points or something, a client with a million dollars is being close at a $100 basis points. So it depends a little bit on the business mix as to what revenue you generate on those assets. Obviously, some of the E TRADE active trading clients have got high velocity on them. They're going to have higher basis point numbers and a very passive position in restricted stock. So a little bit of that is you've got to sort of peel away what is going on under the numbers, but you brought a question, do I see price compression across wealth management? No, I don't. In fact, we will probably generate more revenue as we build up the banking, lending and deposit product. On the asset management side I mean, listen if you driving performance in the active side, you can generate, you can hold your fees as they are. The underperformers lose their assets quickly when they lose their fees. So I'm not terribly bothered about, and if you knew the names of the three above it, you'll probably get some, there is a reason, they are more index-oriented, it's a different business model. Now we generate a higher revenue per dollar of assets, but we pay a higher revenue comp structure for Solium assets, but it's not exactly 30, 40, 50 basis point win as you know obviously. Glenn Schorr : Understood. Why don't we hear your words? Thanks. And then maybe if we could just bridge the gap, I think I know the answer to this too, but this was a pretty strong environment, you consolidated each -- the adjusted margin and wealth management of 24% of the medium term target - two year target at 26 to 30. How do we get inside the range without the help of rates, because the fed theoretically is on hold for a few years? James Gorman : Yes, the business is growing. We had some additional expenses this year. For example, we made more contributions to our role, philanthropic and charitable efforts given what is going on with COVID, that cost is distributed across the businesses. We paid a one-time bonus to all employees owning less than I think $150,000 who don't receive bonuses, given the headcount and wealth management that disproportionately picks up business. So there is always a few things going on that, a point of margin is worth about $45 million a quarter I think if I am doing my maths right, $18 billion, 180 million, so something like that. So it's not small numbers can move it around a 0.02, but I think with increased growth, increased efficiency, better conversion of the assets more as suppose in generating this average 58 basis points is how you bounce between the sort of 20 -- what did we say 24 to 30 range -- 26 to 30. Depending on the environment, I mean, we've started the strong that probably helps the point of that held up, there you go. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Devin Ryan : Thanks, good morning. First question just want to come back to some of the questions on organic growth and I liked the slide nine that shows $8 trillion in assets held away, essentially making the point that you already have the customer reach. And so I'm just trying to think about whether you view kind of all of that is potential wallet that you can go after or set another way. Are there any products that maybe you don't line up with $8 trillion, and then as the firm becomes more connected through technology, which I think you guys have done a great job over the past couple of years? How do you think about your strategies to connect with greater percentage of that you call it $8 trillion. I know every business has a little bit of a different, call it sales process, but are there new strategies or even financial incentives that you can think about to really accelerate the penetration into that? Jonathan Pruzan : Sure. I'll give that a crack and we're not naive. We don't expect to have a 100% of the wallet of all of our clients. So clearly, we don't expect them to bring in all 8 trillion over time, but there is significant overlap as you note in these channels and in these wealth figures. We continue as you saw through the net new assets as James mentioned, a lot of that was from existing customers consolidating their assets. A lot of that is being driven by the technology that we've made and the investments that we've made in the platform that help our advisors advise their clients. And we've seen people bring in more assets. So I think if you think about the opportunity set, I think we tried to line it up pretty well through the different channels on the workplace. I think it's really around retaining cash and retaining vested assets. And then over time growing the relationships, self-directed at a minimum, we've seen people leaving the E TRADE platform as their needs got more sophisticated and they needed advice. We're clearly going to capture that top part of the funnel with the FA led model that we have. So again, a real opportunity and I liked the way you described it, just look at the numbers 2.5 million households, almost 5 million participants in 6.7 million households, the breadth and reach of the platform is quite large and there is some overlap there, but it's still over 10 million clients that we can provide incremental services or bring in more assets from. In terms of good activity, as you can imagine, we are collecting and analyzing data and working with our clients to try to figure out incremental needs and services and products that they need with the E TRADE acquisition we bring on, incremental digital capabilities, and as you can imagine this year, we're spending the year trying to figure out and piloting ways that we can work better and more efficiently with our clients. We're going to pilot around lead generation, we've defined the advisor group who is going to work with new clients, got scoring systems, we've got artificial intelligence, trying to help predict what people are going to want and need, and next best action. So it's really a culmination of all the investments that we made, plus the digital from wealth and we're going to use this year to try to get a very good understanding of our client base with these pilots and how we can provide incremental services going forward. Devin Ryan : Okay, terrific. Thanks, Jon. Just a follow-up here just on the core expense structure and trying to think about some of the benefits of 2020 with the pandemic that were deflationary, it would seem that some of those benefits roll-off. There's some inflationary aspects in the 2021, kind of in a core basis. But longer-term, obviously I think we've learned a lot about the businesses through the past 12 months and opportunities potentially to derive some longer-term savings, or maybe core deflation in the expense structure. So I'm just, love to get some thoughts around how you guys are thinking about areas or opportunities to maybe drive more expense out of the system based on what you've learned over the last 12 months? Jonathan Pruzan : Yes, I would say we're still learning; crisis is not over. We clearly are hopeful around the rollout of the vaccine. I think there are going to be some takeaways around some of the digital client experiences that we've been able to do the work from home that we've been able to do, but I think it's little early to start making those decisions. Let's get through the crisis first. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Michael Carrier : Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. The strategic update and growth outlook are always helpful, just on the efficiency ratio, given the 70% level in '20 and realized strong revenues in this environment, but E TRADE and Eaton Vance operating at a better ratio, I think it's longer-term Wealth Management margin improving maybe 600 basis points, just what drives the conservative outlook like, are there areas that you want to assess significantly, either to continue to drive the growth, or there is potential improvement on that 70%? James Gorman : Listen, I think we said under 70%, after two years. So, I don't think that's conservative. We were -- Mike, we're at 79%, just a few years ago. And when I started, we were much higher. So the long-term position is we'll run this place with a 30% margin plus, what happens in the next two years with the bounce around the markets, I don't know, maybe we're too conservative in the short run, but it doesn't change our behavior, I guess is what I would tell you, we are very determined right, this company for growth and for efficiency and for return. So it's been unambiguous for a decade now. So it doesn't change our behavior at all. It's just what do we think as reasonable people you should expect at a minimum to achieve in this time period. And that's what we try and put in the two-year period, the longer-term we're much more aggressive, but it was relative two years this year, as I said, if you annualize the way this year started up we'll do better than the efficiency rate. Michael Carrier : Yes, that makes sense. Jon, just one clarification on the wealth management, you gave a lot of numbers on the outlook just given the E TRADE deal, I just wanted to clarify on the funding benefit, did you say 80% in '21 and most of that by 2Q. And then same thing on the expense synergy, I heard a 25% and a 40%. So I just wanted to make sure I had the right number in terms of what you're recognizing in '21? Thanks. Jonathan Pruzan : I think all those numbers that you gave are correct. The funding synergies are really from this transition from the off balance sheet, the on balance sheet and the run-off of the wholesale deposits. So again, that use more towards the back half in that, 80% that's when you get into the second quarter, you'll be using a quarter number, not a full-year benefit number, and then 25% on costs and approximately 40% on the integration costs. Also, yes, those are the right numbers. Michael Carrier : Got it, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas. Your line is now open. If your line is muted, please unmute. Jeremy Sigee : Sorry, apologies for that. I thought the comments on net interest income outlook and wealth management were very helpful. And I just wondered if I could get you to talk in a similar way about the asset management fees and the transaction revenues in wealth management because versus my estimates, I thought asset management was a bit below maybe that's a lag with the rising AUM, but obviously transaction revenues were very strong. So, could you talk about those two revenue drivers within wealth management, please? Jonathan Pruzan : Sure. On the assessment management fees line, obviously the exit rate, as you know we get the benefit now for the full year of the $1.5 trillion in fee-based assets have average effect and exit effect in terms of 2021. So now, at $1.5 trillion asset, we also have the benefit of the net new assets that we bring in over 2021. Though on an average basis, we would expect continued growth obviously in that line. We had over 10% year-over-year in that asset management fees. And then on transactional, it's really going to around client engagement and client activity levels. Fourth quarter, we benefited from elevated transactional. I did say that that was helped by the DCP number which presumably may or may not repeat next year. But that the margin on that revenue, as we have talked about in the past, is virtually zero. And so, transactional generally has been declining. We now have the E TRADE platform inside Morgan Stanley, so the commissions based on their options trading as well as some of the flow dynamics will aid that number. So, it will be at a new level. But generally that's going to be driven by volume-related activity. And we'll have to see how it plays out recognizing the first 11 days of have been pretty good. Jeremy Sigee : Thank you. And just to follow up on the acquisition expenses. You sort of break out the amounts of acquisition related expenses in here, I just wondered if you could talk to us about the split between sort of restructuring and also ratio of intangibles? You said you are going to be amortizing the intangibles. I just wondered about the amounts of that and where we see it. Jonathan Pruzan : Sure. Well, I'll just give you a few. So -- again, we issued $11 billion of equity or about $230 million shares, generated $7.5 billion of goodwill and intangibles. You'll see that in the first couple of pages of the supplement. Of that goodwill and intangibles, about $3 billion is going to be amortized at a rough rate of about 15 years, so about $200 million. And that would be allocated in the non-comps in the wealth segment. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open. Jim Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe we could talk a little bit the momentum at E TRADE. I just want to confirm the numbers. If I looked at their second quarter sort of retail client base is around $5.8 million self-directed clients. And then I think in December, the fourth quarter was up to $6.7 million. Are those apples to apples? And if so, that implies quite a bit of net new account growth of close to 900,000. That's pretty good momentum. And just maybe you could discuss what's driving that and how you feel about that going forward? Jonathan Pruzan : Yes. I mean I think we tried to lay that out. As I said on page seven, you can see what pre closing -- so, the September 30 number shows the self-directed assets within Morgan Stanley before the deal closed. So, yes, the growth has really been in the E TRADE channel. Your number of about 900,000 is accurate. Again I think from our disclosure going forward, we had to conform sort of definitions and whatnot, but they have had real strong growth with new clients given the activity level this year. It's a number you'll be able to track whether the self-directed channel is growing through that number going forward. I don't think we're going to be explicitly disclosing net new clients within the self-directed channel as we try to integrate and bring these two businesses together. Jim Mitchell : Right, I imagine that's better growth than anticipated. Does that give you even more confidence in the revenue synergies from E TRADE? Jonathan Pruzan : Yes. James Gorman : Yes and yes. Jim Mitchell : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator *: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Today's presentation will refer to Morgan Stanley's earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman. James Gorman : Hi, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The first quarter of 2021 was a significant record for the firm and for many of our businesses. It was marked by some truly extraordinary highs; numerous performance records; the closing of the Eaton Vance deal, our second strategic transaction in the last year; and one very complex event relating to the collapse of the hedge fund, Archegos. In summary, we generated record revenues of $15.7 billion and an ROTCE of 21.4%. The higher revenues reveal the operating leverage in our business and the quarter's efficiency ratio was 66%. Wealth Management generated revenues of approximately $6 billion. Net new assets were $105 billion, which is easily our best ever quarterly flows and concrete evidence of the growth trajectory of this business. These flows represented annualized increase of over 10% of beginning period assets. Pre-tax margin was 27.9%. This margin should only improve in future years, and we expect will exceed 30% as rates tick up. Daily trades reached a new record, with heightened levels of retail client engagement. E TRADE, and particularly the strength of the self-directed channel, has exceeded our expectations. In addition, assets continue to migrate towards advice. Fee-based flows for the quarter were a record $37 billion. We're adding new clients at a record pace, creating more opportunities to consolidate wealth held away and provide advisory services. Our workplace business is adding corporate plans, and as a result, the number of participants we reached increased to 5.1 million. Institutional securities revenues of $8.6 billion were also a record as clients remain highly engaged. Fixed income had the strongest first quarter of the last decade, and has consistently gained share in recent years. Investment banking revenues reached a record, driven by record equity underwriting. And our Equities division also had its best quarter in over a decade. Turning to Investment Management. On March 1, we closed our acquisition of Eaton Vance, bringing together two high-performing assets managers. Our teams at both Eaton Vance and Morgan Stanley executed the close ahead of schedule while prioritizing client service. The momentum Eaton Vance and MSIM demonstrated between announcement and close only strengthened our conviction of this combination. Since we announced the transaction in the beginning of October, pro forma assets grew by nearly $200 billion, and pro forma net flows were approximately $100 billion. In the first quarter, pro forma net flows were $53 billion, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 16%. Our industry-leading organic growth signals that clients are very supportive of the combination, and increasingly recognized the highly differentiated value offering solutions that we offer across the global platform. Investment Management now has assets under management of $1.4 trillion, and is very well positioned in key secular growth segments. Let me discuss the loss we incurred navigating the collapse of Archegos. First, we liquidated some very large single stock positions through a series of block sales, culminating on Sunday night, March 28. That resulted in a net loss of $644 million, which represents the amount the client owed us under the transactions that failed to pay us. Subsequently, we made a management decision to completely derisk the remaining smaller long and short positions, which are not especially problematic, might have been. We decided we would be out of the risk as rapidly as possible, and in so doing incurred an incremental loss of $267 million. I regard that decision as necessary and money well spent. The results are all reflected in Q1. I'm very pleased with how the institution came together and responded to this very complex situation. Let me close with an early readout from our acquisitions of E TRADE and Eaton Vance. The performance of both businesses is significantly exceeding our expectations. And as importantly, the integration so far is proceeding without major incident. These acquisitions, when combined with our existing wealth and investment management businesses, drove our client assets to $5.7 trillion, of which approximately $150 billion represented net new client assets to the firm this quarter. We are more convinced than ever that both deals help position Morgan Stanley for growth in the years ahead. I'll now turn it over to Jon to discuss the quarter in detail, and together we'll take your questions. Jonathan Pruzan : Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced record revenues of $15.7 billion in the first quarter. Across businesses and regions, performance was incredibly strong as clients remained highly engaged and markets were constructive. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $2.22, our ROTCE was 21.4%, and our efficiency ratio was 66%. First, some housekeeping. To improve the transparency and comparability of our external financial reporting, we made several enhancements to our disclosures this quarter. You can find more details and three years' restated data on pages 12 and 13 of the supplement. The more significant items are as follows. For the firm, the provision for credit losses for HFI loans and lending commitments is now presented as a separate line in the income statement versus being in other revenues and expenses. In Institutional Securities, sales and trading net revenue have been reclassified into equity and fixed income, which now includes certain investments and other revenues that are directly attributable to those businesses. And other revenues, notably contained corporate loans and lending commitments and related hedges, as well as the impact of deferred compensation plans. And in Investment Management, following the closing of the Eaton Vance transaction, we have simplified reporting by breaking revenues into two lines. Asset Management has been renamed Asset Management and Related Fees, although the historical numbers remain the same. And we have combined the remaining revenue categories under a new line named, Performance-Based Income and Other, notably carried interest. We have also updated our AUM disclosures, Alternatives and Other has been updated to Alternatives and Solutions, to reflect the addition of most of the Parametric AUM, excluding Parametric's portfolio services for institutional investors that have been included in a new line called Liquidity and Overlay Services. Now to the businesses. The momentum in Institutional Securities witnessed through the back-half of 2020 continued as clients remained high engaged. Several performance records were set as revenues were broad-based and balanced across businesses and regions. Revenues were $8.6 billion, representing a record and a 66% increase compared to the same period last year. The integrated investment bank continues to serve clients across the complex. Regionally, Asia remained a standout, building on the four best quarters of the last decade, in 2020. The first quarter of this year set a new record. Europe's performance was solid across investment banking and fixed income and was the strongest in over a decade. Investment banking generated revenues of $2.6 billion, more than doubling the prior year, driven by record underwriting results. Advisory revenues were $480 million, reflective of higher completed M&A industry volumes versus the prior year. Equity underwriting continues to be exceptionally active. Record revenues of $1.5 billion reflect its strength across products and sectors. IPO activity was extremely strong, with blocks, follow-ons, and convertibles also notable. Fixed income underwriting revenues, of $631 million, were the second highest only to the second quarter of last year, as companies continue to take advantage of the attractive borrowing environment. We saw strong activity across non-investment grade financing spread across sponsors and corporate issuers. Investment Banking pipelines remain healthy across products. Strategic dialogues are active. Equity markets should support issuance, and conditions remain favorable for borrowers. And we are seeing a broadening across sectors beyond technology and healthcare. Equity revenues reached $2.9 billion, the strongest in a decade, as global equity market volumes remained elevated. Derivative results were the best in the decade, reflecting heightened client activity and a constructive trading market environment. Both cash and Prime Brokerage revenues declined versus the same period last year. Revenues associated with higher volumes and higher Prime Brokerage balances respectively were offset by the losses James discussed. Fixed income revenues of $3 billion was the highest for our first quarter in a decade. Performance was broad based across products. The debate around the speed and strength of the global recovery, the passage of U.S. fiscal stimulus, and the movement in passive rate supported client activity. Micro performance continues to be strong. A meaningful increase versus the prior year was driven by securitized products and municipals. Macro results were robust that were reflected a decline from the very strong prior year as bid-ask spread were more stable this period. And commodities also had solid results. Other revenues of $323 million improved meaningful versus the prior year. The increase primarily reflects gains related to deferred cash-based compensation plans compared to losses in the prior year and lower mark-to-mark losses on corporate loans and related hedges. Turning to ISG lending, our credit portfolio continues to perform well. Improved confidence in the economic outlook and pay downs on corporate relationship loans particularly non-invest grade resulted in a release of $93 million. Net charge-offs in the quarter were $10 million. And our allowance for credit losses on ISG and lending commitments now stands at $1 billion. Total ISG loans were up $2.5 billion while lending commitments increased by approximately $5 billion relative to 4Q as we continue to support our clients. Our vulnerable sector portfolio continues to represent less than 10% of the overall ISG loans in lending commitment. We saw some velocity in the book with new commitments for investment grade clients that were largely offset by pay downs. Approximately 90% of this portfolio like our entire ISG portfolio is either investment grade or secured. And lastly, forbearance for the ISG portfolio continues to decline and now stands at approximately $300 million. Turning to wealth management, given the timing of the close of the E TRADE acquisition, I will make comparisons to the prior quarter which will serve as a more relevant benchmark than prior year. Revenues were $6 billion with strength in every area. Excluding the impact of DCP, which declined by approximately $300 million versus the prior quarter revenue increased 11%. Integration related expenses were $64 million. And excluding these cost, pre-tax profit increased 28% to a record $1.7 billion. And the PBT margin was 27.9%. The underlying growth drivers in this business remained extremely strong. Net new asset growth was $105 billion driven by net new clients, asset consolidation from existing clients, and stock plan retention. Fee-based flows were a record $37 billion and self-directed channel net new households grew by a record $500,000 or 7%. Financial advisors also recognized the value of our platform demonstrated in continued strength in net recruiting and retention which also benefited M&A. Elevated client activity across both advisor-led and self-directed channels drove strong transactional revenues. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues increased 19%. Client engagement in the market was high putting more cash into equities in the quarter. Self-directed engagement was particularly robust reflecting record net buying activity. Daily average trades on the E TRADE platform reached record highs of $1.6 million, almost 50% higher than the fourth quarter record of $1.1 million. Importantly, revenue related to the E TRADE platform transactional activity is highly accretive to the PBT margin. Asset management revenues were $3.2 billion, up 7% sequentially benefiting from higher asset levels and record fee-based flows. Fee-based assets are now $1.6 trillion and have grown over $400 billion from last year, greater than the cumulative growth of the prior six years and revenues were up nearly 20% from the prior year. Loan growth remains extremely robust with balances reaching $105 billion. Demand across products with particular strength in securities based lending led the quarterly balance sheet of $7 billion, north of the 10% full-year guidance we gave earlier this year. Continued use of data analytics to understand customer needs is contributing to the strong growth. Net interest income was $1.4 billion including prepayment amortization which turned positive, and was approximately $100 million. Excluding prepay, NII was up 6%, and in line with our prior guidance. The increase reflected the realization of funding synergies, driven by the onboarding of $20 billion of deposits that were previously swept off E TRADE's balance sheet, rose in bank lending balances, and increased margin lending in the self-directed channel. We have now completed the onboarding of approximately $25 billion of deposits since we closed the E TRADE transaction, and we remain on pace to realize approximately $200 million in NII funding benefits in 2021. We would also expect to runoff additional $16 billion of wholesale deposits through the remainder of the year. We expect that NII will continue to build on the full impact of the onboarded deposits and continued growth in lending. We're even more excited about E TRADE today then when we announced the deal as momentum on E TRADE platform is robust. Additionally, we are beginning to see early successes from the combination. The business continues to benefit from increased client engagement across channels as evidenced by this quarter's NII. And while we expect these flows will be lumpy and should be looked at over the course of the year, rather than individual quarters, we are encouraged by the strong start. We continue to prioritize client experiences as we progress for their integration. Rest of 2021 will be focused on analyzing the comprehensive datasets, which covered advisor-led and self-directed clients to help better understand investment behaviors and needs and refining the tools required to connect financial advisors to service those needs. Over time, we expect to learn from these insights to effectively serve clients across their entire wealth journey. Workplace will serve as an important growth engine going forward, and we are building on the investments we have made to date. Our workplace offering is resonating with corporate clients. We are adding new B2B clients and participants at a record pace, and our current pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. Equity plan wins increased by approximately 70% versus 1Q last year, and this led to the addition of 75,000 participants to the Morgan Stanley at work platform. The number of participants now stands at $5.1 million. We are also focused on ensuring that each workplace participant has a companion brokerage account to capture vested award proceeds. Today, approximately 50% have one, and we expect 90% of participants will have a companion account within 18 months. This will further enhance our ability to capture workplace flows. On the expense side, we're on track to realize a $100 million of cost synergies in 2021, and have made progress in the first quarter towards this end. On a run rate basis, we expect to achieve 35% to 40% of the targeted $400 million expense synergies by the end of the year. Moving to investment management, on March 1, we closed the acquisition of Eaton Vance. We issued 69 million shares and $5 billion of common equity. We created approximately $9 billion of goodwill and intangibles, including $4 billion of intangibles, of which, half will amortize over approximately 15 years. Our CET1 ratio is impacted by approximately 80 basis points. This quarter's results include one month of the buying businesses, financial, so comparisons to prior periods are difficult. I will focus mainly on the quarter and our positioning moving forward. We're pleased that the businesses retain their strong momentum from announcements closed, and total AUM now stands at $1.4 trillion, an increase of 40% or $400 billion on a pro forma basis versus the prior year. Upon close, Eaton Vance added approximately $590 billion to our total AUM. The underlying fundamentals of this business remain extremely strong. Positive net flow momentum continued across both businesses. Total net flows on a pro forma basis were $53 billion for the full quarter. Long-term pro forma net flows of $22 billion were broad-based across products and region. We saw a particular strength in MSM global equity strategies, which continue to attract robust flows following strong investment performance. Our metric customized portfolios continued very strong organic growth in the alternative and solutions line. We believe customization is a long-term secular trend, and parametrics is the market leader in this space. Eaton Vance is leading a floating rate loan business, recovered to strong positive flows, and Calvert saw strong growth as ESG investing accelerates. In the quarter, revenues were $1.3 billion. Consistent with strong growth in AUM, the contribution from more durable management fee revenue has meaningful increase, and asset management and related fees were $1.1 billion with just one month of Eaton Vance contribution. Performance-based income and other revenues were $211 million in the quarter. We saw broad-based gains across our alternative funds. The increase versus the prior year was primarily driven by gains in our real estate funds, which continued their recovery from 1Q '20. Total expenses were $944 million, of which integration-related expenses were negligible. Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets increased to $1.2 trillion, reflecting higher client activity levels, and the addition of Eaton Vance. Standardized RWAs were flat to the prior quarter, at $454 billion. And our standardized CET1 ratio declined from the prior quarter, to 16.8. Our tax rate was 22% for the quarter, and we continue to expect our full-year 2021 tax rate will be approximately 23%. We are pleased with our results in the first quarter, as our three world-class businesses of scale delivered exceptional performance and growth. Pipelines are healthy, institutional and retail client engagement is strong, and our global positions have improved. With the successful closing of the Eaton Vance deal, we continue to drive our business model towards more durable, more recurring, and less capital intensive businesses. While it's very early in the integration, the combination of breadth and depth of product offerings and services within our large customer base has led to approximately $150 billion of net new client assets to the franchise. And our unique business model is well-positioned for growth through a variety of market backdrops. With that, we will now open the line to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to ask maybe first on Wealth Management. The net new asset growth rate implying double-digit organic is really impressive, not something that narrative around wirehouses, tailing to be able to grow really jives with. So, I'm curious, I know we've seen these trends accelerate in Morgan Stanley before over a year now. But how much of this remarkable quarter was attributable to E TRADE versus full-service Wealth Management at Morgan Stanly? And how should we think about a sustainable organic net new asset growth going forward? James Gorman : Well, Brennan, let me have a go at that. I mean historically, the growth rate, as you probably know in the full-service, as you call it, wirehouses has been, I don\u2019t know, 0% to 2% over the last 15 years, with loss of financial advisors, some loss of assets into the RAA channel, and clearly loss to some of the direct distributors, and generally just not having in place significant growth plans. And I think this quarter, and I'll talk about the absolute levels in a minute. But this quarter is reflective of a very different view of that Wealth Management business. Number one, we needed to have a compelling direct channel. We have that through E TRADE. Number two, we needed to have a compelling workplace platform, we have that through Solium and E TRADE. Number three, we needed to have net positive FA growth in terms of recruiting, not in just numbers of bodies, but actual people who are brining in assets, and we're doing that. And number four, you need a compelling platform of ideas which link to our institutional business and the quality research and product. You're just operating at a different level. And so, I think it's a culmination actually of a lot of things, E TRADE is clearly a factor in it, but it's by no means the only factor. If you took out E TRADE, the organic growth was tremendous in the core business, which again we've started to see in the last couple of years. I think we showed some numbers last year of around 4%. Our target, I think, was 4% to 6%. Now this at 10%, well, Q1 is probably going to be your best quarter. Q2 usually has some tax factors -- tax flows going on. But listen, the growth rate is real. If we annualize 10% a year for the next several years that would be spectacular, but that's certainly not what we're planning on, and got to be realistic. But to be outgrowing some of our nontraditional competitors, even for a quarter, is just -- it's a wonderful green shoot to have planted out there. Brennan Hawken : No doubt. Thanks for that color, James. And then thinking about NII within the Wealth Management business, Jon, you made some comments on NII, but I wasn't sure if those were just purely on the wealth and from wide. When we think about it on the Wealth Management business, thanks for quantifying those prepaid impact, is this -- you've got strong loan growth. We've got securities yields that have been recovering, yesterday's setback aside. So, should we be expecting continued constructive trends in core NII ex-ing out any noise you might have from prepays quarter-to-quarter? Jonathan Pruzan : Sure. I think the short answer is, yes. We've really got some nice tailwinds from the loan growth that we've been experiencing, as well as the deposit funding synergies. I think, as I said in the first quarter, we don't expect any movement in policy rates. The short end is really what benefits the NII, so our growth we would expect from the full realization of the onboarding of deposits, which as you know, was feathered in over the quarter, and so that, we'll have the full impact next quarter. At $7 billion of loan growth, we're running ahead of plan there, so that's obviously a nice tailwind. And then as I said, we'll continue to see our deposit costs tick down as some of the incremental wholesale deposits run off because of the onboarding. So, we feel good about the guidance we gave you. The $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter was a good run rate, and then start to add the tailwinds from the deposits as well as the loan growth. We also saw some nice loan growth in margin lending, which is not in the bank, but is part of the wealth management NII story. So again, just a nice quarter, and we would expect it to continue to grow from these levels. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. James Gorman : Morning. Steven Chubak : So, wanted to start off with a question on the Archegos development. So, James, you noted that you were pleased with how the firm responded just given the complexity of the situation. What were some of the learnings from that experience? And just maybe more importantly, how does it inform your risk management approach within PB to infer that you can avert a similar situation in the future? James Gorman : Yes, I think -- I mean, my comment about the way this team has worked together now for a decade. We all went through the financial crisis, most of us in sort of a job or level below where we are now. So, I'd say, the accumulated, both scar tissue and experience is very real. And we have a philosophy; we cauterize bad stuff, and deal with it as soon as we possibly can. This was, as you know, a very unusual event. It was a family office actually, no outside money. It got to enormous size by the growth in their single stock position, very concentrated single stock loan positions that had exposed to growth. And they're offset by the various shorts, in the indices that they were short. So, it was -- and I think what -- the lessons are still unfolding, if you will, or learnings, Steve. But it's not going to change how we feel about the Prime Brokerage business at all. This is a gem of a business that we've probably generated, I don't know, something close to $40 billion in revenue in a decade. It's a core part and backbone of the equities business. So, it doesn't change that at all. But I think we'll certainly be looking hard at family office-type relationships, where they're very concentrated, and you have multiple prime brokers. And frankly, the transparency and lack of disclosure relating to those institutions is just different from the hedge fund institutions. And that's something I'm sure the SEC is going to be looking at, and that's probably good for the whole industry. Better information is always good in rooting out where potential problems can be. So, obviously, there's not a lot I can and should be saying publicly about it. But we're -- as I said, we've never happy taking a loss, but our job is to deal with the facts as reality and get on top of it and get it done, and that's what we did. And we took the extra bit, frankly, just to clean it up by quarter-end, we didn't want this thing to be lingering. Steven Chubak : No, that's helpful color, James, and certainly appreciate your candor on the topic. Just for my follow-up, another one on NII, Jon. I just wanted to get a sense, looking at the cost of deposit disclosure, nice to see that come in from 24 bps to 18 basis points. And one of the things that we're thinking about just given some of the funding benefits from E TRADE as well as just some higher-cost wholesale deposits that start to roll off. Where should we expect that number to ultimately bottom? And is that what informs those benefits, at least your expectation that we should be able to grow or build an NII from here going forward? Jonathan Pruzan : So the weighted average cost of deposits is 18. It will clearly continue to tick down over the course of the quarter, assuming short-term rates don't move. And again, we're not expecting policy rates to move as the wholesale higher cost wholesale deposits roll off. I think, as you recall, when we originally announced the transaction, I think we talked about $150 billion of funding synergies. We've revised that to $250 billion given the growth in deposits. You said that we would realize that in $200 billion of which will be realized this year. So we have incremental deposit and funding synergies that will be captured in 2022. So, all of the sorts of a movement, if you will, in the cost of deposits is sort of factored into our funding synergy calculation. So the way we generally have been thinking about it is that the policy rates aren't going to move. So there's not going to be necessarily a big plus or minus from rates and NII will grow because the quantum will grow based on loan growth. And then we pick up the funding soon. Steven Chubak : That's great color, John. Thanks for taking my questions. Jonathan Pruzan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. James, I think you've covered some of the stuff that I wanted to cover on our cases, sort of couple of quick follow-ups. So I still want to get to what was so complex about this one. Is it really just the family office nature and the less disclosure on multiple primes and the leverage of employees where, because obviously what's been great about your PB businesses. I mean, you didn't even lose money in '08, you had the assets, when they historically, when you have the assets and things break, you look for more collateral or you blow out the positions. What was different about this one? What do you think, why wasn't it disclosed? Why didn't this meet the materiality past, and then what do you think regulators want to change going forward? Thanks. Sorry for the follow-ups. James Gorman : Well, going to try and touch on a couple of them. And to be honest, there was a lot going on in this quarter. And so I don't want to spend too much with talking about a specific line situation, which is now done on history, but let me touch on a couple of things going to the reverse, sort of why we didn't disclose, we were having a record quarter. But the business was having a record quarter, the equities business, where this resided was having a record quarter. So you've going to be at a level where it's material to the overall quarter and I'll leave that up to the lawyers, but we're very comfortable with that. That's frankly, at given how the firm was performing, I think we generated $2 billion revenues more than our previous record quarter out of I don't know 340 quarters that we've had since our origination. So you've got to sort of focus on, on the big picture on that one. What was different about this situation relative to our weight, and yes, you're right, I don't think we've had, we went back through the records and I don't think we've ever had this a long time, but a loss in the PB business and the businesses back to the previous question from Steve, the business is very well risk managed and has been for decades now. And we are the number one prime broker in the world. We were the number one prime broker in this particular instance. There were enormous positions because of the rapid growth of the fund. They were levered across multiple prime brokers and as I said, the disclosure rules, as I understand them, and I'm not the expert on it made it more difficult to understand exactly who was holding, what, where, and that's something that we'll work through and that's part of the learning experience. It was complicated. I will say last comment on this, by the fact that one of the large single stock positions related to a security in which we have been an underwriting; we thought the right thing to do was to close that previous underwriting, which happened on that Friday. So, we had to hold off, which caused us to be later than some if you will. And the reason for that was not that we weren't aware of what was going on. We just felt we had an underwriting obligation to deal with. So, anyway, it's a long story, but again, in the context of equities business, equities had a record with this built into it, which is pretty extraordinary. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. And then on workplace, it's such a good growth and good margin business on its own. How do you execute? You mentioned that the companion accounts over the next 12, 18 months, how do you execute on that and then how you execute on morphing them to the all important Wealth Management Advisory relationship? Operator : Please standby. It is disconnected, the call will now end. Goodbye. Please standby. The conference will resume momentarily. Again, please standby. Please standby. The conference will begin now. Otherwise please hold. This line is now muted. I'm passing it to the line. Hold on, I'm passing in. Unidentified Company Representative : Hello, this is the speaker of the call. Can the Operator hear us, please? Operator : Yes, confirmed. Unidentified Company Representative : Okay, great. Can you present, please? Operator : You are in the main conference ready to proceed. James Gorman : Can we have the next question, please? Operator : And our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Your line is now open. Christian Bolu : Good morning. Hope everyone can hear me. James Gorman : We can now, sorry about that. Christian Bolu : Perfect. No worries, okay. Just circle back to the Wealth Management business. The organic growth there was pretty spectacular, north of 10%. And I was wondering if you'd give more detail on the Legacy Fresh advisor business, I hear you on each one of workplace. But the vast majority of the business is still the FA business. And it's really surprising to see this level of growth. So just curious, how much of recruiting for example drive growth, have you made any changes to the recruiting incentives that you're paying out to drive local, just trying to understand some of the core drivers of the strengths here? Jonathan Pruzan : Sure, Christian, it's Jon. I'll take that. I would say just first on net recruiting. I think you've heard us talk about this for the last several quarters, we've been very active, we've become a destination of choice. All the comments that James made about the breadth of the platform, the intellectual capital, the technology investments that we've made have made our platform and our company a place where FAs wants to do business. So we've seen higher levels of recruiting pipeline, as we bring in FAs and they're successful, and they like the platform. They're obviously talking to their previous colleagues, and therefore it's sort of accelerating. So we've seen really nice net recruiting. We're bringing in bigger teams, better teams and attrition has dramatically slowed down. So that's point number one, in terms of just the contribution of NNA, it was really across all the comments that I made net recruiting aided in the NNA, the E TRADE platform contributed to the contribution, new clients in the FA channel bringing in existing clients away. So just broad based activity, very, very active, we talked about client engagement being quite spectacular this quarter, and it really aided those numbers but broad based. Christian Bolu : Okay, thank you. And then to your point, it's been a while since I've seen this level of revenues in that business, and you called out securitized products as a real strength, which I think has always been a bigger business for Morgan Stanley, maybe any more details on that business and what's driving growth. Is it anything to do with the state of the mortgage markets and the strength there, just trying to get more color on sort of, if you have business and what's driving the strong growth there? Jonathan Pruzan : Sure. And again, I think that as I said, the Fed business, it was really every business in all geographies contributed to that quarter $3 billion of revenue, the team is working extremely well together, we're gaining share in that business, the depth of the franchise continues to improve, as you can imagine, in this environment, where the debate around rates and inflation and credit yields. So generally speaking, the credit products have been quite active and volumes have been quite elevated. Also, it's being aided by the primary calendar agency issuance. And so just a lot of good activity going on in credit, and I think as you saw, this quarter, a lot of debate around rates inflation, reflation, which really added to those results. Christian Bolu : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Mike Mayo : Hi, well, great timing with your E TRADE acquisition. And I guess retail volumes are some two to three times high, higher than historical from what I can tell. Are you seeing those trends continue through the end of March? And do you expect that to reverse as we get out of the pandemic and people get out of the house and stop trading as much or maybe this is secular? Jonathan Pruzan : Sure, Mike. No, we're really pleased with the timing of the transaction as you highlight, just if you look at number of clients, volumes, trades, all of the metrics that we historically looked at in that business, they're dramatically higher today than they were when we announced the transaction back in February of last year. So we're also seeing that same engagement across the FA led channel. So it's not just related to the E TRADE. So I think client engagement is very, very strong at 1.6 million average trades, that's on top of a 1.1 million average trade in the fourth quarter, which was a record, it was less than a million over the course of last year. So we're clearly at elevated levels. So I think we go back to the 200,000 or 300,000 trades they were doing in '19, no. But can we sustain this level? No one's got a crystal ball. But right now, clients are extraordinarily engaged. And we'll have to see how this plays out over time. James Gorman : Mike, I just said the two kickers, there will be some obviously these markets won't state this kind of retail activity forever. But the two strategic kickers behind this business are yet to really have the impact that they will have, obviously, the deposits and as rates rise, that will be a phenomenal additive. And secondly, the whole workplaces we're integrating with Solium. And that's proving we had some stats in there, I think about 5 million plus clients in there. But that's a huge growth business for us. And I think that'll be sort of the story of the next five years, as much as the elevated activity will be. Mike Mayo : And then my separate question goes back to Archegos, so if I heard you correctly, $900 million of losses and that compares to record equities anyway, $40 billion of revenues over the past decade in prime brokerage. But within all the news around this, I guess it was just press report saying that you didn't have losses. So I think it's a little bit of a surprise, and does speak to risk management. And so I guess my question is, how much of your prime brokerage business relates to family offices, since you're saying you're taking another look at that and why do you think it was that you were the only large bank to call out losses of this magnitude, when others didn't? I mean, did you, I don't know what you guys did differently versus Citibank America, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, or maybe they didn't disclose it. I just don't know if you can share some color on that, that would be great. James Gorman : Well, I'll give you a couple of things, just on the -- we're in a quiet period. So those things, there are certain times when you can't comment about the business unless you sort of pre-announce earnings, which we weren't going to do given that it was a record. So secondly, I don't I'm not going to comment on other firms. Some of them weren't even prime brokers to this institution. I don't think so. Each of them have their own bid, and they make it and thirdly, the context is the business is a phenomenal business. It's been risk managed very well. This was a very unusual incident. I think the family office, I don't have those numbers, Jon might have, I suspect it's less than 10% of the prime brokerage business, very small. So, yes, Mike I mean listen, we're quite transparent about this. We don't like to take losses ever. Unfortunately, when you intermediate flows of capital, you sometimes say that's what our whole margin book is. And the question is, once you're faced with the reality, how does the team come together to deal with it? And I think they did. As I said, I think they did a really good job. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Michael Carrier : Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. To me first, just on the trading front obviously robust quarter gauging with those losses, I realized it's difficult to gauge the outlook. Could you -- what drivers are you seeing that could continue to drive activity versus normalize it? And how is your market share, you have been trending during in this environment? Jonathan Pruzan : It's a great question. And again, without the crystal ball, I'll just give you some sort of perspective on what we saw in the first quarter. And then we collectively decide where we think that'll persist for what period of time, we clearly still have strong asset values. I mentioned, we have healthy pipelines and clients are significantly engaged both retail and institutional, markets are open, there's a lot of liquidity. And we're seeing a continuation of the accelerating economic data around the globe. Obviously, news coming out of China this morning or last night in terms of the growth recovery, so really good backdrop or macro backdrop. As James mentioned, seasonality the first quarter is usually the strongest. Typically, it wasn't last year, but typically it is the strongest in these businesses, we're confident that we have the ability to deliver on the objectives that we set out earlier this year, in terms of our strategic goals. We do believe and I think the data supports that we're gaining market share across all of our businesses. So that's something that we would expect to persist. And I think this year is really going to be focused on that, just growing our market shares and integrating these two very important acquisitions. Michael Carrier : Okay, great and then just as a follow-up. Just on the wealth and investment management, organic growth got to be very strong gain dimension, some of the retail activity can moderate. I guess maybe on the flip side, both E TRADE and Eaton Vance, they're very early, it's early innings in terms of integrating it and getting to like the maximum potential. So what are some of those initiatives over the next one to two years did that you feel like, good maybe partially offset any normalization that we eventually get? Jonathan Pruzan : I think James mentioned a couple of those already. I mean, I think what we've said all along, we're going to be very deliberate with the integrations, these deals were not about costs, they were about growth. And we do not want to, we don't want to disrupt the client experience, we obviously want to enhance it over time. So we're being very deliberate, we're investing in the platforms, we're investing in the service model and we're in the process, as we've mentioned before of sort of gathering data and running pilots to make sure that we understand what we need, so we can service our clients better. So, for example, we're defining running pilots around lead generation. We're defining the FAs, it will be part of that program. We're looking at data analytics and scoring models. We're making the investments in the engine that will help us match the FAs to the client based on specific needs. And the goal really for this year is to make sure that we have the pipes, the people and the process to be able to support our clients in the coming year. So we think there's huge potential. James mentioned the 5 million workplace participants were only clients outside of that channel with about half of those, that business continues to grow. The great thing about that business is that it's scalable. Think of it is a huge funnel of opportunities to further enhance client relationships, that experiences digital. So, it is very, very scalable. And we would expect real growth not only in that channel but to drive growth across the platform, really out of the workplace. James Gorman : Just to add to it, I can't tell you how excited I am about the combination of these four businesses, the Eaton Vance, our own investment management business, a traditional co-wealth management business in E TRADE and how this is transforming the place by providing so many growth verticals. I mean, look at the parametric product in Eaton Vance, it's extraordinary. They've done an unbelievable job. Calvert funds with everything going on in the sustainability space. As I said, the workplace with E TRADE and what we've done with solely in there. And now we'll be one of the top two workplace providers in the world, things that we can do to expand internationally and taking Eaton Vance product using our international distribution putting some back core equities product on the Eaton Vance domestic distribution, they have a great capability there. So it's just -- there is so many verticals now, which are driving growth. Once upon a time when we had the coal business, that sort of number of financial advisors and productivity per financial buzzer, that's basically the only two metrics you needed to follow. And now we've got like 30 different things that are bobbing along. So, you know, sort of watch this space. My target is $10 trillion of money under management. I've told the team internally. They hate that. But you know what, I told Danny [indiscernible] a couple of years ago that my target, I said on a public platform was a trillion dollars assets under management in the wealth asset management business. And he correctly pointed out, it's revenues per asset. It's not assets. And I said, yes, I know, but I'd like $1 trillion with high revenues per asset, and guess what, we've got $1.4 trillion when we started the wealth management journey 12 years ago, we had 500 being under management, now we have $4 trillion. And so we're heading to 10 trillion, we've got all these growth verticals and I just couldn't be more excited about it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. Maybe just a little more color on workplace. I feel like it's a good growth and good margin business on its own, but nirvana is the ability to transition them over to full wealth management advisory relationships over time. So the question is how do you execute on that? You mentioned companion accounts, but do you make research available? What products do you push across? Have you pre-market to them to convert them, because it takes time? Thanks. Jonathan Pruzan : Yes. Glenn, John is going to answer, but sorry about cutting off the four rows in personal, trust me, I like you, don't know quite what happened, but I told the team, let's get you back on for another go at it, to dub you back. James Gorman : I think you sort of highlighted some of the things that are going to drive the growth going forward. I mean, again, we want more corporate accounts. We're seeing the pipeline very strong. The hit rate is higher and the product is really resonating. We then want to grow the participants. And then once the participants are in the system, we need to build trust and relationships with them through content, through education and through services, because the ultimate goal as you said is to convert them to a broader client. And when we first convert them, we're reasonably indifferent whether they go into the self-directed channel, the FA channel, a virtual channel, because that'll just give us an opportunity to build that relationship, deepen that relationship as the clients requirements and services and needs change, we'll be able to grow with them. And so your comment about migrating wealth client across the different platforms be the ultimate goal, but first we want to build trust with them, bring them into the Morgan Stanley relationship, one of the keys is to try to have that integrated experience across the platforms for the clients. So that's a lot of the technology that we're trying to build too. So we want to bring them in, deepen the relationship and then let them go to the channel that best suits. Glenn Schorr : Thanks, James. I'm very confident in our relationship. I appreciate that. James Gorman : Good to hear. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Aijaz Abdul Hussain with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Aijaz Abdul Hussain : Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is on fixed income, as you know, you are very credit key player. And clearly that's been performing extremely well. I just wanted to see how you're thinking about that business more the longer-term, more stable environment around credit and with you macro pieces being a bit weaker. So can you talk a little bit about the mix and if you're happy about the mix or what opportunities do you see to further grow the rates and FX area? Jonathan Pruzan : I think that the short answer again is that we're very pleased with the performance from the fixed income business. We've deepened the breadth of the franchise as you said, credit has historically been a strong point for us, but we're seeing good results and good penetration in both the macro as well as the commodity space. And so again, we think we've gained market share since we've restructured this business. We were probably a 6% or 7% player before. We're now probably a 10%, maybe even 10% plus player. We would expect to maintain that market share going forward, potentially increase it or grow it a little bit more, but we've been very pleased with the balance of the business and the results over the last several years in this. Aijaz Abdul Hussain : ,: James Gorman : I'll just make one comment. And I'll let John to add a couple of comments, but we've answered and addressed this topic and I'm sure we'll have plenty of opportunity to talk about it in the future, but this is a pretty small part of what we do as a whole firm. But I think the comment I want to make is family offices are not bad per se. I want to be very clear about that. We have some phenomenal family office clients, and they're all over the world tremendous institutions. So let's not throw the baby out with about 40 here. This is not a judgment call on family offices. This is a very idiosyncratic event. And I'll let John, if he wants to add anything more to it, but I don't want to overlay with this issue. Jonathan Pruzan : Yes, I would just and I think just pulling some of the threads of your questions together, just make a couple more observations. First, as we obviously are looking across all of the portfolios. As James mentioned, we're looking in our stress testing methodology and we will recalibrate it if and where it's appropriate to do so. Number one your comment about margin and collateral. I mean, I think the way that we think about it as we had collateral based on a certain set of facts that turned out not to be true, and James as mentioned it wasn't necessarily, it was a family office. It wasn't necessarily that they had large concentrated positions. It really came down to the fact that this firm had large positions, the same positions in the same names at other banks across the street, and it wasn't apparent to us. So I think that's what isolates the situation here or makes it more unique. We scrubbed the portfolio. We haven't found anyone that has similar fact patterns or copycat strategies and we'll continue to be diligent around all of those points. Aijaz Abdul Hussain : Thanks for your answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Devin Ryan : Okay, great day, good morning. So, wanted to ask a question about the recent announcement to offer a few specific bitcoin related funds to wealth management clients and appreciate you have to walk before you run here and it's pretty small, but just given how fast the ecosystem is developing and the interest in the space lobby just maybe give some thoughts on, I guess, one what the reaction was in currently, and then two just tell us more broadly as you're thinking about the crypto space across the organization? Jonathan Pruzan : Sure. And I think your comments are very appropriate. It's a fast-growing space. There's a lot of interest in the space. And we had a significant interest from our wealth clients to try to get access to this new asset class. And so we tried to facilitate that. We've allowed within our wealth management platform, qualified investors to get access through two specific passive funds, if you will, that access to the crypto currency. The uptake and the interest level has been strong, and we would expect people to continue to be interested in this space. And we will continue to monitor it and evolve. And we are in the business of trying to provide services and investment opportunities that interest our client base. And as we continue to see more or stronger interest, we will continue to try to work with the regulators and others to provide services that we think are appropriate. Devin Ryan : Okay, perfect. Let me squeeze in a quick follow-up here. Just on the SPAC market, clearly has played a role I think there. The record amount of investment banking activity in the market really started to lock up a bit over the past month on the PIPE side. And now the SEC is adding some more scrutiny here. So, I just love to maybe think the backlogs there and expectations moving forward to kind of work through those backlogs, and then, in the IPO market kind of do a hand off year, the traditional route have gone public if the SPAC market soars? Jonathan Pruzan : Sure. I mean, listen, the SPAC or the product itself is just another financing vehicle just like a private placement or a direct listing. And even with those incremental and new products, the traditional IPO product has been very active very strong. And we have been a market leader in that space. You appropriately point out that the backlog I think over 200 SPACs on file. So, I would expect that we will continue to see more issuance. There seems to be a pause as market is digesting this and the regulators are looking at it. So, I don't want to get in front of that. But, there is clearly interest in this product both from an issuer and a buyer perspective. And I think it does also add to some of the momentum in the M&A product. But I would also point out there is a couple hundred million dollars sort of SPAC money that can be levered and put into the M&A environment. But, there is also a $1.5 trillion of dry powder with the private equity firm. So, if you put multiples or leverage of those, there is a lot of buying power, so I think that's also a good driver of the M&A market going forward. Devin Ryan : Okay, great. Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Sigee with BNP Exane Paribas. Your line is now open. Jeremy Sigee : Hi there. Thank you. I would like to carry on the discussion about the revenue growth drivers in wealth management. So, I agree with you, I think the upside is huge from that. Is it too early to see signs of revenue synergy between E TRADE and the workplace channel and the advisor channels whether it's customers bringing in assets held away or starting to cross over into other channels and use other services? Can you see signs of that yet, or is it too soon? Jonathan Pruzan : Yes. I mean I think as I mentioned, we are seeing some anecdotal signs of that. We are running some private programs. We think we are capturing some of the traditional E TRADE clients who might have left that platform for incremental advice and now they are staying with us and working with our financial advisory platform. So, I think there are very good early signs. And I think you are seeing some of that obviously in the NNA. The other point I would make is in terms of the workplace retention when we announced the transaction, we targeted a 15% retention rate there. It's early days, but we are pleased with the progress that we are making. E TRADE is still -- the E TRADE platform retention rate is still well above 15%. So, we feel very confident about our ability to deliver on that. And as we get further along on this journey, we will start to give you more color on that. But, early anecdotes are quite positive. Jeremy Sigee : Okay, great. And, could I just ask a follow-up, a technical question on Archegos? I know you are fed up with this topic, but just a technical question. Does the fact of the loss which is now in your data history, does that have any mechanical calculation impact on risk ratings or capital requirements in your PB business? Jonathan Pruzan : Again, the volatility related to this event was as James said, was very short in terms of time series. So, I think the answer is it will not have a meaningful impact to the overall capital requirement. Jeremy Sigee : Okay, thank you very much. Operator *: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplements, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com.  Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman. James Gorman : Hi, good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. As the firm delivered another strong quarter and a record first-half, with year-to-date revenues in excess of $30 billion. We had strong inflows across Wealth and Investment Management, and in the first 6 months of the year, we added over $250 billion of net new assets, across both of those businesses. We now have over 13 million unique relationships in Wealth Management, and in Investment Management, our assets makes us increasingly diverse and well-positioned, in key secular growth areas, such as customization, private alternatives, and sustainability. Finally, Institutional Securities also had a tremendous performance.  Equity remains a preeminent leader in the industry, fixed income has maintained share gains, and our leading investment banking franchise performed strongly. Our business is further enhanced by our acquisitions of E TRADE and Eaton Vance and the progress on our integration.  Since the respective announcement of each acquisition, both businesses have performed better than we expected. Not only did the standard merger metrics such as synergies and funding benefits read positive, but much more importantly, we're seeing long-term business growth driven by exceptional client engagement.  This quarter, our ROTCE was 19% and year-to-date, we're over 20%. Obviously, we are exceeding our longer-term targets of 17% plus. We intend to formally revisit our goals next January. While we will not revisit targets mid-year, I want to assure you we are as focused on delivering top performance as ever. Though we're always subject to the broader macroenvironment, we will strive for continued outperformance. Now let me talk about the decision we announced 2 weeks ago on further capital distribution. During the financial crisis, we reduced our buyback to 0, and cut our dividend quarterly to $0.05 per share.  Over the past decade, it has been a slow, steady path of improvement as we grew our dividend from $0.05 ultimately to $0.35, and increased our buyback from 0 to $5 billion. I have said for a number of years that Wealth and Investment Management contribute durable earnings that enable us to pay our shareholders substantially, and that is what we are doing. As a result, we reset our dividend, doubling it to $0.70 per share, and also increased our buyback for up to $12 billion over the next 12 months. We made this decision because of the confidence we have in our business model and our performance over the past 3 Federal Reserve stress tests.  These tests confirmed what we have said for many years. Morgan Stanley has built a significant amount of excess capital, and we have the ability to invest in our business, do acquisitions, maintained a very healthy dividend yield, and increased our buyback.  Given our current earnings momentum, it takes some time to fully distribute that capital, but we feel strongly that this year is the time to make a big start. Now, Sharon Yeshaya is here with me today in her new role as Chief Financial Officer. Jon Pruzan, who was CFO up until midway through the second quarter, is also here with us.  And as you know, Jon took on additional responsibilities, as our Chief Operating Officer since June 1st. Let me turn it over to Sharon, who'll discuss the quarter in detail, and we look forward to all of your questions. Thank you. Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion in the second quarter, representing one of the top 3 quarters on record. Performance continued to be very strong, reflecting high levels of client activity across our businesses. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $1.89.  Our ROTCE was 19%. Year-to-date revenues of $30.5 billion were a new record, highlighting the power of our firm which has been further enhanced by our recent acquisitions. Investing for growth remains a priority, while also managing our expense base. On a year-to-date basis, total expenses were $20.6 billion, of which, non-compensation expenses were $7.4 billion and compensation expenses were $13.2 billion.  The increase in expenses versus the prior year reflects the addition of E-Trade and Eaton Vance, and the integration-related costs. Year-to-date, our firm efficiency ratio declined to 67%, excluding integration-related expenses, underscoring the operating leverage of our business. Now, to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenue of over $7 billion demonstrates the power of the integrated investment bank. Revenues declined by 14% from the exceptionally strong prior year. Higher revenues in investment banking and equities were offset by lower fixed income results.  Underwriting was particularly robust, as issuance remained elevated. And despite lower volatility across asset classes, our sales and trading clients remained engaged. We ended the period on a strong footing, as clients were active through June. Investment banking revenues were $2.4 billion. The 16% increase from the prior year was driven by advisory and continued strength in equity underwriting.  From a geographical perspective, results in Europe and Asia were the strongest in over a decade. And while technology and healthcare remain areas of core strength, activity in financial institutions, financial sponsors, real estate, and other sectors supported higher revenues.  Advisory revenues were $664 million, reflecting increased completed M&A activity versus the prior year. Year-to-date announced industry volumes reached record levels, and clients continued to look for strategic opportunities as markets remained open and constructive. Equity underwriting revenues of $1.1 billion were the second highest on record, and the third consecutive quarter over $1 billion.  The increase from the prior year was driven by traditional IPOs, where activity remains robust globally. Fixed income underwriting revenues of $640 million were also the second highest after a record second quarter of last year. Investment banking pipelines remain healthy across products and regions. CEO confidence remains high as companies look for strategic opportunities for growth.  Equity revenues increased 8% from the prior year to $2.8 billion. We are number 1 in this business globally. Revenues were the second highest in over a decade. Results in Asia were particularly strong, reflecting increased interest in the region from both Asia and non Asia-based clients.  Cash and derivative results were robust, but declined versus the prior year, against the backdrop of lower volatility. Prime brokerage revenues were strong, and increased versus last year, as average balances reached new highs. Fixed income revenues were $1.7 billion. Revenues declined from the exceptional prior year as wider bid offer spreads normalized across products.  This quarter's results were broad-based across regions. Micro results were robust, compared to historical averages, but declined from the prior year, as credit markets were relatively range bound, and bid offer spreads compressed. Macro also declined versus last year, with lower revenue in both rates and foreign exchange, on the back of lower volatility.  Other revenues of $207 million declined versus the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects lower mark-to-market gains on corporate loans, net of related hedges. Prior year results benefited from significant credit spread tightening.  Turning to ISG lending, our allowance for loan -- for credit losses in ISG loans and lending commitments was essentially flat in the second quarter at $1 billion. ISG provisions were $70 million and net charge-offs were $92 million, primarily related to one facility. Total ISG loans were flat. The decline in corporate loans was almost entirely offset by growth in all other lending categories. Lending commitments increased by approximately $6 billion relative to the prior quarter. Turning to Wealth Management. The prior quarter will be a more relevant benchmark as a comparison period rather than the prior year, given the acquisition of E TRADE. Revenues were a record $6.1 billion. Excluding integration-related cost of $60 million, TBT was also a record of $1.7 billion, with a margin of 27.8%. Growth drivers of this business remain robust. Net new assets were $71 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date NNA to 176 billion which represents a 9% annualized growth rate of beginning period assets for the first half.  Net new client, asset consolidation from existing clients, and stock plan retention all contributed to the strong results. Further, we continue to see strength in net recruiting and retention, also contributing to NNA. While NNA will be lumpy and should be looked at on a full-year basis, the first half of this year illustrates the tremendous growth potential inherent in this business.  Transactional revenues were $1.2 billion. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues declined 16% from the exceptional prior quarter. Client activity moderated from the first quarter's torrid pace, but engagement remained high. Self-directed daily average trades were 1 million in the second quarter, approximately 10% above average levels for full-year 2020. Our client base continues to expand, and our households reached 7.4 million in the self-directed channel.  Asset Management revenues increased 8% sequentially to $3.4 billion. Year-to-date, these revenues increased 28%. Fee-based flows were $34 billion bringing year-to-date fee-based flows to $71 billion, almost matching the amount for the full-year of 2020. Fee-based assets are now 1.7 trillion, or more than double the level of only five years ago. Bank lending balances grew by a record 10 billion, and balances reached 115 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date balances have grown by 17%, exceeding our full-year expectation of 10%. This was driven by strong demand for securities-based lending. Net interest income was $1.3 billion.  Excluding prepayment amortization, which declined approximately $150 million sequentially, NII was up slightly. The benefit of incremental loan growth was offset by the downward movement in the middle of the curve. We have realized the fully phased-in synergies that we expected for 2021.  For NII going forward, $1.3 billion is a reasonable exit rate to inform the back half of the year. We expect NII to build from this level as we anticipate loans to grow more in line with 2020 levels. The integration of E TRADE is going well, and we continue to prioritize the client experience. While early, we are encouraged by continued client engagement and excited about the potential of our pilot programs around referrals. The workplace channel continues to show momentum as we win equity plans, and our number of participants now stands at 5.2 million. Financial wellness plans are also gaining traction.  We had 4 times as many wins year-over-year. Moving to Investment Management. Because the timing of the close of the Eaton Vance acquisition makes comparisons to prior periods difficult, I will review the quarter mainly on an absolute basis. Revenues were $1.7 billion. Total AUM reached $1.5 trillion and total net flows were over $48 billion.  Since we announced acquisition at the beginning of October, pro forma net flows were approximately $150 billion. The increase diversification of this business was a significant driver of results. Total AUM increased 7% from the prior quarter, and stands at a record high of which long-term AUM reached $1.1 trillion.  The benefit of our broadened product offering and positioning in secular growth areas supported our net flows this quarter. Inflows across products resulted in over $13 billion of long-term net flows. We saw a particular strength in Alternatives and Solutions, driven primarily by demand for Parametric customized portfolios, as well as a $1 billion strategic multi-asset partnership mandate.  We continue to see strong client momentum in our private credit and core real estate platforms. Loan strategies and fixed income were particularly robust. Asset Management and related fees were $1.4 billion, more than doubling from the prior year driven by strong AUM growth and the addition of Eaton Vance. Performance-Based Income and Other revenues were $284 million in the quarter, reflecting broad-based strength across the private alternatives portfolio.  With the integration on pace, our very strong position in customization, sustainability, alternatives, value-added fixed income, and high-conviction equity investing, positioning us all as a critical partner to global clients. Turning to the balance sheet. [Indiscernible] assets were essentially flat. Standardized RWAs increased to $461 billion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was flat to the prior quarter at 16.7% compared to our CET1 requirement, including the SCB of 13.2%. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $2.9 billion of common stock or 34 million shares.  Our tax rate for the quarter was 23%. The second quarter results were strong and balanced. Looking ahead, while we're cognizant of the typical summer slowdown, we're starting the third quarter from a position of strength. Investment Banking pipelines are healthy, dialogues are active, and markets are open.  Wealth management continues to retain and attract new clients, new advisors, and new assets. Investment management should continue to benefit from the increased diversification of the platform. With that, we will now open the line to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. You peaked my interest. You made the comments drawn on investing for growth remains a priority. We've seen so much that you've done across Asset Wealth management. My question is on ISG. You're as good as it gets I think in equities and M&A. Where do you see opportunities to invest and/or capture share across ISG right now? James Gorman : Hey, Glenn. I think firstly, I wouldn't -- I certainly wouldn't, and I'll come back to it in a minute, discount growth opportunities across IM and Wealth, even though we've just done these huge acquisitions. I'll come back to that. In the institutional business, listen, there's more consolidation going on in prime brokerage. We're the market leader in that.  We will pick up share over time. Clearly in M&A, there's opportunity for us to grow. I think that a lot of the middle-market M&A spaces are very fertile. There are different parts in the world we still think we could punch higher above our weight.  I actually think both of those, the Equities business as good as it is, and M&A as good as it is, I actually think there's a real upside in both of those. In the Fixed Income space, our aspiration years ago was to do $1.25 billion. We raised it to $1.5 billion. And here we are in a sort of so-so quarter with $1.7 billion. As rates normalize and as the fixed income fee pool will inevitably grow, I see a lot of space there in the SVG credit side we've got a world-class business there, again, continuing to grow share. And our commodities business is doing very well.  So, the ISG franchise has gone from sort of running at $5 billion a quarter to this quarter it was $7 billion. It was frankly better than we'd expected coming into it, which is terrific, but it's very interesting, that the share gains across -- and it's not just us. Some of the other big players in the U.S. are real and I think enduring.  And as the global economies recover and the people increases, you'll just see more of that. I feel very confident about the ISG business. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. And I hear you loud and clear on Asset and Wealth Management. I do have a quick follow-up. Within Wealth Management, obviously Shareworks is this enormous opportunity. Wonder if you could just give us a little mark-to-market in terms of what's going on in terms of conversions in the core business, and then what is going on in terms of leading towards [Indiscernible] business within the Morgan Stanley platform? Sharon Yeshaya : I didn't hear the last part of your question, but I think you said referrals throughout and how the integration on workplace is going, Glenn? Glenn Schorr : Yes. Sharon Yeshaya : So the -- I'd say that you're sort of starting with infrastructure, it's going very well, as James said. But the core is start with infrastructure, make sure that everyone has companion accounts as you go through. We've said we're at 50% right now, where clients have companion accounts.  By the back half of next year, we should be around 90%. And we've started pilot programs where you do have that companion account, and we do see it working. We see the retention of assets, we see clients moving over to actually get advice when they look and want advice. So we're working with the clients and we're trying out new technologies, and we'll go from there. So it's really about conversion of clients and then the retention of assets. But it all seems to be working very well. James Gorman : I'd just say something. So I'll tease it a little bit here because it wasn't your question, but you've given me an opportunity to comment based on Shareworks. I think every now and then in business, you look and you sort of see a wave coming, and you catch the wave, and it's a beautiful thing. The whole workplace space, to me, is the next major growth area in financial services. I think over the next 10 years, we'll look back at that Solium transaction, which at the time, some people thought was expensive and it was. I think we spent 800 or 900 on it, might have been Canadian dollars, so somewhere around there, and it was trading at about 500 value.  That gave us the opportunity to do the E TRADE transaction with confidence because we knew we could merge the workplace businesses and create Shareworks. And I really believe that this is very fertile ground and convert those millions of clients hopefully into being Morgan Stanley and E TRADE clients as we have the accounts to fold into our own house accounts. That's one wave. Parametric, the customization space, I think is the second wave. Calvert Funds and everything we've done through our own sustainability and [Indiscernible] efforts, combined with now Calvert 's products.  And then the digitalization and how we're going to take the E TRADE platform both domestically and internationally, I think there's incredible opportunity. It's pretty rare to sit here, and having done this for a little while, there are a lot of things that you can do to just improve your business, but these are things where I think we have fundamental market forces pushing these waves and we're right on top of them. So it's very exciting. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. And I'd like to just start by saying congrats to Sharon. Welcome to the calls in a different role, the quarterly. Dan 's here. Congrats. Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you. Brennan Hawken : Sure. I'd like to maybe start with the integrations and sort of taking a step back. You've got two pretty substantial deals under your belt. They've now closed and so you're working on integrating those businesses. What are the milestones that we should think about as you proceed with that work? What kind of timeframe should we think about around updates?  Is -- are we going to just get back to the annual strategic update where it's the fourth quarter call or are they going to be more regular updates where we're going to be able to hear about the work that you're doing. James, you made reference to the workplace, which is obviously a key part of E TRADE.  But how should we think about those from here? I know it's kind of a broad question, but just wanted to try and level this out. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. I think that it's a fair question. And in terms of where that comes out, it will likely be the next step, will be the annual deck. But then from that point on, I think, there'll be a more regular cadence. Obviously, most investors here know, Jensen for example, who can begin to take us through some of that workplace.  But there is also, I think, the goal will eventually be to better understand where there are participant migration. So how do you think about the question that Glenn asked, which is referrals. How do you see that referral channel going through, in terms of dollars, et cetera.  How are you thinking about proceeds and the proceeds following through from those Companion accounts. But the integration is a three-year process, which we put out there at the very beginning. So I think right now what we're looking to do is make sure that the pilot programs are going well and understand the client reaction as you think about some of the technology and what is working and what isn't working.  So to give you things piecemeal or to give it a little bit too early, I think would also be a mistake because we'd like to ensure that it is the right client experience and that's what we're focused on right now. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that. And then, when we think about net new assets, the growth there has been really, pretty impressive. We have seen some acceleration across the industry though, and I think most investors think it's going to slow. This past year has been a little unusual. But when we look at what's been happening at Morgan Stanley, things already were accelerating before we entered into this period.  And so, one of the debates that has been coming up more regularly has been, what is the right growth rate for the wealth business on a go-forward basis? I'll maybe throw out a range. And from my perspective, it feels like somewhere in the mid-upper single-digits, 5% to 7% feels fair on a long run basis. But number 1, I'd love to hear your reaction to that. And then number 2, how do you think about that growth rate?  Do you guys have something in mind? Is there something that you're targeting? Any color on that would be really helpful. James Gorman : I\u2019ll let Sharon start and I\u2019ve got a few thoughts about this. Sharon Yeshaya : Yeah. I think where we started, Brennan, if we look back to the beginning of the year, we gave you guys a very long historical average chart, and then we showed you the 7% of the pro forma when you included E TRADE. Now what we have said is we don't think we'd go back to a 3% to4% on a sustainable basis. That 5% to 6% is where James spoke to this audience at the beginning of the year when we talked about the deck. Obviously as you look forward though, we're doing a lot, both on net asset consolidation, net recruiting, and all of these new channels. And so, I don't think we -- the same way that James level set with the targets at the beginning of his introductory remarks, I'd say we don't -- that's probably the same way you can think about this, where 5% to 6% maybe that's the right place to start, but we're obviously not going to try to underachieve that number. James Gorman : Yeah. Brennan, it's really the -- it's the question. Because if we can generate growth in the high teens, I mean, I think we're at -- what are we, 9% year-to-date organic. I mean, this is just -- we've never seen this. And I've been doing this for a very long time. The 3 industry segments, basically the wirehouses, the independent/RIAs, and the direct channel, for years, the direct has grown.  The RIAs have grown in a large part because they've taken - advisers have moved out of the traditional channel, into the RIA channels. So part of the growth has just been a shift, if you will, part of it\u2019s been organic. And the wirehouses have sort of struggled. And it struggled for a couple of reasons : 1 is poor training, 2 is very high attrition, 3 is lack of [gluing] (ph) the clients in through the mortgage and the banking products that the banks have, etc.  And I think what you are seeing now, we think we're kind of creating a, not to be arrogant about it, but a new mouse trap. We're creating an advisor channel, which actually has deep organic growth flavors in it. And if you look at our attrition numbers and the weekly hiring numbers, I mean they are fantastic. And with that, we're getting tremendous asset growth. And then you combine that with having the direct platform, and then combine that with having the workplace platform. You've got 3 legitimate channels pouring assets into the house. And it wasn't so long ago that if we did 10 billion a quarter, we thought we're pretty good.  And we just had a $70 billion quarter during tax season, and it's good. It's very good. But we don't think it was a fluke. I don't know where the ultimate number is going to settle. I think our assets in wealth are now around a little over 4.5 trillion. That was 500 billion 12, 14 years ago. We're at 4.5 trillion. We've gone up 9 times.  Compounding on a big number is a pretty potent force as you know. I don't know if it's going to -- it won't be below 5%. I mean, in any individual quarter you have stuff going on, but it won't be below 5%. Whether it's 6, 7, 8, where we land on that, we'll see over a few years but it feels good. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. And welcome, Sharon. Nice to have you on the call. Wanted to start off with just a two-parter on Wealth Management NII. You noted that the E TRADE funding synergies have been captured for 2021. The deposit costs in Wealth Management still feels a bit elevated at 16 bps, especially when benchmarking versus peers. Just wondering if there's potential to drive those funding costs lower if rates remain at 0? And then just as a second part, maybe just speak to the environmental factors supporting such strong SBL growth and the sustainability of that trend. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. I would just mention that we did see the planned runoff right of wholesale deposits. And we continue to expect another 13 billion of wholesale deposits to runoff by year-end, as we see some of that higher cost funding roll down. So just to note there, I don't have an exact target on BDP cost, if that will give you a sense. In addition to that, I would just highlight the SBL question that you asked.  That product is resonating with our clients. So that's the point there. And as James has always said, it's a product in which you lend wealthy clients their money back. And this is something that is resonating, it's structured very well. We've historically seen minimal losses and it has a 37% LTV right now in that portfolio.  So from that perspective, I think it's a good product to offer and it's also something that works especially in a season like this where you generally see a lot of that product in tax season. And so there is an elevated number in the second quarter, generally speaking. Steven Chubak : Just for my follow-up on capital management, the dividend increase that we saw was much higher than anticipated. Looks like you're now running with the highest dividend yield amongst all of the G-SIBs. I know, James, you had alluded to the improved stress test outcomes, the higher contribution from recurring revenues.  But just remind us of the philosophy around setting the dividend and buyback, and where you're comfortable running on your capital ratios on it through the cycle basis. James Gorman : I mean, there's a lot in that Steve, so it might take a little while. Get yourself a cup of coffee, put your feet up on the stool. Let's just start with -- I think we're a company that is going to produce durable revenues forever, unless we go and screw it up, basically. If you look at the daily numbers coming out of the fee-based businesses, and the Wealth business, and the fee-based businesses, and Asset Management, they're for real and they're everyday. And they're not 10 million, they're 100 million. You\u2019ve locked in a $25 billion business right from day 1 in the beginning of the year. And our view on that is, unless we spend our way into trouble on it, it will generate very consistent earnings.  And just philosophically, it doesn't mean I'm right, but my view was certainly the wealth business and the fee-based part of the Asset Management business, which is so predictable, we think of it as like a yield stock, and the Investment Banking and Trading Businesses and Capital Markets businesses and some of the carrier businesses in Asset Management we think is like the -- not the other businesses in a growth stock, but that provides the capital to fund the engine, to do buybacks, et cetera, et cetera. We've been carrying a buffer CET1 of over 17%. We have to be, I think, the latest CCAR was around 13.2-ish. I don't know what the exact buffer we should carry internally, as we've said, 50 basis points. It wouldn't be less than that. But just pretend that 80 basis points, you're at 14. You've got 300+ basis points to play with.  We're generating net income in the first half of this year was 7 billion. Assume we are less than that in the second half, just because who knows. But we're certainly not going to be under 10 billion for the year, and probably not under 12 billion. You're talking about a buyback of 5 --- of 12 billion, a dividend of 5, that gets you to 17. You're generating at least 12.  You're in the hole for 5, but you've got 300 basis points of excess. It's going to take a bunch of years to eat into that. And we felt as shareholders deserve to get the earnings stream up the predictability of the businesses. So we've got -- we're not a traditional investment bank as traditional investment banks used to be and the vast majority of them, if not all of them, went out of business or merged. We are a combined investment bank with a massive wealth and asset management business. So we think shareholders should get the benefit of that very different profile. 14 points, whatever it was, 8 billion in revenue this quarter, a little over 7 of it was institutional, little over 7 of it was wealth and asset management.  So it's exactly what we hoped, this sort of balance. That's the philosophy now. It would take us a bunch of years, unless CCAR changes dramatically for us to get close to our buffer. And we're buying the stock back and the stock's over $90. We are very happy buying at this level but at some point, obviously, that gets expensive.  We do think we can do more deals over time, and we'll actively look at that, and we want to keep investing in the business, but the reality is, and this is the ultimate conundrum, we can do all four : buyback, dividend, invest, and acquisitions, and still run an excess buffer. And the only way out of that problem is not to have good earnings and that's not my solution currently. Let's play this out over a few years.  I'm really happy we got the dividend, as we quoted a reset. And we had the authorization from the Board for up to 12 billion, and we'll go hard at that, particularly if the stock were to-- if we saw a big move in the market. But that's how I'm thinking about it, and how the Board's thinking about it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Bernard Von Gizycki : Hi, good morning. This is actually Bernie Von Gizycki on for Matt. My questions are on Investment Management and the inclusion of Eaton Vance. In the last quarter's 10-Q, you noted that certain Eaton Vance products have lower average fee rates than the standalone Morgan Stanley Investment Management platform. I know you made some revisions to the AUM disclosures, and Eaton Vance only had one month of performance in the data in 1Q. Could you just talk about the expectations on fee rate in the combined Asset Management platform as you diversify the product mix? Sharon Yeshaya : I think that that's right. Obviously, that's in some of the overlay products, for example, will have lower fee rates. It will obviously be a mixed product. Also, if you think about it just across the platform, you might see other gives and takes. But I think that what we're focused on is not necessarily the fee rate of one individual product, it's creating an ability to service the client more broadly.  So while the overall fee rate might come down as was disclosed, there are secular growth trends that should continue to bring assets to the platform, which would offset parts of that on a total basis, right. A rate times volume kind of concept. In particular, you have the Parametric product which we discussed, which is obviously -- has its own secular growth trends, the Calvert product. And then there are cyclical trends that could eventually turn into secular trends, i.e ESG, i.e, what's going on with changes to tax legislation and how people think about customized portfolios. All of those things are reasons that we might see changes in growth in AUM. And in addition to that, I think that the fixed income products offered the clients an ability to bring their entire portfolio to Morgan Stanley.  And so, from that perspective, again, rate times volume over time, and so there will be a difference in those fees more broadly on the portfolio. But our assets should continue to come in. Bernard Von Gizycki : Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then just with my follow-up. Again, I know it's just the first full quarter of Eaton Vance just combined on the platform. But just any color you can share about the integration efforts around putting Eaton Vance 's products on your international distribution channel, and then vice versa, putting some of your core products on Eaton Vance 's domestic retail platform? Just trying to get a sense of anything with the net flows showed up. Sharon Yeshaya : We have -- I'd say we've aligned the sales forces. But as you noted, it has not been that long. We're working through it. I think we see and we expect to invest in the various businesses to deliver the customization for a better client experience, but also open the new workplaces. So not just international, but also as it relates to workplace, etc. So we're still working through that and we should have an update over the course of the rest of the year. James Gorman : But the short answer on the flows is zero of the flows, to my knowledge, are a result of exactly what you just said, putting the Eaton Vance product in international and putting our products through the wholesalers in Eaton Vance. They're terrific teams. There'll be a lot of upside on that going forward, but zero of it has appeared yet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Your line is now open. Christian Bolu : Good morning, James and Sharon. And just to echo the sentiments, a big congrats to you, Sharon. James, let me ask you a couple of follow-ups on things you've said on prior questions. I think you just said, maybe a couple of questions before, that you mentioned you can do more M&A deals. Just trying to get a sense of what you're thinking there. Is that the doubling down on wealth management, or is it consolidating traditional asset management space as you look to grow [Indiscernible] client assets? James Gorman : Christian, good morning. We've done I think five deals, acquisition since the crisis, and we've had a lot of dispositions, disposals, I guess. TransMontaigne, Hidemar, we spun-off MSCI, obviously. Before this, we spun off Discover, PDT, [Indiscernible] business, FrontPoint, ESOP.  So folks have focused on the acquisition side, but we've also done a huge number of deals in getting rid of businesses that are better owned by somebody else or just [not a] (ph) fit. Now, Asesores in Spain as I remember, Quilter in the UK, European private banking business we sold, etc.  So on the deal side, we've done -- Smith Barney obviously was the big one and Mesa West was the first sort of toe in the water in investment management, then the Solium deal in the workplace space, followed by E TRADE and Eaton Vance. So all I'm saying is, we don't have big transactions in line of sight at this point in time, but we're a big enough company, we're generating, I don't know, we're running -- run rate, I guess, is 60 billion of revenues this year, 170 plus billion market cap. Finding the right things to fit in, particularly internationally, and particularly on the digital and technology side is very interesting to us. Now, pricing is always, you've got to be disciplined, but it's something that we're very watchful of, and we're not shy about it. But major transactions are highly unlikely to happen. These are more bolt-ons as they feel right. Christian Bolu : Great, thanks. And just a follow-up, you keep mentioning international. I think you said E TRADE, you want to expand that internationally? Which I don't think I've heard before. And if I remember correctly, in the past, you were always cautious about Wealth Management, international expansion, and maybe you just said you divested Quilter, and E TRADE [Indiscernible] international businesses post financial crisis.  So, can you just talk more about how you think about international, how you would expand E TRADE. What's the sort of like vision here? James Gorman : Sure. I'll try and be brief. The International Wealth business is complicated because while the U.S. market is 300 million people and Europe is about 300 million people, Europe is multiple jurisdictions within that, even though its Eurozone. Asia people look at it, so it's some monolith. It's not -- Vietnam is not Indonesia, Malaysia is not Thailand, the Philippines is not Australia, Korea is not China, etc. You've got to -- it's very hard to get scale in these markets, so issue number 1.  Issue number 2, they tend to be very heavy equities trading markets. They're not diversified traditional financial planning market. Look at Japan, the velocity of asset in Japan, compared to the U.S. That's night and day. And thirdly, obviously, know your client, money laundering, all of the things that one has to be careful about cross-border type money flows. The bar is very high, and we're a conservative institution.  We just are. So my view has been, for a long time that you trade very carefully. You go where you've got scale. We've done that in LatAm because we basically run it out of Miami and New York. So we run it as a region, as succinct from single countries. And you go and we've done it in Hong Kong where we deal with a lot of wealthy Asian clients out of Hong Kong and Singapore, little bit in Australia, but basically, you go where you have scale.  So the more attractive path forward is likely to be through digital electronic under the brand and with good products rather than trying to build up thousands of people in, I don't know, Malaysia and Indonesia. Hence, E TRADE becomes a very interesting platform for that. Early days that the new strategy team is taking a look at what we can do internationally, but that's something I'd be very excited about. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Mike Mayo : Hi. This is the first call since you announced the partnership with Microsoft to accelerate your cloud development. Can you talk about what you hope to achieve with that with any concrete metrics possible, and ultimately, how much do you expect to have of your processing on the public cloud or a private cloud and otherwise on-premise? James Gorman : Yeah. I don't think I have off the top of my head all of those details, Mike. We do have a major deal with Microsoft, but we're also working with other Cloud providers. I won't name them on the call, but we have a long-term contract we've just done with Microsoft. It's all part of the reimagination of our technology organization.  And it's come through some programs that we put in place internally around Agile and something we called Pace that are basically designed to move this organization into this century, which I think they've done a fantastic job of. We created a group of what we call the Distinguished Engineers.  And interestingly, and people don't think of it this way, but I think we've done the biggest move in technology of any of the large banks, maybe in the world, by spending $13 billion on a technology company called E TRADE, which is basically technology and brand. The Microsoft deal is a very important one, but it's not the whole enchilada for what we're doing with our tech platform. It's just a necessary step to move a large part of our business into the cloud. And we've got, I think 3 different providers. We just happened to have the largest contract went to Microsoft on this occasion. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then a separate question on culture. I think it was like 6 or 7 years ago, you made some pretty harsh comments on compensation, and people had to take stock and they were all upset, and I guess that was the right move for you and for them. And recently, you made some other tough comments as relates to employees needing to be back in the office. And there's a big debate out there; should you have a hybrid solution? Should people be back in the office? If you work outside the office, you'd be paid less. So perhaps just my question saying, well you were right, whenever that was, 6 or 7 years ago about being -- taking the hard stance short-term for the long-term. Can you elaborate on those comments you made recently? James Gorman : Well, that's certainly not connected, and I think it was 9 years ago, I think it was 2012. We were barely profitable. We cut the dividend to $0.05. We had zero buyback and we had an ROE of about 2%. And somebody asked me in a TV interview, how would I feel about people complaining about their bonuses. And I said what I said at the time. If you don't reward your shareholders at some point, as you've reminded us over the years, Mike, when our ROE was well below 10%, they picked up their bat and ball and go home. Given we were paying employees a lot in stock, it was in their self-interest to hang tough, get a lot of stock very cheap, and they'd be rewarded.  And I'm very, very happy for our employees that that's in fact what's transpired, and the stock has gone from obviously, a very low number to where we are today. The comment I made about the workplace, I fundamentally believe that the way you and I, and others sitting in this room, Sharon and Jon, have developed their careers is by being mentored by, and watching and experiencing the professional skills of those who come before us. It's certainly dramatically affected my career. And I don't think you can do that sitting at home by yourself. I think there's a limit to how far as good as the Zoom technology is, how far they can take you. So what I said was, that I wanted people to start coming back in the office and certainly by Labor Day. But I also said, which wasn't picked up in the media, that we would be flexible where flexibility was called for. What we've learned through COVID is that under certain circumstances, having people work from home makes great sense. There are individuals who have health issues, there are individuals who looking after family members. In past years, we would have said, well, that sort of too bad. Now if you have to move to be with your family for a couple of months to look after a health issue or a family issue, we can manage that. Some people have extraordinary commutes. We can manage some flexibility around that. So -- but the basic premise and right at the beginning of COVID in February of -- what was it, 2020, I think I said when I was asked \"How would this end up?\" I think I said that I felt 80% of all employee hours worked, would be done in one of our offices. And that's probably where it's going to end up. Not 100%, but not 0%. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. I just had a question around the -- I know you mentioned earlier in terms of a [Indiscernible] around your return 17% plus return outlook early next year. I was wondering if you can talk about, as you think about the next 5 years and just the competitive forces, talk to us in how you're thinking about main -- budgeting some investment spend as it relates to R&D or more experimental-type investments that could allow you to better compete and gain market share? James Gorman : You know, I -- that would take a lot longer than we probably have on this call. Why don't we hold that until we get to the strategy discussion next year because I'd much rather tie budgeting and investment discussions to actual initiatives that were undertaken, rather than just do it in the abstract here, if you don't mind. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Gerard Cassid : Good morning, Sharon and James. Can you guys share with us, you talked about wallet share gains in the ISG Group. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on how you think you're achieving it. Some of your peers have said the same thing. Is it because of your people or the amount you've invested in technology, your size, or is it some of your competitors are just weaker and have other issues to deal with, which gives you this opening to take wallet share gains? Sharon Yeshaya : Hi Gerard. It's nice to hear from you. I'd say it's all of the above. But more importantly, I also think that there is something that we've said which is in periods of crisis, which I think you saw over the course of 2020, oftentimes, those that you are closest to from a relationship perspective end up being your closest relationship.  And you are gaining share in that regard. Very similar to what we've talked a lot about on this call about asset consolidation in a wealth management relationship. I think the same goes for the asset -- the relationship consolidation if you think about Institutional Securities. So be that on the equity underwriting, for example, be that in coming to the equity business. But not forgetting what we've done in fixed income, which is really gained shares since 2015 to be a really credible player in that marketplace. All of those things, I think technology and leveraging technology with the beginning of[MSAT] (ph)in equities moving over to the right places in fixed income where it makes sense, that investment continues. And I think it's helped us gain share as well from, like you said, probably the Europeans and others that have retreated in certain market places. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas. Your line is now open. Jeremy Sigee : Thank you. Just really a quick follow-up on net interest income in Wealth Management. I just wondered whether in your view we\u2019re sort of asset sustainable base level here and NII should now grow in line with the volumes that are coming through or are there any further moving parts that you expect to affect that? Sharon Yeshaya : Well, I would say that the fundamental moving part is rates. So if you think about it, obviously, there are certain things where when we look at giving you guidance or presenting a base case, the base case is what's priced into the marketplace. And so we use that as the guide. And that's why I think for this quarter, what we mentioned was the medium part of the curve did move more than I think that most had expected or predicted.  But as you go forward right now, at least for 2020, the build is really going to come from the actual lending which we've talked about, which is a 2020 number as what we've just given you, and we said that that ran around $18 billion for that year. So that's $4billion to $5 billion a quarter, that you can think of for the growth in lending per quarter through the end of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. I have a couple of questions just on the Investment Management and Eaton Vance. Curious, I know you mentioned that you're just integrating the sales forces for the distribution platforms, but curious about which products do you think have the most potential to be sold through the Morgan Stanley distribution on the global side as you look at the Eaton Vance product lineup today. And then within ESG, you have multiple capabilities now with Calvert and what was Legacy Morgan Stanley. How do you think about integrating that more broadly across the Investment Management segment, given the demand you're seeing- we're seeing across the industry for those types of products? Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. So I would say, sort of, similar to my last answer, which is all of the above, I think all products. But particularly, we've talked a lot about the customization of Parametric. I don't think that's just wealth management, I think that's a workplace product as well over time, so not just an advisor-led product.  Alternatives, private credit is one where I think we've seen an interest and we continue to see interest in alternatives from the wealth management franchises more broadly, not just our own. And as you think about ESG, we had always talked about Eaton Vance and the old [Anthem] (ph) being a \"perfect fit\" in terms of the two. And I think a lot of that came from the distribution and the complementary distribution that you had.  So ESG products and Calvert was an Eaton Vance product with a U.S. domestic sales force. We have a strong international sales force. And obviously, a lot of the interest in the ESG and sustainability products are also coming from Europe and abroad, and so that's where we think that that distribution can really help thinking about taking those products elsewhere. Operator *: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding Forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman. James Gorman : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, thanks for joining us. It was an exceptional third quarter this -- the firm delivered, and it's contributed to year-to-date revenues of 45 billion. To put this in context, year-to-date revenues surpassed full-year 2019 revenues by nearly 10% as of this stage. Our business model continues to generate durable revenues, high returns, and strong operating leverage, and we produced an ROTCE of over 20%, both in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Institutional Securities continues to gain share, it performed strongly across all regions and all 3 major businesses. The work we have done to integrate our businesses across the Investment Bank is clearly paying dividends. Of note, investment banking had its best quarter in history. And within that M&A also produced its own record quarter. Equities were extremely strong and fixed income was stable. The wealth management business, which includes E TRADE now, of course, is growing assets at levels far beyond what we've seen. Through the first nine months, this business added over 300 billion of net new assets, compounding growth on a client asset base of over 4.6 trillion, and we believe this is going to be an economic engine for Morgan Stanley for decades to come. The majority of our advisors had positive net new assets year-to-date. And it's this broad-based strength that's key to driving these asset levels. We're seeing momentum, though, across all our newer channels, self-directed and workplace. Self-directed client engagement remains elevated, US corporate soft claim wins increased over 90% versus last year. In the quarter, we continued to broaden our reach, especially Morgan Stanley at Work, where we now have in excess of 14 million unique relationships. While it's early days, we believe that over time, Morgan Stanley at Work will be a meaningful growth driver for the overall business providing additional connectivity to a wider range of prospective clients for broader Wealth Management services. Investment Management. Fee-based asset management revenues were $1.5 billion in the quarter. By the way, that's nearly tripled the average quarterly level of five years ago. At $1.5 trillion of assets under management represents a more diverse asset mix, further enhancing the range of bay we can provide clients. Expanded solutions and customization, sustainability, and value-added Fixed Income, along with our sizable and growing alternatives platform, position us well to capitalize on ongoing secular growth trends. Year-to-date net flows within Investment Management have exceeded $100 billion. Finally, as it relates to capital, we bought back 3.6 billion of stock, consistent with our overall capital plan, and doubled our dividends, thereby delivering shareholders a nearly 3% return. All that said, we're not complacent in what is obviously a slightly more turbulent market environment. We do expect the Federal Reserve will begin tapering soon, and that will be followed by increasing rates in 2022. We remain optimistic about the firm's position and business outlook, but we will exercise more caution if we see a significant uptick in volatility. Throughout, we remain committed to our core values that drive our culture and ensure we do business the right way. A final word on capital. As you know, SA-CCR, the Standardized Counterparty Credit Risk, regulatory changes beginning next year for the largest banks, It impacts the calculation of counterparty credit risks and thus, risk-weighted assets. We've decided to early adopt in the fourth quarter. That, of course, increases RWAs and with that lowers the implied CET1 ratio. Our current CET1 ratio, which includes the impact of our recently doubled dividend and our buyback as of the third quarter is 16%. The pro forma impact of CECA, absent further mitigation, could theoretically reduce that by approximately 120 basis points. Of course, we have a lot of flexibility to mitigate, and that work has already begun. But early adoption allows us to pick up a benefit in the future which may itself offset a part of this impact over time. I am now going to turn the call over to Sharon and discuss -- she will discuss the quarter in greater detail and then we'll both take your questions. Thank you. Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion in the third quarter, once again, representing 1 of the top 3 quarters of the last decade. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $2.04 and our ROTCE was 20.2%. Year-to-date revenues reached a record of $45.2 billion. Institutional Securities continue to power performance with particular strength in investment banking and equities. Wealth management and investment management each set year-to-date records. While investing for growth, our business model demonstrated operating leverage. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio improved to 67%. Now, to the businesses. Institutional Securities delivered an extremely strong quarter with $7.5 billion in revenues. Year-to-date, the revenues of $23.2 billion were the strongest in over a decade. The integrated investment bank is working seamlessly to serve our clients and to gain share. B balance revenues supported overall results. Advisory, in particular, was a standout with record quarterly and year-to-date performance. Importantly, Institutional Securities is delivering remarkable operating leverage. The pretax margin, which was 38% year-to-date, has significantly contributed to the firm's strong efficiency ratio this year. Investment Banking revenues were a record of $2.8 billion, increasing 67% from the prior year. Exceptional performance in advisory and continued strength in underwriting drove the quarter's results. The Americas and Europe led the year-over-year increase. Advisory revenues were a record $1.3 billion reflecting increased completed M&A activity versus the prior year. Results were supported by greater sector diversification compared to last year. Equity underwriting revenues were $1 billion, marking the fourth consecutive quarter at/or above this level. The increase from the prior year was driven by strength across products. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $567 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by strength in non-investment grade loans supported by the combination of the rate environment, and elevated levels of event-driven activity. Investment Banking pipelines remain healthy across sectors and regions. And activity is expected to continue on the back of current momentum. Financial sponsors are deploying capital and corporate clients are looking for strategic opportunities as a source for growth. Equity revenues were very strong, increasing 24% from the prior year to $2.9 billion. Our equities business remains a global leader. Results benefited from sustained client activities throughout the quarter. Revenues in Asia were particularly strong, underscoring the importance of our diversified global footprint. Cash and derivative revenues were both higher versus the prior year. Broad-based client engagement continued through the summer months. Prime brokerage revenues increased versus last year on higher equity market levels. Fixed Income revenues declined from the strong prior year to $1.6 billion. Still, the business delivered a solid third quarter. Micro results remained above historical averages but reflected lower revenues and securitized products and credit corporates compared to the prior year, which benefited from a wider bid-offer spread. Macro also declined versus last year, with lower revenues in both rates and foreign exchange. Commodities were strong and revenues improved versus the prior year, as North America's power and gas benefited from robust client activity. Turning to Wealth Management, the prior quarter will be a more relevant benchmark as a comparison period, given the acquisition of E-TRADE, Revenues were $5.9 billion, down 3% from the prior quarter. However, excluding the impact of DCP, which declined by approximately $300 million, the revenues increased 2%. Integration-related costs were $113 million. Excluding integration-related expenses, PBT was $1.6 billion, and the margin was 27.7%. We realized a record of $135 billion of net new assets, which underscores the power of the asset gathering platform we have built. Net new assets in the quarter were strong and balanced, inclusive of assets from existing clients and new clients, stock and investing events, and net recruiting. Year-to-date NNA exceeds $300 billion representing a 10% annualized growth rate of beginning period assets. In the quarter, we added $43 billion of predominantly retirement assets through an asset acquisition. These incremental assets are reflected in total client assets, fee-based assets, net new assets, and fee-based flows. We are particularly excited about the approximately 600,000 participants associated with these retirement assets, who will now have access to educational content and analytical tools, delivered through the financial wellness platform. Deepening these relationships and ultimately converting workplace relationships to an advisor, lead, or self-directed clients based on their individual needs. It's at the core of our expansion strategy. The workplace channel serves as an asset acquisition funnel, that will fuel our growth over time. We are excited by the momentum in the workplace. Year-to-date, new stock plan participants have more than doubled. We have nearly $500 billion in invested assets. In the quarter, transactional revenues were $832 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues declined 4% in line with seasonal patterns. Self-directed daily average tradings were approximately $960,000 in the Quarter. In line with the average level for the full year of 2020. While moderating from the exceptionally high activity seen earlier this year, client engagement remains high. Darts this quarter was 3 times above E TRADE's pre-acquisition record. Asset Management revenues were $3.6, billion up 5% sequentially, Year-to-date, these revenues increased 29% to a record $10.3 billion. The strength in fee-based flow supports our view that clients first consolidate assets onto our platform and then migrate these assets to the advisory. Bank lending balances grew $7 billion sequentially to $121 billion and have grown 23% year-to-date. Growth in securities-based lending and mortgages drove the increase, reflecting strong client demand for new lines and increased household participation. Net interest income was $1.3 billion. Prepayment amortization was negligible in the quarter, but it did impact the sequential move. Excluding prepaying for both quarters, NII was up 4%, benefiting from the incremental growth in lending balances and decreased deposit costs. For the remainder of the year, we expect NII to build sequentially on the back of loan growth at a pace slightly below the third quarter. The integration of E TRADE remains on track. Today, dual clients of E TRADE and Morgan Stanley can choose to provide their Morgan Stanley advisor with visibility into their E TRADE accounts. By year-end, clients will be able to link their self-directed accounts via single sign-on building on our digital client experience. Moving to investment management. The timing of the Eaton Vance acquisition makes the prior quarter a more relevant benchmark. Revenues were $1.5 billion declining 15%, while asset management and related fees rose sequentially, the increase was offset by lower performance-based income and other revenue. Total AUM remains strong at $1.5 trillion. Net -- total net flows were $12.3 billion in the quarter, driven by liquidity and overlay services. Long-term flows reflected a single redemption of $7.5 billion in our solutions business by a large asset manager. The redemption was approximately half of the asset manager's AUM with us. We expect the remainder of the AUM to be redeemed in the first half of 2022, as the asset manager brings its equity, trading implementation in-house. Excluding this idiosyncratic outflow, we saw positive long-term net flows, with continued demand for parametric, customized portfolios, private real estate, and private credit, and sustainable strategies through both Calvert and funds. Asset management and related fees were $1.5 billion, reflecting the high proportion of durable and recurring revenues in this business. Performance-based income and other revenues were a loss of $17 million in the quarter. Gains across the platform were offset by lower accrued carried interest in our Asia private equity business, primarily driven by a single underlying public investment in one of the funds. The broadening of our growing alternatives portfolio helped mitigate this overall impact. Finally, the integration with Eaton Vance remains on pace. We continue to invest in secular growth areas, particularly sustainability, alternative, and customization for Wealth Management platforms and clients. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets increased to $1.2 trillion. Risk-weighted assets grew by approximately $11 billion, primarily driven by increased client activity in the quarter. We continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to shareholders and are executing on our $12 billion buyback authorization, buying back $3.6 billion of stock in the quarter. Our standardized CET1 ratio now stands at 16%. As James mentioned, we intend to early adopt SA-CCR during the fourth quarter this year, after taking into consideration the potential benefits to certain capital metrics, such as the future SCB calculations. With our current portfolio size and mix, the adoption would imply an estimated increase to our risk-weighted assets of approximately 35 to $45 billion. This would also apply a reduction to our CET1 ratio by approximately 120 basis points upon adoption. We have commenced mitigation efforts that should offset some of the impacts to our CET1 ratio. We will continue to remain well-capitalized post the adoption of SA-CCR. We continue to benefit from the diversification of our franchise. The firm is firing on all cylinders as we enter the end of the year on a strong footing. We're capturing share and Institutional Securities. Clients remain engaged and pipelines are healthy. We are excited by the momentum we've seen in Wealth Management's ability to attract and consolidate assets, and the benefits of the improved diversification in Investment Management. Importantly, we are meaningfully investing in technology across all of our businesses. With that, we will now open the lineup to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. I'm curious. The flows in the Wealth Management channel continue to impress. I think you guys are by far the largest distributor of alternative assets, and as that space grows and as that becomes a bigger part of a client portfolio, I wonder if you could help us frame -- have you ever broken out either the asset level or percentage of high net worth portfolios that you have today versus where you think that can grow to? Sharon Yeshaya : I think. Hi Glenn. It's Sharon. I think if memory serves me, there was a strategy deck that we did in 2017 or '18 that does give a portfolio mix that you can see for advisory lead assets. So it can give you some sense, rough sense from those documents. What I would say though is that I had also noticed this trend. When we go through it, there has been a slight shift. But you're obviously talking about a very large asset base. But I would definitely say that both anecdotally, and it does bear out in some of the numbers that you see a slight increase towards alternatives as a composition of the portfolio. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Just a quick follow-up on your SA-CCR comments, because they were reasonably comprehensive. Which specific assets are most impacted? Just so I can think through mitigation and how much of an impact it can make. And then I'm curious, what does early adoption do for you besides brownie points, like. how does that possibly help in future SA - CCRs? James Gorman : Glenn, in case you're confused, this is James. The accents are so different. On SA - CCR -- I mean, it depicts counterparty credit risks, there were models that were in place, that Basel has been working on replacing. They actually started in 2014. And the idea was to implement it in 2017. And they relate to most of the derivative contracts and the determination where their margin and not margin have to treat that from a risk-weighted asset perspective. So there's a complicated formula that applies the weighting to default risk and then the NPV of future payment obligations under various contracts. So it's taken a while for them to get it done. They actually deferred it, I think, during COVID. They've given the banks till the beginning of next year to get -- to put it in place and they are allowing banks to pre-announce the benefit of starting early if it affects the peak-to-trough in your SA-CCR calculations during the SA - CCR cycles. So there will be some offsets later. And we just felt, we need to get -- we needed to get into it sooner rather than later. Most of it is in ISG. I think about if let's say the RWA number, I think we've got at $35 to $45 billion, honestly, that's moving around a little bit because we are -- this is complicated stuff. But we've certainly done the end's worst, and hopefully, it's the lower end of that. Some of it is in the wealth business because of all the options in that business, but it's a relatively small part of it, but I think like 10%, 15%. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to start on net new assets in Wealth. Sharon, I believe you flagged an acquisition of a retirement business. Number 1, this is basically just the team, right, of consultants that all sit within wealth. So it could be a call to large-scale recruiting. Is that fair? And number 2 is the idea that you guys are interested in getting -- more importantly and more strategically, is the idea that you guys want to get a little more aggressive in 401K, DC plans in order to complement the stock plan business and enhance the workplace offering? Sharon Yeshaya : I'd say in -- holistically, Brennan, nice question. Thank you. It's fair. I think that it is a large-scale team that you can consider in terms of that asset acquisition. I think that as you rightly point out, it is an extension of our strategy. And what you're really trying to think about is how do you get more participants that you can touch, that you can begin to sell both products and assets that are appropriate for them, but more than that, offer them true services like financial wellness that we're already doing through the stock plan business. If you think of retirement assets and then you think of who is the actual holder of those retirement assets. And those are the participants. So through municipalities, pensions, et cetera, and all of a sudden you have just another layer of people that you first offer, financial wellness and education to. And then you can introduce them to the services that Morgan Stanley has, the same way that you would introduce the services to a workplace client. So an extension of the strategy and a continuation of the concept of the funnel. James Gorman : My key takeaway on -- because this is a very important topic broadly. My key takeaway on it is, we used to have a very monolithic model for asset gathering. You had existing clients who may be brought new money to you from other institutions or accumulated wealth. They also spent wealth, so that would go up and down. You had financial biases about who left and who you're recruited. And for many is, we were frankly net deficit of financial advisors as frankly most of the broker dealer is in my 30 years of doing this. A couple of years ago, the net deficit changed materially for us. We are seeing net positive attrition, very few advisors leaving and significant advisors come in particularly large teams from across the street in the banking industry. So that's positive. The channel that the workplaces opened up and the opportunity to gather assets, which was a part of the driver between -- behind this quarter's numbers is basically a new channel. And then obviously the E TRADE channel is a new channel, and now you're seeing this sort of acquisition of RIA type teams of which this is one, so it's gone from one model, a defense and a tack model of keep you people and try and get some of the marketplaces to our multi-pronged model, which if we obviously, we can't predict the future, but it looks like this is set up to have multiple channels of growth in the years ahead, which is the strategy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So sticking along that same topic of just the corporate stock plan business, it looks like the organic growth continues to sustain really strong momentum in terms of new corporate stock plan ads. And I was just curious how client conversion levels are tracking today. Within your ecosystem relative to the level as you were seeing prior to the E TRADE deal. And was hoping you could just provide a broader update, not just on the corporate stock plan momentum, but even just how you're tracking with the revenue synergy targets from E TRADE s and to announce the deal. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. It's nice to speak to you, Steve. So I would just echo what you said. Yes, we saw US stock plan wins increase by 90% over last year. So just to put that out there and put it in perspective. As you think about conversion, we're still working through some of the metrics as it relates to retention, but anecdotally we are seeing strong retention. Obviously, there were different metrics as you think about what E TRADE defined as retention and how you might define retention going forward given this new structure. But I think that the synergies as they've played out are very strong. We obviously never gave a direct revenues target. But if you think about what E TRADE was doing, it's -- the concept was always, well, how you think about the whole spectrum of client wealth. And so we're seeing our teams work very closely together. We're thinking about new ways to offer Morgan Stanley services like research, et cetera, and advice that you would see through your advisor also through your E TRADE portal. And all of that's really much interacting on -- we continue to think about meeting our companion accounts for example, which was 50% right now and 90% in the U.S. accounts by next year. So all of those sorts of touchpoints and milestones are on track and we look forward to giving you, I think more detail as you think about the January deck next year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Bernard Von Gizycki : Yes. Hi. Good morning. This is actually Bernie Von Gizycki from Maxim, thanks for taking my question. My question relates to the Investment Banking backdrop and how it relates to direct listings. Investment Banking results are very strong. And as you previously noted, pipelines remain healthy across sectors and regions, and momentum should continue. So with that said, there's been a number of direct listings this year versus just 1 in 2018. Given Morgan Stanley has been an advisor on a number of these deals, could you share your observations if the increase of these private to public structures, although small in numbers still have been more of a byproduct of a favorable market backdrop? Or is it more of a structural change in the private markets? And any comments you could share on future industry pipelines for direct listings. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. I think that key point that we've always said about direct listings is that it's another tool in the toolkit and it's really dependent on the client situation and the needs at that point in time. So these are specific situations, but I would say that that's, while potentially can be a contributor to the advisory results, what I would focus you on for advisory are two things. One is the diversification across the sectors and the geography. So what we're seeing is not just one product necessarily driving results, or one sector driving results, but rather that the pipeline broadly is healthy. And as James said, last year, we continue to invest in this business. So I think that's sort of where we -- how we think about the business going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital. Your line is now open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, Sharon, James. Can you guys share with us -- obviously, the markets have been very strong. You guys have done a great job, obviously, in capturing that growth along with some of your peers. Do you have any sense of what normal -- what normalization would be in the markets and how you would put -- -- what kind of market share you could maintain in a more normalized market, whether that's somewhere between 2019 and today, but any color there? And then second, James, you talked about increased volatility. What are some of the metrics you're looking at to measure if the markets became more volatile and you guys would maybe get a little more defensive? Thank you. James Gorman : Well, on the normalized markets, it's clearly being a major shift between the U.S. and non-U.S. institutions post-crisis. And I'm talking about capital markets here, Gerard. It's the barriers to entry for those businesses. If you look, a lot of the regional banks and investment banks that tried to be global investment banks and didn't work out so well, the scale economics over the barriers to entry are just so large. And frankly, the technology is so demanding and complex that it's pretty hard to be a wannabe or a new entrant trying to break into the group that is dominating the global flow of capital markets. And within that, we are obviously performing very well. We've picked up a lot of shares consistently across fixed income and equities, and increasingly in banking over the last several years. I don't see that abating. I mean, I don't see a compelling reason why that would change in the wealth and asset management space, again scale is your friend, we've done two huge deals in the last year and then Smith Barney a decade ago at 6.5- ish trillion, clearly at scale, we're one of the biggest asset managers and Wealth Managers in the world, and that generates about 30 billion revenue. Again, it's hard to pick up advisors one-by-one. And there aren't that many firms out there of the size that really moves the needle on the scale, and there aren't really any direct firms of size. You saw the Meritrade deal which combined 2 competitors, you've got Fidelity, you've got a couple of smaller ones, but each was kind of the last big one that was available. So I'm pretty confident about our market position. I don't see why it would deteriorate at this point. Doesn't mean it can't, I mean, but that would be more internal what we've done to ourselves than external what the market is going to do to us, is my gut on that. On volatility, I mean, you're just -- you're looking at all sorts of stuff. You're looking at day-to-day movements in market prices, you're looking at when when the Fed starts tapering what the impact of the market is, what they start signaling terms of how many DOT suggests there will be rate increases next year. It's gone from, I think, 4 to 9. That's going to introduce volatility. Some of the geopolitical discussions around obviously U.S.- China relationships, Taiwan -- injects volatility. Like anything we look at monetary policy, inflation numbers, geopolitics, and then see how that bleeds into market activity. And from that we get -- we sort of dial-up or down on the margin, a risk then you're looking -- you look at specific transactions, you look at multiples of EBITDA the deals are done at. You're looking at days of distribution on syndicated deals. I mean, there's a lot of more tactical stuff. But I try and take a thematic view. My thematic view is, it's good to be watchful right now. There's certainly nothing to suggest there are any issues, but it's -- the markets are bouncing a little bit, and over the next 18 months, we'll see more of that as the Fed starts to move. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Mike Mayo : Hi. Can you hear me? James Gorman : Yes, Mike. Hey. Mike Mayo : Hey, how are you doing? Look, during the quarter you made what seemed like a pretty significant announcement with a partnership with Microsoft, and I'm not really sure about the ramifications of that. Does it look like you're going to use Microsoft to transition more to the public cloud if I have that correctly? And then you're also going to be providing services to Microsoft to help them position their business, but I wasn't really clear on that. So if you could get -- a dimension that, talk about maybe efficiency benefits by using the cloud, how much do you want to transition your workload to the cloud? And then what is it that you'd be doing in return? James Gorman : It was an important deal. Obviously, Microsoft is one of the great companies in the world, if not the largest Company in the world. So fantastic partner for us. We did do a multi-year deal with them. I won't give you the financials as you would understand. But a multi-year deal with them, and by the way, they are not the only cloud provider we use. We use -- there are great players in AWS and Google, and we have relationships with all of them, but we wanted to make a significant move. It gives us more capacity to process and analyze data, gives us time-to-market tools. There's more resilience and flexibility in the Cloud. Obviously, some of the digital initiatives that we're using to improve our client experience, we do through the Cloud. So it's one of the pillars of our technology strategy. We've tried to drive more innovation across our businesses. If you look at what we've done in Wealth Management with some of the virtual financial advisors, the lead IQ platform, and the next best ideas, these kinds of things, they are all AI-driven. And I think what you're seeing is with first, the acquisition of Solium, and then an E Trade, our wealth businesses have a much, much stronger technology backbone, and we've been driving a lot of innovation in that space. The Cloud decision with Microsoft is really a corporate one, and I think would just lead to a much more efficient Morgan Stanley and more resilient by the way. But it's not totally -- it's Microsoft, we're very proud of our partnership with them, but we're a huge Company and we're going to keep evolving. We have developed a special relationship with them on some other things that we worked on, that I don't want to go into, obviously, on the call, that's between us and Microsoft, but it's a great move, Mike, we're really happy about it. Mike Mayo : So can you dimension what you think the potential savings are, or how much workload you might move or give us some sense of -- I think what we're finding is some banks like Capital One are 100% on the public cloud. And then there's a series of other banks that don't really want to be on the public cloud. Where are you in that continuum? Do you want to have more of a private cloud or do you want to be one to the public cloud? And what kind of savings do you think you could get? James Gorman : I kind of mentioned savings. Obviously, we're balancing it between both private and public. Capital One is a very different business model. They don't do M&A, they don't underwrite equity deals that have global trading businesses. So, It's really a function of -- you drive your technology decisions based upon the path to innovation and what your business model needs to support different technologies. One of the programs Rob Rooney and the team set up several years ago was something we call our distinguished engineers. We have some unbelievably capable engineers, software engineers, computer scientists around the world, who work with us and we've created a cohort where they're basically driving and feeding innovation across the firm. So no, I can't break it down to a simple you go to the cloud and it will improve our efficiency ratio by 1.2%. It just, I can't do that. But I do know that when you drive it down into the actual business activities, it's making us both a more efficient, more resilient, and faster-moving player. And frankly, being in partnership with Microsoft is a very good thing for Morgan Stanley. They're best-in-class as a Company -- as a tech Company. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could expand a bit on the advisor trends, you talked about larger advisor groups coming over the recruiting. Could you maybe put some numbers around that in the context of maybe previous periods a year ago, or something prior to that, and maybe the backlog or the outlook for advisor growth as you think about the next 12 month time period? James Gorman : Yeah, we don't -- Dan we don't put out numbers on ATRO teams that we bring in. We have a weekly report which I get every Friday night, about 7 :15. And scrutinize that pretty closely and it shows which people we've recruited, what their trailing 12 months revenue are, what their assets are, and then which funds that we lose to different competition and what the sources are, where they're going to. And as I said, I've been doing this a long time at my previous firm, and here, for most of that period, we were net deficit. We were losing advisors to RIAs. We're moving this sometimes to private banks. You are losing some of the smaller producers to places like Linsco Private Ledger. That has all turned. And I think the power of the brand, I mean if you're -- the beauty of having this integrated Investment bank combined with this wealth and asset management business is you've now got world-class Parametric, Calvert sustainability funds to offer our advisors, world-class whole platforms through infrastructure, means finance, private equity, real estate. But you've also got new issuance. I mean, we're so active in the equity markets that if you're a world-class advisor managing -- some of our advisors have teams of -- they're managing books of 20 and 30 billion. They are enormous operations themselves. So if -- do you want to take a book of several billion dollars to a firm that is not a global leader in the equities markets, and is not a global leader in underwriting? I don't think so. So we've got a huge competitive advantage by having such a world-class investment bank, which feeds the advisors plus the research, which we amortized across the cost of all the three platforms, enables us to invest more in research than you do if you were just a wealth shop, or you were just an institutional shop. So again, we don't break down individual teams, but -- and it's more than any total. I have the numbers obviously in front of me. Well not literally in front of me, but in my office. And it's real, we're getting very big teams coming in. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Devin Ryan : Great morning. I want to come back to some of the comments on Investment Banking strength and the expected ongoing momentum there. It feels like a number of the areas are still actually seeing acceleration, even in the third quarter advisory. And so that's driving investor questions around, how much of this is structural versus just being in a great cycle. And as we think about Sharon, some of the comments you made about sponsors playing a bigger role. I'm just curious, how you guys would quantify how much bigger that part of your business is today, relative to maybe a few years ago. Because clearly, that's an area where there's more capital and sponsors are kind of always transacting. So just love to get some sense of how much bigger that is and whether that could continue? Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. I think that if you think about sponsors and -- but if you really think about everything, right? What's gone on is you have cash that you've raised, and debt in other parts of the market, given where the industry was at the beginning of the pandemic. And so you have the cash that needs to be deployed, be that either from a corporate or from a sponsor, et cetera. And as you push that through the system, people are looking for opportunities for growth be that from the corporate lens or from the financial sponsor's lens. So I would say that it's an active part of the business. It's not the only part of the business though, and that's the point that I was trying to make before when I mentioned sector diversification. So you might look at a financial sponsor of the sector, but you can also think about all different types of materials or retail or consumer discretionary, etc. All of that -- -- that pie in terms of where it's coming from, is changing. And that diversification I think is what's helping the activity. And I think that corporations are looking for growth. And so I'd say that it's not just one sleeve that is driving what -- the results that you saw, at least over the course of this quarter and the future pipeline. Devin Ryan : Sure. Okay. I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up to your Wealth Management terrific momentum on the lending side. As we think about the evolution here of Morgan Stanley winning a higher percentage of the overall customer's Balance Sheet or their wallet, where do you guys feel like you are at the moment on the liability side relative to the potential? And then are there any other products there that could be the same kind of extension or a focus for growth? Sharon Yeshaya : I think that it continues to be the beginning of that process. And so when you think about where we came from, and then the penetration that we've seen from the household side, the numbers are still small. And so while there is a loan growth momentum, and we've obviously done quite well, there's a technology that James mentioned that's also in the loan space. So if you are an advisor and you see somebody or you receive information that they've looked -- that your client has listed a mortgage calculator, for example, you'll get notified. You will speak to your client about the product that you might have. And so I think that that extension of how you use technology to service your client better. And then also just the sheer numbers given that we became a bank later in our life cycle provides a further runway for growth along with that space. James Gorman : And I would just add a few -- when we bought E TRADE, they had a relatively small loan book, and that was for good reason. I don't know if you remember Devin, but I forget exactly what year was it was probably '05, '06 when they had problems with this large hillock portfolio they had, and that made them very gun-shy about the lending space. So with -- just our mortgage product alone has the enormous capacity with the E TRADE clients. That's even before you get to start to think about the stock plan clients ultimately. We just think about converting their equity grants into accounts, that's project number 1, but project number two is obviously managing their full liability side as well. So a lot of space to go. Devin Ryan : Okay. Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with SocGen. Your line is now open. Andrew Lim : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So crypto has been in the news lately and I just wanted to get your view on how you expect that space to develop and your strategy, and how to offer products to clients. How do you expect to engage with clients in the crypto space? James Gorman : We're not directly trading crypto for retail clients and there are other players who are choosing to do that. We give access to them to buy crypto through various funds and things. But listen. I've said it publicly before, I'll say it again. I don't think crypto's a fad. That doesn't mean it's going to go away. I don't know what the value of -- I don't know what the value of Bitcoin should or shouldn't be, but these things aren't going away and the blockchain technology supporting it is obviously very real and powerful, so it remains Andrew a working space. But for us, honestly, it's just not a huge part of the business demand from our clients. And that may evolve and we'll evolve with it. But right now, it's certainly not what's driving or economics one way or the other. But we're watchful of it, we're respectful and we'll wait and see other regulators handle it. Andrew Lim : That was great. Thanks a lot for that. James Gorman : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer.  During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplements, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release and strategic update. Within the strategic update, certain reported information has been adjusted as noted. These adjustments were made to provide a transparent and comparative view of our operating performance against our strategic objectives. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP adjusted operating performance metrics are included in the notes to the presentation of the earnings release. Morgan Stanley closed its acquisition of E TRADE on October 2, 2020, impacting annual comparisons for the Firm and Wealth Management and closed its acquisition of Eaton Vance on March 1, 2021, impacting period-over-period comparisons for the Firm and Investment Management. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman. James Gorman : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Morgan Stanley delivered another record year of profits and results in 2021, generating a full year ROTCE of 20%. Performance was strong in each business. In Institutional Securities, we showed strength and gained share. And in Wealth Management, we added over $430 billion of net new assets, bringing total client assets to nearly $5 trillion. We drove our strategic vision forward Investment Management, successfully closing our acquisition of Eaton Vance in the year and created a premier asset manager, which itself has $1.6 trillion of assets under management. Sharon will discuss the details of the quarter and the full year shortly. But first, as always, I will walk through our annual strategic updates. If you turn to the document and start on Slide 3. At the beginning of last year, we set two-year objectives with the expectation that 2021 would be a transition year as we work through our integrations. Clearly, the Firm's performance exceeded the expectations we had for 2021 heading into that year. With the early successes of the E TRADE and Eaton Vance acquisitions and the Firm's overall momentum, we entered 2022 ahead of plan. Turning to Slide 4. First, I'll focus on our 12-year transformation and where the Firm is today. History offers perspective on our track record. Next, I'll highlight where we've built unique competitive advantages around each of our businesses and how we expect to grow and maintain our leading positions. Then I will address our continued commitment to return capital to our shareholders. And finally, I'll touch on how, when taken together, this should lead to further multiple expansion. To begin with our longer-term evolution, Slide 5 highlights the transformation of Morgan Stanley into a more balanced, higher returning firm today. Total revenues are more than double the level of 2009 with each business significantly growing and contributing to the Firm's enhanced profitability. Each of our businesses now have defensible and sustainable competitive advantages to protect and drive their leading positions. Start with Institutional Securities on Slide 6. Looking back to 2014, when we had recovered from the financial crisis, but before we reset our strategy and restructured some of this business, we've increased share both overall and individually across business lines. Share continues to aggregate to the industry leaders, and we expect this trend to hold. Our competitive position is strong, and as demonstrated in the very active markets for the last two years, we are confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities to hold, if not gain, share across the division. Moving to Slide 7. Our integrated investment bank delivered $30 billion of revenues in 2021 and continues to demonstrate operating leverage, highlighted by our expanding margins. Our footprint is balanced around the world, putting us in a leading tier of investment banks with global scale. Our franchise has never been stronger, and we have seen tangible results from the collaboration between our segments. Shifting to Wealth Management on Slide 8. The growth we have seen in 2021 has been unprecedented. We added nearly $1 trillion in client assets in a single year. Scale advantages propelled growth, and we added $438 billion of net new assets in the last 12 months. This predominantly organic growth is the result of our consistent and focused execution on our integration and expansion initiatives and puts us in a leading position. The journey over the last few years has demonstrated the out of the possible. With respect to net new asset growth, this business has gone from very low single digits in the last decade to 4% to 6% more recently to unprecedented growth this year. Obviously, it's still early days, but the verticals are in place. Before we commit to specific guidance for net new asset growth, we need more time to better understand the power of these channels. But what I can tell you is that the proof points are strong, and we feel great about where we are today in the business potential. Turning to Slide 9. With the top advisor-led business in the industry, complemented by leading workplace and self-directed offerings, the wealth franchise we've built as a category 1. We already serve nearly $5 trillion of client assets, and overall revenue on assets remains high over 50 basis points, underlining this segment is -- underlining this segment as an economic engine for the Firm. As we think about the growth ahead, we are most excited about the nearly 15 million relationships we have across channels and the potential to deepen those relationships further and consolidate client on to the platform. On Slide 10, we look more closely at workplace, which I'm incredibly excited about for the future. As we've said before, we see this channel as a funnel for client and asset acquisition to sustain growth going forward. We now have over $500 billion of unvested assets in this channel and expect to retain an increasing proportion as they vest. In 2021, we had a 24% retention rate. That compares with 21% the previous year. Given our focused effort, our long-term goal is to reach 30% retention. This new metric illustrates the strength of the workplace business to augment net new assets to Wealth Management. Moving to Investment Management on Slide 11. Our platform has transformed into premier and growing asset manager. Our distinctive capabilities enable us to deliver differentiated client value as endorsed by $115 billion of net flows in the year. Total AUM is now $1.6 trillion, and our more durable asset management fees are nearly triple what they were in 2014. If you look closely with our Investment Management business on Slide 12, you can see we're a leader and growing where it matters most. Customization, specifically direct indexing through the premier Parametric brand, sustainability and alternatives are each areas of increasing client demand. We've strengthened our position across these categories with robust investment our capabilities, and we've seen meaningful asset under management growth as a result. Moreover, the complementary nature of distribution networks with Eaton Vance's powerful U.S. retail distribution capabilities and MSIM's strength in international distribution enhances our client reach. We're encouraged by early signs of success in leveraging the greater combined network, along with our world-class equity franchise and value-added fixed income platform, and we expect these areas will continue to drive growth into the future. Finally, on Slide 11, as we look ahead, we expect rates to rise. We expect approximately $500 million of incremental NII in Wealth Management this year based on the year-end forward curve. Additionally, we expect another $200 million this year from the reversal of fee waivers in our Investment Management business. To further measure our rate sensitivity, we look at what happens if there is an incremental 100 basis point parallel shift in rates beyond the curve. That would deliver another $1.3 billion, which largely goes to the bottom line. While we certainly don't expect this additional shift to happen this year, the Firm will clearly benefit substantially as rates rise over the next several years. Pivoting to our capital return strategy on Slide 14. Our increased earnings power, supported by revenues from more durable sources, has enabled us to double our annualized dividend to $2.80 just last year while, at the same time, executing on meaningful share repurchases. Notwithstanding the returns we're making to shareholders and the investments we make in our business, we continue to have an excess capital position. Our CET1 ratio was 16% at year-end after paying our dividend, executing on our repurchase plan and accounting for the impact of SA-CCR. And as further illustrated on Slide 15, a growing net income has provided us the flexibility to reduce our share count. While we added 300 million shares from our 2 large acquisitions of E TRADE and Eaton Vance, we continue to execute on our meaningful buyback program and have brought back our share count back to just under $1.8 billion from $2 billion in 2014. Taking all this together, Slide 16 highlights the fundamentals we have in place to drive future multiple expansion. We have scale, significant growth opportunities in wealth and investment management, coupled with a leading institutional business, and a strong commitment to capital return. The Morgan Stanley brand has never been stronger. We've been fortunate enough to acquire additional brands in the last few years that have tremendous value in expanding our footprint. The sum of these elements supports multiple expansion for the combined company. Slide 17 shows our performance goals. Of note, we are increasing our ROTCE goal to reflect the earnings power we see in our business model. We are laser focused on delivering value to our clients, our shareholders and our employees, and we believe an ROTCE in excess of 20% is achievable. As we look to the longer term, with the support of our track record behind us, we're adding a new goal, a long-term goal to achieve $10 trillion in client assets across Wealth and Investment Management.  As always, our targets are subject, of course, to major market moves or changes in the economic, political and regulatory environment. However, with the outlook we have now, we fully expect to achieve our goals. I'll now turn the call over to Sharon, who will discuss our fourth quarter and annual results. And together, we will take your questions. Thank you. Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you, and good morning. The Firm produced record revenues of $59.8 billion in 2021 and ended the year on a strong footing with fourth quarter revenues of $14.5 billion. All 3 businesses contributed to the extremely strong full year results, reflecting high levels of client engagement and active market. Excluding integration-related expenses, our ROTCE was 20.2% for the full year and 20.4% for the fourth quarter, and EPS was $8.22 and $2.08, respectively. Even while investing in our business, we continue to demonstrate operating leverage led by Institutional Securities. The full year efficiency ratio was 67.1%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our full year efficiency ratio was 66.3%, down from 68.4% in 2020. Total expenses in the year were [$40.1 billion]. The increase in total expenses versus the prior year reflects the addition of E TRADE and Eaton Vance and the integration-related costs and higher compensation on higher revenues. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities delivered excellent full year performance with record revenues of $29.8 billion. In the fourth quarter, revenues were $6.7 billion. Our integrated approach, global footprint and balance across business lines continues to distinguish our model. Underscoring the operating leverage in the business, pretax margin was 39.6% for the full year, increasing from 34.6% in the prior year. Investment Banking revenues were a record $10.3 billion for the full year. While each business delivered record results, Advisory and Equity underwriting led the year-over-year improvement. Corporate clients actively pursued strategic opportunities and sponsor-deployed capital. IPO issuances were exceptionally robust in the year. And from a geographical perspective, results were led by the Americas, along with sustained strength in EMEA. Fourth quarter revenues of $20.4 billion -- excuse me, of from the prior year driven by strength in Advisory. Trends from the third quarter persisted, particularly as results benefited from a broadening of transactions across sectors. Although underwriting revenues moderated overall, equity issuance was strong, and elevated levels of event-driven activity supported fixed income. We continue to invest in our Investment Banking business. Our outlook entering 2022 is strong, and our pipelines continue to be healthy across products. CEO confidence remains high, and markets remain open and constructive. Additionally, Advisory transactions should support strong capital market issuance. Equity full year revenues were a record $11.4 billion, increasing 15% from the prior year as client engagement remained high. The increase versus the prior year was driven by strength in prime brokerage and, from a geographical perspective, Asia. Revenues were $2.9 billion in the quarter. Increased revenues in prime brokerage on higher client balances were offset by declines in cash and derivatives on lower client activity versus the prior fourth quarter. This quarter also included a mark-to-market gain of $225 million on a certain strategic investment. Fixed income revenues were $7.5 billion for the full year, declining 15% from the last year's exceptional results. The full year decline was driven by tighter bid offer spreads in macro and credit corporates partially offset by securitized products. Quarterly revenues of $1.2 billion were 31% lower than the prior year, reflecting a challenging trading environment and rates and lower volumes and tighter bid offer spreads and credit. Further, client engagement tempered in December, reflecting seasonal patterns impacting results. Turning to Wealth Management. For the full year, Wealth Management produced record revenues of $24.2 billion and a PBT margin of 25.5%. Excluding $346 million of integration-related expenses, the PBT margin was 26.9%. Fourth quarter revenues were $6.3 billion, up 10% from the prior year, and the PBT margin was 22.6%. Excluding integration-related expenses of $109 million, the PBT margin for the quarter was 24.4%. Quarterly margin was negatively impacted by seasonal expenses and certain compensation and benefits decisions made to further support our employees. Given the full annual impact of these decisions was taken in the fourth quarter, the impact was amplified in this quarter's margin. Going forward, this will be spread throughout the year pro rata. As we look ahead to the first quarter of 2022, we expect the PBT margin to be more in line with the 2021 full year margin, excluding integration-related expenses. This business continues to benefit from strong client demand across the platform. Client assets grew nearly $1 trillion this year and now stands at $4.9 trillion. Fee-based flows were an incredible $179 billion in the year, recording growth in fee-based assets of $1.8 trillion or 25% higher than last year. In the quarter, asset management revenues were $3.7 billion. Net new assets of $438 million in the year represent 11% annual growth of beginning period assets. Momentum was carried through the fourth quarter, which saw net new assets of $127 billion. We saw strong asset generation from both existing clients and net new clients driven by the advisor-led channel. We remain a destination of choice for advisors and continue to add strong teams and retain productive advisors. Net new assets growth is further buoyed by positive momentum in our newer channels, namely workplace. Our results demonstrate the tremendous asset generation capability of our platform. Transactional revenues in the fourth quarter were $1 billion, declining 23% from the prior year, excluding the impact of DCP, which declined by approximately $300 million versus prior year, revenues were flat. The workplace continues to gain traction. Our total number of participants we now read stands at 5.6 million, 14% higher than last year, and unvested assets now exceed $500 billion. As James mentioned, we are reporting on a new metric to show the percentage of stock plan assets that vest and remain within Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. E TRADE previously disclosed a similar metrics. The definition going forward will measure the retention of the value of vested stocks on a rolling 12- to 24-month period. This new metric will allow us to measure the potential strength of workplace to service the funnel to grow our asset base. We saw 24% retention in 2021, which compares to 21% in 2020. As James mentioned, over time, we believe that number can reach retention for our stock plan administration business. Going forward, we plan to disclose this metric annually. Bank lending balances grew by $31 billion in the year, and now stand at $129 billion. Strong client demand for securities-based lending and mortgages drove the increase. Net interest income was $1.4 billion in the quarter driven by strong lending growth and the benefit of fully phased-in funding synergies. The fourth quarter NII is a reasonable base to inform 2022. This year, NII will be impacted by the forward curve on lending growth. On rates, while the timing and the magnitude of the rate hikes is uncertain, we should benefit from rising rates and the realization of the forward curve. This would imply an estimated $500 million of additional NII this year, largely weighted to the back half of the year. On lending, we continue to see strong lending demand. And while growth is likely to moderate some, we expect approximately $20 billion of loan growth in the year. Finally, the integration of the E TRADE continues to go well. We are encouraged by continued client engagement and are seeing rate clients take advantage of Morgan Stanley capabilities being introduced on the E TRADE platform. Building on our digital client experience, clients are now able to link their self-directed accounts via single sign-on. We have successfully merged E TRADE's bank legal entities with Morgan Stanley. Throughout the integration efforts, we continue to focus on a unified client experience while providing clients choice. Completing this integration successfully remains a key investment priority. Moving to Investment Management. The timing of the Eaton Vance acquisition makes comparisons to prior periods difficult. So I will make my comments primarily on an absolute basis. Investment Management reported annual revenues of $6.2 billion and quarterly revenues of $1.8 billion. Our results continue to demonstrate the diversification of this business and a greater contribution from more durable management fee revenue. Total AUM rose to a record high of $1.6 trillion, of which long-term AUM was also a record at $1.1 trillion. Total net flows were $12 billion in the quarter driven by liquidity and overlay services. Long-term net flows were slightly negative. For the full year, net flows were $115 billion. Asset management and related fees were $1.6 billion in the quarter. The 8% sequential increase was driven by higher performance fees. As a reminder, performance fees are mostly recognized in the fourth quarter. Performance-based income and other revenues were $166 million, reflecting broad-based gains in our diversified alternative platform. Finally, the integration with Eaton Vance remains on track. In the first half of this year, we will bring a number of Eaton Vance and Calvert funds onto our international distribution platform. We are also now offering MSIM model portfolios on the E TRADE platform, and we are seeing positive traction. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Risk-weighted assets were essentially flat to the prior quarter at $472 billion. We adopted SA-CCR on December 1, resulting in a $23 billion RWA increase. This was offset by a decline in activity and lower market levels towards the end of the quarter. Our SA-CCR mitigation efforts were better than we anticipated and resulted in an impact lower than our initial guidance to produce a better outcome. We repurchased approximately $2.8 billion of common stock during the quarter. We remain well capitalized post the adoption of SA-CCR, and our standardized CET1 ratio now stands at 16%, flat to the prior quarter. Our tax rate was 23.1% for the full year. And absent any changes to tax law, we expect our 2022 tax rate to be in line with 2021. We which will exhibit some quarter-to-quarter volatility. In terms of our outlook for calendar year 2022, the exit rate of our Wealth and Investment Management asset base and the integrations of our acquisitions set these businesses up to further support results. As it relates to institutional securities, while it remains difficult to forecast this business, the banking pipeline looks healthy and the year has started off well. That said, a lot will depend on monetary and fiscal policy and its impact on sentiment.  With that, we will now open the line up for questions. Operator : We are now ready to take questions. [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Christian Bolu : Good morning, guys. So James, on the -- organic growth has been remarkably strong and you keep calling for a slowdown on organic growth, but we're not seeing any -- sort of any evidence of slowing anything, you\u2019re accelerating here. I guess a couple of questions on that. Can you give us a bit more flavor around what's driving organic growth? How much of it is retention versus recruiting? On recruiting, who are you gaining share from? And then I would imagine you have quite a bit of visibility into the recruiting pipeline. So any sense of like how long do you think the sort of strength can continue? James Gorman : Good morning, Christian. I think you're talking about net new money, I assume, right? Christian Bolu : Correct. Correct. James Gorman : Yes. Yes. I mean it's not a simple answer because in the old days, it was simple. It was a function of money that you lost by financial advisors leaving and money you gain by recruiting financial advisors. And obviously, that's a sort of sorry way to run a business. It basically settles your P&L for the next nine years to buy a little bit of joy in the near-term. Fortunately, we've outgrown that. The source of net new money comes from several places. Number one, as you heard the retention in the workplace space is much better than what we did pre E TRADE. I mean, we -- I think it went from 21% to 24% last year, but pre-E TRADE, it was much, much lower and pre-Solium. Number two, the reality is wealthy people get wealthier quicker than people who are less wealthy get wealthy. And we've got a lot of them. We -- now with our -- the sophistication of our network, the linkages we have to invest in banking across our top financial advisors, the family office structure the team has put in place are all drivers of growth that we didn't have before. I mean just the new assets that are brought in from our Investment Banking relationships sort of across the house, whereas in the past, we never really introduced across the house. It's truly running like one Firm. Thirdly, we're just not losing many people. I mean that's the reality relative to previous years, where being significant net gainers. And that's not because we're doing stupid recruiting deals. That's because we're not losing a lot of people. Now we are doing recruiting deals. There are talented people in the market. They're not coming from one1 particular Firm or another. We don't focus on firms, we focus on individuals, and that has been doing well. Then you add in things like the technology the team has put in place in Wealth Management, sort of the virtual advisor type technology where you leverage the best talent we have across the whole country, all of the old platform that is being built out, where we now provide the product that you would have had to go to another Firm to get. And finally, you bring in the deposits and what we've done with the bank and the online banking. And then you throw on top of that E TRADE and what that's been doing in growth. And so Christian, it's an interesting story. It's many, many parts, which is why we're confident it's going to keep going. Just recruiting, that's different. You turn that spigot on or off, but it's not just recruiting. So I think there's going to be strong organic growth. I mean these numbers, we said unprecedented for reason. It had never -- we've never seen -- it's 10%, 11% organic growth year-over-year. That's got to be the best in the industry, and overwhelmingly, the best in our history. And it's better than, frankly, many of the traditional faster-growing, so-called faster-growing companies. So we're really excited about it. I don't think 10% or 11% is realistic to hold. But certainly, we're not going back to anywhere near where we were in the old days. Sharon Yeshaya : If I can also add to it, Christian, I would just say if you actually look at the data, is relatively, as James said, balanced across many of these different sectors. But as you think of just the advisor channel, you're seeing not only -- we've, I think, spent a lot of time speaking to the community around assets held away. We are seeing existing clients bringing assets as well as new clients bringing assets to the advisor-led channel. So you are seeing a balance of both. Christian Bolu : Okay. Thank you. For my second question, on expenses, really nice control in the quarter, but all your peers are speaking about elevated expense growth going forward to retain talent and just to invest for growth. Can you talk about just longer-term, how you're thinking about balancing sort of that good expense control that we like while continuing to invest for the long-term? Sharon Yeshaya : Yes. I think we have managed expenses well. I think that we always are cognizant of the pressures around expenses, both on the wage side and on the non-comp side. If you think about the comp side, I think we constantly feel that we've paid for performance, and that's sort of been the model that we have. But as you also think about the non-comps, we're investing in our integration. We're investing in technology, resiliency, cyber. And I think we're also putting in place different types of investments as you think about positioning Morgan Stanley up for growth and making sure that we have the right people and the processes in place to do that. But there is also inherent operating margin in -- or excuse me, operating leverage in the model, and that's been something that we've been able to demonstrate, I think, this quarter as well as over the course of the year. James Gorman : Yes. I'd say, Christian, obviously, this is going to be a hot topic because it's all anybody wants to talk about all of a sudden is expense management for 2022. I'm not going to talk about competitors, but you've got to look at business models. I mean, we're a different business model. Just take our Wealth Management business, which is $24-plus billion in revenue. Those advisors are paid on a grid. There is no inflation on it. It's based upon what they produce. Most of our investment bank is similarly paid based on bonus and that's based on what they produce, what our performance is. If that goes up, they go up, which they did this year and we were thrilled to do that. So we've invested a lot in technology, but we've also bought companies. As I said before, we didn't just buy E TRADE and Solium and Eaton Vance, we bought technology businesses within them, which we would have been developing ourselves, the online banking business within E TRADE, the Solium workplace platform, which is basically -- it's basically software programming business, the Parametric platform with Eaton Vance, all of these are things which if we built would have been very expensive. So buy versus build, we made that trade-off. So it's a combination of all of those. We're very comfortable with our expense situation right now. And I don't know, we're just -- I guess, it's a different business model. Christian Bolu : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Sharon, I just wanted to ask a question on the slide that you've got in the deck on the realization of forward curve as well as the liquidity revenue and whatnot. So I'm guessing that the $200 million in liquidity revenue is waivers and the recovery of waivers. But that number seems a little low. Wasn't the waiver in the third quarter, $169 million? At least that's what was in the Q. And so can you maybe help reconcile where you're currently running on waivers versus that $200 million? Sharon Yeshaya : Absolutely. So this $200 million, what we're reflecting here, Brennan, it's a good question, is the forward curve. And so the forward curve has the first rate hike in effect that we looked at from December 31. So that's in the second quarter. So therefore, it's the amount that you would expect to realize this year, should that forward curve play out. That's the way this slide was illustrated. And just to drive the distinction, though, between what you see in the Q, the Q has all different types of waivers. It's not just money market waivers. But you're right to say that this number on a relative basis would be considered low if you're thinking about a full year context. Brennan Hawken : Got it. Okay. So we could calibrate both the NII number and the liquidity for it. Okay. Excellent. And then when we think about -- you made a comment, I think, Sharon, when you were talking about the impact in the fourth quarter of Wealth Management margins, clearly low, right, full year impact of that benefit. But it sounded like what you said was, when we were thinking about entering 2022 that the full year is the way to think about it. But that's just like -- I just want to sort of clarify and understand. Did you mean that, that was the jumping off point? Or that that's the right way to think about 2022 in total? Because I'd assume with a lot of the rate benefit coming, continued operating leverage and whatnot, you'd be talking more about it jumping off point than thinking about the full year. But am I reading too much into that? Sharon Yeshaya : No, you're not. Thank you for clarifying that. That's 100% accurate. What we were referring to is the first quarter of 2022 and using this full year number as a good launching off point is sort of setting you up. That's obviously ex-integration for the first quarter. So yes, as the rate rises, that should increase the margin as it goes forward throughout the course of the year. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Okay. Hopefully, I can sneak one in because it was a clarification question. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. Don't worry, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : The Investment Management fee rate was like really pleasantly surprisingly improved despite the fact that we're still waiving fees like we just talked about. Could you talk a little about -- I know Eaton Vance is early and there's still -- that is still progressing and whatnot. But I kind of thought that the third quarter fee rate would have settled fully but there was an improvement. Can you talk about what drove that improvement? Is that sustainable? Or was there some one-time lumpiness in there? Sharon Yeshaya : It's the fourth quarter. Those -- you see some of the rates moving up in the fourth quarter, Brennan. But overall, I think as you look forward and you think about fees more broadly, we obviously have a larger asset base. I think it all ends back to this idea of growth. And that's -- I think, really ties to James' slide as well, which really thinks about what are we trying to build, leaning into growth and really thinking about creating durable fee revenue streams over time. Brennan Hawken : So when you say the fourth quarter, I mean, I was excluding the performance fee because you guys break that out. Are there performance fees that are also embedded in the asset management line, too, that have the seasonality? Sharon Yeshaya : No. Brennan Hawken : No. Okay. So the core fee rate is a good fee rate to think about going forward? Sharon Yeshaya : Yes. And we also disclosed them in the Q and in the K. Operator : The next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI Group. Glenn Schorr : James, a little, tiny qualifier, if I could. Last quarter, I think you made the comment of, well, organic growth shouldn't be likely below 5%. Today, you said more like it won't be like the old days. Is it still like the old days, meaning that when you're in that 4% range pre all the additions and the opportunities you have in hand? Are we still looking at like should be 5 and above? I don't need to pin you down. I would just want to make sure I'm getting the right context. James Gorman : Yes. I don't know what -- I'm not sure I heard you correctly about what you said about what I said last quarter. But let me say what I'm going to say this quarter. Listen, we -- historically, back in the bad days, we actually had negative growth, right? We lost more money than we brought in. Then for a bunch of years through the early sort of '12 through '15, we were probably running at 1%, 2%. The couple of years before the E TRADE acquisition and before, frankly, the business really hit its stride, we were sort of running around 3%, 4%, 5%, and we kind of guided 4% to 6% was reasonable for long-term predictions. This past year, I think we grew at 11%, which is -- I mean, it's freakish, right, Glenn? This is -- you're talking about over $400 billion of new money. There are a lot of asset management companies that aren't $400 billion in size. I don't think that's sustainable. I mean, God I'd love it, but I don't think it's sustainable, but we're not going back to 3%, 4%. I don't know if it's 5, 6, 7, somewhere in that zone. But it's going to be a very healthy growth rate. And you compound that out over what is now $4.9 trillion, you get to really big numbers, which is why, combined with wealth and asset management, we put them together and currently, they're about $6.5 trillion. We can see a path to $10 trillion here, and we want to call that because we believe that's going to happen. So that's -- we're in that sort of, I don't know, 4, 5, 6, 7. It's -- and that's why I deliberately said in the script that it was too early to put a net new money target out there. We needed to see where this really settled. Glenn Schorr : Perfect. Exactly what I needed. Thanks. The other one, James, is the long-term goals, if you look at the last slide, I think those are great long-term goals. And if you could do that sustainably, I think you would get your multiple expansion, people would love it. James Gorman : Would be $200 stock, my friend. Glenn Schorr : The high-class problem that you have is you kind of did some of them this year or last year, so maybe if -- again, if I could just have you part some more, then just go through, how to think about sustainability and what you're building towards what long-term means just so we don't do the up and down game every quarter. So like, \"Oh, wait, you didn't hit your ROTC target this quarter\u2026? James Gorman : Yes. Listen, this is the problem with putting goals out there. You hear them and everybody says, \"Great, what's the new one?\" Our goals last year, our 2-year goals was 14 to -- take ROTCE of 14% to 16%. We happen to hit 20% this year. It was an unbelievably good year. And if we were really operating with a permanent 20-plus percent ROTCE, the stock would be much higher than it is now. In fact, I think it should be higher than it is now, but that's a different issue. So we put out 20%-plus. I don't think you're going to find another bank in the world that's putting out a 20%-plus ROTCE goal. And over the long term, we're not saying forever, that's why we separated client assets at 10 trillion as longer term not to be too cute about it, but we think that, obviously, just mathematically, if you do 5% net new money growth, you have 5% to 6% market appreciation, you're talking about a sort of just mathematically, full year to 5-year time zone to get to 10 trillion. By the way, in 2006, our total assets as a company were $1 trillion. We're now at 6.5. So it's not like an impossible lift. On efficiency ratio, when I started in this job, I think our efficiency ratio was in the low 80s. We have grounded down every single year. And our range over the last -- including this year, 2021, '22 was 69 to 72. We obviously beat that. We had -- as I said, we had a blowout year. But we're consistently of the view that, notwithstanding all the talk about expense pressure, our efficiency ratio will stay under 70%. That for long-term management and managing growth and investing in the business, you got to balance growth versus expense, I think that's a phenomenal outcome. And Wealth Management, our long-term goals there was 69 to 72 -- I'm sorry, 26 to 30, we've now said 30% plus. When we get the kick up from the forward curve, we get some of the rate increase in the next couple of years. We finished the integration expenses. You're going to see that number go up. No question about that. So that's the context. And frankly, I just like the round 20, 70, 30, 10, felt like a nice clean sheet. Everybody can follow it. And that's what we're planning on. Operator : The next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So I was hoping to unpack some of the assumptions underpinning the 30% margin target for the Wealth segment. Looking at the adjusted Wealth Management margin this past year of 27% and the 30% target is certainly a significant improvement from where you've been run rating over like the past decade-plus. In this new world order following the E TRADE acquisition, it does feel a bit conservative when layering in the synergies as well as simply the realization of the forward curve. And I wanted to see if we should expect the NII windfall to largely fall to the bottom line? And can you speak to what you believe is an achievable margin goal when contemplating a lot of the tailwinds or benefits you cited from higher run rate organic growth, the upside from higher rates and just the full realization of trade synergies? James Gorman : Steve, I have to say I love you. You're the first person in history to call a 30%-plus pretax margin Wealth Management as conservative. I mean we started we're like 3%. So listen, there's nobody in history, I think, has ever generated 30-plus percent number. I think it was back -- if you go back, it was Shearson in the fourth quarter of 1999, I believe, generated a 29% margin. And that was because they were doing, let's just say, a lot of Internet-based buy and selling, the clients back then. So that was like an artificial period. Listen, there is the reason we put the plus on it. We don't think 30% is the ceiling. But let's run before we sprint here. We've gone from 5 to 10 to 15 to 20 to 25. 27%, 28% margins with growth, that's a phenomenal story. If we can do 30%, which we will do because of the way rates are going, it gets even better. So 30%-plus, there's no great magic to it. It's just the math of how we think the business plays out the next couple of years. I don't know what the plus is going to be. It might be 0.1 or it might be 5. Steven Chubak : Fair enough, James. Although last year, I think you had a similar response, and I pressed you on the ROTCE target and it was raised. So hopefully, we'll see a similar outcome this time around. James Gorman : Maybe you're clairvoyant, I don't know. Steven Chubak : Well, just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the upcoming changes to the capital regime. There's certainly some significant changes coming down the pike as part of Basel IV. I know we might be jumping the gun. We don't have a proposal yet from the Fed. But I was hoping you could just share some preliminary thoughts on how you see this potentially impacting minimum capital requirements at the Firm. And any learnings just from the SA-CCR experience in terms of your ability to mitigate some of those RWA inflationary pressures? Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. Why don't I take the last one first, which I think the overarching theme is really around adaptation? As it specifically relates to SA-CCR, I think there was data mitigation that we were able to achieve. And I think we're proud of being able to focus and move forward. As it relates to Basel, no surprise that you asked the question, Steve. So it's nice to hear from you on that one. But obviously, there is no final rule yet. I think there's -- the difficulty in saying something is that there's often and can be offset between these rules. And so that's something that I would bear in mind as you think through it and as we all think through it. But what I think is really the point is that we have adopted really well. And we also have 280 basis points, I think, as James showed, of excess capital on the CET1 metric. And so I think we're really comfortable with our position, and we're comfortable to better understand the capital rules as they come our way. Operator : The next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Michael Mayo : Since, James, you're looking for the 20% ROTCE permanently, how much longer do you plan to stay as CEO? And by setting such a high target, are you encouraging some extra risk-taking? James Gorman : I'll take the second question -- second part of the question first. No. We, in fact, did a 20% ROTCE this year without taking extra risk taking with the movement in rates, the scaling the business, the completed integration to come of Eaton Vance and E TRADE and the removal of those costs. The moats around the business and the embedded growth we have in net new assets, I don't think these are -- involve risk-taking at all. This is not about growing the balance sheet and growing risk-weighted assets. This is about growing durable fee sources, durable revenues and managing our expenses. I don't know if we're going to achieve it every single year, but we certainly -- it's certainly a goal, and it's a go for reason. So no, I don't think it involves taking extra risk. I mean, fundamentally, our business model is different, Mike, as you know, we generate $30 billion and it's going up from wealth and asset management that don't involve taking a lot of risk. Our investment bank -- traditional Investment Banking doesn't involve taking a lot of risk. Some of the underwriting, obviously, does. Some of the trading does. But a lot of the -- look at equities, a lot of the equities business is buying and selling on behalf of clients. So no, that's not -- the plan is not after all these years to dial up the risk.  And I'm not going to repeat what I've said many times, I'm not leaving now, and I'm not going to be here in 5 years, and it's up to the Board. We're developing successors. I'll be here a few years. And I want to see these integrations done. I want to see us firmly on this path. And I want to hand it over to somebody else who can take us to the next decade. Michael Mayo : Great. And then one follow-up. As far as the ins and outs, that's helpful to give the market share. And the numbers speak for themselves, 15% Investment Banking market share, 23% Equity share. But on the one hand, I think you're one of the biggest providers to the tech industry. And with tech having some pain recently, I wonder what percent of your Investment Banking business is to the tech sector. And then offsetting that, perhaps there are some other industries that are coming back online after the pandemic. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. I would actually point to the fact that what I said, I think, in the last 2 quarters, is that we're seeing a broadening out of the advisor activity. It's not specific to any one sector. And I think that's been what's really contributed to the healthy pipelines in that business. across all the Investment Banking. And then as you look in sales and trading, it's a highly diversified model and has not really pinned down to any one specific sector. Operator : The next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor: Can you just talk a bit big picture on the industry wallet for both banking and trading as rates rise and as the Fed unwinds the balance sheet? Obviously, there's been some benefits the last couple of years, and we're all trying to figure out do we anchor to the more recent last couple of years, go back to pre-COVID, if you think about the wallet. And my follow-up will be on your positioning specifically. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. I think the -- if you think about the industry wallet, -- There have been a couple of things that I would mention. One is, obviously, as I said, if you look specifically at Investment Banking, you've seen different types of activity. You see different types of corporates and sponsors, which has been one of the contributors of a greater wallet. But then if you also think about the Sales & Trading franchise and the movement there, the activity has changed. I think that you were looking back -- if you think back to pre-2018, '17, '19, there was obviously less activity with central banks all having a very similar approach and one rate. Obviously, as you inject rates rising, you do -- you would expect or one should expect different types of volatility and different diversification amongst products, which could contribute to a bigger or a different type of wallet that you saw in the early 2020 to period. That being said, I mean, obviously, none of us have a crystal ball. I think right now, what we do know is that activity is high. I think there's a lot of client differentiation and a robustness really in that type of wallet more broadly. But we'll have to see how it goes. And I think the point I was trying to make in my conclusion is we don't know how any of it will impact sentiment. And I think that's the big piece that is out there is a factor that we have to watch. Matthew O'Connor: Fair enough. And then in terms of your positioning, obviously, Slide 6 of your deck shows very strong market share gains in the last few years. As you think about the market kind of ebbing and flowing, is the goal to hold the share, and this kind of ties back into some of the expense pressures in the industry where some of your peers are either invested quite a bit this last year or plan to in the future years? How do we think about the segments and you already have such strong share in equities, for example, but fixed income is an area where you've talked about being somewhere in between on the? So how do you think about those businesses from a competitive point of view going forward? Sharon Yeshaya : So I think that when you -- what we would point to is I think this is a really -- it's a scale-driven model. We've put a lot of moats in place. I think having a global reach across different pieces contributes to the ability to actually hold or gain share across the Investment Banking division and -- or excuse me, the Institutional Securities franchise more broadly. If you think about the equities, we have a very strong very strong franchise there. Investment banking, as I've said before, we continue to invest in that business. And then if you look at fixed income, I think we continue to feel good about that business, our client positioning, and we've gained share over the last couple of years, and we feel good about being rightsized and there for our clients as it relates to those needs. Operator : The next question is from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess, Sharon, I was wondering if, one, you could just get a mark-to-market in terms of an update on all the integration, where we are and when do we expect to fully get that behind us. And just tied to that, I think, James, you've in the past talked about looking at E TRADE scaling that up globally. Just give us a sense of is there something that can happen in the near term. And what's the optionality there on E TRADE and taking it global? Sharon Yeshaya : So why don't I start on the integration. I think where we -- what we had said was we looked for approximately a 3-year integration period. We have seen some -- and this is specific to E TRADE, we have seen obviously a portion of the integration-related spend over the course of the last 2 years. We would expect the vast majority of the integration-related expenses to be pulled forward into 2022 with a slight residual in 2023 but most of that happening in 2022. And I think that what you'll see later in the 2023 space will be more on the back end and not really a client -- not really client-facing. As it relates to the actual cost synergies that we've seen, we're in a very good place. I think that it's exceeded our expectations in terms of the guidance that we gave in terms of a time line and seeing those come through. But on a holistic basis, we stick to the cost synergy guidance that we gave when we first announced the transaction. James Gorman : On the international, I mean, E TRADE already manages some plans internationally. We don't have immediate plans to take the platform outside the U.S., but it's certainly part of the long-term strategy. So I'd say right now, let's get the integration done. Let's prove out the case here, get the cost synergies we talked about sort of close the books on that, and then we're looking for further expansion. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And just a separate question around -- there's some concern that the Fed is behind the curve in terms of monetary policy, how concerned are you in terms of the risk of an accident happening with one of your clients within the capital markets business if the Fed has to hike faster or get to QT sooner than expected? Any thoughts around that? James Gorman : We've got a lot of clients. So I'm sure some of them are well positioned for rate hike. Some are -- it's very hard to predict that, that point suggests we're going to get 3 to 4 rate hikes this year and 3 to 4 next year. That feels kind of right. That gets us back to sort of near normal. Normal would be about 10 increases from here, gets us to about 2.5%. If people aren't positioned to manage getting back to normal, then it's kind of -- I mean, it's sort of their problem. It's not -- I'm not particularly worried about it, to be honest. And we don't try and project how people are going to change their positioning with what is a fairly predictable set of outcomes, which is we will have a normalization of interest rates at some point in the next couple of years. Operator : The next question is from Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas. Jeremy Sigee : I just wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions. The 2 related questions really about the wealth management growth because, obviously, that's just such a strong theme in what you're doing. The first one is I think the new metric you're giving us, the retention invested assets. That's an interesting metric and a useful one. Could you talk about how you're driving that in terms of how you're going to get that higher in terms of how you're approaching those clients and what product you're putting in front of them to drive that higher? And the second question, related, are you seeing any cross-sell or revenue synergy between your 3 Wealth Management channels, Advisory, workplace, self-directed? Or is it still too early for that? Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. So on the first -- on the new metric, I think that the first driver you're going to see is a lot of the companion accounts, right? So we've talked about the fact that we would expect to give everybody on the U.S., a companion account or at least be at 90% by the end of this year, and that's still on track. And what that will allow for is as those assets from stock plans vest into a companion account, you retain them in a Morgan Stanley self-directed type of way.  And then you use -- this will lead to the second question that you asked and sort of tying it together, products like LeadIQ or technology investments like [Project Genome] to better understand our clients and offer us the technology and that agility to give advisors and to provide the right advisors to the right workplace participants. We are already doing that. We already have pilots in place where we are giving different workplace individual advisors. And so I would say that this -- the first step is really getting everybody a companion account and that's part of the integration process. And then the second part is using technology to better match clients such that, while they still get client choice, we're able to offer them the full advice network that Morgan Stanley has to offer. Jeremy Sigee : That's great. Could I just ask an unrelated follow-up? Do you need to get the CET1 ratio down to support your ROTCE target staying above 20%? Sharon Yeshaya : Does it -- no, this is a longer-term target. I think you saw it even this year. So I would just retort with look at this particular year and where we were in terms of our CET1 and, obviously, say we were able to do it given the market circumstance. I'd say that over time, however, we continue to look at capital. As we think about how do we best use that capital for investment, returning it to shareholders with dividends, looking at buybacks and then other ways and uses of capital as we have over the course of the last decade. Operator : The next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : I was hoping you could discuss the profitability of the asset management business now that you've had several quarters of Eaton Vance. And I know that deal wasn't cost driven, but wondering if there's any additional synergies? And as you think about money market fee waivers coming through, as you mentioned earlier, the incremental margin on that in the context of the overall profitability of that business? Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. So I think that the fee waiver sort of speak for themselves, and so I think that gives you a direct number. On the E TRADE and Eaton Vance integration -- or excuse me, the Investment Management and the Eaton Vance integration, I think that the way to think about it is it wasn't ever a cost savings transaction. The idea was always to marry the platforms, and you've already begun to see that. So if you think about the diversification of the product suite itself, you're in a position where if you see flows in one business go down, you've seen flows go up in other businesses. And so that's given you this ballast almost in that business specifically. But in addition to that, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, if you look at the second thing that we had highlighted a lot when we purchased Eaton Vance was the different distribution networks. So we have an international -- or Morgan Stanley had an international distribution capability that Eaton Vance didn't have. So a product such as Calvert, where you have a cyclical tailwind in terms of -- and a secular tailwind in terms of people being interested in that sustainability space, that is going to be sold using our international distribution channels beginning in the first half of year. I think that shows the progress and momentum that we have in place as you're marrying those 2 different sort of companies and they're coming together as one. Daniel Fannon : And one of the other attributes you've highlighted is the Parametric opportunity within Wealth. I guess, is it too early to talk about uptake of that, some of the tax advantage strategies they offer in terms of your Wealth clients? Sharon Yeshaya : Well, Parametric was already offered and very well received within the Wealth Management platform. I think we're looking for more ways to sell -- to offer that product, I should say, within different parts of the Wealth Management channel. Operator : There are no questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone, for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. During today\u2019s presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman. James Gorman : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I know you have a very, very busy morning, so we did our best to keep these earnings uncomplicated for you. Heading into 2022, we anticipate, as everybody did, a more volatile market, and obviously, we saw that in the first quarter. The year started with rising inflationary pressures, accelerated expectations for tightening of monetary policy, and most notably, and sadly, the invasion of Ukraine. This backdrop injected significant uncertainty into the markets and further tested resiliency of our franchise. Against this quickly evolving market environment, our diversified business model again generated high returns. The firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion and a ROTCE of 20%. I am pleased to report that our first quarter results continued to exemplify Morgan Stanley\u2019s strength and affirm our long-term strategy. First, Institutional Securities delivered another very strong quarter, with revenues of $7.7 billion, making it one of its highest performances ever. Compared to last year\u2019s record first quarter, we saw a different mix of businesses driving the strength of this segment. While underwriting was muted, Advisory was a highlight. Equity and fixed income again delivered exceptional results, particularly in Asia and Europe, as we supported our global clients amid a turbulent backdrop. Global balanced Institutional businesses are complex. They require many years to build and an enormous amount invested in human capital. The breadth and depth of our franchise today is a competitive differentiator. Wealth Management showcased its resiliency in the quarter. Notwithstanding, fluctuating market levels, the business generated a margin of approximately 28% excluding integration-related expenses. The E TRADE integration continues to go very well, and given the current path we are on, a significant portion of the integration will be done by the end of this year. By the end of 2022, we expect to no longer separate our integration expenses. Net new assets for the quarter were $142 billion. That included an asset acquisition. Nonetheless, organic growth in our existing business remained very strong. In a volatile market, this is very affirming of the model. Further, we saw our first rate hike in the year in the first quarter, and with our strong and growing deposit base, this will have a near immediate economic impact to our business and it supports our path to delivering the margins that we projected in excess of 30%. In Investment Management, the increased diversification of the business supported results in a very choppy market. Fee based asset management revenues, which were $1.4 billion in the quarter, have grown with the addition of Parametric, Calvert and the broadening of our alts and fixed income platforms. We have performed better with these franchises than we would have without it and it has brought much more balance to our asset management business. And with respect to the Eaton Vance integration, it progresses very smoothly as well. The teams remain stable, and culturally, it\u2019s a terrific fit. Our markets continue to evolve, we remain confident about our position and the many opportunities ahead. Finally, a brief word on the Russian invasion of the Ukraine. In managing a global business, particularly a market-based global business, we must always remain vigilant about the potential for shocks or unexpected events. Obviously, the invasion of the Ukraine is one such event. First of all, and most importantly, our hearts go out to the Ukrainians and all those have been impacted. As it relates to the business, apart from the volatility it\u2019s created, there\u2019s been very limited financial impact to Morgan Stanley. A few years ago, we decided to give up our banking license and we significantly scaled back operations in Russia. Further, as a result of these actions and the current war, we are not entering into any new business in the country and our activities are limited to helping global clients address and close out pre-existing obligations. I am very proud of how our team has managed through a difficult market backdrop, and going forward, we continue to navigate the turbulent markets and broader geopolitical environment with confidence. I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the quarter in greater detail and together we will take your questions. Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion in the first quarter, representing the second highest quarter in our firm\u2019s history. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $2.06 and our ROTCE was 20.3%. The firm\u2019s first quarter efficiency ratio, excluding integration-related expenses was 67.9% and reflects our expense discipline, while continuing to invest in the businesses. Results of the first quarter illustrate resiliency and durability. Equity and fixed income supported our clients, while navigating volatile markets. Wealth Management proved resilient and Investment Management benefited from diversification. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues of $7.7 billion represented the third highest quarter on record. Results declined 11% from the record set in the prior year. This quarter\u2019s performance again demonstrated the power of our global integrated investment bank, with balance across businesses and a strong presence across geographies. We remain a global diversified leader. Europe delivered its best quarter in over a decade, while Asia saw its second highest result, with strength in both equities and fixed income. Investment Banking revenues grew $1.6 Billion, led by strength in Advisory. Compared to the prior year, revenues declined by 37%. Advisory revenues were $944 million, almost double the prior year\u2019s first quarter, reflecting higher completed M&A volumes. Equity underwriting revenues were $258 million, a meaningful decline from last year\u2019s elevated results, in line with market volumes. Heightened volatility led clients to delay issuance activity. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $432 million, down compared to the prior year as macroeconomic conditions contributed to lower bond issuances. Investment banking pipelines remain healthy across sectors and regions. However, the conversion from pipeline to realize will be largely dependent on market conditions going forward. Equity revenues were $3.2 billion, reflecting broad-based strength in performance against the backdrop of volatile markets. We continue to be a global leader in this business. Cash revenues were solid, with particular strength in Europe, consistent with market volumes by geography. Derivative revenues were robust and the business navigated the volatility well. Prime brokerage revenues were strong, while intra-quarter balances were impacted by uncertainty, we saw balances rebound alongside markets. Fixed income revenues of $2.9 billion were in line with the very strong prior year. In the quarter, commodities and macro, particularly foreign exchange led the strength. Macro revenues increased meaningfully from the prior quarter. Clients remained engaged and the trading environment proved constructive. Micro results were strong, but reflected lower revenues compared to the prior year. Commodities delivered a more diversified results, with revenues notably higher than the previous first quarter, benefiting from the heightened levels of activity. Turning to Wealth Management. Revenues were $5.9 billion. Declines in DCP negatively impacted the revenues by approximately $300 million. Excluding the impact related to DCP, revenues increased 6% versus the prior year\u2019s first quarter results. Results underscore the resilience of the franchise, the value offered to clients during uncertain times and the benefits of our scaled multi-channel model. Retail clients remained invested, with allocations across asset classes consistent with last year. PBT was $1.6 billion and the margin was 26.5% or 27.8%, excluding integration-related expenses. These strong results should continue to be supported, as we realize the benefits of rising rates. Asset management revenues were $3.6 billion, up 14% versus last year, benefiting from the growth in fee-based assets. This growth continues to reflect the investments we have made into the business over time and affirms our strategy is working. Net new assets were $142 billion for the quarter. NNA was inclusive of an asset acquisition, which I will touch on shortly. Absent this asset acquisition, annualized growth was 5.4%, and despite the volatility, net new assets were generated from all channels. The advisor-led channel benefited from an even split of existing and new clients, as well as positive net recruiting. Fee-based flows were also strong and inclusive of the asset acquisition were $97 billion. Workplace continues to benefit from the establishment of companion accounts. Retention of assets also continued to rise as a result of incremental companion account adoption and the value of the platform. In the quarter, we added $75 billion of retirement assets through an asset acquisition of our institutional retirement -- of an institutional retirement consultant. We remain a platform of choice and this is the second institutional retirement plan to join us in the last nine months. We continue to view these asset acquisitions as incremental opportunities to reach the expanded audience through education and financial wellness. The acquired team\u2019s client base includes nearly one million of plan participants. Transactional revenues were $635 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, which is reflected in this line revenues were strong. Although activity moderated from the prior year, self-directed daily average trades remained above $1 million in the quarter, over 3 times E TRADE pre-asset acquisition record. We have also seen meaningful interest in our alternatives offering, given our broad-based access to managers and their retail-oriented products. Loan growth remained strong in the quarter, with bank lending balances growing $7 billion, driven by securities-based lending and mortgages. We expect loan growth over the remainder of the year to be consistent with our prior guidance of approximately $5 billion per quarter. Deposits increased $6 billion in the quarter to $352 billion. The average rate on deposits declined to 9 basis points. We have completed the net runoff in wholesale deposits and do not anticipate further declines in deposit costs. Net interest income was $1.5 billion. Excluding prepayment amortization, NII increased 15% from the prior year driven by loan growth. Back in January, we indicated that the fourth quarter NII was a reasonable base to inform 2022 and that we would expect $500 million of incremental NII on the back of rising rates. Due to the further moves in rate expectations since January, we should see this benefit at least double if the forward curve and our modeled assumptions are realized over the remaining nine months of the year. Moving to Investment Management. My remarks will refer to quarter-over-quarter changes as the timing of the Eaton Vance acquisition makes the prior quarter a more relevant benchmark. Revenues were $1.3 billion. The sequential decline reflects the seasonally lower performance fees, which are mostly recognized in the fourth quarter and a more challenging market environment. Despite headwinds, this business is benefiting from increased scale and a more diversified product offering. Total AUM of $1.4 trillion declined 8% quarter-over-quarter as a result of market declines and outflows. Long-term net outflows reflected approximately $9 billion of institutional outflows in our Solutions business, including the expected redemption of a large asset manager who brought their equity trading implementation in-house. Equity strategies saw a giveback of some of the prior year\u2019s asset appreciation, as the broader market experienced a rotation out of growth. This was partially offset by the continued strong flows into Parametric customized portfolios, as well as our inflation-related and interest rate-sensitive products. Asset management and related fees decreased sequentially to $1.4 billion on the back of the aforementioned seasonality and market volatility. Performance-based income and other revenues were a loss of $53 million in the quarter, driven by markdowns in one of the Asia private equity funds. Declines in deferred compensation plan investments and negative marks associated with legacy international real estate investments. Away from these specific markdowns, we saw broad-based gains across our alternatives platform, reflecting the strength and diversity of the platform. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets increased to $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio sequentially declined and now stands at 14.5%. Multiple factors contributed to this change. Standardized RWAs increased as client activity returned after the more moderated levels at the end of 2021 and volatility increased. OCI related to our available-for-sale securities portfolio reflected an increase of an unrealized loss of $2.4 billion as a result of higher interest rates. While this should earn back over time, it impacted our CET1 ratio by 50 basis points in the quarter. We continue to return capital to our shareholders. We are executing on our $12 billion buyback authorization, as we repurchased $2.9 billion of stock in the quarter. We remain in a strong capital position. Our tax rate was 19% for the quarter. The vast majority of share-based compensation and the share-based award conversions takes place in the first quarter creating a tax benefit. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be in line with full year 2021. The first quarter again tested the resiliency of our franchise. We are pleased with how our team navigated the volatile environment and stayed close to clients during times of uncertainty. While the outlook for the remainder of the year is difficult to predict, the second quarter has started constructively and clients remain engaged. With that, we will now open up the line to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thank you. Maybe just to start off big picture, so putting up a 20% ROTCE in this tape, I am sure it is good performance and it is affirmation of the strategy and what you built. So my question is, you have enough capital, you have a lot of earnings power, rates are going up. I am curious how you think about -- is there what\u2019s next, I mean, what do you do with this higher earnings production with all the capital that\u2019s being produced, do you continue to chip away and find bolt-on acquisitions? Are you thinking about a next act, I mean, organic growth alone can power this, but I am just curious in the next couple of years how you are thinking about that, James? James Gorman : Glenn, it\u2019s a high class problem and its great position to be in. We have been very protective of keeping a sort of buffer on a buffer, because you never know in this world and I think what we have experienced with the markets in the last quarter were extremely volatile and you just have to -- you have to anticipate the worst and make sure you are prepared for that. We clearly have done that. We have been chipping away at the excess capital. If you add back the OCI, we are running about 15% CET1. We were well above 16%. So, clearly, we will see where our CCAR results are. I think last year, they are around 13.2% or 13.3%. I\u2019d be surprised if there\u2019s material changes. But let\u2019s see. So we are still sitting on a significant buffer. Listen, we are clearly going to keep pushing capital distribution through buyback and dividend to shareholders. That\u2019s clearly the case. We have just done two major acquisitions with about $21 billion. We would do more deals if as they -- if they fit with our strategy, we won\u2019t do things that take us offline, off piece. We want to stay true to our strategy and our strengths in our three core businesses. So, yeah, continued buyback, but also a lot of investment in the business. I mean, we are doing a lot on the tech side. Obviously, we want to stay completely compliant with our regulatory responsibilities and we will continue to invest to make sure we are best-in-class there. But a lot of investment technology and a lot of investment around the retirement workplace platform, which I think is sort of the next frontier. And we are just in baby steps, we are very early days of that, but I think that\u2019s a huge opportunity. And finally, I do think that there are opportunities outside of the U.S., even though we are along the US and that served us incredibly well, and I think, will serve us very well for the next decade. But I think in the Wealth and Asset Management spaces internationally, we punch below our weight. On Institutional Securities we don\u2019t and we had a very strong quarter in Europe and Asia in Institutional Securities. But I think there\u2019s clearly more we can do internationally, so sort of watch that space. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate all of that. Thank you. Maybe just one follow-up, Sharon, you mentioned alternatives on the Wealth Management platform. I think you are the largest in the world, but yet it\u2019s still, in terms of distributor of alternative product, But there\u2019s -- it\u2019s still at a low level percentage wise of client assets. So I am curious, James mentioned, building technology, building people. How much do you have to prepare the platform or is it there waiting for this deluge of products that\u2019s coming, I am trying to get a window into what\u2019s coming in terms of alternative distribution on your platform? Sharon Yeshaya : I think it\u2019s a great question and we -- as you said, we continue to invest in it. We have obviously seen the alternative players creating more product and you see that from peers, but you also even see that from our own from MSM as a secular growth trend in a place that we are investing. They have obviously created products now that are more appropriate or more suitable for retail and our platform is there. We are working very closely together. There\u2019s clearly more that we can do. As Jim said, we are continuing to invest. But I agree with you that this is a place where we have seen an uptick. We noted it over the course of this quarter. It was interesting to us, as I know we have discussed it individually as well, Glenn, and I think, it\u2019s a place where you will just continue to see that kind of growth investment from both us and also on the product side. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry, [Indiscernible]paper, I couldn\u2019t even find the handset. So I had a question first on the Wealth Management deposits and thanks, Sharon, for that indication of updating the NII outlook. But when we think about the deposits and the potential beta, what\u2019s your expectation for beta this time around and what percentage of your deposits are actually on the self-directed platform? We get the asset percentages, but it\u2019s my sense that self-directed runs with a higher percentage of cash. So I am guessing the percentage of deposits would be -- would skew higher than the assets do on that platform and could that impact your beta this time around? Thanks. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. I think it\u2019s a great question. I think about it as two parts, probably, actually a bit separately. One with beta, beta for us is informed by the last rate hike cycle. So, we have given you historically and we stand by as sort of a 50 beta as an end state. But, obviously, beta also moves through time as you see different rate cycles, and so that\u2019s stage sort of point A, if you think about just where the beta is. Your point on deposits is also interesting. I think that we think about deposits as we look at the composition of the deposits. And obviously, what E TRADE did and the self-directed channel did is it offered us more deposits from smaller accounts with smaller levels and that might -- to your point that might have a different beta. So there\u2019s a beta, obviously, holistically, but then there\u2019s a beta, as you have mentioned, that might depend on where you are within the size of the accounts and the stickiness that you might see associated with those deposits. So, we are looking at it from two ways. Overall, beta the same, but the deposits themselves and the way that we think about the runoff of the deposits might be different this time around, just given our own composition of the deposits as they have been acquired by E TRADE. Brennan Hawken : Great. That makes a lot of sense. And then for the follow-up, sticking with the rate sensitivity, SBL growth has been quite remarkable this -- for the past many years. When we think about what happen last rate hiking cycle, I went back and I looked through, and the interesting thing is the SBLs weren\u2019t often thought of as rate sensitive, but they continued to grow in the last rate hiking cycle. So, how do you think about this time around if the product is obviously mature, but more mature and so maybe could be more subject to some rate sensitivity, but also like advisors and customers, probably, understand the value of the product better, too. And so there\u2019s a couple of cross currents and I can\u2019t quite get my head around exactly how to think about it, but what are your thoughts on that? Sharon Yeshaya : Thanks for the question. I think when you -- your points are, I think, appropriate. You are looking at, obviously, yeah, it was nascent. What I\u2019d say about our profile is, we didn\u2019t have the same size of household penetration across lending products. Then and even today, there is still, I\u2019d say, room to run in better understanding educating products and educating our clients about the different products that are available to them. Now, of course, the pace may change and that\u2019s not impossible given what we are seeing or what you might think could happen. That\u2019s not really the prediction. But the idea is there\u2019s still more education that can be done and that\u2019s why I think we feel comfortable that even though we might see rates rise. The actual amount that we gave you as guidance from a lending perspective should continue. Part of that obviously being SBL, part of that being mortgages. But when you look at the household penetration even five years, six years ago, you were in very low-double digits for us and you have only reached that mid-teen numbers. So still a lot more to go, as I said, around the education of that product for clients where that\u2019s suitable. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. The $75 billion acquisition of AUM that you got within Wealth Management, this is the second transaction I think over the last 12 months. Can you talk about the capabilities that you are getting with this and how this is being integrated more broadly into the Wealth platform? And also just thinking about the backdrop and strategy, should we see more of these type of transactions going forward? Sharon Yeshaya : So why don\u2019t I start with just saying, we will see more when it\u2019s appropriate for our -- we are obviously continuing to look at this space. What these are, and as James said, when we are looking at retirement, we are looking at defined benefit. We are looking at understanding how workplace coincides with the FA advisor-led space together and the way that I would think of this is just an extension of our strategy. So the best kind of concept that you can say is, yes, we had a proof point in the third quarter of last year. We are obviously in a situation where we have acquired a similar plan and group of advisors. The group of advisors covered defined benefit contribution plans. Those defined benefit contribution plans have corporations associated with them that may also have participants. Those -- in this case, we have 1 million participants that were added. That -- those participants, if you go back to our strategy of the funnel, they are a top portion of that funnel that we begin to advise or educate or learn or teach people about financial wellness. We give them access to our services particularly that we have already developed in the workplace channel. And so that educational content has a crossover and then they now understand better what financial wellness is. They can say, I am interested in speaking to a financial adviser. So that\u2019s where the channels begin to converge and merge, and where you are beginning to really think about the top of the funnel into potentially providing access and advice to clients over time. Dan Fannon : Got it. That makes sense. And you did talk about within the workplace, higher retention rates and more companion accounts. I don\u2019t know if you can give some stats around that, but maybe you are also I think highlighted that the integration costs will be done with E TRADE by the end of the year. So maybe what\u2019s left in terms of milestones with that and then within the kind of workplace, some of the momentum and progress, any numbers would be helpful? Thank you. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. So the companion accounts, what we have said is that, by the end of this year, approximately 90% of U.S. stock participants will be in a position to access a companion account. Should they want to or should they have the stock to invest into the account. So that\u2019s the point there. The question around the retention of assets, we had given that metric at the beginning of -- in the January deck and we talked about aiming towards 30% and we have made improvements from the 24% that we gave you at the end of the quarter. So, all of those are milestones as you think about integration and integration-related expenses. And also the points that James had made around the investment in our business in technology and in this -- and in the integration more broadly. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question on M&A outlook. Organic growth has moderated granted versus what admittedly was a neck breaking pace that we had seen last year. And to what extent does the market volatility disrupt adviser movement across the wealth space and have you seen any improvement in breakaway broker trends or just the recruiting backlog more broadly as volatility has started to moderate versus the level seen in Jan and Feb? Sharon Yeshaya : Thanks for the question, Steve. So as it relates to net recruiting, still seeing inflows on the back of net recruiting, in fact, all three channels, as you think about NNA were contributors to the net -- the NNA number excluding the asset retention, so if you just take that other piece or the asset acquisition. And if you look just at the advisor led channel, a couple of factors; so, one, net recruiting positive; two, on the actual adviser side, evenly split between existing accounts or existing clients and new clients, so continuing to see consolidation of assets held away, as well as new client relationships going forward. And then we had a contribution from workplace, which is obviously impacted by both the companion accounts and also retention of assets and self-directed. So, really broad-based contributions from the different channels and net recruiting, as I said, remains very -- in a good -- in a solid place. Steven Chubak : Understood. And just for a follow-up, just trying to clarify some of the NII guidance, I was hoping you could provide, Sharon, an update on the loan growth outlook, whether you are still comfortable with the mid-teens loan growth you had guided to previously and does the more than $1 billion NII benefit that you alluded to in your prepared remarks contemplate some continued loan growth or is that on a static balance sheet? Sharon Yeshaya : It\u2019s the same loan growth number that I gave you. So the percent that you gave, if you take that and you think it was basically about $5 billion a quarter, so we just gave you in dollars this time around. It\u2019s the same that I gave in January. And then that is what\u2019s -- the point around the -- I don\u2019t know if it was illusion, I actually gave you that it was double. So I said at least double in terms of the NII guidance increase. That really has to do with the realization of the forward curve and the change in the forward curve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey. Good morning. Just a quick couple of follow ups. One, Sharon, if you could remind us in terms of the NII guide, how big is the money market waivers kind of coming back now that we have had the first fed hike and is there any additional improvement that we should expect if the fed hikes by 50 bps in May? Sharon Yeshaya : So our money market guidance we gave you was about plus $200 million and we stand by plus $200 million, but I\u2019d say, for the full year. It\u2019s really based on two factors that are contributing into that. One is the balances, as well as the industry and the waivers, how quickly those waivers roll off. So we are -- $200 million for the remainder of the year for the increase for Investment Management. Ebrahim Poonawala : Understood. And just as a follow-up, when you think about, it\u2019s a tougher question around the macro outlook when we think about M&A, IPOs coming back. Any sense in terms of when you look at the world feels like volatility is going to be high, which bodes well for trading. But how do you handicap just talking to sort of your corporate clients around appetite for deal making and given just the current geopolitical backdrop, any color would be helpful? Sharon Yeshaya : Yeah. So a couple of things, first on the advisory pipeline in particular. Pipeline remains healthy and diversified. So taking a look at the underlying pipeline still diversified across sectors, which I think is another healthy sign in terms of the marketplace. As it relates to the underwriting calendar, that obviously you do have deals that didn\u2019t necessarily come to market in the first quarter. They -- that pipeline to realize, that was associated really with the volatility and the uncertainty in the first quarter, as that recedes, to the extent it does, that would move things from the pipeline state to the realized state. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. I have a question and a follow-up. I guess no good deed goes unpunished. Going back to, you said, core net new asset growth for the quarter was 5.4%, if I got that right excluding the deal. And so that is down from where you were before, but it\u2019s certainly up from where you guys have been a few years ago. So where do you expect that to settle out and what\u2019s the relative contribution, say, E TRADE versus the other legacy businesses? Sharon Yeshaya : We have given what I think we -- where we started, Mike, is we said and James said it in January. 11%, which we saw last year, was exceptional and we didn\u2019t expect that to be repeated in the near-term or we weren\u2019t sure and we wanted to see how the pipeline moved out and how these different channels work together. But what we did say is 3% to 4% is where we used to be and we weren\u2019t expecting to see that, obviously, we are also at a higher base now and so that\u2019s also something to bear in mind. So I think we feel very good about where we are and this is well within that range that we had basically given you. We said, we would spend time better understanding the channels to provide guidance over time. You asked another. The contribution from each of the channels, as I said, three different channels all contributed very, very nicely. We don\u2019t break it out into different pieces, but I would say that, the integration is going well and the E TRADE client and client usage is also doing well. Mike Mayo : Okay. And my follow-up question is on the block trading investigation, which you guys highlighted in your filings. And I know you are limited about what you want to say, I know you can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t give any expectations. But there might be some things that you could disclose around this. This might wind up being a non-event. I mean there\u2019s investigations all the time. We get it. But every now and then one of these investigations lead to something. I am not saying that this is the case, but I just want to what investors ask me, what do you think the impact to the block trading investigation of Morgan Stanley could be? It would be nice for me and investors to have that answer, so with that big wind up. How much do you make from block trading per year and were these issues self-disclosed by Morgan Stanley to the regulators or did it come from an outside party? Thank you. James Gorman : Hey, Mike. Certainly prepared your first question about the net new money growth and high class problems of not achieving 11% organic, 5.4% is generating something like $200 million to $250 million net a year. So it\u2019s actually a great problem, and I think, as Sharon said, the various channels there are going to continue to contribute. My telling you all of this is to say, I can\u2019t talk about ongoing investigations on block trades, obviously and we are not going to do that on an earnings call. But you can look at our equities business and how it performs generally and how it\u2019s done over many, many years. And its current performance and draw, whatever conclusions might be appropriate, but right now we can\u2019t talk about ongoing investigations and it doesn\u2019t matter whether this one or any other one from any authority, it\u2019s always the same rule. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hi, Sharon. Sharon, can you share with us when you take a look at the equities business, as well as the FIC [ph] business and all the disruption we saw in the quarter. Has there been any opportunity for you guys to grab market share from maybe some other competitors that are weaker and are unable to handle the volatility the way you guys did? Sharon Yeshaya : Thanks, Gerard for the question. I -- actually I know a lot of the peers have released this morning. So I haven\u2019t looked specifically at this quarter\u2019s number in terms of this -- the public market share. But what I can tell you is that we have seen increased share over time. I think we are really proud of the position that we have made in both of the sales and trading franchises. A lot of that has to do with what James discussed more directly in his script, which is building these -- investing our people and talent both geographically and also making sure that we have it across different functions. So all of these things are important, I think it\u2019s decades in the making rather than just one quarter, and we are really proud of the way that we thought about the continue -- the continuous velocity of all of our resources to make sure that we can better and more efficiently support client flows. Gerard Cassidy : And then a second, following-up on your commentary about your pipeline and we all understand the volatility of what\u2019s going on out there, if the markets settle down but they settled down at lower valuations in the underwriting area. Do you still think that could come back or do we need higher valuations, so that there\u2019s not basically down, almost like a down round where private has to go public, if that\u2019s their intention at a lower price than what they have raised money on the private side? Sharon Yeshaya : I think that will be very -- I think individual companies will make their own decisions in terms of where they have that from an advice driven perspective. James Gorman : I just -- if you look at pipeline and you look at investment banking revenue through cycles. It\u2019s actually remarkably stable on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, it\u2019s extremely volatile. I mean, look at the change between fourth quarter ECM and first quarter ECM. But then look at what M&A did the advisory business, I think, over $800 million. But if you go through the end of the year, I am sure you will find it\u2019s much more stable and reflective of what we have done in 2020, 2021 period. So I don\u2019t think that -- it\u2019s a very interesting question you raised, but I don\u2019t think that individual companies, they don\u2019t make their decisions obviously based on averages of what the market theme is based on what their own equity capital needs are or debt capital needs or M&A needs. And listen, we have got -- we have one of the best franchises in the world. It is global. So any cross border deals, any global companies, we are in it. That won\u2019t change. It\u2019s just a question as a Q1 or Q3. So I am really unphased by the volatility and banking on a quarterly basis. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Sigee with BNB Paribas. Jeremy Sigee : Hi, there. Thank you. I wanted to talk about the lower transaction revenues in Wealth Management and not so much about what happened in the quarter, but just looking at March and April, what\u2019s the state of mind in your Wealth Management clients? Is this an environment where they are going to stay active or become more active again or is this a sort of wait and see kind of mood among your clients? Sharon Yeshaya : So actually it\u2019s an interesting question. Two things that struck me as we sort of went through and thought about the quarter. One is the fact that when you look at allocations of investors in the retail space in terms of where their positions were in equities, fixed income, cash, cash equivalents, et cetera, on a proportional basis. Over the last year or two actually, those percentages have actually also remained relatively stable. So the retail investors\u2019 investment is something that hasn\u2019t necessarily fluctuated based on the data that we have, that we have seen. Those positions have remained there despite the fact that there\u2019s been volatility. The second point is, specifically on self-directed is, the E TRADE, the fact that, this is what I tried to mention in the script was, where we are from the daily average trade levels, still very, very high, 3 times the high from when E TRADE was a standalone company. And so I think it highlights the change that we have seen in the retail sentiment over the course of the last two years or three years. James Gorman : I\u2019d just add two points to that. Number one, the transaction revenue line in Wealth Management has the DCP impact in it, which was actually very big this quarter. That bounces around. And secondly, if you look at the P&L of Wealth Management, actually the transaction revenues as a driver of the overall health of the business is relatively small. I mean, the much more important are the fee-based revenues, the net interest income, what we are doing in the banking side. So, and then some of the new issue stuff. So I just put that out there. It\u2019s -- again, it\u2019s one of these things that, honestly, I am not very pleased, I am much more interested in asset growth, net new asset growth and what we are doing in the bank than deposits, transactions will bounce around given market volatility. Jeremy Sigee : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And could I just ask a follow-up, I am sitting in Europe, you mentioned Europe was strong. Could you talk about which bits were driving that? What was so great in Europe this quarter? Sharon Yeshaya : I think that this is really based on the advice driven model, right? You have uncertainty in Europe. There\u2019s a lot going on. Obviously, there are pieces of commodities, for example, it\u2019s very specific. But then you also just see client engagement as it relates to various parts of Europe and being able to service that advice is all part of this diversified model. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Devin Ryan : Great. Good morning, everyone. Question on the family office strategy, there was an interesting article recently and I figured to dig in here a little bit more. I know it\u2019s always been a focus for Morgan Stanley and really the firm is uniquely positioned in my opinion to really take advantage of that. But I am curious kind of what is new in the strategy and how you guys would maybe frame the evolution and kind of where the opportunity is accelerating? Sharon Yeshaya : Absolutely. I am actually glad you asked the question. I think it\u2019s a really interesting space and I think it\u2019s an example of connecting the dots. So over the course of the last couple of years, what we have realized is there\u2019s a need for family offices to have access to services that we already offer Institutional Securities clients through our Fund Services platform. And so bringing together those conversations between what\u2019s happening in the Institutional Securities Group and what strategy we are driving in Wealth Management is just an example of how the business is working more closely together to find those opportunities to service clients as family offices begin to feel more like Institutional accounts, and that back and forth in dialogue is really amongst the team, the leadership and then throughout the organization. Devin Ryan : Okay. Great. Thanks, Sharon. Quick follow-up, just on the digital asset strategy and maybe how you would frame where you are today both in GWM and Institutional, and what we could expect over the next year? Sharon Yeshaya : Absolutely. As you know, we are obviously offering some -- we have some offerings for different qualified investors that we have. But in this space, we are obviously taking the lead from regulators as it relates to what we can and can\u2019t offer various clients. Operator *: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Thank you, presenters. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you again for participating and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimers. This call is being recorded. During today\u2019s presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman. James Gorman : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. We are doing the call a little differently this time. I am in London, Sharon is in New York. So, if we have any logistical gaps for a second or two please understand, but I think we will be just fine. The firm delivered a very solid quarter against obviously what is a more challenging backdrop. Our businesses proved resilient, reflecting an important aspect of our strategy, and that is to, as we have said many times, deliver stable performance in a difficult environment while remaining well capitalized. The integrations of E TRADE and Eaton Vance continued to expand our opportunities to reach new clients, grow assets and support the firm\u2019s overall stability. Net new assets in Wealth Management of over $50 billion, despite the volatility and clients tax-related withdrawals in the quarter, underscored the scale of our business and its power to attract assets. And in the face of a sharp decline of equity markets, Wealth Management delivered a strong PBT and improved margin supported by the benefits of rising rates. Investment Management benefited from its diversification and we saw continued momentum in private alternatives, parametric customized portfolios and the countercyclicality of our money market business. Finally, in Institutional Securities, our strong franchise in equity and fixed income helps materially counter what everybody knows to be limited activity across Investment Banking. Our results this quarter also reflected two notable headwinds that are worth calling out. First, we saw a significant movement in the investments related to deferred cash based compensation plans. While the marks on these investments are substantially offsetting compensation expense, they created significant drag on top line revenues in the quarter across the firm, particularly in Wealth Management, where the impact of revenues exceeded $500 million. Secondly, the quarter results also included the legal costs of $200 million that reflects the likely resolution of regulatory investigations by the SEC and the CFTC regarding employees\u2019 use of unapproved personal devices and the firm\u2019s recordkeeping requirements. This has been the subject of industry-wide scrutiny. Our ROTCE, excluding integration expenses for the deals that we have done, was 14.3%, down 20% in Q1 and from last year. As I said at the outset, our objective to demonstrate resilience and balance in a more difficult economic cycle was achieved this quarter, helped in part by the acquisition of E TRADE and Eaton Vance in what was otherwise a challenging environment. Finally, the Fed stress test further affirmed our differentiated business model. Our diversified business mix, as well as our strong capital position, provides us the flexibility to invest for future growth and support our robust capital return program. As such, we increased our quarterly dividend by 11% and announced a $20 billion multiyear buyback program. Having a dividend that\u2019s aligned to the more stable earnings from Wealth and Investment Management is a leading priority of this firm. And by the way, today\u2019s stock price, the current dividend has a yield of approximately 4%. With the buyback, we wanted more flexibility than an annual fixed commitment allows. Given the nature of our business model, it\u2019s especially appealing to have this additional flexibility to deploy capital at what we believe to be attractive valuations. I will now turn the call over to Sharon. And as always, at the end, we will take your questions. Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $13.1 billion in the second quarter. Our EPS was $1.39 and our ROTCE was 13.8%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $1.44 and our ROTCE was 14.3%. Our results reaffirm the stability of the franchise against a challenging backdrop and the benefits of a balanced business model. The integrated investment bank continues to serve clients\u2019 evolving needs in a dynamic environment. Wealth Management benefited from its scale and rising rates. Despite the decline in global asset prices, our expanded product set in Investment Management proved supportive to that business. The firm\u2019s year-to-date efficiency ratio, excluding integration-related expenses, was 70%. This includes the $200 million legal matter related to the firm\u2019s recordkeeping requirements that James discussed. Given the broader market uncertainty and inflationary environment, we are focused on discretionary spend while balancing continued investment initiatives and ensuring the right controls are in place to support future growth. As a management team, our priority is to diligently address what we can control given the market realities. We will continue to review incremental spend as we regard efficiency as a critical performance objective. Now to the businesses, institutional revenue of over $6 billion demonstrates the power of our balanced franchise against the difficult market backdrop. Revenues declined from the exceptionally strong prior year, while the backdrop was challenging for Investment Banking, particularly underwriting, fixed income and equities led the strength of the quarter as clients navigated volatile markets. Investment Banking revenues were $1.1 billion, down significantly from the prior year. Heightened volatility led clients to delay strategic actions and new issue activity. Advisory revenues were $598 million, reflecting lower completed M&A volumes. Equity underwriting revenues declined to $148 million. Results were in line with global equity volumes, which fell meaningfully versus the prior year. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $326 million, also down compared to the prior year as bond issuance was muted across both investment grade and non-investment-grade companies. The Investment Banking pipeline remains solid. Conversion to realize will largely be dependent on market conditions and corporate confidence. Equity revenues were $3 billion, reflecting the strength of our business against a volatile backdrop. Prime brokerage revenue... [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Please standby as we reconnect our speakers. Please continue. Sharon Yeshaya : Our revenues declined versus the prior year and reflected a loss of $413 million. Mark-to-market losses on corporate loans held-for-sale including event loans offset by gains on hedges were $282 million. This reflected the widening of credit spreads. Notable declines in deferred-based \u2013 in deferred cash-based compensation plans compared to gains in the prior year also contributed to the decline. Turning to ISG lending, as a reminder, over 90% of our ISG loans and commitments are either investment grade or secured. Our Institutional Securities Group credit portfolio continues to perform well. Our funded ratio on corporate loans stands at approximately 11%, in line with pre-pandemic levels and well below the first quarter 2020 peak of approximately 25%. Turning to Wealth Management, by several measures, performance was strong despite the volatile backdrop. We reported revenues of $5.7 billion. Results were meaningfully impacted by movements in DCP, which reduced revenues by $515 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues increased 6% from the prior year to $6.3 billion, a new record. The decline in DCP was substantially offset by a reduction in compensation expense. Excluding integration-related expenses, PBT was robust at $1.6 billion and the margin increased to 28.2%. The margin resilience in a turbulent market environment serves as evidence of the strength of the franchise and the benefits of our business mix, including the growth of our banking offerings. Transactional revenues were $291 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, transactional revenues declined 17%. Lower revenues reflect a moderation of client activity from last year\u2019s elevated levels and limited new issuance. Self-directed daily average trades remained well above E TRADE\u2019s pre-acquisition high. Asset management revenues of $3.5 billion were up modestly versus the prior year driven by strong fee-based flows realized over recent quarters. Fee-based flow assets were $29 billion in the quarter and fee-based assets now represent 50% of our adviser-led assets. Total net new assets were $53 billion in the quarter bringing year-to-date NNA to $195 billion, representing a 6% annualized growth rate. Tax outflows were roughly double that of recent second quarters and yet asset generation remains strong and balanced. NNA was driven by existing and new clients in the adviser-led channel, stock plan vesting events, positive net recruiting and self-directed channel inflows. Bank lending balances grew $7 billion in the quarter driven by securities based lending and mortgages. We continue to expect full year loan growth of $22 billion. Deposits declined $12 billion in the quarter to $340 billion. The decline was associated with seasonal tax outflows and the deployment of rate-sensitive cash. The outflows were largely in line with our expectations. The average rate of deposits increased to 28 basis points. This was driven by an increase in savings account rates and deposit mix. Net interest income was $1.7 billion, up notably from the prior year, driven by higher rates and continued strong bank lending growth. Looking ahead to the second quarter, NII is now a more reasonable exit rate going forward. While the magnitude of rate hikes is not certain, if the forward curve is realized and our model assumptions materialize, we estimate $500 million of incremental NII to be spread over the upcoming two quarters weighted towards the fourth quarter. Turning to Investment Management, revenues were $1.4 billion. Against the challenging public market environment, our results demonstrate the benefits of our diversified product mix, particularly with strength in our portfolio solutions led by Parametric customization and private alternative funds as well as our liquidity offering. We have built a portfolio that provides balance across various market environments. The benefits of these efforts were apparent in the quarter. Total AUM was $1.4 trillion. Long-term net outflows of $3.5 billion primarily reflect recurring headwinds in equity strategies that were partially offset by strong demand in alternatives and solutions, particularly in Parametric customized portfolios. Collaboration with our Wealth Management business as well as other U.S. wealth management platforms is a driver of strength of our customized offerings. Liquidity net inflows exceeded $30 billion. We have invested in our liquidity business in the past decade, which has positioned our franchise well to benefit from the current rising rate environment. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion. The impact of lower AUM was partially offset by higher liquidity fee revenue as rates came off of a zero-bound. Performance-based income and other revenues were $107 million in the quarter. We saw broad-based gains in our private alternative portfolio with particular strength in infrastructure and the energy sector investment. The decline versus the prior year was driven by movements in DCP and markdowns on public investments. Overall, our integration with Eaton Vance continues to progress well. We have seen early success in leveraging our global distribution across our combined businesses. Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets declined 4% from the prior quarter to $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.2%, up 70 basis points versus the prior quarter. Standardized RWAs notably decreased to $461 billion from the prior quarter as we manage our exposure efficiently across our businesses amid a market decline. The result was a reduction in RWAs of $40 billion. OCI related to our available-for-sale securities portfolio reflected an increase of unrealized losses of $1.1 billion. While this should be earned back over time, it reduced our CET1 ratio by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 5.4%. During the second quarter, we completed our $12 billion buyback plan that we announced last year. The most recent stress test results further reaffirmed our durable business model and we announced a dividend increase of 11% and a $20 billion multiyear repurchase authorization. Looking ahead, while the second half of the year remains difficult to predict, we are focused on our underlying business drivers. Lower asset values will impact revenue in both Wealth and Investment Management. However, in Wealth Management, rising rates are already driving NII higher, supporting performance and net new assets remain healthy in Investment Management. The diversification across fund strategies should continue to support results. What we do not know is how much volatility we will see in the coming months and how it will impact our Institutional Securities business. However, our competitive positions remains strong and we remain close to our clients while they assess current valuations and the overall environment. With that, we will now open the line up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Christian Bolu : Thank you. Good afternoon, James I guess and then good morning Sharon. Maybe start on the macro, James, it\u2019s a very confusing time on the macro front and there are some positives but a ton of headwinds. I\u2019d also say this quarter was unusually noisy for Morgan Stanley and I think you kind of put up your lowest ROE in almost 2 years? So just curious how you are thinking about the macro backdrop, how is MS positioned for that backdrop? Maybe how you think about your pathway to achieve some of your longer term targets in the current backdrop? Thanks. James Gorman : Sure. Thanks, Christian. I think you hit on the head, the environment \u2013 if I had to use one word to describe it, it would be complicated. We have the Russian invasion of the Ukraine, obviously, an historic occasion. We have historically low rates with very significant rate increases going around the world. We have got the tail of COVID. We have got obviously the fears of inflation and actual inflation. We have got enormous political change just here in this country, the UK, where I am at the moment. They had a leadership change a few days ago, supply chain issues, China-U.S. relations, etcetera, so yes, very complicated. I think it\u2019s important to say though, it is not 2008 complicated. This is a different type of financial stress in the system. And frankly, the banking sector is much stronger than it was going into the last time we went through a major reset in \u201807/08. Morgan Stanley is in particular, I won\u2019t speak for others, but we are in specifically much better shape. We are long in the U.S. in our businesses, largely because Wealth Management is almost entirely U.S. and the U.S. is yet again sort of a great region to be in, in the world. And yes, while we might head into some form of recession \u2013 and I, like many of others, have tried to handicap it, but we are frankly guessing at this stage, but I think it\u2019s unlikely to be a deep and dramatic recession at least in the U.S. I think Asia is a little behind. It depends how COVID rolls out, and it\u2019s sort of reemerging a little bit in some countries. And then Europe is obviously \u2013 is fighting the hardest right now because of the war in the Ukraine, because of the pressure on gas and gas prices and so on. So when I look at Morgan Stanley, sort of added all together, we did exactly what we wanted to do this quarter. Yes, it\u2019s the lowest ROE for a couple of years after, I think, 3 consecutive record years, but hey, this is the most difficult environment we\u2019ve been in decades. So I\u2019m okay with the lower ROE, particularly when it has a ten-handle on it. We have \u2013 CET1 capital ratio is 200 basis points above our requirement. Our ROTCE was nearly 14%. If you look at the Wealth Management margins, we did a 27% margin, including integration this quarter, 28% without it. Those numbers were unheard of a few years ago. So you add it all together, the environment, very complicated, lots of uncertainty. But frankly, for our business model, I think we fare relatively well. And evidence of that is our confidence in the future, and I\u2019m sure we will talk about that in terms of capital and so on. Christian Bolu : Okay. Thank you, James. Maybe, Sharon, some more specifics around the buyback, just thinking about how you\u2019re thinking about buybacks in the second half of the year. I mean your CET1 did grow quarter-over-quarter, but I think a little of that was RWA declining. It looks like actually CET1 dollars are still falling \u2013 have been falling for a while. So I don\u2019t know, can you maintain the sort of $2.7 billion-ish buyback per quarter going forward or any more specifics around how long it will take to exhaust that $20 billion in buybacks you announced? Sharon Yeshaya : Well, multiyear obviously means more than 1 year. So sort of just to put that in perspective, but I think that the most important thing about the buyback and also the capital more broadly is we\u2019ve been very prudent and efficient around our capital usage. I think that we\u2019ve always said that capital is very much tied to strategy. They are one and the same. And so we think about them holistically. When we think specifically about the buyback and the concept of a multiyear repurchase plan, right, two points : one, we did complete our old authorization. So therefore, we had announced a new authorization. And in addition to that, the point is we provide ourselves with tremendous flexibility in an environment such as this one where there are, as James said, multiple macroeconomic factors but also a commitment to continue to return capital to those shareholders, be that both in the evidenced by the increase in the dividend. And I think that what we\u2019re looking for is really \u2013 is flexibility around the capital purchase plan. James Gorman : I just want to add something. I mean it was an important move to $20 billion number. And we said multiyear for a reason. Obviously, we\u2019re not going to do that in 1 year, but we have enormous flexibility quarter-to-quarter now, and that\u2019s really important. And with 200 basis points of capital access, we can use some of that flexibility. Listen, the stock trade \u2013 I don\u2019t know what it is this morning, $72 or something, it was $109 a couple of months ago. I like buying the stock at $72. And by the way, every time you buy a share at $72, your retiring dividend worth $3.10. So there is a sort of virtuous circle, if we bought back \u2013 we\u2019re averaging about 6% of shares outstanding net, we\u2019re buying back plus a 4% dividend, shareholders getting great return without getting out of bed. So this is a statement of confidence of, a, our capital position; and, b, the resilience of our business model. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. Maybe just a follow-on on the buyback convo and broaden it out. When you look across all the big GSIBs, lots of higher \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, lots of the GSIBs, lots have higher GSIB buffers coming, capital deficiency to their targets and don\u2019t have the access that you have. So I get it, buyback cheap stock is great. Are there any other options that you ponder like maybe using that capital to grow share in any parts of the business or just save it for a rainy day, like I am curious on how that dynamic works being one of the only ones with the excess position? James Gorman : Well, it\u2019s \u2013 Glenn, this is sort of the ultimate question. We\u2019ve built through a decade of, frankly, hard work and discipline, a great excess capital position. Not for nothing along the way, we did two major acquisitions. So we\u2019re using it on deals and two small ones, Solium and Mesa West, you recall, the majors, of course, E TRADE and Eaton Vance. We\u2019ve taken the dividend. Last year, we doubled the dividend. And this year, we took it up another 11%. It wasn\u2019t so long ago, our dividend was $0.05 a quarter. The incremental change this year is $0.075 a quarter. So we\u2019ve used on that. We\u2019re investing in the business everywhere, particularly around the workplace retirement space. We\u2019ve invested in the digital bank and building out the wealth space. We\u2019ve invested in asset management and our capability, and we\u2019re going to be doing more of that, taking the Eaton Vance Funds internationally, expanding the Parametric program. And then we\u2019re investing in banking. I mean, obviously, the banking calendar has been terrible the last few months, but that\u2019s not \u2013 we\u2019re interested in the next 10 years, not the last few months. So the only thing we haven\u2019t done with excess capital is do a special dividend. And that\u2019s something I\u2019m just personally not a fan of. I just don\u2019t \u2013 I think it\u2019s like giving shareholders a problem and saying, we don\u2019t know what to do with their money. Here, you take it. So what we like to do with that money, invest it in the business, check; give you a smart dividend with a 4% yield, check; and do buybacks and have flexibility around it when the stock is trading. At the beginning of the year for every x dollars we spent, we\u2019ve got 4 shares retired. Now we\u2019re retiring 5 shares. I like that. Glenn Schorr : Cool. I appreciate all that, James. A follow-up on Wealth Management, Sharon, thank you, you gave color on new money coming into which types of accounts and new clients. I\u2019m curious, what are they doing with it? In other words, is it sitting in cash? Our cash position is higher than they usually are. What products are they going to? And then thirdly, you\u2019re the largest gatherer of alternative assets. Has this market brought any noticeable impact to that opportunity on the wealth channel? Thank you. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. Let me start with the last. No, no change in opportunity. I think we continue to actually work very closely with different alternative managers as we go forward and think about \u2013 educate FAs, educate FAs, educate their clients and use that relationship to continue to create the right products for our clients, all based on education through both channels. In terms of what are they doing with that money, I think what you do see is a lot of the money ends up moving into fee-based over time, right? So look at the fact that we aggregated all these net new assets over recent quarters that first often does come into the system as cash when they are brought over. And then that cash is then deployed into various types of fee-based asset accounts. I think it\u2019s worth noting and just repeating that those fee-based assets are now 50% of our adviser-led channel and those assets, which is a big move from those somewhat 40s, low 40s that we had seen in previous years. In terms of very specifically what we\u2019ve seen over the course of the first half of this year in terms of different types of products, we were sitting at the end of the fourth quarter with cash levels at around 17% to 18% around the self-directed and the advice-based channel. We\u2019re now around 21%. Of course, that could be reflective of some of the equity asset values and the other asset values coming down to increase. But there is somewhat of \u2013 there is a pause, I think, people are waiting and observing in certain end markets to deploy that cash. And I think that, that\u2019s just \u2013 you can see that in the transactional coming down a bit and/or it\u2019s coming down a bit, but I don\u2019t want to suggest that the engagement isn\u2019t there, because we still are at levels where our engagement as thought about by the most DART metrics and just what we\u2019ve seen in transactional, it\u2019s still higher than levels where we were from a pre pandemic basis. So people are engaged, people are active, and they are seeking advice from their FAs. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Steve Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steve Chubak : Hi, good morning. So wanted to ask a follow-up question on the deposit outlook, as you noted in the prepared remarks, just lots of crosscurrents this quarter on the deposit side, tax seasonality, cash sorting and maybe some offset from higher market volatility? And given the NII guidance, Sharon that you had laid out, I was hoping you could speak to what you\u2019re assuming for deposit betas and the deposit growth trajectory given the myopic focus on cash sorting and recognizing that you already laid out some pretty explicit guidance on the loan growth side? Sharon Yeshaya : I think what you just noted at the very end is very important because all of this is weighted into that NII forecast, right? Deposit beta is just one piece of that conversation, the behavior and then also how we continue to build in an aggregate, be it new assets through NNA and also various types of, as you call it, cash sorting, but the movements of cash between products and that behavior of deposits. Specific to your question around the beta, as we\u2019ve said, we are informed by the last rate hike cycle, and it does have to do with the weighted beta at 50, which I had noted last quarter, and we will just reiterate again this quarter. There really has to do with the deposit composition mix that we have. So we have obviously accumulated very increased levels on those smaller accounts with smaller account levels. And we might have other accounts where we\u2019ve seen larger inflows into larger accounts, right? So account balances that are higher might also have gone up over time. And that helps to explain the deposit beta, which we see now based again, as I said, on that deposit composition mix. It will not just be, though, of course, around deposit beta. A lot that is embedded into the forecast, as I said, has to do with how we see those deposit behavior moving over time. And again, a lot of that is informed by what we saw in the last rate hike cycle. Steve Chubak : Very helpful color, Sharon. And maybe just a follow-up on the earlier discussion on organic growth, I mean the 4% number, which, considering the more pronounced tax seasonality, elevated market volatility, was certainly an impressive result. If the market volatility persists, should we view this as a reasonable floor on organic growth? And I was also hoping you could just speak to the cadence of flows from April to June, just to give us a sense as to how organic growth is trajecting over the course of the quarter? Sharon Yeshaya : Well, the cadence is obviously \u2013 you\u2019re not going to \u2013 you\u2019ve seen more in the second quarter \u2013 I mean you\u2019ve seen a different mix, right, in the second 2 months than the first month because you had a tax outflow season. So that kind of gives you the change in those two numbers. I think what we have seen is a continue \u2013 you have a lot that comes in from a flow-based basis is just \u2013 if you think about workplace, you\u2019re going to see that development and continue. As people have exercised their options, they continue to move forward. So there are various types of offsets. I think what\u2019s important as we look forward, in terms of where is the floor, look, we have said historically, we don\u2019t expect to be in that very low single-digit range, which we were before the acquisition of E TRADE. We said that 11% was too high. So that kind of gave you that middle range. Exactly how it will pan out, what I can say to you is that it does look \u2013 it\u2019s still healthy, and we\u2019re still \u2013 we still feel well positioned. As it relates specifically to other indicators that you might think about \u2013 for example, recruiting. When \u2013 recruiting pipeline remains healthy. And what we often see and tactically, anecdotally is when those recruits come over, they will be \u2013 they could be in a market volatility event actually be quicker to begin to bring those assets that were held away into the channel, why? Because they are seeking to be with their FA through that advice-led channel more immediately, so as you called it, there are cross currents. And I think they are into \u2013 bear in mind in this environment. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to follow-up on Investment Management and the fee outlook, you have, obviously, beta working against you in some of your higher fee products, but you have fee waivers coming off on the money market side. So as you think about mix and client behavior going forward, how do you think about the fee rate in that business longer-term? Sharon Yeshaya : It\u2019s a great question. I am sure you will see the disclosure also that will come out in the Q specifically for this business. But just to give you a sense, the fee rates themselves haven\u2019t changed. What changes \u2013 what has changed is the mix of the actual flows themselves. So we\u2019ve seen a decrease over the course of the last two quarters in some of those equity accounts, for example, which, as is disclosed, could be higher \u2013 can have higher fees. But what we have seen is an increase in balances. In things like liquidity, we\u2019re now not seeing the fee waivers since we\u2019ve moved off that zero-bound floor. We had given you previous guidance of $200 million that we expected to see as an incremental fee positive over the course of the year as those waivers went away because rates came off of that zero-bound. We stand behind that guidance, and you\u2019ve continued to see that flow into the numbers. I think, though, what is important is, obviously, where could you see things change, is the liquidity balances, right. It\u2019s a rate time balance question, as I said before. And the balance is in this case, I think, is a testament to the amount of time and the investment we\u2019ve put into this business to find relationships also across the integrated investment bank where we\u2019ve worked with partners in Institutional Securities, for example, to help forge relationships that will help bring in some of those deposits into those money market products. Dan Fannon : Great. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, given the backdrop we\u2019re in where revenues are a bit more challenged or uncertain. As you think about non-comp expense, and you highlighted being focused on this area and being efficient, but have you proactively started to make decisions around spend and cutting back or as you think about that flexibility in the back half of the year, is there a way to quantify levels of growth or lack thereof and any changes? Sharon Yeshaya : So the first point that I would highlight to you is that ex integration, our efficiency ratio is at 7%, and that includes the legal charge that James mentioned this quarter. So I think we have shown and continues to demonstrate discipline around our expense base, very similar to the way we think about capital. Resources, we think about it very holistically and part of our strategic decision-making process. As we walked into the second quarter, we were aware that the environment was changing, and we all had been seeing the same events that \u2013 we\u2019ve all witnessed together as it relates to the geopolitical front and the macro side. And we came in and we took a look \u2013 a hard look and we continue to do so, individual product by product, investment by investment, project by project to understand where are the potential growth in expenses coming from, how are we thinking about balancing, as James said, that near-term investment, making sure that we need to get on certain things. We always need to ensure that as we invest also with a longer-term horizon, the right controls are in place as we continue to grow the business efficiently, but are there projects that can be delayed that we might be doing on the margin? So I\u2019d say that, that work is in flight, has been in flight. It\u2019s not new information, and it\u2019s certainly something that we are keeping our eyes on. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hi, good morning. Just one more follow-up on the Institutional Securities business. So you talked about market share opportunities, which you clearly have. Would love to hear your thoughts around just the health of, one, how is the plumbing in the capital market functioning? We saw a bunch of headlines around hung deals, et cetera, during the quarter. So just how are clients holding up on the institutional side? And given how strong the franchise already is on the Prime Brokerage side, is there more opportunity there? I realize that was a big driver of the growth this quarter. So would love to hear your thoughts? Sharon Yeshaya : The \u2013 from \u2013 basically, in terms of the capital market functioning, as James said, this is not \u2013 we\u2019re not in a position of the same kind of stress we\u2019ve seen in other necessary cycles. We\u2019re still seeing functioning markets. You can see that in just some of the funded balance points that I made across the ISG portfolio in terms of funded balances being at 11% versus even the pandemic, we have seen those balances up to 25%. So I would certainly say that you see institutions that are in a good place. I also think from a corporate perspective, it is worth noting that many came into this from an environmental perspective in a much better position than they have before because they did issue and we\u2019re in a good spot from a balance sheet perspective in the period of low rates that you saw over the course of last year. Of course, there are days where it\u2019s more difficult to come to market. That is very clear as you see that in the underwriting results. So just to provide that balance, of course, it\u2019s not the same thing as having a green screen every single day. But I think that you are seeing both institutions and corporations, etcetera, taking advantage of days where the market is open, and they are able to do that, and from that perspective, the market is functioning. As it relates to Prime Brokerage, we have been very balanced in that business. I think we have been a tremendous leader in that business. And we continue to effectively look for the relationships that we are well suited for both in this environment that makes sense to partner with clients. You see that on the balance side. You see that on the revenue side. And you see that the mix also matters to us. And so from that perspective, we have been very focused on the equities business more holistically for over a decade now. Ebrahim Poonawala : Thanks for that. And just on the fixed income. So, appreciate that you all right-sized the business a few years ago. Like given the capital constraints at your peers, does it make sense maybe, James or Sharon, to like lean in and revisit areas where you could actually pick up share on the fixed income side or no? James Gorman : Listen, there is always opportunities to an environment where you can try and pick up share. We are in a bit of an uncertain world, as I opened with. I don\u2019t think this is the time to be overly aggressive personally. I like the fact we have excess capital. I like where our CET1 ratio is. Obviously, as you drive up RWAs, you read into that. We actually brought up RWAs down by $40 billion this quarter. I think the institutional team in both fixed income and equities were very prudent and appropriately so. So, listen, if the option is to trigger another 50 basis points on the SCB or generate another, I don\u2019t know, $100 million, $200 million in revenue. That for me is a very easy call right now. I like the 50 basis points that we haven\u2019t had to trigger that some of our competitors have. So, listen, we will be eyes wide open, but we are not trying to win the game right now. There is a \u2013 the fixed income business has gone from doing, I don\u2019t know what they were doing, $500 million, $600 million a quarter in the back half of 2015. And we are consistently somewhere between $1.75 billion and $3 billion, that\u2019s \u2013 they have done a phenomenal job. They have materially gained share. I think we are around 10% share up from 6% or lower in those days, stable business, great leadership. So, yes, we will be opportunistic, but we are not going to be greedy. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on Steve\u2019s questions on deposit beta, but rather talk about the balance side of things. So, the brokerage sweep deposits declined by about $30 billion this quarter. Sharon, I think you referenced that it \u2013 that was driven by both tax payments, but also some yield seeking. Could you maybe break that down a little bit, or do you have a sense about what that attribution would be, just so we can kind of level set and think about how much further potential deposit \u2013 deposit loss there could be from further yield seeking? Sharon Yeshaya : Yes. I think the better \u2013 I mean I think that one quarter would be a little bit difficult to kind of draw those conclusions. I think the way I would think about it, Brennan, is a little bit differently, which is some of the questions I know we have received are, well, why didn\u2019t your beta come down because you had E TRADE. And so those balances should be in a position where you should have an average weighted beta that\u2019s lower over time. So, I think the best way to kind of answer your question a little bit more head on in terms of where the underlying crux is, is we have seen balances also increase in the higher account level. That\u2019s built into the model. It\u2019s built into our expectations. It\u2019s built into the forecast. And we have said, as I said directly in my remarks, we also saw the deposit behavior very much in line with what we expected. And so it is working in terms of that predictability. But why is the beta then higher, some of that beta just has to do with \u2013 you have some higher balances. Why, because you accumulated them likely at periods of time where yields were lower, and there was excess cash that was sitting in position. And so some of that higher balanced amount begins to leave seeking out higher-yielding payments. So, I think that can help give you a little bit of construct in terms of what\u2019s going on from the balance perspective to more directly, I think answer the question rather than just look at one quarter\u2019s behavior. Brennan Hawken : Sure. Okay. That\u2019s fair. Thank you. And then when we think about the SBL book, you flagged the $22 billion of continued loan growth. So, it seems like you are expecting loan growth in the back half to be about half of what you saw in the first half a little more than that, but not by much. So \u2013 and it makes sense, it would slow. Can you talk about what we have seen from an LTV perspective in the SBL book and whether or not some of that slowing loan growth is going to reflect some \u2013 maybe some SBL pay-down, or is there the potential of some SBL reduction just because LTVs are getting high, and so there is going to need to be some of that just mechanically and maybe also how you manage those LTVs in these choppy market environments? Sharon Yeshaya : Yes. So, the LTVs are very well managed. No, it\u2019s okay. Okay. I am just trying to remember it all. So, from the LTV perspective, as you would expect, we are very much actually in line with where we have been from historical years. And the reason for that is it is a very well-managed book. And why any uptick at all, as you would expect, obviously, the value of the underlying has gone down. But from a historical basis, we have always been within that \u2013 sort of given a 40% range or low-40% range, we are in that range, and we are very much, like I said in line over the last couple of years. Now as it relates directly to what we are looking forward and seeing, I think what\u2019s important here is that from a mortgage perspective, you might see some slowing just obviously given where rates are. Now, why would the SBLs come down, you just might not have as much interest or engagement in the product with lower asset values. So, I don\u2019t look at it in terms of, oh, there is a management issue, rather that is a very well-managed portfolio where we haven\u2019t seen issues in a lot of different market environment with the calls from an operational perspective more broadly, etcetera, but rather just the engagement from that relationship side, is this the right product to be using now. You might not have those conversations as much with the asset values coming down. So, a very practical answer to the question that you gave. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. Just a follow-up on the loan growth, the $20 billion loan growth target from the start of the year, it looks like you are still looking at that. But how are you thinking about loss rates on those new loans given perhaps a new economic forecast? We note that provisions for wealth losses are already tripled with the level of last year. Kind of what\u2019s the risk in that portfolio? And does it make sense to have a loan growth target? It\u2019s always easy to make loans. It\u2019s just tough to get paid back sometimes. Thanks. Sharon Yeshaya : Yes. I think that the loan growth target is, I mean just in terms of \u2013 it\u2019s more of an expectation to help people understand what the NII projection is. I wouldn\u2019t call it as the target. To the point that was brought by Brennan, obviously, the expectations on a quarter-over-quarter basis has come down. So, we did see some pull forward, and that\u2019s all we are reflecting in that. As you look at the provisions themselves, they still vary on a relative basis to other provisions across various \u2013 both institutions, and even our Institutional Securities franchise is quite low. In terms of what drives that, as you know, it\u2019s all \u2013 it is based on the CECL concept, in the life of loan concept. And as you also know, it is a complicated idea between both qualitative and a quantitative scenario. For us, as we disclosed in our Q, the factors that we look at that are most important is really around GDP. We did see a degradation in the GDP expectations, very consistent with what\u2019s going on in the macroeconomic outlook. And we are expecting the recession that we have talked about, the probabilities are in the 50-50 range. And that\u2019s very consistent with also what we have said publicly. Mike Mayo : And so did you have any extra CECL provisions this quarter? Sharon Yeshaya : No. We are \u2013 we feel appropriately reserved for where we are right now. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. Sharon, in the workplace channel, you guys had some good growth in the number of participants on a year-over-year basis, it was up 17%. The unvested asset values declined about 33%. Can you give us a little color? Was it primarily just market conditions bringing that down, or is there something else there? Sharon Yeshaya : It\u2019s a great question and you draw a good point distinction. No, those are just the value \u2013 it\u2019s just the value of the assets themselves have gone down that those holders have. Now the increase in participants has a lot to do with the fact that we just continue \u2013 as we continue to \u2013 we mandate, we have seen that increase the number of participants. What I would say in terms of just an opportunity in terms of engaging with those clients is, obviously, it is a difficult time in environment for some of those individuals. And we do \u2013 we continue to educate and use financial wellness as a tool, especially in these environments, to explain the advice-driven model and provide us with an opportunity actually in this kind of environment to discuss what financial advice and what financial wellness is, specifically as people see different declines in their potential portfolio. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And does \u2013 do the assets skew to more new start-up companies that might be tech-orientated versus a more traditional industrial company or a stable company in those plans? Sharon Yeshaya : Skew, there are \u2013 there is a good portion, I would say of technology companies that would be in that sector that you can see as you see those asset values declined, but there is a balance on the other side of different types of companies. And as we win mandates, it\u2019s not just on the tech side. We are winning mandates across different institutions, especially as people better understand that financial wellness offering. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Appreciate all the details on Slide 11 here, the allowance for credit losses. Maybe you have had it before, but more relevant now, and good detail. If you had to kind of guesstimate in a moderate recession that $1.2 billion of total ACL, where does that go? Sharon Yeshaya : I think that is a very difficult question to answer. I think that what you can look at and think about it is, obviously, the economic scenario makes sense. The GDP makes sense, the size of the \u2013 where the growth actually comes from and goes, and then there is some extension of duration that you can see dependent on the rate rise expectation. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Any way to frame, does it double or triple? Obviously, a lot of the loans are in Wealth Management, which is just not going to \u2013 you would think have as much loss content, but any way to frame generically how high it could go? James Gorman : Yes, I would\u2026 Sharon Yeshaya : I mean you know what I would do \u2013 I would say is why don\u2019t you think about it as it relates to COVID, right. You can think about where we were from a COVID perspective. And so let\u2019s talk ISG specifically. The provisions this quarter are 82%. It was almost 4x that when you think about where we were from a COVID perspective. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. James Gorman : I would just point out that \u2013 sorry. I would just point out that the Wealth Management piece, ACL percentage is 0.1. These are very different kinds of loans from traditional consumer banking loans. So, you are just not going to see at least for that part of a major, major move. For the others, I think it\u2019s just \u2013 you can\u2019t project. I mean who knows what kind of recession \u2013 a recession might be, how long it might be and so on. But we manage this business conservatively and we don\u2019t have a big traditional middle market, small business loan book. We just don\u2019t have that kind of business. Matt O\u2019Connor: That\u2019s helpful. And then just a clarification question, the total DCP for the firm, you mentioned $515 million revenue impact in Wealth, but what\u2019s the firm-wide revenue and expense impact, please? Sharon Yeshaya : It\u2019s non-material per business line, which is why we don\u2019t call out the number. James Gorman : The reason we called it out in Wealth, just to be clear, was Wealth actually had a great quarter, revenue growth, new money growth, fee-based growth and margins year-over-year, the same at 27% in a very difficult environment. So, we thought it was kind of raining on the party a little bit that the DCP took $500 million off the top line number, even though it comes out of the comp expense number almost dollar-for-dollar, not quite. So, that\u2019s why we called it out. Ordinarily, we wouldn\u2019t call out DCP. We don\u2019t make a big deal of it. It\u2019s kind of \u2013 it\u2019s an accounting issue. It\u2019s not a business issue. So, we are not often that excited about it. But we just thought given you would all be interested in how the retail investor was behaving right now and what was going on in that business and how panic they were, the short answer is not very, behaving well, business stable, saw growth. Hence, we want to call it out. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Good morning. Maybe just on the RWA decline, was that a deliberate reduction, or is that more market-driven? And if somewhat \u2013 some deliberate actions, can you kind of give us a little more clarity on what those actions were specifically and if that can continue? Sharon Yeshaya : Yes. It was both is the way I would answer it. There are obviously market declines that had to do with it as well. But this was a very thoughtful use and approach around efficient uses of RWAs. And where does it make sense from a business perspective given the uncertainty, and I think there is a very \u2013 as I said, the same way when we think about the expenses, it\u2019s about being efficient and thoughtful and very prudent and flexible with all of that environment. So, it\u2019s both of those things that were taken into account when thinking about the RWA decline. James Gorman : Listen, I want to make an important point here. We regard our capital ratios as sacrosanct. These are a big deal for us. We have spent a decade building them. We like having excess capital for exactly this environment we are in now. We can buy back up to $20 billion and a bunch that we are going to be doing, hopefully, in the low-70s. So, making sure we give ourselves that flexibility, demonstrating discipline in a tough environment. I think Ted and the ISG team did a phenomenal job in driving that number down. And obviously, it\u2019s driven in part by volatility in the market, so things outside of their control. But this is something that we should and will try and control as best as we can. Jim Mitchell : Right. Maybe as a follow-up on that, James, I think you have talked about hoping the change in the mix of your business over time would push your DFAS losses and SCB down slightly. This year is probably a period of victory relative to what some happened to your peers. But do you think there is still room to see that come down over time given your changing mix? James Gorman : Absolutely. Look at the PPNR number, was materially up as stress losses were also up, not surprisingly. The test was incredibly demanding in this environment. But notwithstanding that, we increased the dividend and we still came out at 13.3, I think versus 13.2. We are very focused on the SCB buffer not getting away from us. The change in business model, the growth in the asset management business, the growth in the workplace retirement business, all of these things, which frankly are very capital-friendly. Yes, that number is going to keep moving. Then we have an argument we have been \u2013 an argument I won\u2019t put it that way, but let\u2019s just say a different point of view with the Federal Reserve about how they treat financial adviser compensation during a time of stress. And we have argued for a long time that financial adviser compensation is obviously variable. So, that expense comes down when revenues come down. The Fed has not yet seen it our way, but we are continuing to push that argument strongly. When it does, we believe that will free up another bunch of capital. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. James, you have talked about variable expenses for variable revenues, and the revenues were down, and comp was down. But at what point do you pull the lever on kind of plan being? I mean you said 50-50 on a recession. And Sharon talked about maybe delaying some projects. But when it comes to resource allocation, headcount, more aggressive moves to prepare for a difficult environment, you said yourself that it\u2019s uncertain, it\u2019s not the time to take too much extra risk to push your market share. But is it time to go to plan B or more recession-like scenario in terms of your resource management? James Gorman : No, it\u2019s not. We are overwhelmingly in the U.S. We had 6% revenue growth in the Wealth Management business, produced ex integration 28% margins. This is a business we definitely don\u2019t want to harm in this environment. And we are managing, I mean I guess it\u2019s quasi plan B., managing the RWAs as we just said in the balance sheet, reflecting a more stressed environment. We met as a Management Committee last September, I think and I spoke to the Management Committee about I felt there was much more downside risk to the market. The magnitude of it, I didn\u2019t have a strong feeling for, but I thought it was somewhere between significant and are really significant. And I think we are in the sort of significant phase right now. So, we started pulling back, Mike, at that point. We have got a very clear handle on headcount growth and where that growth is. We have also got a lot of regulatory obligations. We have got to continue to fulfill as all the banks do. But right now, we are definitely not in a sort of crisis mode at all. I mean that\u2019s what \u2013 if we were, we wouldn\u2019t be buying back $20 billion increase in the dividend 11%. On the other hand, balance sheet growth will be very measured. I think we will pick up share by banks coming back to us, not necessarily us having to move forward. And as I think Sharon articulated very well, we are doing a pretty systematic review of the prioritization of all the projects going on around the firm and also in a big company like this with $60 billion of revenue, we have a lot of stuff going on, and we have choices as to when we do it. So, I would call it a sort of plan A minus, not a plan B, if you will, but that\u2019s mindset we are in. However, if things get worse, and in my career, I have seen a lot of recessions, a lot of crises, a lot of damage done to the environment, if things really deteriorated, particularly in the U.S., then we take a much more aggressive position. And we obviously have the ultimate weapon, which is comp. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. Welcome to Morgan Stanley's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimers. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman. James Gorman : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us, and I know we're starting a little later than some of the previous quarters. So I appreciate you staying with us. The Firm performed well in a very uncertain and difficult environment. An ROTCE of 15%, excluding integration expenses, flexes stability and strength of the business model. Wealth Management pre-tax margin, excluding integration expenses, was 28.4% and coupled with $65 billion of net new assets, demonstrates how this business even in a very volatile market environment and with indices down over 20% this year, continues to attract new client assets and remains highly profitable. This business' enormous scale and channel diversification should ensure continued success.  Investment Management and Investment Banking were clearly impacted by the market environment. But as I've said elsewhere, advisory and underwriting activity has not gone away, it has simply been deferred. Fixed income and equities remains very solid with no areas of obvious concern. Both businesses navigated the complicated markets without serious incidents. Finally, the strength of our capital position is very clear, as shown by the continuation of our strong buyback program with $2.6 billion of share repurchases in this past quarter, coupled that with a dividend yield north of 3% and a CET1 ratio of 14.8%. On an operating basis, this Firm is doing well in a post-COVID world. From a markets perspective, we expect continued volatility as the Federal Reserve continues to tighten policy such to bring down inflation to acceptable long-term levels. This is an environment where it behoves management to be prudent but balanced, a wholesale retreat from the markets is not called for. But at the same time, I must be more cautious in credit-sensitive parts of the business. Fortunately, the business model changes for the past decade or more, plus the acquisitions of Smith Barney, E TRADE and Eaton Vance put us in a position of significant relative strength and should support solid absolute performance in the months ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the quarter in detail, and together, we'll take your questions. Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you, and good morning. The Firm produced revenues of $13 billion in the quarter. Our EPS was $1.47, and our ROTCE was 14.6%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $1.53, and our ROTCE was 15.2%. We built our business model to perform through the cycle and withstand volatile environments, evidenced again by the performance this quarter. In Institutional Securities, fixed income benefited from macroeconomic developments and in Wealth Management, we continue to attract strong net new assets, underscoring the benefits of an advice-driven model and a variety of backdrops. The Firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 72%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our year-to-date efficiency ratio was 71%, ensuring future growth remains a priority, and we continue to invest in tech-driven efficiencies. And with the abatement of COVID-related restrictions, marketing and business development expenses have progressively normalized as our teams reengage with clients and our colleagues in person. Efficiency remains an important performance objective and we review incremental spend on an ongoing basis. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues were $5.8 billion, down from the robust prior year, but seasonally strong for -- seasonally strong rather, for a seasonally slower quarter relative to historical levels. Strength in fixed income and equities was a counterbalance to muted activity and investment banking. Investment Banking revenues decreased year-over-year to $1.3 billion, with meaningful declines across products, particularly underwriting. Ongoing market volatility continued to weigh on issuance and led clients to delay strategic actions. Advisory revenues were $693 million. Solid results reflected the completion of previously announced strategic transactions. Revenues were down relative to the record prior year and in line with broader M&A market volumes. Equity underwriting revenues were $218 million with year-over-year declines across products, reflecting the overall volatility in global equity markets. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $366 million. Investment grade issuance fared better. Issuers took advantage of favorable windows and investors demonstrated selectivity in a more challenging market. We remain engaged with clients and strategic dialogues are active across multiple industry groups. The eventual conversion to announcement is dependent on clarity around macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, growth and geopolitics as well as the stabilization of valuation. Equity revenues were $2.5 billion, the business performed well against the backdrop of equity market declines and volatility. Prime Brokerage revenues decreased from last year. Results were impacted by lower average balances reflective of client deleveraging, which was partially offset by the mix of client balances. Cash and derivative results declined versus the prior year as client activity moderated. Fixed income revenues of $2.2 billion represented the highest third quarter in over a decade driven by strength across the macro complex. Macro revenue increased meaningfully versus the prior period. Inflationary pressure as well as central bank and fiscal activity drove volatility higher. By extension, changes in portfolios supported client engagement and increased flow trading activity, benefiting rates and foreign exchange. Micro revenues were in line with the prior year. Revenues favored the Americas more in the current period. Other revenues declined from the prior year and reflected a loss of $100 million. Mark-to-market losses on event and relationship loans, net of hedges and movements in revenues related to deferred cash-based compensation contributed to the decrease. Turning to Wealth Management. The business continues to deliver strong results despite the economic uncertainty. Revenues increased from the prior year to a robust $6.1 billion as we continue to grow the more stable parts of our Firm. The rising rate environment supported net interest income, more than offsetting the lower asset management and transactional revenues. Pre-tax profit was $1.6 billion, and the PBT margin was 26.9%. Excluding integration-related expenses, the PBT margin reached 28.4%, underscoring the resiliency of this business against the backdrop of declining asset values. Total net new assets were $65 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date net new assets to $260 billion. Asset consolidation from existing clients, net new clients, workplace relationships and positive net recruiting were all sources of strength. The growth of net new assets highlights the value of trusted advice especially through periods of market uncertainty. Our platform continues to attract advisors who recognize the integral role of the Wealth Management business at the Firm, and the value advisors gain by leveraging our technology and our products to best serve their clients. Transactional revenues of $616 million declined from the prior period, due to lower retail engagement and the impact of movements in revenues related to deferred compensation plans. Asset management revenues of $3.4 billion primarily reflected lower market levels. Fee-based flows were $17 billion, moderating from the robust levels seen in recent quarters, suggesting retail hesitancy to invest in managed products in uncertain markets. Bank lending balances grew to $146 billion. And on a year-to-date basis, balances have grown by $16 billion on a year-to-date basis. Rather, this quarter, balances have grown by $16 billion. The pace of loan growth slowed this quarter on the back of paydowns in securities-based lending and moderating mortgage growth. Total deposits declined by 2% in the quarter to $332 billion. There was a shift in mix to higher-yielding saving products as our expanded bank offering attracted clients' investable cash. Net interest income was $2 billion, up nearly 50% from the prior year. In this accelerated rate hike cycle, we have outperformed our model beta across our deposit portfolio, which has more than offset the changing mix of our deposit base. Through the end of the year, we would expect NII to remain broadly in line with the guidance provided last quarter. Noting that some of the rate benefit was pulled forward into the third quarter. Despite this period of heightened uncertainty and volatility, we achieved consistent growth in Wealth Management. We continue to deliver strong net new assets and demonstrate economies of scale with considerable growth opportunities ahead. Turning to Investment Management. Revenues of $1.2 billion declined from the prior period, substantially driven by lower asset values as well as the impact of outflows over the last year. Total AUM ended at $1.3 trillion. Long-term flows were approximately $2 billion. While equity strategies continue to see outflows, the pace has moderated from recent quarters. Interest rate volatility negatively impacted fixed income flows. However, our broadened portfolio also delivered offsets. Inflows of $7 billion into our Alternative and Solutions platform were led by continued demand for Parametric customized portfolios and our direct indexing and tax-efficient investing capabilities, as well as continued demand for private credit. Liquidity and Overlay Services had outflows of $32 billion. Clients likely relocated money market holdings to alternative risk-free assets. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion. The impact of lower average AUM led to the year-over-year decline. Performance-based income and other revenues were a net loss of $101 million, primarily driven by the markdown of a single underlying public investment in one of our Asia private equity funds. Investments in the business and the integration of Eaton Vance continue to progress well. We are investing in products and vehicles that will allow us to deliver solutions to a broader set of clients. Our strategic focus on secular growth areas such as alternatives and direct indexing, supported by our ability to globally distribute products, positions us well to perform through the cycle. Turning to the balance sheet. Standardized RWAs were relatively flat, ending the quarter at $460 billion. Prudent management of resources was partially offset by an increase due to market volatility. During the third quarter, we also bought back $2.6 billion of stock, taking advantage of our current valuation and utilizing the flexibility of our repurchase authorization. OCI related to our available-for-sale securities portfolio reflected unrealized losses of $1.3 billion. While this should be earned back over time, it reduced our CET1 ratio by approximately 30 basis points in the quarter. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 14.8%, approximately 150 basis points above our regulatory requirement, inclusive of buffers as of October 1. Capital remains critical to our strategy, particularly in this rapidly evolving backdrop. Our tax rate was 21.4% for the quarter, down from the third quarter of last year, primarily driven by the realization of certain tax benefits. We now expect that our full year '22 tax rate will be approximately 22%. Looking ahead, the broader economic outlook remains uncertain. While we cannot be sure how the market dynamics will play out, we remain confident in our strategy, particularly our ability to aggregate client assets in Wealth Management, support our Institutional clients and deliver diversified solutions in Investment Management, all while prudently managing our capital profile and focusing on our strategic goals.  With that, we will now open up the line to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess -- so James, you alluded to a lot of cross-currents. I fully appreciate that. I think from your shareholders' perspective, I think why folks own Morgan Stanley is some degree of confidence on the superior ROE, defensibility of that ROE. Just talk to us as you think about -- I mean, we've already seen a ton of market volatility. As we look forward, your confidence where return on tangible equity, 15%, 16%, how defensible do you think that is and understanding the quarter-to-quarter volatility. But how defensible do you think that is? And remind us about the synergies from Eaton Vance, E TRADE, et cetera, that we should be mindful of when we think about Morgan Stanley's growth relative to what happens to the market? James Gorman : Great. Well, that's a good broad question to kick it off. I would say, first of all, we're thrilled with the deals we did with E TRADE and Eaton Vance. I mean they\u2019ve both worked better than expectations. In Eaton Vance, for example, the gem that is Parametric as just the gift that keeps giving. E TRADE with the deposits that we brought over through that deal, what we've done with the stock plan business is now combined with ours, 35% of the S&P companies. And obviously, having a digital banking platform, I've often described E TRADE, it's a technology company, and we brought a lot of technology with that. So just on those two things, thrilled with it.  In terms of the overall environment and how we play in that environment, maybe I'll just touch on the environment for a minute. It shouldn't be surprising what's going on in the market. So I'm kind of surprised every time I see somebody on TV who seems surprised by it. We had zero interest rates for a decade. We have massive monetary and fiscal stimulus. We have the first land war in Europe in 70 years. The highest inflation in 40 years, and the Fed had to move. Now my opinion was they moved late, but they moved and they're going to keep moving. And rates are now around 3%, they're probably going to go mid-4s, but that remains to be determined. And with that, there will be consequences. So far, we haven't seen clarity around inflation abating. My guess is that we will see that clarity and it will be more evident certainly by the middle of next year. And I think the Fed will be successful in this journey, but that's a gut from all the numbers I'm looking at, but it doesn't mean I'm going to be right. The world obviously remains volatile. We -- you're going to see some disruption. We're seeing it. Some of the more ridiculous stuff that's been in the market in the last few years, company is trading at 50x revenues, what's gone on with Bitcoin trade at $60,000 some of the -- what's going on in some of the GameStop and other companies where there's been these sort of aberration type trading. I mean that's been washed out. And that's okay. We're back to sort of fundamentals.  So how does Morgan Stanley play in that? Investment Management, obviously gets hurt when fees are down because asset prices are down. But I'm not -- I don't think we're in a long-term financial depreciation. So I'm not particularly concerned about that. As I've said, the banking pipeline and underwriting gets deferred. People don't stop doing deals. In fact, there was a deal announced this morning. And there'll be much more deals as we get closer to economic clarity. Our sales and trading businesses remain robust. We are holding share in those. I feel very good about that. And a lot of that business is actually repeatable. If you think of Prime Brokerage, it's actually very stable. And with Wealth Management, we brought in $65 billion of new money in one of the most difficult quarters that we've had in 15 years. I mean, that would have been unthinkable even two years ago. So the fact our clients are continuing to bring us money and the funnel of all the ways the money comes in the door is working, it's not -- that's not an accident. That's a business model design. So I'm really happy with the way that's working out.  So in aggregate, I am pretty relaxed. I mean, our CET1 around 14.8%. We're required to have 13.3%, I think. And I don't know if that answers your question, we could probably spend all day talking about it. But the environment is difficult, but we are not under stress. Ebrahim Poonawala : No, it did. And just one quick follow-up to that. At the same time, you've shown a tendency to lean in the opportunistic Eaton Vance, E TRADE, a lot of disruption among your peers, both here in Europe. Any -- like how do you think about just Morgan Stanley leaning in to actually gain share in this backdrop? James Gorman : Well, I think you've got to keep investing. And we are not making major cutbacks across the plant. I mean I'm sure Sharon will talk about expenses in a minute. We're obviously being prudent. But we don't see any reason for great draconian measures. We've built a business model. And in times like this is when -- if you can sustain it, you actually do very well coming out the other side. So I feel pretty good about our relative position, to be honest. Operator : We'll take our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Christian Bolu : Maybe, Sharon, on the deposits, I hear your comments on deposit mix shift but sweep deposits were down, I think, 18% Q-on-Q, which I think is the worst quarter decline by significant margin. So I'm a little surprised that you said deposit beta expectations -- deposit beta is in line with expectations. I guess my question is, how are you now thinking about your guide for 50% terminal deposit beta. Is that still realistic given the Fed is still hiking and obviously the pace here of sweep deposit decline? Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. So let me just take them and separate them a little. So the change that you saw in mix of deposits, you actually -- what we saw is we have -- I would label it as transactional cash and investable cash. The transactional cash is the sweep deposits that you're talking about. And as James said, with the expanded offering, which was also aided by E TRADE, we have more diversified products than we've ever had before. And in fact, what we've seen is the savings account that we offer is those other deposits is where those -- that investable cash is going when it's new to the bank. So from the aggregate standpoint, Morgan Stanley actually has the vast majority of its deposits is coming from the Wealth Management system. This is important when we compare it to the last period that you're talking about because that actually wasn't the case. So we had sweep deposits. We had some savings in CDs, but a big chunk of that was actually wholesale that was coming from outside. So what James has said with us being able to attract these new assets, these are new assets that are sitting at Morgan Stanley that over time can be deployed as you think about either different investment opportunities or different transactional opportunities.  As it relates to deposit beta, we are outperforming the deposit beta that we've modeled, which is where that NII is still coming from. So NII, as you know, Christian, is going to be made of three different things : the deposit beta, the actual deposit mix and then loan growth. And taken together, that's still propelling NII to where it was this quarter. Christian Bolu : Okay. Maybe on just leverage lending and the bridge book. Can you speak to your balance sheet risk appetite? You guys seem to be on a number of sort of like home deals, Citrix, Twitter, et cetera. So first of all, how big is your bridge book or leverage loan book, however you want to characterize it? And then second, are you increasing your risk appetite here to capture opportunities? And then how are you thinking about managing that risk? Sharon Yeshaya : So broadly speaking, I'd say we've been extremely prudent in terms of risk management. I think that's most notable actually when you think about our RWAs and just our capital position. So we've been looking at different risk-based metrics really over time and bringing them down over the course of the year. So that's for the entire institution, just knowing that we've entered into what feels like a more volatile period. And as you think about those different relationship and event net of hedges, over the course of this quarter, they actually were quite modest marks, given the environment. Operator : We'll go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : So maybe a follow-up on the deposit conversation. I'm curious, you have these expanded offerings. You have the provided savings accounts. How do you monitor and how do you guide client behavior? And is the goal at all costs keep deposits in-house, even if the cost of those deposits is a lot higher than sitting in a brokerage account? I'm just curious on the how to. Sharon Yeshaya : The intention, of course, is to give the clients opportunities and choice, Glenn, as you know, which has been our position over the course of the last God knows how long. But the intention is to give them as many offerings as possible. And yes, as you said, if we can bring those assets in and give them an opportunity to have a savings account or we can issue CDs or as you've always talked about, we have other types of things such as alternatives. What it does is it brings those assets in-house. And then in a point where they want to be deployed into the marketplace, we can do that. As it relates to what we might necessarily give to different deposits, it would be, of course, again, related to the transactional versus investable cash. Glenn Schorr : Maybe staying in Wealth, the -- you've been very successful at growing your securities-based loan book. I think of those as extremely low risk to Morgan Stanley. But backed by securities and securities of all types have fallen a lot. So I'm curious if you can comment on how big is the book? Will it still grow? And how are you managing the whole margin call situation? Just get a mark-to-market on that, that would be great. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. So we have seen a pay down specifically this quarter, so just in terms of the actual book. But in terms of the risk, which you highlight, we've always said it's really more of an operational risk than anything else. We have obviously seen margin calls, and they've all been handled very well over the course of the quarter. So we haven't seen any issues there. And in addition to that, I think when you look at the LTVs, what we noticed when we have those -- we obviously look at that data internally. And it is very much in line with the longer-dated historical average. And for this quarter, it was over the course of the quarter, on average, was in line with last quarter as well. So I think that book remains very well managed, means a great opportunity and option for our client base. And of course, it will just be dependent on the environment itself. Operator : We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : I'd like to drill in a little bit, Sharon, to the comments that you made around deposit betas and deposits and what's been changing in the mix for you all. That all makes a lot of sense. I think that there's clear benefits to having deposits much more oriented to the Wealth Management business and it helps to watch that mix between the sweep and other. But the idea that the NII guide is essentially unchanged and you had $250 million growth quarter-over-quarter, that suggests that basically NII is going to be flat into 4Q. So is that -- have we hit -- given the dynamics, given you have wealthier clients and you have more of their cash, and so you -- there's -- if you want to keep that funding which is, of course, more attractive than wholesale, then you're going to have to pay for it in those savings accounts. And so therefore, is it just -- and with loan growth slowing, is it just right to just assume that, okay, this is probably like the stable level of NII for at least the foreseeable future as we head into 2023? Or will we hit a point where you'll be able to continue to see some -- resume some growth and we've just entered this transition period. How should we think about it a little bit longer term? Sharon Yeshaya : Yes. I think -- I mean the truth is, I think we'll have to see, right? So you're right in your assumption that that's basically what it implies in terms of the quarter-over-quarter for NII. Obviously, we haven't given 2023 guidance yet. And the reason, I mean, aside from the fact that we generally give guidance in January. But aside from that, the guidance would obviously also take into place what is actually happening with the deposit mix. And I do think that this is -- obviously, is an accelerated rate hike cycle. The deposit behavior is still playing out, but the intention here is really to make sure that we have these deposits in-house, and they will continue to be deployed into the marketplace over time. So that's the balance that one is trying to achieve when you think about that deposit mix and what we're actually doing from a great bank and growth perspective. On the loan side, I think that, again, where you see the positivity is these are environmental factors, right? So when you think of household penetration from our FAs into different mortgage and lending products, those things continue to rise. So what you're focused on, which is completely fair, is really going to be dependent largely on the environment itself, how quickly you see rates move and then how you see deposit behavior play out over time. Brennan Hawken : Okay. That is all totally fair. Thanks for that color. Second question would be on the LevFin book. There's definitely some increased focus there. You referenced some marks through the Institutional business on the other line, which wasn't that surprising given the environment. But how are you thinking about managing those risks? There still is some inventory that The Street broadly is going to need to work through and investor appetite has been weak. And so how have you hedged that book? How should we be thinking about those risks going forward? And how are you continuing to manage it? Sharon Yeshaya : Clearly, prudent disciplined risk management. And I think that the markets that you've seen so far underscores and underlines that. I think that the other point that I would just mention, as we think about the outlook perspective, what you saw over the course of the third quarter was that the market and issuers and others are very opportunistic as it relates to wins, and it's a window specific driven market. And so when you do see positive windows, and we saw it in August, and we saw in early September, you do see movement. And so, one is watching that calendar as you think through that. And I think we're looking for those market receptivities and for those favorable windows. James Gorman : I'd just add to it. I mean, there's obviously been a lot of talk about this here in a couple of names in particular, and we can't talk about individual names as much as I'm sure you'd all like us to. By the way, they're not hung deals until they're actually out there. But put that aside. About a year ago, a little over a year ago, we turned quite conservative, Brennan. We across the whole plant we pulled in a little bit. And we pulled in with our margin book, particularly our Asia margin book. We looked across our whole Prime Brokerage platform, and we pulled in a little bit with certain clients there. And we've been quite cautious in our leverage finance arena. And as somebody mentioned one transaction, Citrix, we're actually a small player in that. So we're not -- it's not like we've been large in this space, which might account for the fact -- in the other line, which is -- incorporates a bunch of things, including loan losses, number actually is very modest. I think it was like negative 100. And there are a few pluses in there and minuses. But the aggregate picture is not that -- frankly, it's just not that troubling. We'll remain cautious, as I said in my sort of opening comments, particularly in credit sensitive areas. We're a big institution. We serve a lot of clients. You don't get this perfect. But I feel actually pretty good about the way we've navigated this so far. So stay tuned to it. Operator : We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : I wanted to follow up on the wealth side in terms of organic growth. The fee-based growth did slow a bit. And I think, Sharon, you mentioned some decision-making maybe being a little bit more challenged or slowdown in this type of backdrop. But maybe could you just talk more broadly about the channels that you're seeing growth in both the total flows as well as maybe what's -- where the rate of change might be either the biggest or slowest, whether that's through existing advisors, workplace in the various funnels that you have out there? Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. I think that's a really great question because I think it is pretty remarkable to see $65 billion of assets in a quarter such as this one, it is coming from different parts of the funnel. Specifically, though, the advice-based channel is the one aggregating the most at this point in time versus the self-directed itself, which isn't surprising. But what's so interesting about the advice-based channel is it's a, existing and new clients? Yes. But also, we're beginning to see more and more referrals and more and more anecdotes and stories where you actually see the assets that's coming through the advice-based channel is actually coming through different referrals that we might have seen from the actual workplace relationships. And so we've been on a lot of time when you look at workplace and finding a way to, a, provide better content and more content to various employers, specifically in this environment, which is very, very well received. The number two sort of point is that when you think about the FA, we've talked a lot about how to match various FAs within the workplace. The more and more referrals and the more and more data we have, who's able to monetize those referrals, the better and better it is. And so we're seeing that continue to pick up. And then from a workplace perspective, we also have integrated various relationship managers that we might have seen with the workplace into the actual FA teams. All of those things taken together is coming through from an NNA perspective, the advisor-based channel, but it's clearly a positivity if you sort of think of the rate of change where some of that might be coming from. So I think very proud of the results on the net new asset side. Dan Fannon : Okay. And then just to follow up on expenses. You broadly obviously talked about being focused on efficiency. But is there anything specific you can point to that you're doing differently or thinking about as you start budgeting for next year or even as we go into the fourth quarter that from a rate of change that you're focused on? Sharon Yeshaya : Well, I'd say that we've been focused on expenses, well, all year -- I mean, we're always focused on expenses, but very much in the spring of this year, we've been taking -- and I spoke about it in the last two earnings call, a very hard look at all of the expenses and just continuing to manage them on an individual project level, understanding where all the costs are coming from and also understanding where the growth is -- we're balancing that, of course, with the need to continue to invest, not only on the business side but also continuing to make sure that the infrastructure and controls are there as you think about expanding the business. So it's really around foundational side where some of those expenses might also be coming through as you think about technology, migration, et cetera. So it's just -- it's tactical in nature as well as this holistic approach of just making sure that you're very cognizant. But it's certainly part of something that we're thinking through as we look at the budgeting perspective. James Gorman : We also -- I mean, obviously, we're looking at headcount. I mean we're -- you've got to take into account the rate of growth we've had in the last few years, and we've learned some things through in COVID about how we can operate more efficiently. So that's something that the management team is working between now and the end of the year. And again, we want to provide growth opportunities across the platform, but we've also identified some efficiencies. So over time, that will become clearer. Operator : We'll go next to Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Devin Ryan : I want to start on fixed income trading. Obviously, revenues have been quite healthy in the volatile rate environment. Customers moving around their portfolios, as you guys noted, been a long time since we've seen these levels of rates. So I'm curious how you guys are thinking about what a higher for longer environment looks like for fixed income trading once rates settle in. I'm assuming more movement in yield on an absolute basis could be helpful, but would it be great to get your views from any historical context or just broader expectations. Sharon Yeshaya : Absolutely. It's interesting. I think when we looked at the beginning of this year, and we said, okay, how do you think about the fixed income environment? What stood out isn't just the absolute level of rates but it's also the dispersion of what's going on in different economies. So if you think -- if you go back a decade and you had all rates at zero for every economy and all of a sudden, you've moved to a place where you have divergent views, obviously also driving foreign exchange, for example. So I think all of that taken together is one that we keep looking at. It's clear that should that continue. That's a place where one would expect higher volatility and, therefore, by definition, likely higher client engagement. And so as we go forward, that's clearly something that we're looking at. But that's how I would reflect where the fixed income market is right now versus where it's been, say, 10 years ago. Devin Ryan : Yes. Okay. Just a quick follow-up here, also just on kind of corporate M&A opportunities. Obviously, evaluations across financials and fintech are down pretty dramatically over the last year. And so I'm curious whether you're seeing more maybe opportunities emerge, maybe things you were looking for, but just more sellers potentially coming to market given some of the challenging macro that we're seeing and also the big change in valuations over the last nine months to a year. James Gorman : I mean you're going to see a little bit of a washout in some of the fintech space. I mean this is reality. You've seen companies trading at valuations with which God we could only dream of over here in our modest little house. But they're just not reality. And that washes out, you'll see consolidation. A lot of these businesses are scale-driven businesses. We have enormous technology requirements to support cyber and stop client fraud, and data control and management and so on. So consolidation is the key word. At these prices, I think the sellers are only there if they need to sell. They're probably holding out for something a little more balanced. And maybe if my projection is right that sort of end of next year, so in the fintech space. Generally, consolidation across financial services has been the catchword for a decade, and we've moved aggressively to be at the front of that. And I think that's just reflecting reality, scale matters. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Mayo : First one, just a general question. Can you just give more details on your tech spending, how much you're spending, what that's growing, how much is to change the bank? I know I've asked you before about how much of your workload you look to move to the cloud, maybe how many apps you have? Just a little bit more meat on the bones. I appreciated the wealth expo that you held in June. I recognize the cost avoidance that you've achieved with the acquisition of E TRADE. Now that your backbone is complete, your tech backbone, but these are kind of high-level tech comments that you've made. So any public comments that you can give to put more meat on the bones would be appreciated. James Gorman : Why don't I take that, Mike? I think we don't publicly break out tech. And maybe we'll do more of that through next year. But I would say, just to give you some sense of sort of what the focus is, obviously, moving to the cloud was a big deal, and you saw the deals that we did in that. All of the innovation that's taking place in the financial advisor channel, the next best action, the virtual advisors, all of the technology, and I think you probably saw some of that. The work we've done around workplace. Solium is basically a tech company. E TRADE is a tech company. Building a workplace platform that doesn't revolve around a financial intermediary, but all of it goes straight from stock plans straight into vested E TRADE accounts. We're doing a bunch of work. We just did -- reviewed our electronic trading platform in Equities, some of they're doing equities, some fixed income. And some of the opportunities to leverage the derivatives trading within the E TRADE platform with our electronic trading within our Equities Group. So -- and a lot of stuff we're doing around cyber, data protection, data management. AI is a huge effort.  We have a group of people, our distinguished engineers, which we appoint each year, a group of very sophisticated technology software engineers and designers and we had new class just welcomed him actually last week, I think it was. So enormous amount of work going on.  I mean to your base question, tech spend is going up. I think it's fair to say along with some of our controls and compliance areas, it's the fastest-growing part of this Firm. But that's good because it's displacing things we would be doing manually, which we shouldn't be doing manually. So I'm perfectly happy to see our tech spend go up. A lot of it is around new innovation, but we're also running a plant which is driving $60 billion in revenue. And there's just basic tech infrastructure that we keep modernizing that is the backbone of that plant. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of a sense. Michael Mayo : All right. Maybe drive specifics in another area. You have $65 billion of inflows to wealth in a tough market noted. But I see the definition of inflows has changed over the last year to also include dividends, interest and asset acquisitions. That's from the note in the earnings supplement. So how much of the $65 billion inflows to wealth were related to dividends, interest and asset acquisitions? Sharon Yeshaya : I just would highlight, there are no asset acquisitions this quarter, and the dividends and interest was always included in that definition. James Gorman : Yes, that's -- I mean, to my knowledge, that's not a change that has happened at least in the last two decades, so. Operator : We'll go next to Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas. Jeremy Sigee : You talked about E TRADE and workplace and the multichannel business model, which I think is very powerful. I just wanted to ask because that all bedded down now? Is that fully operational humming along? Or are there any major integration steps or implementation steps still to be done? Sharon Yeshaya : So last time, integration, I talked about this actually in the call in January, there will be a back office conversion that we'll see in 2023. But that's the most major thing that we have left to be done. As well as over the course of the fourth quarter, we will expect something in terms of integration expense, specifically from an E TRADE perspective, it will look similar to the third quarter. Jeremy Sigee : And in terms of referral between the channels, that capability, that's fully happening already. That's in place. It's happening all the capability is there. Sharon Yeshaya : I'm sorry, I misunderstood the question that you were talking specifically about the integration expenses and how we were thinking about that is from a referral perspective, I would say there's still a lot more that will continue to be done. So we're just scratching the surface of that entire -- those relationships and bringing those funnels together. What I mentioned, for example, as you think about the referral programs, that's just beginning, right? So the better data that we have amongst who's the best FA to refer to the referral workplace relationship to -- that will just continue as you kind of better understand and aggregate data. Remember, we've invested a lot in the capabilities that you would consider AI in nature. It gives you a better sense of what does someone do with his or her next stock plan distribution, for example, do they buy a house, do they need a mortgage? Okay, what happens at this stage in someone's life cycle? So the more and more data that we aggregate across all of these channels, the more and more powerful the Wealth Management business becomes. So to James' point around the technology investment, that technology investment is core to be able to continue to grow the business with what we've called that we discussed this project genome before. James Gorman : I'd just repeat something that Andy Saperstein said at one of the recent conferences that our plan is to generate $1 trillion of new money, new client money every three years. So it's $330 billion. Obviously, in a very difficult environment like this, it's -- that run rate is more challenging, but we've had quarters where we've been much higher than where we are now. So it's about, call it, $75 billion, a little more $80 billion a quarter. And in this quarter, we did $65 billion. That is an unbelievable number. If you think about $1 trillion, we generate over 50 basis points -- 50 basis points per dollar of assets. So that is an unbelievable revenue machine. And there are many, many factors contributing to it. It is a completely different business model because of workplace because of the direct channels, because of what we've done with the bank and the way we've changed the whole financial advisory interaction with their clients through technology.  So very exciting this path that we're on, and it's heading towards what I've said, my long-term goal here is $10 trillion in clients' money at 50 basis points is a $50 billion business. And that's the target we're heading for, and that's where we're going to go. Operator : We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : James, you mentioned that obviously, it's no real surprise the market conditions, as you described, some of the issues we've confronted this year. And obviously, capital raising is going to come back at some point. Can you guys give us a little further color on your pipelines of what you're seeing possibly for the fourth quarter as we go into the first of next year in the Investment Banking and trading areas? Sharon Yeshaya : The pipelines are solid. The activity, I think what's interesting is continues to be across a diversified base of different companies. So it's not just about one sector in particular. But as James and I highlighted, I think it's really around that macroeconomic factors, and that's geopolitics, et cetera. But what it really ends up doing is creates uncertainty in the cost of capital and in valuation, which therefore also impacts price discovery. And so that's kind of the -- what's the clincher in terms of this realization of what remains a solid pipeline. Gerard Cassidy : Do you think your clients are more realistic about that price discovery today, Sharon, versus maybe six months ago? Sharon Yeshaya : I think that people are digesting the various prices and I do think that you're beginning to see that on, say, an issuance perspective, right? So if you think about the cost of capital, that also took people time to -- or rather companies time to digest and understand that we are in a different regime where treasuries are. And so it means that their cost of capital is also higher. And you might not have necessarily seen issuance right away because those corporate balance sheets were there. And now you might see an opportunistic or more prudent behavior from a treasurer or CFO. And so I think that as that mindset begins to shift, then yes, over time, the valuation mindset begins to shift as well. James Gorman : I mean just to -- I'm on the road a lot, and I see a lot of CEOs. I mean I think the CEOs of sort of established or on the path to established companies are getting very realistic. And they want to get on with business. I mean you can't sit on your hands forever. You've got to figure out always a better way to do business. And the environment, it's wonderful if you have zero interest rates, but that's unsustainable. So we've moved to a normalized and obviously, we're going to go a little higher than that to beat inflation back, but people are adjusting to that. I think the ones that are struggling still, companies that -- private companies that were valued at, let's just say, spotty levels and they're doing new rounds and they're finding they're just not paid at the same. And that's hard to accept as an entrepreneur, it's their baby and they want to believe that it's what it was at the peak. And maybe it was revalued at the peak. That's just what profiting markets do. And again, some of these public companies that have traded down from their offering price because we're in a different environment and money has got more expensive. So those groups will take longer to adjust. But this is sort of real politic around core businesses that have been around for a while, they adjust pretty quickly. I mean, we all get it. We've all been through different cycles. You get a little lucky in certain cycles where things are really cheap. And then you got to move a little harder and a little faster when things aren't. And we've done deals in both kinds of cycles. Operator *: There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone, for participating. You may now disconnect.",

During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release and strategic update. Within the strategic update, certain reported information has been adjusted as noted. These adjustments were made to provide a transparent and comparative view of our operating performance against our strategic objectives. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP adjusted operating performance metrics are included in the notes to the presentation or the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman. James Gorman : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. The macro backdrop of the last year presented challenges we haven't seen for some time. The combined impact of persistent inflation and rapid central bank tightening pressured asset levels and led to some \u2013 let to very little strategic activity and capital raising. Despite volatility throughout the year, Morgan Stanley demonstrated resilience and delivered on an ROTCE of 16%, including integration-related expenses from our deals. The firm did what it was supposed to do with our more stable Wealth and Investment Management businesses offsetting declines in Institutional Securities. This is hard evidence of the transformation we've made to become increasingly durable and a stark contrast to the 8% ROTCE we had in the last notable challenging environment of 2015. When markets rebound, we will capitalize on growth once again across the full firm and from an even stronger position. Before turning to Sharon to discuss the details of the fourth quarter and the full year, I'll walk you through now how we plan to achieve these goals in our annual strategic update appropriately titled delivering growth through the next decade. Briefly first, I'd like to acknowledge the many contributions Jon Pruzan made as CFO and COO. As you know, he's retiring from Morgan Stanley at the end of this month, and we wish him the absolute best. Please now turn to the deck into Slide 3. What informs our confidence and growth strategy is that we know who we are. We've been clear about that for over a decade. Our clarity of purpose has been a key driver of our success to date, and the next decade will be no different. On Slide 4, you can see we've been consistent since the financial crisis. We have a client-centric franchise with a common objective to facilitate capital flows between those who have it and those who need it. We're committed to our clients and to the markets we're in, clearly illustrated by the leading competitive positions we have. In each of our businesses, we have a significant competitive moat, which will enable us to maintain and further enhance our strength. Slide 5 highlights the strategic decisions we've made over the past decades that are focused on aligning markets -- ourselves to the markets where we perform best. And these are core businesses with scale in major markets that are on the whole more balance sheet-light and benefit from more durable fee-based revenues. We continue to invest in these areas to drive future growth. We have proven track record in our ability to acquire and integrate the businesses that are aligned with this strategy, namely within Wealth and Investment Management. Importantly, we've also taken action to get out of businesses that are not core to this flow of capital. While we may facilitate activities across varied markets, we do not own businesses that are built around unsecured consumer credit payments, physical handling of commodities and the like. Instead, we focus on markets we best, and our ability is there to support our clients in those markets. Please turn to Slide 6. This illustrates the ongoing growth and shift of our business mix. As we continue to grow our client assets, we expect Wealth and Investment Management will become an increasingly larger portion of the firm's pretax profit. The stability of the firm will be further enhanced by this growth, all the while coupled with a preeminent institutional franchise. Fair to say our business model was tested this year, as you can see on Slide 7. 2022 was a paradigm shift. But first the common acts continuation of the first pandemic in 100 years, the first war in Europe, in over 70 years and the highest inflation in 40 years. Despite lower asset values and an anemic underwriting calendar, the firm performed well. We generated, as I said before, a 16% ROTCE; had the most excess risk-based capital of our peers and attracted over $300 billion of net new assets, all while integrating two major acquisitions. So, now moving to the opportunities to maximize growth in the next decade, let's start with Wealth Management. On Slide 8, you can see we have leadership positions across channels, reflecting our combination of best-in-class advice and best-in-class technology. And we have the ability to meet any client wherever they are in their wealth accumulation journey. This allows us to grow with our clients along the way and provides the opportunity for clients to migrate across channels. The growth of our business is reflected in our higher average daily revenues, something I've been tracking for well over a decade. 2022, every trading day saw revenues in excess of $80 million, and over 1/3 of those exceeded $100 million a day. Contrast that with only three years ago, where 95% of trading revenues were each below $80 million, and none exceeded $100 million. The history of the journey as illustrated on Slide 7, Wealth Management has gone through a powerful transformation, as you all know, including with the most significant recent acquisitions in E TRADE and Solium, which have expanded our client base with two new channels. Today, we have 18 million relationships. We focus on deepening those relationships by offering the right product at the right time and consolidating assets under our platform. From here, we're building on the scale and the tools to reach -- and the reach that will propel future growth. Net interest income has certainly been part of the profitability expansion to date, and you can see the driving forces highlighted on Slide 10. We have invested in expanding our bank offerings, allowing us to offer attractive products to our clients on both sides of their balance sheet to meet their needs. We've nearly doubled our lending balances over the last three years, and we expect to continue to grow attractive high-quality loans. On the other side, our deposit franchise has grown significantly since 2019 and will continue to support future NII through various cycles. Approximately 90% of our deposits are sourced from our Wealth Management client base. And in the current rising rate environment, our cost of deposits is more efficient than that we experienced in the last rate hiking cycle. Sharon will discuss this important topic and our outlook around NII further in a few minutes. Let's turn to Slide 11. This now talks about NNA growth, net new assets. Over the last three years, our platform generated nearly $1 trillion of net new assets showing a clear step change from prior periods and marking Morgan Stanley as a leader across our peer group as an asset accumulator. Given the scale and reach of our businesses, we expect to deliver this pace of asset accumulation going forward. Obviously, there will be up and downs in individual years. But over a three-year period, we expect to drive approximately $1 trillion in net new assets. Most importantly, as you can see on the right-hand side of this page, no single source is accounting for greater than 25% of this net new money. Some people think it's just a result of recruiting. It is absolutely not. It's a combination of several things, which the team has described as filling the funnel of net new money. You can see on Slide 12, which shows our growth in client assets, we have experienced that through our workplace channel. We estimate now that relationships wealth held away has expanded by about 4x in the last three years. With our ability to serve clients across the entire wealth spectrum, we're well positioned to consolidate a portion of these assets. Further, the workplace channel continues to bring new relationships to the platform. We've executed on key steps to deepen those. We've already reached our goal to roll out companion accounts to 90% of workplace participants and to achieve 30% retention of stock plan assets. We look forward to even higher retention. The results of our advice-driven strategy are illustrated on Slide 13. The workplace channel has driven the majority of our growth in client relationships and stands at 12 million relationships to date. While it can take several years to deepen those, we've already seen success in some parts of the offering that of our stock plan administrative services. Over the last three years, we've had approximately $350 billion of after-tax vested inflows. Vesting assets gives us more opportunity to deliver an integrated client experience, and that's allowed us to showcase the power of advice. To date, we've already seen adviser-led flows of approximately $150 billion that originated from a workplace relationship. A portion of those assets are the stock plan vested balances, but a larger portion are from assets that were previously held away. In short, we will -- as we deliver our full suite of capabilities, our strategy to attract clients to advice is working. Investment Management has also delivered strong fee-based growth over the course of its own transformation, as you can see on Slide 14, which encapsulates the business together with Eaton Vance. This business has more than doubled its durable asset management and related fees since 2014. And importantly, this significantly larger revenue base is more diversified. Increased diversification from fixed income, customization and alternatives continues to support results in more volatile equity markets. We remain very aligned to key growth areas. Our alternative investment capital is at $210 billion with strong growth in private credit, real assets, including infrastructure, our multi-strategy hedge fund platform and special situations. And customization by our market-leading parametric business continues to be a significant growth engine. Shifting to Institutional Securities on Slide 15, we have a global and balanced franchise. And our integrated investment bank has and continues to focus on meeting clients where they are active. This has served us well as our strength is evident across various market environments. We remain a leader in equity and Investment Banking and have steadily rebuilt our fixed income franchise focused on our strongest capabilities. On Slide 16, you can see our institutional business remains a top three global leader in the industry, as demonstrated by a wallet share position. We have demonstrated our ability to defend share and gain it in relatively more capital-light businesses. At the same time, we've shown prudence over resources as illustrated clearly by the disciplined RWA usage, which actually dropped from '21 to '22 and our consistent G-SIB surcharge of 3%. Let's move to our capital strategy on Slide 17. We have 200 basis points of excess capital above our regulatory requirement. This is intentional. Our capital strategy has focused on bringing the risk down in our businesses, and we've seen a steady decline in our SCB excluding the dividend add-on reflective of our more durable business mix. Our capital position gives us enormous flexibility, and we're comfortable with our decision to be prudently positioned. On Slide 18, you can see our excess capital position enables us to continue to invest in our business for future growth and deliver robust returns to shareholders. Our business transformation, especially the durable earnings from Wealth and Investment Management, enable us to double that dividend -- enabled us to double our dividend in 2021 and further increase it by 11% in 2022. Over the same time, we've reduced our shares outstanding from the much higher levels driven by the impact of our recent acquisitions. Taken together, we delivered a 9% capital return to our shareholders last year. We remain committed to ongoing shareholder return, adjusting always for whatever the business performance is and the regulatory requirements demand. Shifting to how we see the future state on Slide 19. Starting with the expected path to $10 trillion in client assets across Wealth and Investment Management, we've demonstrated our ability to generate over the last three years positive net new assets of approximately $300 million (ph) a year. Combining that with reasonable average market assumptions give us the confidence this will lead to $10 trillion in client assets in reasonable years ahead. Now let's consider this within the broader firm picture, and bear with me for a minute. In 2022, the firm delivered $14 billion of pretax profit. In this future scenario of $10 trillion of assets, which I believe will happen, generating approximately 50 basis points of revenue which is about what we're doing currently at a 30% pretax margin, which is within 2% of what we're doing currently. If you put that math together, it should create of itself over $14 billion of pretax income. As you can see, that exceeds that of the full firm today just from the wealth and asset management businesses. So if you pull it all together, just to wrap it up, Slide 20 reiterates our confidence in our performance goals. They have not changed on account of what's going on in the markets in the last 12 months. These are the metrics we need to support our longer-term objectives. Of note, we've added a new goal that I spoke to earlier that we've talked about in the last six months to generate $1 trillion in net new assets approximately every three years. Again, I'm sure there will be volatility quarter by quarter, year by year. But as we've demonstrated through the funnel of sources, we expect an outcome over three years of approximately $1 trillion. That's about by the way up to 5% to 7% of beginning period assets within wealth and asset management. As we approach 2023, we do so with quiet confidence, recognizing we have a line of sight with the durability of our Wealth and Investment Management businesses and our market share leading positions across much of Institutional Securities. As always, our objectives are subject to major moves in the economic, political or regulatory environment. However, with a constructive outlook and a proven track record we've delivered thus far, we fully expect to achieve our goals over time. I will now turn the call over to Sharon, who will discuss the fourth quarter and annual results and we'd be delighted to take your questions. Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you, and good morning. In a complex year, the firm delivered solid results. Full year revenues were $53.7 billion, and PBT was $14.1 billion. The fourth quarter contributed to $12.7 billion in revenues and PBT of $2.8 billion. The strategic investments we have made over the last decade have paid off. Wealth Management had a record year and Fixed Income had its strongest performance in over a decade. While the firm was broadly impacted by increased volatility and economic uncertainty, the business model performed very well in a challenging environment as it was designed to do. The full year results included $470 million of integration-related expenses of which $120 million were incurred in the fourth quarter. Excluding these impacts, EPS was $6.36 and $1.31 for the full year and for the quarter respectively. The full year ROTCE was 15.3% and 15.7% excluding the costs associated with integration. In the quarter, severance expenses of $133 million related to a December employee action and a net discrete tax benefit -- or net discrete tax benefits of $89 million largely offset each other through net income. The full year efficiency ratio was 73.2%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our full year efficiency ratio was 72.4%. Total expenses were approximately flat to the prior year. Lower compensation expenses principally related to movements in DCP and on lower revenues were offset by higher non-compensation expenses primarily driven by investments in technology as well as increased marketing and business development spend. As a reminder, this year also included a $200 million charge related to a legal matter regarding the firm's record-keeping requirement in the second quarter. As the environment evolved over the course of 2022, we actively managed our expense base. Cognizant of the ongoing macro uncertainty, we continue to review efficiency opportunities. We are in the final stages of completing our integration of both E TRADE and Eaton Vance. And this will be the last quarter we present measures that exclude integration-related expenses from reported results. However, particularly as it relates to the integration of E TRADE, the final back-office integration remains scheduled to conclude in 2023. We expect to incur approximately $325 million of additional integration-related expenses this year. These expenses will largely be spread evenly across quarters with approximately 2/3 related to E TRADE and 1/3 related to Eaton Vance. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities full year revenues of $24.4 billion declined 18% from the record prior year. In the fourth quarter, revenues were $4.8 billion. Overall, quarterly client engagement across fixed income and equities tapered from the higher levels seen in the first nine months of the year, reflective of seasonality and the macroeconomic environment. Weaker Investment Banking results persisted, reflecting the challenging banking backdrop. Investment Banking revenues were $5.2 billion for the full year, down 49% from the record prior year. Advisory delivered its second best result, supported in part by the completion of previously announced strategic transactions. Underwriting was more challenged, in line with the broader market. Full year global equity volumes dropped to levels unseen in the last 20 years. Debt volumes contracted following the first quarter. And while the market was receptive to higher quality issuance, activity was limited to constructive market periods. Fourth quarter revenues of $1.3 billion decreased 49% from the prior year. Lower completed M&A and underwriting market volumes weighed on results. As we have highlighted in prior quarters, client dialogue and engagement remains high as clients seek advice to navigate the difficult environment. Greater economic clarity should lead to increased confidence to undertake strategic transactions. And looking ahead, we expect issuers to take advantage of these windows of opportunity. Equity full year trading -- excuse me, equity full year revenues were $10.8 billion, representing another strong year of over $10 billion and making us a global leader in this business. Revenues declined 6% from the record prior year primarily driven by lower market activities. Revenues were $2.2 billion in the quarter, reflecting lower asset levels and volumes. Prime brokerage revenues were lower than the prior year as average client balances declined from record levels driven by lower equity markets and deleveraging. Cash results declined on lower client activity across regions. Derivative results increased slightly as the business navigated the market volatility well. Last year's fourth quarter also benefited from a mark-to-market gain on an investment versus a markdown this quarter. Fixed income revenues of $9 billion for the full year were the highest in over a decade. The divergence between the Fed's guidance on financial tightening and conditions and the market expectations engaged clients and drove revenues in macro while volatile energy markets benefited commodities. Quarterly revenues were $1.4 billion. Macro performance benefited from higher client engagement as inflation expectations moderated, and clients repositioned in rates and foreign exchange. Strength in micro was supported by active secondary markets as expectations for inflation tempered and credit spreads tightened, driving an increase in client activity. Results in commodities were down significantly and primarily reflected lower revenues in the power and gas businesses. Other revenues included $356 million of mark-to-market losses on corporate loans held for sale and loan hedges. These losses were substantially offset by net interest income and fees of $287 million. Turning to Wealth Management. For the full year, Wealth Management produced record revenues of $24.4 billion and a record pretax profit of $6.6 billion, resulting in a PBT margin of 27%. Excluding integration-related expenses of $357 million, the PBT margin was 28.4%. Full year results reflect mark-to-market impacts of our deferred cash-based compensation plans referred to as DCP. This negatively impacts our full year revenues by $858 million with a corresponding decrease of $530 million in compensation expenses. As we have explained historically, there is typically a timing difference between the mark-to-market gains and losses on the economic hedges and the deferred recognition of the compensation expense over the vesting period. The revenue and the expense impact of DCP is now included in our financial supplement. Fourth quarter revenues were a record of $6.6 billion and the PBT margin was 27.8%. Including integration-related expenses of $94 million, the PBT margin was 29.2%. Total client assets were $4.2 trillion. Fee-based flows were $20 billion in the quarter, and asset management revenues were $3.3 billion. Net new assets of $311 billion in the year represent a 6.2% annual growth rate of beginning period assets. Fourth quarter net new assets were $52 billion with contributions across channels. Transactional revenues in the fourth quarter were $931 million. Including the impact of DCP, transactional revenues declined 15% from the prior year. The decline was driven by lower levels of overall retail engagement and fewer new issuance opportunities, partially offset by increased transactions related to fixed income products. Bank lending balances grew by 17% in the year or 13% -- or $17 billion in the year or 13% and stand at $146 billion. The pace of lending growth slowed for the second consecutive quarter and was largely unchanged sequentially. While mortgages and tailored loans continue to grow slowly, this was offset by pay downs in securities-based lending due to the higher interest rate environment. Total deposits rose 6% sequentially to $351 billion driven by continued demand for our savings offering among our Wealth Management clients. We have seen success with our strategy to provide advisers with expanded tools needed to offer their clients choice in varied market environment. Further, the pace of sweep outflows also moderated in the quarter. As a result, we have a favorable deposit mix, largely sourced from our Wealth Management client base with attractive pricing and options to meet our clients' needs. Net interest income was $2.1 billion in the quarter. The 52% increase from the prior year was driven by the benefits of the increased rate environment, an efficient deposit mix and strong lending growth over the last 12 months. Looking ahead, we do not believe that NII has peaked. We enter the year with an attractive deposit base with higher intrinsic value. While we expect the growth of NII to moderate from the pace of the last two quarters, we anticipate continued expansion in the first quarter of approximately 5% sequentially, assuming the forward curve is realized. Investment Management reported full year revenues of $5.4 billion, declining 14% from the prior year. The challenging market backdrop led to lower accrued carried interest in several of our private funds. Also -- and also impacted our AUM, which declined to $1.3 trillion. Fourth quarter revenues were $1.5 billion. Long-term net outflows of $6 billion in the quarter were driven by equities and fixed income, reflecting the challenging public market backdrop, partially offset by demand for alternatives and solutions, particularly parametric customized portfolios as well as our special situation strategies and private credit. Fourth quarter asset management and related fees were $1.4 billion, declining on the back of lower average AUM, partially offset by higher liquidity revenues. As a reminder, performance fees are recognized on an annual basis, largely in the fourth quarter, which drove the increase versus the third quarter. Quarterly performance-based income and other revenues were $90 million. We saw broad-based gains in our private alternatives portfolio, though lower than the prior year. The diversification we gain from having fixed income, parametric customization and alternatives positions us well to perform through the cycle. We continue to invest in this business and leverage our premier global distribution capabilities to support future growth to meet continued global client demand. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Standardized RWAs declined by $9 billion sequentially to $449 billion, reflective of our prudent management of resources. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.3%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter. Solid earnings, lower RWAs and gains in OCIs partially offset by capital actions contributed to our strong CET1 ratio. We continue to execute our buyback program, and we repurchased approximately $1.7 billion of common stock in the quarter. The full year tax rate was 20.7% driven by the resolution of certain historic tax matters and the realization of certain tax benefits. We expect our 2023 tax rate to be approximately 23%, which will exhibit some quarterly volatility. The firm's results demonstrate the ability of our business model to perform in an evolving environment. While there are, of course, uncertainties as we look ahead into 2023, we remain the growth opportunities in the year ahead. Our combined $5.5 trillion of assets across Wealth and Investment Management provides us balance. Importantly, our scale positions us well to capture the asset opportunity when the markets recover. Finally, while still very early in the year, we are encouraged by the levels of client engagement we've seen so far. With that, we will now open the line to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate all the slides, too. Okay. Two big picture questions, I guess. One, James, with the 200 basis points of excess CET1 requirements, the big buffer served you well. You've got a lot of buybacks, but also it's dilutive to returns. And I'm just curious how you balance that of keeping that buffer or is that buffer more temporary weighting on Basel III end game final results? Or is that something you want -- you plan on sitting in? I'm just curious on your big picture resting spot for that excess capital. James Gorman : Sure. Glenn, it's a great question, and it's sort of pivotal to the whole strategic positioning of the firm because right now, I think capital strategy is critical. There are a few things going on. Firstly, we have been able to reduce our peak to trough in CCAR because of the change in mix in our business. Secondly, because of the market environment we've reduced RWAs, just we've taken maybe a more prudent lean in. And obviously, we can reverse that at any point in time, which heats up CET1. Thirdly, we have the Basel III finally looks like it's coming to fruition at some point in the first half of the year, although I don't expect that banks will be required to implement whatever the new capital rules are until the beginning of 2025. So while there's a pretty long time frame, a year is a long time in this business, let alone 1.5 years, I still think that it's prudent to kind of have some capital sitting there and just -- I'd rather be in a position where we have excess capital when particularly in an environment where we don't see obvious places we've put it to work. Now that said, we did our best. We bought back I think it was $8 billion and $10 billion last year. We doubled the dividend the year before. We increased the dividend 11% last year. Obviously, we're -- I mean, it's fair to assume that we're going to continue moving on capital distributions. But I like a number of 15%. We actually -- we triggered a little higher than that this quarter. We could easily drop down to 14.5%. That wouldn't bother me at all, but that will be driven by the environment and business opportunities. So, great position to be in coming into a change in the regulatory outlook potentially, and we can always act aggressively, and we've proven we will do that when we have more clarity. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. One other big picture is so Wealth Management is growing great. Everybody is happy. I think historically and even now, you've been considered very equity-centric from whether it be wealth and asset management or your dominant equities platform. So curious if you're thinking about it's possible with these higher rates, lots of clients shift to a more defensive stance. There's good income out there to be earned without much risk or too much risk. If we see a more material shift towards fixed income appetite in general, do you think that in any way disadvantages Morgan Stanley as a firm in overall profitability? James Gorman : I mean, listen, our share of fixed income is 10%; banking, 15; equities, 20. So obviously, the fixed income pool grows. By the way, our share a few years ago, it was 6%. So the team under its Ted and Sam Kellie-Smith has done a phenomenal job. But if the pool grows faster in fixed income, just arithmetically, you're not going to do as well as if the pool grew faster in equities. That doesn't bother me a whole lot. I mean, we've never tried to be the FX EM shop. We've never had the global rates trading, FX trading macro businesses that some of the correspondent-driven commercial banks have had, the HSBCs and Citis. And that's a business model just different. We don't have as big transaction services, so we're not going to have as much FX. That said, what the team have done in macro under Jakob, under credit and Jay Hallik in commodities is really impressive. So I'm totally fine with that. And we clearly have the product. It's not like we don't sell muni bonds to our clients, and we don't have fixed income underwriting, et cetera. We have the product. It's just arithmetically, given our share relative to the others, we wouldn't grow as fast. By the way, I was happy to see I think equities was back at number one this quarter, core franchise. And we're really well positioned, Glenn. I'm not bothered by that at all. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess maybe first question, just Sharon, following up on the efficiency ratio about 72% for 2022. As we think about the journey from 72% to something sub-70% kind of in line with your strategic target, a sense of what it means. Is it this time? And are the businesses growing, which are more efficient and that changes the mix? Or could we see that up 70% even over the next couple of years? Would love to hear it in terms of both from a timing standpoint and what needs to happen at the firm to get to a sustainably below 70% efficiency ratio. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. So if you think about, we were -- we've been below 70%, right? So if you look back to the last couple of years, and there are periods of time where we are below, there's obviously two pieces to it, both the expense side and the revenue side. I think that as we continue to gain scale across the businesses, each of those dollars that we put to work will be more and more efficient. As I highlighted, where we've been investing a lot of those dollars is on the technology side. I noted that in my prepared remarks, and we have seen that both from the cyber resiliency side and also just as we think about the broader integrations of all of the platforms that we've acquired over the last couple of years. So as I think through it and I think about the timing, obviously, a different revenue environment will certainly help. And there's tremendous operating leverage, particularly as you think about the Institutional Securities business, which will help to drive that. Now if you go through each of the businesses, each of those businesses also exhibit operating leverage, right? If you have a constructive market environment, we've seen very strong margins also from the Investment Management business. We're on our way to achieve the 30% margin target as you relate to the Wealth Management business. So I'd say it's a balance of both, both the revenue environment and how that turns around and then just continued discipline and making sure that we have the right investments as we think about our expense base going forward. So we've been extremely prudent and disciplined as we think about the base over the last especially nine months that we've seen with this type of environment. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And I guess just a separate question around market activity obviously highly uncertain how Investment Banking activity shakes out. But if the Fed were to pause and the central banks are done with the majority of the rate hikes, is that enough to drive a rebound in M&A, ECM, DCM? Or do we need a lot more in terms of just confidence returning to the market before we see IB activity picking up? Like what are you hearing for the clients? Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. Why don't I start and if James has anything to add? I basically say that from -- if we think about the Investment Banking pipeline, the pipeline itself isn't what's changed. What's changed is that movement from the pipeline to realized. And when we think about what will cause that, that policy pivot, a peak in inflation, something that allows the CEOs that are actually having those conversations in boardrooms to have more confidence both with their own economic outlook and -- or excuse me, our own company outlook, the economic outlook that hinges on and then also just price clarity valuation certainty. Those are the things that as you think through it, we would expect to see move from the pipeline stage into the realized and announced stage. So the macro environment that you laid out where there is more clarity on the economy and then also a reduction in volatility should help that move forward. James Gorman : Yes, I would say I think Sharon said it, right. And I am highly confident that when the Fed pauses, deal activity and underwriting activity will go up. I would bet the year on that, in fact. CEO's job is to drive growth in their businesses, and they do that two ways, organic and inorganic. And I've been doing this a long time, and I've done both. And the only tricky part about inorganic once you've got your strategy set is timing. And sometimes, you've got to ignore timing, but if the market is really volatile, it behooves CEOs, particularly those relatively early in their careers to be a little cautious, and that's what we're seeing. That will change. Operator : We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : And just like to wish Jon Pruzan best of luck, looking forward to watching his next chapter play out. So Sharon, would love to double click on your expectations for NII. I hear you that it's sort of based on the forward curve playing out, and encouraging certainly to hear it's not peaked. But could you maybe give a little bit more color around expectations beyond forward curve? What do you assume for deposit dynamics? Do you think that the decline in sweep balances will continue to decline? What's underlying that? Thanks. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. So, let's take a step back and just say, why did we outperform in the fourth quarter, Brennan? And if you think about that, we obviously -- when we look at the liability side, we outperformed there, and we performed on the asset side. So if we unpack a little bit of the liability side, I take it into two pieces. As you highlighted, it's obviously about the deposit mix and also about pricing. So what we've seen in the deposit mix is that we have seen a moderation in the pace of outflows of those BDPs. Obviously, what -- where we will go from here, we'll need that to play out. But that is something that we take out into account when we think about the first quarter guidance. The second point is, obviously, on the actual liability pricing, we did see an outperformance of that pricing. And when we exit the first quarter, we take that in -- exit, excuse me, the fourth quarter and take that into the first quarter, that's a benefit as well. So, the Fed hiking 125 basis points over the fourth quarter and then being able to have disciplined pricing over the fourth quarter will serve us well in the first. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that. And then certainly different question. Wealth Management, if we look at the client asset trends, they were barely up quarter-over-quarter. Basically, total client assets in wealth were up about the equivalent of the net new assets and can clearly see that self-directed and workplace were a little weak, probably because their exposure -- more exposure to the Qs and the more growthy stocks. Was -- but I would think, given what we saw in the markets that there'd be a bit more of a tailwind to client assets. Was there anything unusual that was happening there? Sharon Yeshaya : No. Actually and what you highlighted is broadly correct in terms of where you see the broader exposure, the underlying exposure of those different channels. So, it's just a function of the assets that you actually see as well as the mix of the underlying assets based on the channel. Operator : We'll go next to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So wanted to dig in a little bit further, Sharon, as it relates to Brennan's question on NII. The two pieces I want to understand a little bit better is, one, what are you assuming for SBL growth in the coming year or even loan growth broadly across the wealth complex? And secondly, you saw really nice deposit growth in the fourth quarter. I wanted to understand how much of that is a function of tax loss harvesting that you expect to be redeployed? Or do you think any of that deposit growth is actually going to prove to be a bit stickier? Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. I'm just going to take them -- I'll take them in order. The first is, as you asked about loan growth. The NII guidance in the first quarter is not dependent on the loan growth projections. Obviously, the loan growth itself will be a function of the environment. As I said, from an SBL perspective, we have seen some pay downs and it will be dependent on market conditions. Now, the second quarter -- the second question that you asked me around the deposits and the deposit growth, obviously, there are -- there could be a portion of it that does come from, as you mentioned, different inputs that you might see, be that interest, et cetera, in the end of the fourth quarter. But broadly speaking, what we've seen with the deposit base is that we have many channels, i.e. savings, for example, where we can begin to get those deposits and attract new deposits to the institution and to the bank from other sources, external assets held away that come in. And also, as you think about every piece of NNA that comes in over time, the $1 trillion that James mentioned, there's generally a portion of that, that's actually held from a cash perspective. And so that, I think, also needs to be taken account when thinking about the build as you go forward from the deposit, a longer-term deposit perspective. Steven Chubak : That's great. And just for my follow-up, as it relates to the trading outlook, I thought you guys did a really nice job of articulating some of the potential sources or drivers of inflection in Investment Banking activity. Admittedly, we've experienced a couple of years of pretty gangbusters trading and market activity. I was hoping to get your perspective on how you're thinking about the outlook for the trading businesses. If you're willing to go so far as to suggest what normalization might look like across both FICC and equities would be really helpful. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. I would look at it more holistically from an institutional perspective. And so when I think about what does it mean? We entered -- I remember doing an investor conference in February of last year. And we talked a lot about what is normal and is 2019 normal. And our answer then was we would expect to actually normalize somewhere between 2019 and 2020 from an industry wallet perspective. In fact, it looks as though the industry wallet has just been right around that range within those two bonds. And when we look ahead, we would expect to remain above that 2019 level, and we'll have to see what the upside is. But a lot of that growth in Sales & Trading has come from the divergent central bank policies and has also come from the fact that you have higher yields, right? So when you think about investing in the fixed income product, and you go into that going forward, that could create different dynamics than we would have seen over the earlier 2010 through 2019 or '17 outlook for Sales & Trading. Operator : We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : I wanted to follow up on the wealth business and the rollout of the companion accounts and the 90% that you've headed. Can you talk about the behavior change or what has happened subsequent to clients receiving those companion accounts and try to get a sense of what that could mean on a longer-term basis in terms of increased activity and asset flows? Sharon Yeshaya : Absolutely, as James highlighted in his prepared remarks, the intention is to generally be in a position where we're able to offer the right type of advice and content and wealth advice over the course in time when we go into the workplace. And so when we think about the retention of assets or we think about the companion account rollout, eventually, what that's really doing is to make sure that we've provided content. We look at content, as I've said before, as a passport into the employees. And you think about that as financial wellness. Something that Jed highlighted in his presentation in the spring is, generally speaking, when you see $1 of vested assets that come into the institution through the stock plan business, we actually see approximately $9 compared to that $1 that come from assets held away. That's the consolidation of assets once you have this advice-based channel and the advice-based relationship. And so, what we're trying to do is build on that. We have an FA referral process. We continue to use technology to help match the right individuals with the right FAs. We have better relationship management within E TRADE and making sure that larger accounts are also connected appropriately to the right teams. These are all ways to build the right advice for the right clients to provide them choice and give them a reason to bring assets held away into the institution. Dan Fannon : Got it. Okay. And then just as a follow-up, you talked about the longer-term efficiency potential. But I guess the thing about fourth quarter, there was some severance looking at non-comp expense as you think about next year. I just want to understand how we should think about the base level of expenses and potential changes and/or where you're looking to be more efficient into this year? Sharon Yeshaya : I mean, we're always, as I said in my prepared remarks, looking at efficiency opportunities where there might exist. We just, as you highlight through the severance, we just had a December employee action. So, we obviously walk in with a different level of comfort as we kind of think about the expense base going forward. But as we've done with our own resources from a capital perspective, we'll remain nimble and prudent, and look forward if and as the economic environment changes. James Gorman : I think just on the efficiency ratio, it's worth pointing out and Sharon mentioned this earlier, if you actually average the last two years, '21, '22, you end up right at 70%. '21 was about 67, '22 at 73. Part of it is revenue driven. We took the efficiency that will take some expenses out in the coming year. We also want to feed the beast. I mean, we're growing parts of this firm. We're trying to -- we don't -- we're not of the view that we're heading into a dark period, whatever negativity in the world is out there. That's not our house views. So we want to make sure we're positioned for growth. This thing will turn. M&A underwriting will come back. I'm positive of it. So, we want to be well positioned for it, but we're going to manage to that number of around 70% as best as we can. Operator : We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : I have a bigger picture. James, you gave us some very good detail about the expectations for growth in the Wealth Management and the new assets, $1 trillion every three years. When you're looking at your three channels, the adviser-led workplace and self-directed, where do you see the most growth? And which one has the best margin that can get you to that 30% goal? James Gorman : Well, the adviser is the biggest, obviously, by far. We have 15,000, 16,000 advisers, phenomenal business. The direct channel is from the acquisition of E TRADE combined with our Morgan Stanley Direct, great business. Obviously, it's a little more market sensitive, a little more active, particularly on the option side during bullish market environments. And the workplace is sort of the sleeper. I've said previously, I think, two years ago, I thought in a decade, we'd look back at this firm and say that the workplace was the most significant strategic change to happen over the last decade. I truly believe that the workplace employee, the retirement space is sort of the next frontier, and we're right in the middle of that. So as to margins, they're probably margin accretive in reverse order. In other words, workplace first, the direct second and the adviser third, that's simply a function of advisers. We have adviser payout, and God bless them for the jobs that they do, and we're very happy to pay them. So I think it's a combination, Gerard, of all three of them. We will hit the 30% margin. I mean, we're almost there now in a more challenging environment. So that zero anxiety about whether it's this year or next year, it's coming, and all of them will contribute. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. I appreciate that. And Sharon, you talked about the marks that you took in the corporate loan portfolio in the quarter, just over $350 million, I think you said. Can you share with us how big is that portfolio? And where did the marks come from? Were they bridge loans? Or what drove those marks? Sharon Yeshaya : So you have different disclosures as it relates to various loans and lending that we give. As we think about that line, it's inclusive of losses across the loan portfolio. And it was also worth highlighting there that we also mentioned the interest that you receive on the loans that we hold as well as the fees associated with those loans. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : James, last quarter, I asked you when will you be ready for plan B if the pipeline doesn't seem like it's going to be converted, and you said you're at plan A minus, so just kind of looking for an update there. And in terms of the headwinds, if I hear you correctly, it sounds like the pipeline is still good but down quarter-over-quarter because some of those deals have converted. And also, you said it's still not back yet. And as it relates to the Twitter financing, you were the lead bank. Can you disclose any write-down that you had on Twitter or simply the leveraged loan category? So that's the headwind. On the other hand, I guess, there's been some reports that you've reduced headcount. So if you could just give us more color on that, especially Twitter? James Gorman : Okay. Let me try and unpack that a little bit. I'm not going to talk about Twitter. We don't talk about single names as you would expect. You did see the line -- the other ISG line. You can assume that whatever marks we took on any single name are reflected in that. And I think the way I think about this is we run a portfolio business. We obviously have single credits at any point in time that disappoint relative to others. But it's the total package, and the total package, if you look at it actually turned out to be very fine given the environment we're in. So on the plan B, I don't know if the rip we did -- we took about 1,800 heads in early December, would equate to a plan B. It certainly felt like it. We've reduced -- we took a severance charge, Mike, which affected some of the efficiency ratio for this year, but we'll improve it for next year. And that was the rightsizing. We were frankly a little overdue. We hadn't done anything for a couple of years. We've had a lot of growth, and we'll continue monitoring that. Obviously, with the way bonus pools work, we reflected the performance of the firm in the bonus pool. So we're not very different from the rest of the world in that regard. And that obviously resets comp a little bit. So, I feel good about where the whole package is. I'm actually, as I said earlier alluded to I'm a little more confident about the long -- medium-term outlook for the market. I'm not talking about the first quarter or two, although Sharon said the first quarter has actually started well. But the medium-term outlook for the markets, I see the Fed has moved from 75 to 50, likely to go to 25. The next stop on the train line is zero and then to mention they start cutting. Not sure they're going to cut this year, but I think there'll be zero increases this year for sure. So that's the inflection point. And there's a lot of money sitting around waiting to be put to work. And that's our job is to be the flow of capital between those who have it, and those who need it. So I'm pretty confident actually about the outlook. So we're -- we've done our plan B, I guess. We're not anticipating a plan C. And we're going to watch and wait for a little while, but I feel pretty good about it. Operator : We'll take our last question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about the flows within Investment Management, both the long-term and liquidity and how you're thinking about the outlook there specifically in the long term? Sharon Yeshaya : Sure, absolutely. The long term, obviously, what we saw over the course of this year was some movements in equities. That was the most notable. That obviously had to do with some of the higher growth specific -- the specific funds that we have there. But I think you have to really think about those long terms from a long-term basis, right? So you're just focusing on this year, but there were many, many years of very strong flows into that business. What's important is actually the diversification that we had because of Eaton Vance, where we have other products that we're able to offset some of the long -- some of the outflows in, say, the equity product, for example. So parametric is one where we continue to see inflows throughout even the course of this year. We're really focused on the secular growth trends, sustainability, alternatives and customization more broadly. Those are the things that we think as we move forward, we'll be positive for those line items. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone, for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. This call is being recorded. During today\u2019s presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman. James Gorman : Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. The first quarter of 2023 was very eventful for our industry, but not so eventful for Morgan Stanley. Firm delivered strong results with revenues of over $14.5 billion, net income of $3 billion, ROTCE of 17% and net new asset flows of $110 billion. At the same time, we bought back $1.5 billion of stock while maintaining a CET ratio of 15.1%. In many ways, it was an excellent test to Morgan Stanley and the opportunity to show the strength and stability of our business model. Let me just touch briefly on the turmoil and the banking sector. In my view, we are not in a banking crisis, but we have had and may still have a crisis among some banks. I believe strong regulatory intervention on both sides of the Atlantic led to the cauterization of the damage. I consider the current issues is not remotely comparable to 2008. I was pleased that Morgan Stanley, along with the other large U.S. banks, became part of the solution by providing an uninsured deposit line of $30 billion to First Republic Bank. Someone who lived through the darkest days of 2008 where Morgan Stanley was seen as part of the problem, it\u2019s indeed rewarding to be here 14 years later as part of the solution. Turning back to our own company, while the performance of the overall business was strong, the results reflected the impact of the environment. In Wealth Management, positive flows of $110 billion were a very strong result, reflect continued growth in the model together with the flight to quality. This obviously gives us a good start to our 1 trillion every 3 years target. Investment management also benefited from diversification as long-term outflows moderated and we saw strength in Parametric and also in the liquidity product. Overall margin in the Wealth Management business was 26%, impacted by modest increases in credit reserves, slightly lower growth of NII versus forecast and ongoing integration expenses. We continue to focus on the levers within our control with an eye towards expense management. In ISG, underwriting and M&A remain very subdued. As I have said previously, these are revenues delayed, not dead. Already, we are seeing a growing M&A pipeline and some spring-like signs of new issuance emerging. That said, it largely remains a back half 2023 and full year 2024 story. On the positive side, our fixed income and equity trading teams performed very well in managing through some historic rate moves. Total trading revenues were solid. I expect the markets to remain choppy through this earnings season and for the next several months. However, absent any geopolitical surprise or limited progress on bringing down inflation, I think 2023 is likely to end on a constructive note in most areas. Morgan Stanley is very well positioned not just for 2023, but for several years ahead as we see significant growth opportunities across all three of our client platforms. I will now pass it over to Sharon for more details on the first quarter. Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.5 billion in the first quarter, our EPS was $1.70, and our ROTCE was 16.9%. The firm\u2019s results demonstrated the durability of our business model, evidenced by the resilient ROTCE, robust asset consolidation and wealth and our stable capital and liquidity levels. In institutional securities, fixed income and equity supported our clients while navigating volatile markets. Wealth Management showcased $110 billion of net new assets and investment management continued to benefit from the investments we have made to diversify our offerings. The firm\u2019s first quarter efficiency ratio was 72%. Deferred cash-based compensation plans negatively impacted our firm\u2019s efficiency ratio by approximately 60 basis points. Ongoing technology and marketing and business development investments as well as higher litigation costs increased operational expenses versus the prior year. Given the broader market uncertainty and the inflationary environment, expense management remains a priority, although we continue to prioritize investments in our long-term goals. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues were $6.8 billion, an 11% decline from the very strong prior year. Fixed income and equity results partially offset weakness in banking as we helped our clients intermediate markets through this period of heightened uncertainty. From a regional perspective, Asia delivered its third highest quarter ever with strength in areas of both fixed income and equity aided by the policy dynamics in Japan and the China reopening. Investment Banking revenues decreased year-over-year to $1.2 billion, solid revenue in advisory supported results while ongoing market volatility continued to pressure equity and non-investment grade underwriting. Advisory revenues were $638 million, benefiting from the completion of previously announced transactions. Revenues were down versus the strong prior year on the back of lower announced volumes in 2022. Equity underwriting revenues were $202 million, down 22%, largely as a result of depressed IPO activity. While IPO and follow-on activity remained muted, issuers selectively access market windows. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $407 million. Results were supported by an open investment grade market and opportunistic loan activity. Clients are engaged as we help them navigate an uncertain backdrop and our investment banking backlog is building. Financial sponsors continue to look for opportunities to invest. Within underwriting, we are encouraged by the issuance activity during constructive windows. Of course, further conversion from pipeline to realized is predicated on clarity around macroeconomic conditions, stable financing markets and increased corporate confidence. Equity revenues were $2.7 billion, a solid quarter against an uncertain and volatile backdrop. We continue to be a leader in this business and the results reflect our global and diversified footprint. Cash revenues decreased versus the prior first quarter on lower global volumes. Derivatives results were solid compared to a strong quarter last year as we help navigate \u2013 as we help clients navigate challenging markets. Prime brokerage revenues were down as equity market levels declined. Clients remained engaged and balances increased steadily throughout the quarter. Fixed income revenues of $2.6 billion were strong, though lower versus the prior year\u2019s elevated result, which was impacted by the beginning of the Fed rate hiking cycle and a start of the war in Ukraine. This quarter\u2019s performance was driven by rates and credit. Macro revenues were down modestly year-over-year with relative strength in rates versus foreign exchange in the comparison period. The volatility created by varying expectations around global central bank policy aided results across regions. Micro results were up versus the prior year, supported by client engagement. Commodity revenues moderated meaningfully compared to the robust results in the previous first quarter largely due to reduced volatility in European markets and the mild weather in the U.S. Other revenues of $245 million improved versus the prior year, largely driven by higher revenues on corporate lending activity and gains related to DCP. Turning to ISG lending and provisions, our allowance for credit losses on ISG loans and lending commitments increased to $1.3 billion. In the quarter, ISG provisions were $189 million and net charge-offs were $70 million. The increase in provisions was driven by the higher recessionary probability and worsening outlook for commercial real estate. The charge-offs were substantially all from a handful of specific loans. Turning to Wealth Management, revenues were $6.6 billion. Movements in DCP positively impacted revenues by approximately $100 million compared to a negative impact of nearly $300 million in last year\u2019s first quarter. Net new asset growth of $110 billion was a standout as we continue to execute on our long-term strategy. Pre-tax profit was $1.7 billion and the PBT margin was 26.1%. The margin reflects a more favorable revenue mix offset by higher credit provisions and an increase in expenses as we continue to invest in our business, inclusive of integration-related expenses. Credit provisions were $78 million, including those that impacted revenue and the integration-related expenses for the quarter were $53 million, in line with our expectations. Forward growth drivers remain robust. Net new assets were very strong at $110 billion for the quarter, representing a 10% annualized growth rate of beginning period assets. While NNA will be lumpy and should be looked at on a full year basis, the results illustrate our ability to attract assets and the payoff of our investments to support growth. We saw contribution from all channels with notable strength in the adviser led channel, particularly amongst existing clients. The events in March and the rising interest rate environment over the past year impacted client behavior. Clients increased their allocation to cash equivalents such as money market funds and U.S. treasuries by over 60% versus last year. At the same time, deposits declined in the quarter by 3% to $341 billion. We believe investable assets stayed within Morgan Stanley as our clients worked with advisers to help navigate the volatile markets. Today, adviser-led assets invested in cash and cash equivalents stand at a peak of 23% compared to historical average of approximately 18%. Over time, we believe clients will reinvest these balances across more assets when the market outlook improves. In the interim, given our broad product offerings, clients are choosing to invest in cash with Morgan Stanley through the cycle, positioning us to provide them with more reinvestment choices down the road. Net interest income was $2.2 billion, up 40% year-over-year. Results reflect the impact of higher interest rates and lower sweep balances. Fee-based flows of $22 billion were strong. Asset management revenues were $3.4 billion, down 7% versus last year, reflecting lower market levels. Transactional revenues were $921 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues were down 12% versus last year due to fewer new issuance opportunities and reduced activity levels compared to the beginning of 2022. Lending balances declined this quarter to $144 billion, led by pay-downs in securities-based lending, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Importantly, our strategy is working and we are seeing channel migration from workplace to adviser-led. Adviser-led flows, originating from workplace relationships reached $28 billion in this quarter alone, double versus this time last year and this compares to the approximate $50 billion we saw annually over the past 3 years. Furthermore, almost 90% of these flows were from assets held away, also consistent with what we have seen historically. Our strategy remains in place to best serve our clients and support the firm\u2019s path to reach $10 trillion in client assets. Moving to Investment Management, revenues of $1.3 billion declined 3% year-over-year, primarily on lower AUM due to the decline of asset values and the cumulative effect of outflows over the prior year. Total AUM ended at $1.4 trillion. Long-term net outflows were $2.4 billion as equity outflows moderated in the quarter. In fixed income, outflows in floating rate loans were partially offset by high yield and emerging markets. Finally, alternatives and solutions delivered strength, driven mostly by demand for Parametric\u2019s fixed income customized portfolios as well as inflows into private credit. Liquidity and overlay services had inflows of $13.9 billion. Positive liquidity inflows of $37 billion were partially offset by outflows related to a single client relationship. Asset management and related fees decreased versus the prior year to $1.2 billion due to lower average AUM, partially offset by higher liquidity fee revenue. Performance-based income and other revenues were $41 million. Results were supported by gains in our private alternatives portfolio, reflecting the diversity of the platform. Integration-related expenses were $24 million in the quarter in line with expectations. A key focus area remains maximizing our global distribution capabilities and we continue to see momentum internationally, particularly from the Eaton Vance fixed income team. Our investments across a broad array of strategies and capabilities, including active ETFs, Parametric customization and alternatives position us well to benefit from the diversification as well as to serve our global client base. Turning to the balance sheet, spot assets were $1.2 trillion, largely in line with the prior quarter. Our standardized CET1 ratio stands at 15.1% and SLR at 5.5%. Standardized RWAs increased quarter-over-quarter, primarily on client activity, consistent with seasonal patterns. We continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, including buying back $1.5 billion of common stock. Our tax rate was 19.3% for the quarter. The vast majority of share-based award conversion takes place in the first quarter, creating a tax benefit. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 23%, which will exhibit some quarter-to-quarter volatility. As James discussed, the fallout resulting from the events in March is not indicative of the systemic stress that the industry faced during the global financial crisis. Our clear and consistent strategy allowed us to enter this environment well positioned. The outlook for the remainder of this year is difficult to predict. We are keenly aware that opening and functioning markets and economic stability are integral in aiding confidence moving forward. In the interim, we remain focused on supporting our clients and attracting assets to our platform. With that, we will now open up the line to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take your first question from Daniel Fannon from Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Just thinking about the environment and the opportunity, can you talk about adviser recruitment, I assume retention is high, but as you think about the opportunity, given some of the fallout with some of the regional banks, in the current environment. Maybe talk about how you are positioned and maybe how that differentiates versus say a year ago? Sharon Yeshaya : Certainly. The adviser recruiting pipeline remains healthy. We continue to see assets aggregated from all channels, as I mentioned, both recruiting, adviser-led and workplace and when we compare it to a year ago, I think that what we continue to see is that we remain a destination of choice, not only for new advisers, but also obviously, as we stated, from the assets held away that we continue to aggregate in both the net new assets from existing and from new clients. Daniel Fannon : And then just as a follow-up, with NII, generally probably a little more challenged versus where we were last year, how do you think about wealth management margin expansion in this environment? And maybe specifically, can you talk to you the NII trends as you think about this year and how we should think about that given some of the deposit dynamics you mentioned as well as the current rate environment? Sharon Yeshaya : So first, let\u2019s take NII. As we said, what we have been looking at is we thinking about it in terms of modeled client behavior. Obviously, March itself had a different modeled client behavior than we probably would have expected for other months within the quarter. But when we look ahead, we are currently not expecting expansion of the quarterly NII as we go forward. Now as that relates to the margin, a 26% margin, obviously, is still impacted by certain things, such as integration-related expenses. We mentioned also litigation and we continue to really invest in the model as we go \u2013 as we have and also as we go forward. All of that being said our eyes are still on the 30% goal that we have set forth and we will continue to achieve as we move through time to progress to those goals. Operator : We will hear next from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hello. Thanks. Maybe we could follow-up on that conversation. I\u2019m just curious, you mentioned that interesting stat of 23% sitting in cash and cash equivalents, up from 18% historically. If we weave that into normalizing over time, but also deposits were down 3% and cost of funds is up a bunch. As we go through the year, do you anticipate the normalization of the cash component at the same time, deposits continue to come down and migration continues to be yield seeking, like can \u2013 I guess, my question with all that ramble is, can the margin get back into that range while we have these cash leaking and yield-seeking behavior is happening? Sharon Yeshaya : So I think that for us to predict exactly what the behavior will be. Obviously, if we think about what happened in March, that\u2019s a very difficult thing to predict. But I think what you\u2019re highlighting in your question, Glenn, as I parse out the very beginning of it, is right now, cash and cash equivalents are at a higher level, a higher level than we have ever seen historically. As we begin to see those assets be deployed into different types of products that ability and that advice will obviously be accretive. It will also help us as you see asset levels rise. So there is a pull/push factor as you think about those things. In addition to that, as we continue to aggregate assets, we will gain from scale, the more assets that we see, the more we will see in balances, the more that will probably help as you think about just what the cash balances are more broadly because assets are being attracted platform. And in addition to that, we will gain for the longer objectives of what that might mean for the margin and for the wealth management business more broadly. James Gorman : If I could just add and excuse my voice, I have a chest cold. Glenn, on the simple math to take the margin of that business from 26% to 28% is about $120 million. Obviously, we\u2019re still absorbing some integration stuff relating to the platform that will be done this year. We had slightly higher reserves. We\u2019ve been investing pretty aggressively in the business and, frankly, I think, prudent \u2013 appropriately, the payoff is the $110 billion, which is a net new asset organic growth of 10%. So I\u2019ll take that any day long, the assets to sustain the building. So yes, we have a lot of levers to push that margin around a couple of percent points. That\u2019s not, frankly, a source of great anxiety to me at this point. And I think you\u2019ll see us probably push a few of those levers as we get through this year and certainly next year. So the trade-off is, I think we all want to keep investing for growth. We see a real window here. This $10 trillion target is for real. The tree in every 3 years is 300 \u2013 whatever it is, $330 million a year, $333 million, I guess. And starting off with $110 million, I think we have pretty good visibility to net new money. So it\u2019s a balance. But as we get through this integration as it\u2019s finally completed, some of those costs roll off. We will get a little tighter in the expense management in the wealth business. I know Andy and his team are already focused on that. So \u2013 and then the deposit stuff will \u2013 it\u2019s kind of going to be what it\u2019s going to be depending on where rates go and what the Fed does. Glenn Schorr : Appreciate that. And thank you for fixing my question. The follow-up I have a simpler on commercial real estate. Can you just help us just dimensionalize the portfolio? What exposure do you have? And how do we get comfortable that this is going to get that keeps on giving, like I\u2019m sure there is details within the provision that you took that could help us? Thanks. Sharon Yeshaya : Absolutely. I think what\u2019s important about that portfolio is that it is diversified, in addition to that, we have been reducing the exposure in the ISG direct CRE portfolio over the course of the last year or so. So obviously, we keep our eyes on it. As you know, CECL is a life-of-loan concept. And so as you see economic deterioration, you do need to account for that. And the same goes for what we\u2019re seeing in the commercial real estate market. So I think that those are the two main points I would point you to is that it is diversified, and we have been continuing to reduce that direct exposure. Operator : We will hear next from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. I guess just first question, I wanted to follow-up, James, a comment you made about being expecting 2023 to end on a constructive note. I was wondering if you can elaborate on that just in terms of a lot of this is tied to macro. How do you think the economy paying off in terms of the Fed\u2019s fight against inflation damage it does to the economy in the markets? And as you think about ending 2023, where do we think \u2013 where do you think we will be on all these fronts by the time the year ends? James Gorman : Well, our house call out for the markets went about flat from where they started at the beginning of the year, and they certainly support that. I think the two wildcards out there are geopolitical risk, which we can\u2019t really handicap my gut is that the U.S.-China relations while having the moments tension remain overall stable through this year and global trade remains stable. The second risk, of course, is that the Fed\u2019s actions doesn\u2019t bring down inflation. Well, the evidence so far is it is bringing down inflation, but they are probably not done. I think it\u2019s likely we will see at least one more and possibly two more rate increases. That gets you to sort of high 5%, 6% type interest rates, which is not shocking. And if we get through that, again, many people are calling for a modest recession, it might be, I don\u2019t know, obviously, but got is, whether it\u2019s a modest recession or we dodged that bullet. Sort of doesn\u2019t matter that much. What really would matter is if inflation is not tamed, it has to go much higher than people are expecting. You go into a much deeper recession it\u2019s certainly not a likely outcome at this point. So that\u2019s why I said I think I used the words constructive. For Morgan Stanley, if the sort of green shoots we\u2019re starting to see. Again, I don\u2019t think they are a Q2-type event but back half of the year and next year in banking and underwriting, we just had a Global Risk Committee yesterday discussed some of the stuff and certainly the underwriting calendar, it looks like it\u2019s picking up a little bit through the back half of the year. I think the wealth management, what Sharon pointed to, the 23% in cash like security is moving into active investments, that will happen. I mean through the long history of this business people don\u2019t hold a quarter of their money in cash. They just think it is not real. So \u2013 and I suspect once we pass this sort of inflation Fed action, there will be a long pause would be my gut followed by some rate cuts starting in 2024. I do not expect that this year. So when I put it all together, relative to sort of other periods that I\u2019ve been through my career, I think it feels given the landlord, given the geopolitical stuff, given the inflation surge given COVID, it actually feels surprisingly benign from what it could have been. Now that\u2019s not denying there are clear stresses, the commercial real estate that I think Glenn just asked about across the banking sector, what\u2019s going on in some of those banks with very idiosyncratic portfolios that frankly didn\u2019t match duration interest rate risk, well, is were issues. There are parts of the world that are still having slow growth. So it\u2019s not a perfect kind of remains the rolling on song, you can\u2019t always get what you want but you get what you need. And I think about Morgan Stanley coming out of this, and we\u2019re kind of getting what we need. We\u2019re getting a 15% CET1. We\u2019re getting a 17% ROTCE decent revenue, decent earnings, obviously, opportunity to take some costs out and I think very well positioned on a go-forward basis. So that\u2019s where the word constructive came from. Sorry, it\u2019s a long answer for one word. Ebrahim Poonawala : No. I appreciate the color. And just as a follow-up, when we think about capital return in terms of one, the pace of buybacks, given the macro uncertainty, any perspective there? And just opportunistically, do you see this as creating opportunities inorganically M&A-wise for Morgan Stanley as we look forward? James Gorman : We\u2019ve maintained \u2013 it\u2019s a very good question. I\u2019ll deal with sort of what the capital position is now and what the opportunities are for excess capital. On the capital position now, CET1 is running at 15.1%. We obviously have control over that dial to a large extent. So \u2013 and we have tilted conservative. I think it\u2019s fair to say. I haven\u2019t seen all the numbers, but I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re at the top or above all of our competitors set again, and we\u2019ve been that way for quite a while. So on current capital requirements with the last stress test, we\u2019re at 13.2%, I think or 33%, somewhere around there. So 15% is a very healthy buffer. But we\u2019ve got a new stress test coming out. So many people feel that\u2019s going to be a little tougher than what it was last year. It might be, and we\u2019ve obviously got plenty of capital for it. So I don\u2019t expect any issues whatsoever. And then we have Basel III coming out in, I think, sort of late May, June time period where \u2013 and again, that will be implemented probably 2025 that looks like earliest. So again, there is time for the banks to adjust their capital position. So we will have much better visibility as to what we\u2019re dealing with by, say, July 1. And I \u2013 again, I don\u2019t \u2013 I suspect it might drive some changes in how we run our balance sheet, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to involve anything particularly draconian. Now given that, we like to maintain a healthy buffer. We have done, obviously, the deals we did in the last couple of years, E-Trade and Eaton Vance, which I just said I couldn\u2019t be more happy with both the timing of those deals, the pricing of those deals and the performance of the businesses. And when we see a really robust market environment, you\u2019ll see that even more so in spades. We\u2019ve had a very healthy dividend yield. I think it\u2019s over 3.5% churn, something like that now. We believe in the dividend. I\u2019ve said for years, and I think of the wealth management business is a dividend stock, and we\u2019re clearly making more money in that business than we\u2019re paying out a dividend. And we\u2019re buying back. I mean we dove the buyback down a little bit. I think to $1.5 billion, we\u2019re probably running at $2.5 billion at our peak last year on a quarterly basis. And we did that just \u2013 it was an interesting environment. I mean, let\u2019s just say you had two of the biggest banks fail in the last 15 years. So being a little prudent a little conservative, watching that going on, you don\u2019t want to be too grabby is my attitude. So I think we have lots of flexibility. There is no doubt we can and over the years, we will do more acquisitions in my mind. There is no doubt about that whatsoever. And it will be in the wealth and asset management space and we constantly keep a list of who\u2019s attractive and who would be a good fit. But obviously, I couldn\u2019t say if there was something imminent, but there is nothing imminent, but it\u2019s something we focus on. So again, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m giving long answers this morning. It must be this cold that I\u2019ve got. Operator : We will move next to Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So I wanted to start off just unpacking the NNA lows that you saw in the quarter. I mean 10% is really an impressive result. The fee-based flows continue to lag brokerage. And just wanted to better understand what you see as a sustainable fee-based flow rate. And just as we try to evaluate the durability of 10%, how much of the quarterly inflows were from FRC where you\u2019re clearly a destination of choice for some of those attriting advisers? Sharon Yeshaya : I\u2019m going to try and remember all of your questions, Steve, in order. So if I forget one, just remind me. The first point on FRC, I\u2019ll take first. In terms of the regionals, more broadly, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I believe we had about $90 billion that came in without any relationship to those regionals. And so that shows cases to you that\u2019s well above the average that we\u2019ve seen. So I think it just continues to show that the investments that we have made are really working as we move forward. So that\u2019s sort of point number one. The second point that I mentioned, and I think you asked where are those assets coming from? It\u2019s really \u2013 in this particular quarter was in that adviser-led space both from existing accounts and new clients. To me, what was most remarkable when I was going through the diligence materials really was what we\u2019re seeing from clients. So the idea that we continue to be a destination of choice for our existing clients and attracting assets held away, again, speak to all the conversations that we\u2019ve all had over the course of the last 7 years or so talking about investments to give our advisers more time to service their clients as we move forward. Then the final question that you asked around the fee-based flows actually a very strong fee-based flow number, to be honest, from our perspective in an environment where individuals \u2013 we think about it, cash and cash equivalents are high. You\u2019re thinking about putting your money into managed kind of accounts associated with it from that fee-based concept, you\u2019re unlikely to do that in a period of time where you think the cash and cash equivalents and safety might be what you\u2019re looking for right now. And so that is, in fact, the dry powder that we have that over time could move into the fee-based assets. So I think it\u2019s actually a strong number given the environment that we have on the backdrop. Steven Chubak : Really helpful color, Sharon. And just for my follow-up, with \u2013 on sweep deposits, those are now running below 4% of AUM. That\u2019s historically been a strong support level for transactional cash within the advisory space broadly. I was hoping you can give some perspective on how we could think about where sweep CAT could potentially bottom and have you seen any continued mix shift into sweep or deposit pressures in April so far? Sharon Yeshaya : As it relates to April, I talked a little bit in one of the earlier questions about modeled client behavior. And that what we did see is that in March, we really deviated from some of that modeled client behavior. Now in April, we have been more in line with modeled client behavior. So that does speak to your point of maybe we are in a position where from a transactional patch level, we are there. But again, as James said, it is an uncertain environment. And so from that perspective, we will have to wait and see how we move through time from here. Operator : Moving next to Brennan Hawken from UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019d actually have to follow-up on that last question from Steven. So April is more modeled April is typically a tax payment month, which is a headwind. So are you seeing \u2013 where is that cash getting funded from? Are you seeing some of the taxes \u2013 tax payments coming out of both sweep and the other higher cost deposit sources? Is it more biased to the higher cost? Could that provide some relief? And when we put all that into the mix and think about NII going forward, should we be thinking about stable NII we know it\u2019s not growing, but funding this funding cost elevation maybe could lead to some downside. So curious how we should be thinking about that. Sharon Yeshaya : I think that your question in terms of April in terms of where it\u2019s coming from the exact breakdown is challenging to see in terms of exactly where it\u2019s coming from, from all of the deposits perspective because there is could, as you know, cash is fungible, so you could take something and then move it into a different security or a different asset. To parse that out, is challenging. I do think that what\u2019s more important, as you highlight, is that it is tax season. And so to not see an acceleration is obviously one of the more optimistic signs that you are moving through more model client behavior. Now what it means from funding, we obviously have many funding different places. I don\u2019t think that funding is concern, as you mentioned, it does matter from an NII perspective, but it will be a function of two things, Brennan. As you know, rate expectations have also changed since January. And so our NII forecast and predictions are based on models client behavior in terms of cash, sweep etcetera, and also where interest rates are and where the forward curve is for Fed bonds. And so as you begin to see if that changes, that could change your NII forecast. We are still, if you look at models client behavior, asset sensitive. And so from that perspective, I think that gives you a few different pieces to put together in terms of how to think about the forward look based on deferred assumptions. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks very much. Obviously, a lot of uncertainty, so I appreciate that color. And then one more on the net new asset component. Sharon, you guys have an offer for \u2013 promotional offer and it\u2019s tied to higher yielding cash alternatives. What percentage of the net new assets came into \u2013 from that promotion this quarter? In the past, you\u2019ve spoken about how when you bring that cash in a majority of it stays in the system. Do you have any more granular statistics on what portion of that stays in the system? It\u2019s obviously good that it comes into the system, but kind of curious when we think about stickiness and how much is hot money and how much is actually durable? Thanks. Sharon Yeshaya : So the best way to think about the stickiness within the system is actually NNA right, because you\u2019re going to see the outflows would be a net negative to the NNA more broadly. And so the consistent growth over time, if you look at it all the way back even to when we saw promotional levels back, I remember we spoke about this in \u201818 and I think it was \u201817 and \u201818. In those early years, that was still seeing net new asset inflows over time. So, for me, the most important thing is, well, what\u2019s the net, the net continues to be positive and continues to ramp higher. In terms of the CD exact offerings and what that would mean from NNA, it\u2019s considered NNA if it\u2019s brought out from outside of the firm. And again, what\u2019s important here is that we continue to see more in the advisor-led space. And that over time, again, think about the channel migration from workplace into the advisor-led space. What\u2019s important here is that when people begin to seed money into advisor-led, we actually see more money from assets held away. So, I know that doesn\u2019t answer your question directly, but I think it\u2019s important to highlight, as people begin to work with an advisor, what we said to you is 90% of the assets that then come are from assets held away outside the building. So, just again, another proof point that once they understand what the advisor has to offer, it helps aggregate new assets into our system. Operator : We will hear next from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. Sharon, can you share with us, when you guys talked about, I think James said around 25% of your Wealth Management customers\u2019 assets are in cash or cash equivalents, which is high, of course. What interest rate do you guys sense, meaning do rates at the fall 100 basis points or 200 basis points for that money to move back into more traditional assets? Sharon Yeshaya : So, I don\u2019t actually know that it\u2019s the absolute value \u2013 the rate level. And I will answer it in two different ways. First, you have to remember that the events in March didn\u2019t make people \u2013 I mean, we all read the popular press and most individuals begin to think about what is the most risk-free asset, that being a U.S. treasuries. So, one should not be surprised if they begin to move assets into U.S. treasuries. So, I do think that it\u2019s a function also of uncertainty and not just the absolute level of where interest rates are or aren\u2019t. Now, as I have said, we have these moments that are opportunistic, both when you think about the corporate activity and then when you think about the individual activities, so both for ISG and in Wealth Management. And that was evidenced last August, last October and then earlier in January and February that when markets become calm that you begin to see movements into asset classes and further activity as evidenced by our self-directed channel as well. So, I don\u2019t know that there is an absolute level of rates, but I would say it\u2019s related to confidence in the system more broadly and a belief in asset levels being in a place that will bottom and then potentially will rise as we go forward. James Gorman : I totally agree with that. I think Gerard, if people can get a 4%-ish return in a very uncertain environment, that\u2019s not a bad thing to have in your portfolio, at least for 25% of their portfolio. As they get better visibility, as we all get better visibility of when the Fed stops moving and did we go into this recession that some appearing or not or if it\u2019s modest, then I think you will start seeing more engagement. I mean it\u2019s just, we have all been through this. It\u2019s human behavior. We have had a pretty significant shock to the system in the last few months, which thankfully the world kind of \u2013 the financial world got through, but could have turned sideways. And higher rates came at a time of increased uncertainty. So, it\u2019s entirely rational that people would take advantage of higher rates and increased uncertainty by parking in cash, but they are not going to stay in cash at 4% forever. That\u2019s not going to help. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. I appreciate that. And then just as a follow-up question, Sharon, you talked about the credit, the provision and linking into commercial real estate. Of the total loan portfolio, what percentage of that is in commercial real estate mortgages? And are there any construction loans in that portfolio? Sharon Yeshaya : As it relates specifically to the construction loans, I don\u2019t know about the exact construction loans that you might have. I am certain that somewhere there could be a construction loan. But more broadly, I think the absolute level, we do disclose from the ISG side around that $10 billion, and that was in our filings from last quarter. Operator : Devin Ryan from JMP Securities. Devin Ryan : Thank you. Good morning. I just want to start just on market share opportunities that maybe are accelerating here. You touched on some on the call, but one of your peers highlighted your private banking in Europe, just on the heels of some of the banking stress or potentially even just opportunities where you are going to get paid more for committing capital when your capital is becoming more scarce in the system. So, just love to maybe think about some of the things that you are seeing just over the last month or so that might be sustained going forward. Sharon Yeshaya : On capital opportunities, in Europe. Sorry, could you repeat what\u2019s the question? Devin Ryan : Yes. The question is just where there is opportunities to take market share kind of in the wake of the banking turmoil. So, one peer had highlighted private banking in Europe as one example. But just whether there is others as well here, just on the heels of the recent stress? James Gorman : Yes. Devin, let me have a go at that because that probably builds off the capital discussion and where we would invest. We do not have an appetite for private banking in Europe. In fact, we sold our Private Bank in Europe to Credit Suisse several years ago. It\u2019s one of the first things I did, because we would had an unhappy experience. We had owned the business for 21 years, and we lost money for 20 years of them. And I kind of took a fairly simple view that if you lose 20 years out of 21 years, you have probably got to lose it. So, we got out, you need scale. And frankly, it\u2019s not a good fit I believe, with the current regulatory structure that we operate under, so much more interested in the U.S. and Asia and some in Lat-Am. The U.S. business, it\u2019s just going to be an asset gathering monster. To bring in $110 billion in one quarter and $1 trillion over the last 3 years, there aren\u2019t many companies in the world that have a trillion assets under management. So, I think we have got to keep our eye on the prize here and not get distracted by going down some rabbit hole because somebody else is in stress, maybe somebody else is in stress because it\u2019s not a very attractive rabbit hole when you get down inside it. We know what we have got here, and it\u2019s a killer machine. Asia is growing nicely. Again, Lat-Am some, but the workplace conversion is a massive opportunity now that we are focused on. Obviously, we are tracking financial advisors from seeing somewhat of a safe harbor, I guess across the industry. In our organic flows, if you compare them to our traditional competitors, the warehouses or the online brokers, our organic flows, I think are on an annualized basis, significantly higher than the traditional players, and higher than anybody in the industry. So, that\u2019s how we think about it, again, Asia more interesting, Europe not interesting, Lat-Am a little bit interesting and U.S. definitely interesting. Devin Ryan : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Helpful. Just a follow-up, it sounds like you are starting to see maybe a little bit better momentum with financial sponsor clients. I would love to maybe just touch on those specifically and kind of what the appetite is to do deals or to sell assets and kind of what the \u2013 you think the trigger point is to kind of engage them further? Sharon Yeshaya : Certainly, I mentioned is actually when I spoke at a February conference this year, which is that when you think about financial sponsors, they may be in a different position than what we would consider traditional M&A, i.e., they are faster to market. They are in a position where you might not have the same level of activity from a Board. And because of the size, you might have different regulatory restrictions. And so from that perspective, we would expect that they might be first before we see really traditional activity open up. And that is \u2013 that remains kind of the view that we have and also as the pipeline begins to build, that\u2019s also what we are seeing. In order for that to move forward and become realized, it\u2019s really about the opening of the markets in terms of the financing activity. As we have seen some of the backlogs clear, that\u2019s clearly very helpful. But again, it\u2019s about stabilization and it\u2019s about confidence. Operator : We will move next to Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. What is going so right \u2013 what is going so right in Asia that it\u2019s your third best quarter in an environment like this? And then what is going so wrong in investment management since you closed Eaton Vance, the first full quarter, it was second quarter \u201821, if I have that correctly. Investment management revenues are down almost one-fourth. So, shout out to certainly E TRADE and wealth doing well. But in terms of investment management, like it just looks from the outside like Eaton Vance panning out the way you expected. But first, the positive on the Asia was going right and then the negative one, what\u2019s not going right in the investment management? Sharon Yeshaya : Certainly. So, let\u2019s take Asia first. What we saw over the course of the quarter was China reopening, obviously, supporting us from the equities side and perspective in terms of client engagement. And what\u2019s going right also from Asia has been the \u2013 what we have a franchise that we have really built in Japan. And in an environment where interest rate dynamics change, such as what\u2019s going on within Japan, that certainly helped us from the macro perspective and the macro business within fixed income. So, I think that we are \u2013 that\u2019s very important and critical is that it speaks to the global perspective, and it speaks to our global franchise. Why that is important when you think about investment management, and I will tie the two together is that you have to invest more broadly to be able to create an environment of diversification. And so Asia might be asleep. Japan, for example, could be asleep for many years, and all of a sudden, Central Bank activity picks up, and you are there to support your clients with that global franchise. Think about investment management quite similarly. What we are doing is we continue to build a franchise where we are able to have diversified products that are there to capture our client assets. You highlighted what\u2019s going on within the investment management. Well, asset levels are down tremendously. However, since we have purchased and we announced the deal associated with Eaton Vance. Look at Parametric, we have raised over $45 billion in that product alone, again, diversification of the portfolio, diversification of product to be there in a period of time where you see activity. That\u2019s what we are trying to do and build. James Gorman : Yes. I mean I will just add, I wouldn\u2019t frankly, render a judgment yet on the Eaton Vance deal. I think it\u2019s a little soon through a challenging market environment. I would tell you, I am personally thrilled with it. And I am highly confident that 5 years from now, we are going to look back and be thrilled with a lot of people said that Smith Barney deal was a dumb idea. And a lot of people said, E TRADE is a dumb idea. And a lot of people said we overpaid for Solium and these things have moments of sort of settling, if you will. It\u2019s like good house its foundations have to settle. And in a very challenging environment, I think the business is holding up, right. So, I am very happy with that transaction, great people, great company, some fabulous brands. And I think Mike, if you come back and ask that questions in 3 years\u2019 time, hopefully, you won\u2019t reverse the questions. But maybe you will say what\u2019s going right with Eaton Vance and asset management, and what\u2019s going wrong in some other places. Because I am sure, as I have said in the rolling sense, you can\u2019t always get what you want, given the environment, something might be working. But yes, I am pretty relaxed about that one. Mike Mayo : I appreciate the answer. Just a short follow-up, it looks like you are not getting any NII guide, or if you did, I have missed it, and we just want some help with our models here. If you want to kind of guide us in a certain direction, I mean clearly, funding costs have gone up in the industry. James Gorman : I mean super hard. I will be blunt. We sort of guided a little higher on growth in the first quarter and came in plus 1%, which I guess was better than most, but just super hard. So, let\u2019s get through \u2013 I think let\u2019s get through this quarter. We will learn a lot of taxes. And as Sharon said, it\u2019s kind of the numbers have reverted back to what we are modeling, which is good. We will see that. We will see how much of this cash that\u2019s moving. We will see whether there is further deposit outflows or not. I mean it\u2019s just super hard to guide right now. So, I don\u2019t think I know it\u2019s sort of \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s fair or not, but it makes your modeling harder, which I appreciate. But also I don\u2019t want to give guidance that we don\u2019t really have an intellectual basis or fact basis for doing it. It\u2019s just too hard. We are not stressed about it, but that much guidance I will give you, but I just don\u2019t want to put numbers on the sheet of paper at this point. Operator : We will move next to Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Can you talk about the sustainability of the strong fixed income trading revenues. Obviously, on an absolute basis, very good, down from a really strong year ago level and benefited from rate volatility, but at the same time, advisory and DCM was sluggish. So, how do you think about this kind of not just 2Q, but the next several quarters in the kind of environment that we are in and maybe some improvement in IB? Thanks. Sharon Yeshaya : So, the \u2013 our business has done. I think management has done a phenomenal job in really transforming this business to be a client-centric model focused on velocity of assets, focused on supporting our clients. So, the deeper we have gotten into that, the more we have been able to grow our wallet share more broadly and we have been able to be in and around this 10% number. So, that\u2019s clearly based on the activity that we have seen. Now to your point, should we see an opening up of markets could there be greater activity, that would also obviously support the wallet more broadly, but we would expect to be there to continue to gain our appropriate share of that client activity. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then maybe just broadly speaking, like as you think about client brokerage in both fix and equity, like what\u2019s your thought there in terms of committing capital kind of on an incremental basis, like providing more or less from here or not really any change? Sharon Yeshaya : We continued to invest in that business more broadly. You can see that even on the technology side. We are really proud of the equity franchise and business and the transformation that\u2019s had for well over a decade being a market leader. Clearly, as we think about committing capital, it\u2019s also, again, about our clients being active in that market as we see. And I highlighted this in my prepared remarks, we do see client balances increase. We have obviously been there to support our clients. And we are looking for the appropriate risk-adjusted return as we continue to invest in that business. James Gorman : Yes. I would just add, if you step back from this sort of over a 5-year view, firstly, just take hats off to the team led by Ted and Sam, Kelley Smith and then Jay Hallik and Jack [ph] in fixed income. It\u2019s come a long way from, I think a 6% share. I think we troughed that. I don\u2019t even know below after crisis might have been much lower, but sort of 6%-ish share per half of the last decade, and then steadily moved up to 10% and pretty stable. It\u2019s kind of what we wanted. I mean \u2013 and on the equity side, you can buy share, for sure, more, but you want to be in the part of the prime brokerage business that we want to be in. We don\u2019t want to be in the sort of the broker last resort. So \u2013 but if you step back from it and what you have really got is kind of an oligopoly type structure emerged out of the financial crisis where a smaller number of institutions have the global capability for global sales and trading, and we are now one of them. And that was probably not a given 10 years ago. It certainly wasn\u2019t a given. And you have just seen, obviously, Credit Suisse has been merged and that business, lots of parts of that business. I suspect this appear relating to the trading side of the prime brokerage. So, our position gets stronger, not weaker. All that said, we are pretty careful about how much balance sheet we want to use to grow aggressively on the margin because we simply have good options in terms of wealth and asset management businesses. So, it\u2019s a balancing act, but I think the team has done a great job, and I feel really good about where they landed the plane this quarter. tricky quarter, by the way, particularly in rates. Operator : We will hear next from Jeremy Sigee from BNP. Jeremy Sigee : Thank you. Just quite a specific one actually. I thought comp costs were a bit heavy in wealth and in investment management. And you mentioned the deferred comp plans linked to investment performance. Is that heavier deferred comp cost? Is that something that stays with us throughout the year, or is it \u2013 does it move around? Is that a 1Q specific, or is that stuck with us for the rest of the year as well? Sharon Yeshaya : Jeremy, as you remember, that moves around with the investments. You will see both on the revenue line and the expense line. And so you should look at them together, and that\u2019s why we have enhanced the disclosure so that you can think about them from both sides, understand both the margin and the comp ratio, both historically and as we move forward. Jeremy Sigee : That\u2019s perfect. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you everyone for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman. James Gorman : Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We started the second quarter with significant headwinds and uncertainties, and it's fair to say that we ended the quarter overall in a better place with a better tone. The headwinds reflect the ongoing market transition from a high-inflation, low-rate environment to a higher-rate, lower-inflation environment. In addition, there were several other issues impacting the markets. April started on the heels of the first bank crisis since 2008, which had the risk of bleeding into the broader financial system. Prompt action by regulators and what turned out to be idiosyncratic stories of the failed banks combined with the strength and support from the large U.S. banks helped to rebalance the system. Second, we found our country moving headlong into a debt ceiling crisis. While our view was it was likely to be resolved, there is no doubt it created unnecessary uncertainty in the markets in April and May. Thirdly, after rapidly raising rates over 15 months, the Fed reached a pause, if not a plateau at its recent meeting. And while we may not be quite at the end of rate increases, I believe we're very, very close to it. Finally, strong rhetoric from government leaders from both the U.S. and China in recent weeks is evident, but there's now been recent efforts to normalize relations and a constructive dialogue is surely welcome. Seeing these four not-insignificant macro concerns progressed positively, supported a more constructive tone in the markets, particularly evidenced in the last few weeks of the quarter. Beyond more macro issues, we at Morgan Stanley completed a significant part of the E TRADE back-office integration with the final part to be completed after Labor Day and we're very pleased with how it's gone. And today, we announced new institutional initiatives with Japanese research and equity and in foreign exchange with our long standing partner, MUFG, further evidence of how our businesses can work together over time to best serve our global clients. And importantly, we received the most recent results of CCAR. We're pleased our performance under the stress test has improved for the fourth consecutive year, every year since the SCB was introduced. Given our strong results, we increased our dividend by $0.075, the same as we did last year. That brings our total annual dividend per share to $3.40 annually with a dividend yield of about 4% given the current stock price. As to the financial performance of the firm this quarter, certain key metrics were encouraging. Net new assets in Wealth Management grew by $90 billion, and combined with inflows from Investment Management, we saw over $100 billion, bringing our year-to-date net new assets to approximately $200 billion in six months. Our year-to-date growth is well ahead of pace, and while obviously any quarter can bounce around and that will happen, our consistent growth in net new assets in Wealth Management is evidence of our scale and our expanded channels and the clients that we serve. Second, our institutional businesses navigated a choppy environment well. And altogether, the firm delivered net revenues of over $13 billion, up 2% from last year when conditions were very different. This translates into an ROTCE of 12%. Finally, our CET1 ratio was 15.5%. While we knew this would significantly exceed our capital requirements, and it did, it reflects our desire to remain highly capitalized in the face of the new unfolding Basel III Endgame. It's too early to predict the rate of market improvement through the rest of 2023, but the more positive tone and activity seen later in the quarter across many parts of our business is promising. Of course, how much it moves through the balance of the year remains unknown. That said, the fundamentals of our business model remain strong. Finally, a brief comment on succession. At the annual meeting in May, I made it clear I would transition out of the CEO role before next year's annual meeting. Succession planning should be intentional and managed just like strategic planning for the firm or any of our critical talent management processes. We are and have been dealing with a number of uncertainties including but not limited to the CCAR results, business environment, Basel III upcoming Endgame proposals and certain other pending matters. I committed to the Board that I lead our response to those issues, and when I do transition out of the CEO role, I remain as Executive Chairman for a period of time. We are fortunate indeed to have three very strong internal candidates that the Board continues to evaluate along appropriate processes for their readiness to step up as the next CEO of Morgan Stanley. I'll now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the quarter in greater detail and then together we'll take your questions. Thank you. Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $13.5 billion. Our EPS was $1.24, and our ROTCE was 12.1%. Reported results include severance charges of approximately $300 million. This reduced EPS by $0.14 and ROTCE by about 140 basis points. As James discussed, sentiment and activity improved towards the end of the quarter, evidenced by green shoots that emerged across our businesses. In Institutional Securities, client engagement progressively picked up. And in Wealth Management, we witnessed a moderation of sweep outflows as well as the stabilization of retail investments into cash and cash equivalents. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 75%. In addition to severance, expenses for the quarter included $99 million of costs associated with the integrations of E TRADE and Eaton Vance, approximately 75% of which relates to E TRADE. Together, severance and this year's integration represent an impact of about 175 basis points to the year-to-date efficiency ratio. For the balance of the year, our expectations for total integration expenses are broadly in line with our prior guidance, with approximately $150 million remaining. Looking towards the back half of 2023, we continue to balance investments with the operating environment. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues of $5.7 billion declined 8% versus last year. With overall client activity -- while overall client activity was lower compared to the prior period, results improved as the quarter progressed, alongside better market conditions. Investment banking revenues were flat compared to a year ago. Although advisory remained under pressure, a pickup in underwriting supported results. Advisory revenues of $455 million reflected lower completed M&A volumes. Equity underwriting revenues were $225 million. While IPO activity remained muted, results were supported by follow-on and convertibles, encouraging signs that equity and equity-linked markets were opened at times for regular weight issuance. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $395 million, up year-over-year, driven mostly by investment-grade bond issuance, where corporates and financials took advantage of constructive markets in May and June, respectively. Investment-grade markets remain resilient against an uncertain backdrop. Across investment banking, client activity trended positively as the quarter progressed. The preannounced M&A backlog grew consistently throughout the quarter with a potential plateau in rates and lower implied volatility, client dialogue is currently active. We continue to invest in the franchise and have made selective senior hires to enhance our footprint to best position for the opportunity. While we are cognizant of the typical summer slowdown and it is hard to know whether positive trends will continue for the near term, current conditions remain encouraging, certainly for the medium-term outlook and especially for 2024. Equity revenues were $2.5 billion, down 14% compared to strong results in the previous second quarter due to lower activity and lower market volatility. Prime brokerage revenues were solid, supported by increasing average client balances, consistent with rising market levels. Cash and derivatives declined versus last year on lower global volumes and lower market volatility. Fixed income revenues of $1.7 billion decreased compared to last year's elevated results. Solid performance reflects tempered client activity and prudent risk management. However, improved market conditions in June shifted client sentiment and supported the quarter's overall results. Macro revenues were down year-over-year, attributed to the declines in foreign exchange and a challenging environment and reduced activity, partially offset by the pickup in client engagement following the resolution of the debt ceiling debate and performance in rates. Micro results declined versus last year, predominantly on the back of lower client activity. Results in commodities were down significantly compared to the robust prior year, which benefited from volatile energy markets. Other revenues of $315 million improved versus last year, largely driven by lower mark-to-market losses net of hedges and higher net interest income and fees on corporate loans held for sale. Turning to ISG lending and provisions. Our allowance for credit losses on ISG loans and lending commitments increased to $1.4 billion. In the quarter, ISG provisions were $97 million. The increase was driven by continued negative outlook for commercial real estate and modest portfolio growth. Net charge-offs were $30 million, and were substantially all from a handful of specific loans from our corporate lending portfolio. Turning to Wealth Management. Revenues were $6.7 billion, a record. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues were $6.6 billion and increased 5%, supported by higher net interest income. Results demonstrate the strength of the business model and our ability to continue to serve clients throughout different market environments. Pretax profit was $1.7 billion, with a PBT margin of 25.2%. Severance charges were $78 million and integration-related expenses were $75 million. Taken together and with the impact of DCP, these three factors were a drag in the margin of approximately 300 basis points. Despite the challenging market backdrop, the business model continued to deliver against our core objectives. Most notably, Wealth Management delivered $90 billion of net new assets, demonstrating our platform's ability to grow in various market environments. Net new assets were driven by our advisor-led channel, existing client consolidation and net recruiting were strong and offset seasonal tax-related outflows in April. Our early investments in technology, including data and AI, are providing advisers with tools to service current clients better and more efficiently prospect new business, including from our workplace channel. Also significant, as James mentioned, we are pleased to share that we've accomplished an integral part of E TRADE's back-office integration, converting over 3 million E TRADE accounts to Morgan Stanley's unified platform. We did this with virtually no client disruption, which has always been a critical priority. We expect to finish our integration efforts on time in the second half of this year. Moving to our business metrics in the second quarter. Performance was solid down the line in light of the environment. Asset management revenues were $3.5 billion, down 2% versus last year's second quarter, primarily reflecting lower market levels. Transactional revenues were $869 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues declined 2% year-over-year, reflective of lower client activity for most of the quarter. Fee-based flows were $22.7 billion. Bank lending balances grew by $1.1 billion, driven by mortgages, offsetting paydowns in securities-based lending. Total deposits of $343 billion were up slightly quarter-over-quarter. Sweep outflows moderated during May and June compared to April, which included seasonal tax outflows. The recent month's trends are encouraging, but it remains too early to be declarative. Net interest income of $2.2 billion was virtually flat versus the prior quarter. The impact of lower sweep balances and higher funding costs were offset by higher rates. Looking towards the rest of the year, we do not expect NII to expand. Results will be a function of our deposit mix and the trajectory of various rates. Similar to the institutional business, retail sentiment improved as the quarter progressed. For the first time since the beginning of the year, June saw positive monthly flows into equity markets from advisor-led sweep balances. We are encouraged by this more recent activity and remain well positioned to support ongoing asset growth and our clients through market cycles. Turning to Investment Management. Revenues of $1.3 billion declined 9% from the prior second quarter, primarily reflecting lower performance-based income and the cumulative impact of lower asset levels over the course of the year, commensurate with the market environment. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion, declining 3% year-over-year, reflecting the stability and diversification of our client franchise. Performance-based income and other revenues declined year-over-year due to the challenging investing environment in certain asset classes and markets, such as real estate and Asia private equity. Solid performance in other areas of our private alternative strategies acted as a partial offset, reflecting the diversity of our platform and our capital-light, client-driven alternative franchise. Total AUM increased $1.4 trillion. Our integration with Eaton Vance continues to progress well. Integration-related expenses were $24 million in the quarter. Long-term net flows were positive. Inflows were driven by ongoing demand in alternatives and solutions, which offset outflows in equities and fixed income. Within alternatives and solutions, Parametric customized portfolios, private credit and private equity continue -- excuse me, remain consistent sources of net inflows, underscoring the benefits of our diverse platform. Additionally, this quarter, alternatives and solutions benefited from a significant inflow related to a portfolio solutions mandate. Liquidity and overlay services had an inflows of $9.7 billion, supported by ongoing demand for money market funds. We continue to be very well positioned in secular growth areas, such as customization in private markets, across geographies and with our global client base. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets decreased $35 billion from the prior quarter to $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.5%, up approximately 40 basis points versus the prior quarter. Standardized RWAs declined about $9 billion from the prior quarter to $450 billion due to market conditions and continued prudent resource management. Recent stress test results reaffirmed our strong capital position and our durable business model. We announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.075 and renewed our $20 billion multi-year repurchase authorization. Our tax rate was 21% for the quarter, reflecting our global mix of earnings. While we outperformed our tax guidance in the first half, we expect a tax rate of approximately 23% in the second half of this year, consistent with our initial guidance. Although we cannot be sure how the backdrop will play out for the rest of 2023, our priority of the management team is to diligently address what we can control given the market realities. Should stable and higher asset levels prevail, Wealth and Investment Management are poised to benefit, particularly as we continue to attract net new assets, a testament to our asset growth strategy. Within Institutional Securities, while advisory will lag the financing market, the backlog is building and underwriting trends are positive. Open and functioning markets remain key to supporting client conviction and activity levels. Most critically, our business continues to advance our clear and consistent firm strategy, driving long-term growth while remaining well capitalized. With that, we will now open the line up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : Thank you, and good morning. James Gorman : Good morning. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess maybe first question, James, for you. Thanks for the update on the succession. As we think about what you built in terms of the franchise, and I think you talked about the unfolding Basel Endgame rules that are expected over the next week or two, from a shareholder perspective, do you see these rules as game-changing where investors will have to reevaluate the value proposition of Morgan Stanley as a franchise? And you, as a management team, would have to review strategic targets that you've laid out? Give us a sense. And I know plenty of unknowns. But I think the question we get from shareholders is the comfort around the ability of the firm to manage through what could be pretty radical changes. James Gorman : Well, it's an important question. And you're right, I have made comments on it. Let's sort of set the table of where we are right now. We've had a lot of speculation based off of what the Basel III Endgame looks like. By the way, I'm not sure it's actually being implemented fully in Europe, just to say. I think the U.S. banks actually have more capital, but putting that knit aside, we did get the speech from the Vice Chair. I think it's important to look at the title of that speech, which was holistic capital review. So, it's taking into account all of the CCAR, stress tests, SCB buffers and the like as this stuff is implemented. Secondly, we haven't seen the actual rules. I mean, I guess there will be a proposal coming out, as you said, in a couple of weeks. There will be an extensive comment period. There is clearly very different views as to the need for the U.S. banking system to accrete more capital. In fact, if you look at the test of the last few years, what happened with the regional banks, what -- Silicon Valley First Republic Signature, what happened during COVID, what's happened during this period of high inflation, what's happened with the biggest rate increase we've had in 40 years, put all that together, the U.S. large banks actually did really well. In fact, if not all of them, certainly for Morgan Stanley, our capital position improved four years in a row under CCAR. So, it's kind of hard for me to sit here and say that we won't be commenting forcefully that we are very well capitalized. But there will be an extensive comment period. I suspect what comes out of that will not be the same as what starts. I think in the sausage making, there will be a lot of evaluation. Clearly, the intent is not to harm the U.S. banking system, which is the backbone of the economy. It's to strengthen us. Then there will be a long transition period. So, I just happen to be reading the speech from the Vice Chair in the last couple of days, and he had a paragraph in there anticipating this question. I thought I'd read to any proposed changes would go through the standard notice and comment rule-making process, allowing for all interested parties appropriate time. Any final changes to capital requirements would occur with appropriate transition times. And he goes on again later in his speech to point out, it could be -- it will not be fully effective for some years. So, here we are in 2023. I don't think this is going to happen in any meaningful way before the end of 2026. I think what comes out a year from now after comment period will be very different from what goes in. And just take my personal peep in it, which is applying a standardized RWA hit on operating risk as the various regulators trying to figure out what the right way to assess operating risk capital is. And to put a standardized hit is fine, but to do it based on fee income, which is the current European proposal, seems to me to be nuts. I mean, we're not -- you don't build fee-based businesses to create operating risk. You build them to create stability. So that's a point we've made very clear with the regulators, and I think they're taking it under consideration. So, long story short, yes, it's the final trust. It's ironic, I don't believe all the European banks are complying with their own rules. We have a very healthy robust capital system here that's been tested 12 years in a row. Morgan Stanley has done well. And there is no chance there will be a major strategic shift for Morgan Stanley as a result of any of this, is my conclusion. Ebrahim Poonawala : That is helpful, and nuts sounds about right. One quick question, Sharon, for you. You mentioned NII not seen as expanding from here. I guess, is implied in the expectation that NII should stabilize in the back half, give or take, within a few percentage points? Sharon Yeshaya : It will depend really -- Ebrahim, thanks for the question. It really depends on the deposit mix. And so, as I mentioned, there were encouraging signs in terms of that mix as we think about the back half of the quarter. But that liability mix, what's going on with sweeps will be the primary driver when you think about NII in the near term. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Devin Ryan : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just want to touch on the Institutional Securities. And you had ultimately, I think, a pretty good quarter relative to the backdrop. And you mentioned that engagement really accelerated kind of towards to the back half of the quarter. So, I'm assuming kind of on the other side of the debt ceiling debate, things started to normalize a little bit. So, just want to talk about some of the puts and takes, and whether maybe the second quarter results, which are still the softest results, I think, since 2019 second quarter, if this is kind of a more normal outcome, or if you actually think that what you saw kind of in that recovery in the back half of the quarter is normalization and so therefore, we could actually bounce back from the outcome of the second quarter? Thanks. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. Let's take all of ISG first. So, when we think about what we've discussed a lot at length really about normal, post COVID has been for the overall ISG wallet to land between 2019 and 2020. Our view there broadly has not changed. In terms of where we expect ourselves to be, we've laid out a pretty clear sort of market share guidelines in terms of where we are from a wallet perspective. When you look specifically, you talked about fixed income, we've moved from 6% wallet share to 10% wallet share. So, I think the dramatic change that we've made in that business has really been around a client-centric franchise and making sure that we're there and able -- to be able to service our client base. What we talked about, as you highlight, is that there was less client activity for us this second quarter compared to last year's second quarter. But interestingly, as you mentioned, and you're right, we saw a dramatic change in that activity level, specifically in fixed income right after the debt ceiling debate. So, I think what we're looking to do is capture our fair share of the wallet. And that overall wallet in terms of normalization, we think will likely land between 2019 and 2020. Devin Ryan : Okay. Great color there. And then, just in terms of just this green shoot and kind of normalization theme, we are seeing in the equity capital markets, debt capital markets, some normalization. M&A still been pretty lackluster. And so, just curious whether you just feel like maybe that's more on a lag basis as capital markets recover, then M&A recovery would come next? Or is there something else kind of idiosyncratic to that market that may hold back results in that business? Thanks. Sharon Yeshaya : Yes. Remember that, of course, advisory is always going to be lagged just because of the announcement. So, we're digesting the fact that we had a very muted or a dearth of announcements if we look back six, nine months. If we think about the last month of the quarter, we began to see more announcements. And we're seeing that really in sector-specific that have a strategic dialogue around them. So be that financials where you might see industry consolidation, energy where you're seeing transitional discussions and reasons to actually have strategic dialogue. So, what gives us confidence is that you're seeing a broadening out of those strategic dialogues. Our backlog is building, and we're seeing it across various sectors we're having both backlog and discussions. But it is fair to say that advisory will likely lag simply because you are dealing with a lagged announcement pipeline from the last six to nine months. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI Group. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thank you. So, I want to drill down a little bit more on the $90 billion. I know it can be lumpy, but I didn't think it was [due to] (ph) workplace produced. But I wonder if you could drill down a little bit on what happened to work so well this quarter and this first half of the year. I mean, it bodes well for your doubling of pre-tax margin -- I'm sorry, doubling of pre-tax income for Wealth. But just curious on what's contributing to the good lumpiness lately, so obviously, well ahead of your $1 trillion every three-year pace. Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you so much, Glenn, for the question. And yes, I think referencing Andy's speech that he gave for those of you who may not be aware, is helpful because it is an asset-led strategy when we think about where we see expansion in that business going forward. This particular quarter, historically, over the long term, we've generally said no one channel is contributing to over 25% of NNA. Interestingly, this quarter, we did see the advisor-led channel was a big proponent. And more than that, it was -- what was a big production part of the funnel was the assets held away from existing clients. This has been a strategy that we've been talking about back 2015 through [Technical Difficulty] to give advisors more time to begin to not only prospect new clients, but also really offer their existing clients better advice. And so that's where I think you're beginning to see a lot of that work in terms of aggregating assets held away, and we continue to believe that, that's a real opportunity for us to grow our asset base. James Gorman : I just want to add on this a little bit because it's obviously been a focus of mine for many decades. The run rate, Glenn, as you know, for the three years before this was $1 trillion. So we're running about $330-ish billion a year. This year run rate, if you extend it would obviously be higher than that, it would be around $400 billion. But I think you're right, it's going to be lumpy. I mean you're going to have a quarter in here somewhere that's a $50 billion quarter, and I wouldn't get too excited about that. And just as I don't get too excited, we're ahead of the run rate. What I really care about, what I'm really excited about is it's a real thing. This is not just something that's going to stop. We've got a lot of wealthy clients. Just the dividends, the interest they get on their accounts, the money they're bringing in, the migration from the workplace, the migration from the E TRADE accounts, it's the real deal. And I know we put out this $10 trillion number, which I think is -- I think this is going to happen. And at a 5% increase in the value annually on the portfolio with a $1 trillion every three years, it happens in a bit over five years. And it's just a pretty much unstoppable force, but there will be lumpiness in it. I'm sure of that. I don't know when, but there will be lumpy. This happened to be a great one. And I'm excited about it. I think we're heading to -- we're clearly heading to $10 trillion, which is at 50 basis points, $50 billion in revenue. And if you do the math compounding, and I know people are going to call me crazy, and I know it's the end of my tenure, so I get to do this kind of stuff. But if you do 5% over 14 years, you end up at $20 trillion, which is a $100 million revenue business. Well, that seems like a long way out, but I started this job 14 years ago, and we had much, much fewer than the $6.3 trillion we have today. So it's possible. Glenn Schorr : Wow. Maybe just one quickie, Sharon. You talked about sweeps, and it's too early to tell if we've settled in. I'm curious if you have any stats you can share on what percentage of FAs and/or what percentage of clients have accounted for most of the moving? I'm not sure what's [room for you] (ph) here, but curious on how widespread across the FA and client base the shifts have been or concentrated. Sharon Yeshaya : Yes. In terms of the shift in terms of moving out of sweeps into savings or seeing savings products, we still have over 80% of our actual deposit base is coming from our own client base. What's interesting in terms of the movement of sweeps, which might be your question, I'm not sure I'm totally answering it, Glenn, is that we began to see some of those sweeps not just -- remember, we used to see them move into money markets or other cash alternatives. In June, we began to see some of those dollars actually move into markets, so various assets. We hadn't seen that trend since January. So that just shows that some of the clients are actually also deploying excess cash or cash equivalents actually into the marketplace as well. Operator : For our next question, we'll move to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hey, good morning. So James, I appreciate your comments on Basel III Endgame. It might be helpful if you could just speak to how the lengthy transition period informs your near-term buyback appetite if at all? And given the RWA inflation could be quite meaningful, what are some of the mitigating actions you can pursue to alleviate some of the pressure on your businesses? James Gorman : Well, again, I think, Steve, we've got to see the rule proposed first. I mean, without talking out of school, I clearly had conversations with all the appropriate regulatory bodies. And I'm encouraged by their response, which is they sincerely want to hear comments from the industry. They do understand capital changes across the whole industry have to result in the right economic outcome for the country. And by definition, the bank's stability, as evidenced by the recent many years of CCARs, shows that the G-SIB banks, the top eight banks for sure, are well capitalized. So, I don't want to get ahead and talk about what we'd mitigate. Clearly, we have flexibility around our RWAs. You saw that this quarter, we ended up with 15.5% CET1. We did that not really from a Basel III perspective. I mean, we had that in the back of my mind, but more from this environment, it was a little squarely. I mean, let's just say it that you had three bank fails at the beginning of the quarter. That wasn't a good look. So, we wanted to be cautious. And on the specific buyback, obviously, just on the dividend, we're totally comfortable with the dividend. We've said many, many times we regard half the company as a yield stock, and we're going to treat it that way. And the dividend increases you've seen, I think they're entirely appropriate, and I would expect they continue over coming years without saying exactly what level they're at. On the buyback, I mean, we would take advantage of weakness in the stock. We will be prudent. We're creating -- this was a very difficult quarter and we accreted $2 billion. So it's not like we're not making money here. And I'd like to see the rule, I guess, in a couple of weeks, Sharon, right, we're getting the rule and then the first range of comments. We'll be doing buybacks through this year. We have $20 billion authorization from the Board. We won't be doing $20 billion, but we'll be doing buybacks, and we'll moderate it. I think this thing is going to take -- as I said, I'd be surprised if this is all done and dusted by -- where are we, '23, by the end of '26. I think that's sort of -- and that's 3.5 years, which is a lifetime in these industries. Steven Chubak : No, it's a fair point, James. I mean, immediately, we all had the experience with Basel III when it wasn't going to get fully implemented for a period of years and the impacts were fully loaded. So, I think we're all just trying to prepare for maybe some expectation that it gets priced in a little bit more quickly. James Gorman : It could. And we'll adapt, but we won't change our strategy. And I'm going to be a strong advocate on where I think some of these rules do not align with what is right for the global -- for the U.S. financial system and the U.S. economy, not just Morgan Stanley's self-interest. Steven Chubak : No, helpful perspective. If I could squeeze in one more here, just on Investment Management. The 30% margin goal that you've laid out for Wealth and IM, Wealth, when we adjust for the specials, of about 300 bps, you're within spitting distance of that 30%. The Investment Management margin, it's running in the mid-teens. And I recognize you're still integrating Eaton Vance. But what are your margin aspirations for that business? And what are some of the actions you're taking to maybe help close that gap? Sharon Yeshaya : So, Steve, the margin goals that we've given have been really around Wealth Management. I respect your point though, we have given larger efficiency targets for the firm. And so, there are places where you all puts and takes between ISG and I am. Remember, if we look back less than 18 months ago or so, we did -- we were close to 30% margins in the IM business. So, what we've seen over the course of the last year or so has just been the cumulative impact of the outflows associated with changes in what investor appetite was, particularly around active equity. But also just the asset levels themselves that are associated with market. What's important to us is the diversification of the platform and then continuing to invest in where we see real changes in that business. And I mean -- by that business, I mean more broadly in an industry landscape. So things like customization consistently, every quarter, regardless of what we've seen sort of on the top-line, we continue to see increased flows, net inflows on the customization product. You saw -- we talked about a solutions-based product this additional quarter. So, we're leaning into where we see industry opportunities. And as we grow assets, similar to us growing assets on the Wealth Management side, that should help support the margin for the Investment Management business, which we do see as a through-the-cycle business. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Mr. Hawken, your line is now open. Sharon Yeshaya : Operator, maybe we go to the next one and come back to Brennan. Operator : We'll move to the next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Well, this is the first chance we have to ask you about the CEO change, James. And just... James Gorman : Mike, you asked me about CEO change in 2012. So, that's your second chance to ask me. Mike Mayo : Yes, well, you survived and thrived, so there you go. James Gorman : Thank you. I appreciate that. Mike Mayo : But it's -- this is Wall Street and what have you done first lately and what's going to happen ahead. So, first, I don't understand what the Executive Chairman is. And I do hope you have in-person shareholder meetings again like you did in the past. And what will that mean when you're Executive Chairman? And what is your thought process on timing of the new CEO? And what are your considerations? I mean, we could all go through the candidates that we see in the press, but let's just hear it from you directly what you're thinking and what the Board is thinking who ultimately makes that decision? James Gorman : Well, to take a few of those pieces, we're not going to have in-person shareholder meetings. Since the years I did this before COVID, we have more people from security than we did shareholders physically in the meeting. So, let's just be honest, it was an enormous waste of time and money. And while one or two people might ask -- like asking question in-person, I just don't think it's a good use of time and money. But that along with my pet peeve that we shouldn't have quarterly earnings reports, they should be every six months. That'll be two immediate changes I would make if I was God of Finance. But that's not what you really asked about. On the CEO stuff, I mean, Mike, we -- I said about five years ago, I'd stepped down about five years. I said three years ago to be three years, and nobody believed me. So, I said the best way to get people to believe and the Board agree with this strategy was that the annual meeting to say I won't be in the job of the next annual meeting. So that makes it very clear. it's 12 months. We're already two months in. When exactly that happens, frankly, just isn't that relevant. I mean whether it happens tomorrow, it happens on May, whatever it is 15th or something next annual meeting is irrelevant, it will happen somewhere between those dates. There's a few things I think just given my tenure, I can probably get done that will help the new CEO get off to a great start. And that is my intent. I want somebody to do this job as well better than I've done it for the next several years and to thrive in it. And the best way to help them is to get them off to a good start. So the exact timing will be just driven by that. Obviously, given the questions here on Basel III Endgame, that's an important thing for me to dig into over the next few months. We just got the CCAR stuff done. We got the dividend done. We're chipping away at what I call the remaining pieces. The Board will ultimately decide. We have a process. It's a committee, the Comp, Management Development Succession Committee chaired by Dennis Nally, runs that process. He reports to the Board, obviously, and the full Board will ultimately choose the next CEO. And I'm sure at some point, they want my formal input on that, but they're doing their processes, they should independently. And I think it's very healthy. So the criteria you look for, obviously, not necessarily who's the business operator running a given business on a given day, but who's best equipped to deal with the multiple constituencies and challenges of running a global bank. And that's what the Board will figure out. So saying more than that, I think, would be inappropriate because it gets ahead of the Board's process. And that's their job. And I'm just here to help along the way. So hopefully, that clarifies it, Mike. Mike Mayo : Yes. Just one follow-up. So that -- at least I guess there's three contenders, the three heads of the business lines, if that's correct. And I guess that means maybe two people don't get the job. What's a good technique for your firm or any firm to make sure that those people who don't get the top job are still made part -- still stay with the firm and still a part of everything that's happening? James Gorman : Wall Street had a history of that not happening. I think we will -- frankly we will challenge that history. We have an unbelievable team that worked together for at least eight years. I think they've all been on the operating committee and we have an unbelievable team of executives around them. Sharon, who you're hearing on this call; Eric Grossman, our Chief Legal Officer; Clare Woodman, who runs Europe, Middle East; and so on and so on. So, we have a lot of very talented executives. That'll be for myself, frankly, to help navigate that path, but these jobs are enormous jobs, whether it's CEO or President or COO of these global companies and we're one of the largest companies in the world. So I'm confident we'll end up in a great place, Mike. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Hopefully you can hear me now. James Gorman : Go ahead, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : All right. Sorry about that before. So, Sharon, I know you mentioned before about the NII and the deposit cost having a big impact, but actually the deposit cost trends were roughly in line with what we were looking for and yet NII turned out to be a little better than expected. Could you tell us -- we don't have great visibility on the asset side. Did something happen on the asset side were you able to reprice some assets? And how much more of that do we have potentially on the come? Sharon Yeshaya : There were some places where we benefited from the asset side. But as you know, we'll have to look at the ALM mix and it will be dependent on some of the market rates that we see going forward. So, unfortunately, there's not that much more clarity I can give you other than what is leading us as we go forward is largely that liability mix. And so that's the trend that will when we look out in the next couple of quarters is one of the biggest trends that will drive NII from here. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that. And then, I noticed, I know it can diverge sometimes, but the trends for firm-wide NII were different, down about $300 million quarter-over-quarter. So, could you help us maybe understand why was that the firm-wide NII deferred substantially from the Wealth Management trends? Sharon Yeshaya : Yes, that was largely just associated with the trading position. And as you know, it depends on many things, including what products you have, where they're booked, how they're booked and what type of instrument, and in addition, various types of funding costs. So, it's really the -- I think when we look and we manage the business specifically on the trading side given our portfolio and how we think about our bank versus just the broader broker dealer, et cetera, we don't manage it on an NII basis. When we're looking at NII, NII is clearly a driver from the Wealth Management side. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Another question on wealth and acknowledging the strong NNA number in aggregate. What do you think we need to see for the fee-based NNA to begin to get closer in size to the total NNA? And maybe what you think longer term that mix will look like? Sharon Yeshaya : Great question. We've looked a lot at fee based and thought about sort of as we think about the funnel. One thing that we highlighted to you last year, or last quarter rather, was that from the advisor-led side, we still had around 23% of those assets and cash and cash equivalents. That is a historical average of the last five years is around 18%. So, in our mind, a lot of it has to do with the way that people are looking at the markets right now. And the idea that when you're moving into a fee-based asset, specifically on the retail side, you are doing so and you're actually, obviously, actively investing in different market assets. And so what is encouraging is as I highlighted on, I think, to the question Glenn asked is that in the last month of the quarter, we began to see individual retail clients actually put that money into markets. So that's an encouraging sign, but we do think that a portion of that is market dependent. Dan Fannon : Understood. Thank you. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. Sharon, can you give us some color, when the E TRADE deal was closed, I think it was back in October of 2020, one of the real attractions, I think, for Morgan Stanley was the workplace channel. And you guys are, obviously, a dominant player in this workplace channel. Are there any metrics that you can share with us on the success you're having in increasing the penetration in that channel? Sharon Yeshaya : Yes. We've talked a lot in the last two quarterly updates around just the movement that we see in terms of channel migration is what we've called it. So, workplace assets that are then some portion of it is moved into the advisor-led side. And then, from that sort of as a core, you see assets held away beginning to come in. For the first three years that we had that, that number was around $150 billion, so call it $50 billion a quarter. And then, in the first quarter of this year, we were -- for that one quarter, we saw $28 billion. And when you look at the first half, we're largely running almost up to a full year rate of last year. And so, what that puts into account is we are seeing encouraging signs. We don't know exactly where that number will land, but obviously, it's trending in a good direction. And what it shows again is that workplace can begin to be sort of a seed to the conversation that people have with advisors. And you see that being 10%, 20% of the assets that are brought in through the migration, the other 80% or so are coming in from assets held away. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, James, just to circle back to the capital comments that you made with the Basel III Endgame and we've heard from some of your peers about the engagement with the regulators appears to be stronger this time maybe than in past. Can you share with us your feelings when you think about what you guys all went through post the financial crisis and the new regulations that came from Dodd Frank? Do you think the regulators are really listening to you folks more so this time than in the past, or is that not the case? James Gorman : Well, I think, Gerard, it's early. We need see the rule. The test -- there's one thing to listen and there's another thing to listen and act. The test is, once the regulatory community receives feedback from the industry groups, which are very coordinated, I will say, what input do they take into account? Frankly, how do we compare what the European banks have done on their own regulations? So, I think bringing the U.S. to sort of a gold plated European standard just doesn't feel to me like the right end outcome. I think we should do what's right for the U.S. financial system. Yes, I think they're listening. They've shown an interest in -- a strong interest in getting the feedback from the industry, the communities, the legislative bodies, et cetera. So -- but the proof will be in the putting. We'll find out over the next -- I don't know how long it will take the comment period. I'm assuming it could be a year or so. I mean, this is a big deal. Remember, Basel III Endgame first proposed in 2017, so it's taken six years to make its way in a small sailing boat across the Atlantic. And here it is. So, now we've got to decide what we like about, what we don't. So, I'm maintaining constructive tone, because I think everybody wants to end up in the right place. I don't happen to think and this is contrary to some people's views that the Silicon Valley, First Republic have a whole lot to do with this stuff, but that's a different discussion for later days. So, yes, I would hope and expect that they're going to listen, because they -- we should be listening to each other. Operator : For our next question, we'll move to Andrew Lim with SocGen. Please go ahead. Andrew Lim : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to circle back again on Basel III as well. So, I think your comments about European banks having maybe a bit more work to do, a lot of them are guiding towards impacts on the quantitative basis at the low end, sort of like below 50 basis points. So, I was just wondering if you saw something a bit more specific that might level the playing field for the European banks versus U.S. banks debate? And then, turning over to the U.S. banks, obviously, we're all familiar with the large impacts that have been talked about by Jerome Powell and Michael Barr. One of your competitors was a bit more forthcoming saying that that might allude to operational risk weighted assets being added to total, standardized risk weighted assets, which currently isn't the case under the standardized approach. So, I was wondering if you had any like specific thoughts about that, or whether you thought that was a bit more -- a bit less relevant given that, that would allude to legacy RMBS losses from many years ago. How do you think about that? James Gorman : Well, I'm not going to go into more detail about the European banks. I was just observing that the system was set up many years ago under Basel European banks, some of which are fully compliant with it and some are not yet. And the country system was set up in the U.S. of CCAR. So, we've actually had a capital stress test system for at least, I don't know, 12 years or something. So that was simply the observation. On the operational risk standardized approach to risk weighted assets, yes, actually that is very clearly going to be in the proposal. That is the Basel III proposal and that is going to be in the initial readout. I think, from the U.S. proposal, where that ends up, I've made my position very clear on that. But tying standardized RWAs to fee-based business is not -- just doesn't make sense to me. So, up until now we've had idiosyncratic evaluation of specific bank operational risk and the regulators are trying to move a standardized approach. How they get there, when we get there remains a lot to be seen. A lot of work to be done on that. Operator *: There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you everyone for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. Welcome to Morgan Stanley's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimers. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Morgan Stanley does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements in this discussion. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman. James Gorman : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks all for joining us. As anticipated, the market environment in aggregate remained mixed continuing a pattern we've seen over the past several quarters. Notwithstanding, the net result for Morgan Stanley was regenerated $13 billion, a little over $13 billion in revenues, $2.3 billion in net income, and ROTCE of 13.5%. The concerns around a tight employment market, high commodity prices, inflationary pressures that may impact Fed policy provide additional challenges later in the quarter. But we are seeing increasing evidence of M&A and underwriting calendars that are building and while we expect momentum to continue this year, given the fourth quarter has some seasonal considerations, we expect most of the activity to materialize in 2024. Meanwhile, it's our job to control what we can control. Firstly, we successfully completed the E-Trade integration this quarter. That was a massive undertaking, and the expenses relating to that have been bleeding through the P&L for a couple of years, it involved us migrating 14 million accounts onto our platform and honestly it went incredibly well, really a seamless performance by the team. This conversion allows us to further execute on our strategy, building our revenue synergies across channels, and attracting clients to our best-in-class advice offering. Secondly, on the capital front, we bought back 1.5 billion in stock. We averaged a nearly 4% dividend yield over the quarter, and at the same time, delivered a CET1 ratio of 15.5%, which is 260 basis points over our most recent regulatory requirement. We clearly have a significant capital buffer. Also, you saw the full details of the initial Basel III endgame proposal. As you all know, this is a proposal, not the final regulation. And I'm going to repeat that, it\u2019s a proposal. There is an enormous amount of energy being spent, conversations being had across industry groups and agency board members and I've been deeply involved myself along with Sharon Yeshaya and we've been told many times that the Federal Reserve strongly welcomes comments on this proposal. Given this, I anticipate that the agencies will be open to considering thoughtful changes before it's adopted as a final rule. But let me be crystal clear, because of the buffers we have built, even if this proposal were implemented today as written, we have adequate capital to meet the ultimate requirement. Needless to say there are many years between now and then. In the quarter, wealth management generated net new assets of $36 billion, that's obviously below recent quarters. It's consistent with what I've been saying for a long time. These numbers will bounce around and in any quarterly period, they're always idiosyncratic things. This year we've had two quarters where we had some surprise on the upside and in aggregate for the year, we're totally net new assets of $235 billion year-to-date. Our annualized growth rate is at the high end of the 5% to 7% range that we've been looking at. And it's consistent, in fact, it's spot on with our three-year target of a trillion dollars for net new money. Overall, this firm is in excellent shape, notwithstanding the geopolitical and market turmoil that we find ourselves in. My hope and expectation is to hand over Morgan Stanley with as clean as slate as possible and deal with a few of our outstanding issues in the next couple of months. I'm very excited about the future of this firm, its leadership, its strategy, and its culture. And I'll now turn it over to Sharon, who can discuss the quarter in greater detail. And then together, as always, we'll take your questions. Thank you. Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $13.3 billion in the third quarter. Our EPS was $1.38 and our ROTCE was 13.5%. Results in the third quarter were solid against a mixed market backdrop. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 75%. Together, severance and DCP impacted the year-to-date efficiency ratio by nearly 150 basis points. As we invest for growth, our integration efforts have remained a priority. Integration-related expenses were $68 million in the third quarter, and we anticipate a similar amount in the fourth quarter as previously communicated. Now to the businesses. Institutional securities revenues were $5.7 billion, declining 3% versus the prior year. Equity and fixed income results were in line with long-term historical averages. Investment banking revenues remained depressed on lower volume. However, leading indicators across advisory and underwriting progress positively, evidenced by a notable increase of Morgan Stanley's announced volumes in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. Investment banking revenues decreased to $938 million. The change to the previous year was driven by lower results in advisory and debt underwriting. Advisory revenues of $449 million reflected a decline in completed transactions, due to lower announced volumes in prior periods. Despite the weaker quarterly results, we continue to see broad sector diversification of our completed deals and the backlog reflects a similar pattern. Equity underwriting revenues were $237 million. Overall activity remained muted relative to historical averages. While increased confidence supported early September issuances, a hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve, and resulting moves in interest rates serve as a reminder that this market remains window-driven. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $252 million down versus the prior year, primarily reflecting lower non-investment grade events. We are encouraged by the growing client dialogue and bake-off activity across sectors and geographies. The pickup in our announced M&A volumes in the third quarter speak to the trends we've observed at the end of the last quarter. But the landscape continues to evolve. As we look ahead, corporate confidence will largely be determined by the overall health of the consumer and the stability of input costs. While risks remain, including geopolitical threats, the underlying trends suggest activity is building and there is a desire among clients to pursue their long-term strategic objectives. Equity revenues were $2.5 billion. The business performed in line with historical averages with relative strength in Europe and Asia. Prime brokerage revenues were solid. Client balances were modestly higher, compared to last year. The results reflect narrower spreads and the geographic mix of those balances. Cash revenues declined versus the prior year on lower overall global volumes. Derivative results increased year-over-year, reflecting higher client activity with particular strength in Europe. Fixed income revenues were $1.9 billion. Micro results increased versus the prior year, supported by strength in securitized products, both in agency and non-agency trading. Macro revenues decreased versus last year's elevated results with lower revenues and rates in foreign exchange. Results reflect lower client conviction, particularly around the future of central bank policy. Commodity revenues increase year-over-year on the back of a constructive trading environment, particularly for oil. Other revenues of $277 million improved versus last year, driven by lower mark-to-market losses on corporate loans, net of loan hedges, and higher net interest income and fees. Turning to ISG lending and provision. The allowance for credit losses in ISG loans and lending commitments increased slightly to $1.4 billion. In the quarter ISG provisions were $93 million. The increase was driven by a continued negative outlook for the commercial real estate sector. Net charge-offs were $39 million, primarily related to one commercial real estate loan in the office sector. Turning to wealth management, revenues of $6.4 billion were strong, an increase from the prior year. The growth of asset management revenues more than offset the cyclical declines in net interest income, underscoring their durability. As designed, our asset led strategy provides steady fee-based flows that support asset management revenues. With this in mind, we remain focused on asset migration into our advisor led channel. This quarter, our long-term strategy took a critical step forward as we completed the last major milestone of our E-Trade integration, successfully converting nearly $900 billion of client AUM onto the Morgan Stanley platform. This will continue to enhance our ability to introduce clients and advisors and seamlessly transition them into advice-based relationships. Moving on to the business metrics in the third quarter, pre-tax profit was $1.7 billion and the PBT margin was 26.7%. Integration expenses, as well as DCP negatively impacted the margin by approximately 150 basis points. Net new assets were $36 billion, bringing year-to-date NNA to $235 billion, which represents over 7% annualized growth of beginning period assets. Net new assets in the quarter were supported by new clients and positive net recruiting into the advisor led channel. The multi-year buildup of assets provide a foundational pipeline into our advisor led channel, evidence by fee-based flows of $22.5 billion in the third quarter alone. Asset management revenues of $3.6 billion increased 7% year-over-year. Higher average assets and the impact of cumulative positive fee-based flows over the past year drove the increase. Transactional revenues excluding DCP were $820 million, up 7% year-over-year. Results reflect opportunistic deployment of new capital by retail clients into alternatives, particularly into private equity and private credit. Bank lending balances roughly flat versus the prior quarter. Growth in mortgages and tailored lending offset paydowns and securities-based lending. Total deposits of $340 billion remain stable, compared to the prior quarter. Still, the deposit mix has shifted as clients continue to allocate rate-sensitive cash to higher-yielding cash alternatives available on the platform, including our expanded savings offering. In addition, the quarter saw consistent positive monthly inflows into equity markets from sweep balances, ongoing evidence of the improvement of the retail client sentiment. Net interest income was $2 billion. The sequential decline reflects a continued shift in the deposit mix. Looking towards the rest of this year, based on where we exited the quarter, we expect NII to trend lower. The magnitude will be a function of our deposit mix and the trajectory of rates. The wealth management business model is focused on steady asset aggregation, delivering strong solutions and advice to clients, while growing durable fees and expanding margin through the cycle. We are continuing to invest in our industry-leading position and the sustainability of our long-term growth. As the backdrop recovers, advisors remain well-positioned to capture greater asset opportunity supported by our multi-channel model that was built to attract new client relationships. Turning to investment management, revenues of $1.3 billion increased 14%, compared to the prior year, supported by higher asset management revenues. Total AUM ended at $1.4 trillion. Long-term net outflows of approximately $7 billion were driven predominantly by headwinds to our [Technical Difficulty] active equity growth strategies, which continue to see redemption consistent with the industry. Including the segment's outflows, year-to-date long-term flows across the franchise were slightly positive. Within alternatives and solutions, we continue to see demand for parametric customized portfolios across both equity and fixed income strategies, a partial offset to the headwinds of the quarter. Liquidity and overlay services had net flows of $5.7 billion, driven by demand for parametric institutional portfolio overlay solutions and our liquidity strategies. Specific to parametric and across the entire franchise, overlay and long-term net flows in the quarter were almost $7 billion, underscoring strong trends in this business. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion, up 3% year-over-year on higher average AUM. Performance-based income and other revenues were $24 million, supported by the diversification of our balance sheet light platform. Results were driven by gains in U.S. private equity, offset by weakness in Asia private equity and real estate. Our strategic focus on secular growth areas and the expansion of our global footprint remains in place. Ongoing investments in our businesses, including our market-leading parametric franchise, as well as our continued growth and innovation in private markets, position us well to best serve our clients. Turning to the balance sheet, our CET-1 ratio stands at 15.5%, roughly flat versus last quarter. Standardized RWA has declined sequentially to $445 billion, reflecting our ongoing prudent resource management and market movements at the end of the quarter. We continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, buying back $1.5 billion of common stock during the quarter. Taken in the context of the mixed environment, we are pleased with the firm's resiliency and our competitive positioning. As clients gain more conviction, we expect our institutional business to capture more opportunities, particularly in investment banking. This increased client conviction will also further support asset growth and wealth and investment management. We will continue to press our advantages and execute on our growth strategies all while currently managing our capital profile. With that, we will now open the line up to questions. Operator : We are now ready to take any questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research. Christian Bolu : Good morning, James and Sharon. I wanted to just touch on wealth management, a bit of a longer-term question here. As you mentioned, you've enjoyed really strong organic growth in that segment over the last few years. But it doesn't appear to be translating to revenue growth. If I look at the wealth management revenues excluding NII, it hasn't really grown in three years, despite gathering significant amount of assets? So curious how you're thinking about the flow through from AUM or asset growth to revenues? And then maybe more broadly how you're thinking about the unit economics of your asset gathering strategy? Sharon Yeshaya : Sure, actually I think that interestingly enough Christian I'm pretty impressed with the resiliency that we've seen in the business. This is literally the explanation of the funnel that we've talked about. If you look back over the course of the last year alone $260 billion or $235 billion of assets that we've captured. Then look at the fee-based flows, right? We continue to see increased fee-based flows. This past year, if you exclude the asset acquisitions that we had over the last couple of years, we are basically at some of the historical highs of seeing fee-based growth as we move forward. You're looking at times since COVID, where we obviously had very high retail engagement, and you've been able to offset, even with a decline in NII, offset those growths to asset-based, asset management revenues as you move forward. It's that, that we are trying to grow. We're trying to continue to grow our asset management fees over time and make sure that we have the right solutions in place to offer our clients. Now let's take that forward. We have this mixed environment. You have 23% of our retail client assets sitting in cash, that is 5% higher, right, from the 18% on historical averages. We've begun to see retail investors put their cash into markets. The last four months -- in consecutively, we've seen that movement into the market. This quarter alone, we began to see alternative growth in the new products, the growth in transactional revenues. We haven't seen that since the first quarter of 2022 before you started this rate hike cycle. So in my mind, actually the strategy is working pretty darn well, especially if you think about how we've been able to aggregate assets, migrate them into fee-based flows, look at transactional and see that growth -- and see growth in these new products and deliver them to our clients, all while these clients have dry powder to invest as these markets turn. Christian Bolu : Okay, thanks, Sharon. Maybe my follow-up is just thinking about your ROTCE targets over time of 20%. You know, the quarter is fine, 14% is nothing to sniff at, but it is some ways off that 20%. How should we think about the bridge from here? I know you've mentioned investment banking, but it seems like a fairly small part of your business. So what's the bridge to 20%? How much of it is macro? How much of it is self-help? And for what is macro, what sort of operating backdrop are you looking for? Thank you. James Gorman : Well, Christian, maybe I take that given Sharon just pummeled you and I want to give you a little bit of a break here. By the way, the only thing I'd add to what Sharon said is when people have a choice of making a 4%, 5% return by doing nothing, they're not going to be trading in the other market. So the actual secondary lines in the revenues of the lowest I've seen for years in the last couple of years as rates do eventually come down, they will come down, I don't think next year, but they'll come down after that. You'll see more activity in that regard and actually you'll see more money go up in the sweep. So interestingly, there's kind of an optimal point where rates are attractive for investors, but not so high they keep them out of the market and not so high that there isn't money kept on sweep. So very different from the checking account phenomenon you see at some of the commercial banks. But back to the 20%, I mean, I just say, as you know, we actually, we were at 20%. So it's not -- this is not a -- this would not be a remarkable achievement. It's a bit like when I first came to Morgan Stanley and people asked me if the wealth management business could generate, in those days 15% margins. And I said, well, there are two people already doing it, so it's pretty obvious it can be done. So we've done it and nothing structural has changed. If anything, the firm's got stronger, we've been investing a lot. I mean, this E-Trade deal was, you know, it was a lot of investment to get that integration done. We decided to keep investing through the cycle on the funnel and wealth, because we think over the next 10-years that's going to pay monster dividends. The integration across all the Eaton Vance platforms, they were never really integrated as one platform across the different, you know, Atlanta, Calvert, Parametric and Eaton Vance and now sorting through all of that, which Dan has done a great job of doing. And then frankly, banking has been really weak. I mean, under a billion dollars is evidence of a very weak calendar and very weak M&A. And the pipeline we saw this quarter was really strong. So I don't think the announcements won't translate into revenues in Q4, but they will in Q1, Q2 next year. So just on the math, I think if we're running about $2.2 billion we'd have to generate about another $700 million net a quarter. Just on the expense management, we could do things on expenses easily, more than we've done. And you could get a couple of hundred million from that. And then on the revenue side, as banking recovers, some of the transaction stuff we just talked about and Sharon pointed out, these assets moving into a pneumatized product. And then I think Fed will move up from this point. You pretty easily get to the 20%. So I appreciate the question and I'm not concerned about that long-term outlook. I think it's -- as it has happened and will happen again and frankly won't be that long. Operator : We'll go Next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thank you. Sharon, first one on wealth management and NII. I mean, the trends I think are in the range of what's been happening across the industry. So not overly surprising. But I'm curious if you could break down even qualitatively how much of that sweep movement is coming in historical mortgage family versus E-Trade? I'm just trying to see what type of client is moving? And then to go back, you piqued my interest, James, in the comment you just made about not next year, but maybe after that. What conditions do you think we need to see for wealth management NII to stable and grow? Sharon Yeshaya : So let's take the first question, which is the two different types of deposit mix. You're right, you know, from a -- if you think about the self-directed client versus a advisory-based client that we've had in the historical wealth management franchise, one has proven to be somewhat of a stickier deposit base than you would see on the wealth management side. And I think that, you know, on the -- what I would say is the traditional wealth management side that we had historically had. So that does provide you with a sense of what's going on in terms of which client base is seeing that. On the potential growth of NII going forward, again, that's part of the same asset gathering strategy. Some proportion of these assets as they come over, be that into the self-directed or the advice-based relationship, will be held in some sort of transactional cash. So that will be supportive over time of NII to some degree from a deposit perspective. But that also provides us with lending capabilities and opportunities. As you know, Glenn, we've seen tremendous, what we would call, sort of, household penetration in being able to offer new lending products to our various client bases, obviously with the SBL product. But we continue to see mortgages and growth in mortgages even in this right environment for new purchases and homes. As we better understand our client base, we're able to do that more. And actually bringing together this E-Trade acquisition, putting everything on the same portfolio and the same franchise from a technology perspective is foundational and being able to integrate all of those bank relationships and what we used to call the bank rails that E-Trade had for a broader wealth offering that should also help support NII as we look into the future. James Gorman : I think I don't know. On the second bit, I just think there's an optimal point. I mean, we went from zero rates to 5% in effectively the fastest period since the 60s, early 70s, fastest rate increase. What's remarkable is we haven't had a recession, by the way, but -- and I personally don't think we're going to. But with that, I mean, if you're an advisor and you've got a client sitting on a lot of cash earnings zero, I would hope you're telling them to put it in treasuries or something. So that's exactly what's happened. At around 2% to 3%, it becomes a different kind of discussion. So I think there's a trigger point and you're seeing it across, as you said, the whole industry and that's why you're seeing a different behavior set for people in checking accounts where they haven't gone to buy the money sitting in the checking account. If they're not paying attention, they're still getting, I don't know, 20 basis points or something. So as rates come down, the total cash we have in the book, which is 23%, will be coming down anyway, because it's just -- that's an abnormality related to where rates are right now. As rates come down over the next couple of years, you're actually going to see people much less price sensitive on what they're generating in a return on the cash and just using it as a liquidity account to manage investments going in and out. So I think in some ways we overachieved relative to our particular business mix. So I'm quite encouraged about the future because of that. And think, in fact, you're hearing some of that language coming out of the banks where they said, I forget what the words some of the other CEOs said, but it was effectively the same. They've overachieved in that it's sitting in checking accounts and they're making an enormous amount of money on that, but that's unsustainable. We've overachieved in that rates are so high, everybody wanted to be in cash, earning not cash sitting dormant. I don't know if that makes sense to you, Glenn. By the way I have to say I did love your comment about, you know, Paul talked about green shoots, somebody forgot to water them. I'd give you that one. Glenn Schorr : That's better than a pummel. Thank you. Onde quick one, maybe I'll get the pummel on this one. I know it's the board decision, but the longer the CEO transition announcement takes place, is there any timeframe where it starts to put more strain on the organization or become a distraction as every reporter in the world is writing on it every day? James Gorman : Yes, about three years from now. No, wait, listen, Glenn, come on. We said I will not be CEO, I said at the annual meeting I wouldn't be CEO within a year. And I said that for a very simple reason that people didn't believe that I was going to leave because apparently bank CEOs don't. And I said I would and when I say I'm going to do something, I'm definitely going to do it. I would leave at the earliest possible moment that the board feels comfortable making that decision. And I've made that very clear to them. I think they've done a terrific job. Now that you've opened up the question, I'll answer it more broadly. They've done a terrific job. Dennis Nally and the succession comp committee and Tom Glocer, lead director on the board, all the directors engaged, really thorough process. And I don't want to give you an exact time, because that's sort of a spoiler. I already did that apparently talking about Logan Roy once. But we\u2019re -- shall I say we're well into it. And I do believe there are diminishing returns at some point in time. We're not there. The team is doing great. The businesses are moving forward. But yes, I want to get out of the seat and give somebody else a chance to see what they can do with it. And I think there's a lot of things, the growth opportunities in this company, now that we've set it up with so many planks that are solid, you have an abundance of choices. And I just, you know, just look at what we've done with MUFG in Japan, the so-called 2.0 that you know, Ted has been driving with Hero, the CEO of MUFG of taking our Japanese business with them to a completely different level and I think there's a lot of things we can do with them in Japan strategically taking advantage of the turnaround of the Japanese economy. That's just one example. So yes, we're getting close. I'm certainly not a barrier to it. I'm a -- I don't know if the word's enabler, but I'd like to get on with it, and I'll help in the transition as Executive Chairman for a bit, and this place will go forth and thrive. Operator : We'll go next to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. I guess, I just wanted to follow-up on something you said, James, around the optimal level of rates, and you talked about NII. But if the Fed were to hike a few more times, or if rates stay at these levels for longer, is there an argument to be made that just structurally the business will be challenged until we get to the other side of the rate cycle, given just client assets probably remain in lower spread products? Just talk to us in terms of how you think about if rates don't get cut, is that a headwind to the business until we get to the other side? James Gorman : No, I definitely don't think there's a structural issue. I mean, my goodness, the business is generating, I'm talking about wealth 26% margins with the various costs in there, and I think it's 28% Sharon without them. If you'd told me a few years ago, I mean, I thought we'd get to 28%, but pretty much nobody else in the world did. So, no, there's no structural issue here -- there. I'm just saying as a -- and I do think if, at the risk of making prediction, I suspect the Fed will do one more rate increase at some, you know, by the end of the year, I guess November. But that's likely to be it. And I do not expect the Fed to cut rates in 2024, but I do expect going forward after that. So given that, we're talking about 12-months. The cash is largely moved. It's moved, you know, on the margin you're going to have a little bit of NII impact over the next 12-months, but that's really not the real game. The real game is go forward after that. So, and the minute you see the Fed indicate they've stopped raising rates, the M&A and underwriting calendar will explode, because there is enormous pent-up activity. But Boards of directors are sitting there and saying, until we understand the cost of financing, it is very difficult to pull the trigger on some of these capital transactions. So I think you're heading into, and unfortunately I'm not going to be around to enjoy it, but you're heading into a really good patch here. And I don't know if it's six months out or nine months out or it starts three months out, but this thing is going to start turning and then rates will be the kick when they start coming down. And as I said people will be less focused on cash and accounts and more focused on investment opportunities, that's when you're going to see the double kicker. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. I guess a good time for you to hand off. Your successor will be thanking you for that. But a quick question\u2026 James Gorman : I hope so. Ebrahim Poonawala : I think, Sharon, you mentioned about focus on secular growth, I think international expansion, E-Trade is done now. I'm assuming you're not doing any big M&A anytime soon. Just talk to us about international expansion, a lot of disruption on wealth management, private banking globally, what the opportunities are, where we are investing. We'd love some color around that? Sharon Yeshaya : Investing more broadly internationally, James mentioned the deals or what we've been working on, I should say, MUFG 2.0 between research and also our sales and trading side. We continue to look for opportunities. We have Arun Kohli, who's been working on our India franchise. I think that there are clearly opportunities there. Within India, we see a lot of opportunities throughout Asia. We've discussed different opportunities also all across the international franchise in Europe. So when you look at, think about investment management. That was one of the key points that we had talked about potential distribution of investment management Eaton Vance products all over Europe. We've seen that. We continue to see products with Calvert, with various active ETFs that we're seeing all across Europe again. And we've been raising new AUM there. So there are ways to distribute product across different geographies. There's a way to work with our strategic partners in places like Japan. There are ways to organically take advantage and move forward in places of growth that have more secular growth trends such as India. So there are tremendous opportunities where we see that we can take, like I said, product-client relationship and also work across institutional securities and various places in investment management. Dan Simkowitz has talked a lot about that of raising funds through those partnerships and being able to look for ways to work together to also source talent internationally as we work across the organization. James Gorman : And I just said, I mean, I was in the Middle East a few months ago, we're opening an office in Abu Dhabi. If you think of the combination Middle East, India, Japan, kind of, offsetting what's going on in China. And then strategically, I would be very surprised if this firm doesn't do some transactions in both wealth and asset management over the next three years outside the U.S. I think we have a game plan for it. Strategically, the team has worked on a lot of ideas. And obviously, we want to make sure when we do it, we're, you know, we're fully ready and we understand all of the, you know, the diligence issues around some of these relationships and careful about that, but I think the opportunities are clearly there. Operator : We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Thanks, good morning. I wanted to follow-up on flows. Obviously feed-based flows strong in the quarter, but the total flow number came in and understanding the environment was a bit softer here in the third quarter? Could you maybe talk about the channels where the pullback was seen the most? You didn't mention workplace, so I'm not sure you would love some color there as well? Sharon Yeshaya : Yes, we've talked -- thanks Dan for the question. We have talked about the fact that within the workplace channel, I think both in the first and second quarter, I've been asked about it. And it is people are using some of that cash. We aren't necessarily seeing that movement directly into people's accounts and they're seeing actual, you know, taking the stock that they might get and actually selling it rather than investing on it, given what's going on with the economic environment, potentially inflation, et cetera. So that's, you know, potentially a theme out there. But obviously, that's dependent on the market. What is more exciting in my mind is actually where we did see the increase in NNA, which was on new clients and recruiting. So those were the two strongest components. And the ability to attract new clients, I've said it before on these calls, if you asked me five years ago, well before we bought E-Trade and when we were just looking at the beginning of the modern wealth platform, many people ask how will you ever grow, because we weren't seeing new clients coming into the institution. The investments that we've made across the technology for wealth management has been what's been able to attract new recruits. So if you talk to recruits about why they come to Morgan Stanley, it's the projects they can offer, it's the technology that we have, it's the ability to work with the clients. So you're seeing that continue and then you're also seeing new client acquisition through the funnel. So those are all positive metrics. And again, you see that in the stock plan participants rising as well. Dan Fannon : Great, thank you. And then just a follow-up on investment banking and understanding the environment isn't ideal, but you did talk about increase in announcements. So I was hoping you could provide some context maybe on the sponsor community and maybe how those conversations are happening? And just overall backlog levels versus kind of last quarter. Sharon Yeshaya : Yes, the backlog itself, we've continued to rise and to build. Overall, over the course of the year, we've talked a lot about sort of being at some of the highest levels that we've seen across all of the underwriting or on the advisory side. So all of that is optimistic. Financial sponsors, we have talked about dry powder, continue to see that. Obviously, there was some valuation gaps and as James said, the more clarity that we see around the stabilization of rates, the easier that will be around deployment. And then some key themes that we have witnessed when we look at the backlog or we think about the transactions that are happening. One is the financial sector consolidation, that's a theme that's emerging within our pipeline and our discussions in the boardroom. The second is the energy transitions. That, again, that is important to some of the transactions that we have worked on and that we've talked through. And in addition to that, we are seeing emerging themes around technology, around AI, around how companies want to use that when they're thinking about strategic focus and objectives. And all of these themes are part and parcel to the fact that you can see there\u2019s -- it's a diversified backlog. And we're investing in the franchise. We've made some key hires to help us navigate through this more complex landscape and places where we see opportunities to execute as we move forward. Operator : We'll go next to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning, James. Good morning, Sharon. James Gorman : Good morning. Sharon Yeshaya : Good morning. Steven Chubak : So I wanted to start with a question on just the expense and margin outlook. Expenses were actually well managed in the quarter. But one of your peers did talk about competition intensifying in terms of the war for talent within investment banking and trading. It feels like that's been the case for the better part of a number of years in wealth management. And I was hoping you could just speak to your expense growth outlook and your confidence in terms of your ability to achieve the firm-wide margin target of 30%? Sharon Yeshaya : So, when you think about the expenses, we have been looking at expenses through the cycle. We've unfortunately, you know, we have taken actions. We took actions both at the end of last year and then we took one in the spring as well. We've discussed those severance costs throughout the course of the year. And so we've been managing our expense base to better understand and to sort of think about it against the backdrop of what environment are we seeing. So while there is -- there is always a war for talent. We do pay for talent and we pay competitively for that talent, but we have to think about it in the context of where we see the potential growth opportunities. And that is also, we have to take into account the investments that we're making. And that's around processes and investing in technology. And when you look at the technology that we're investing in, we should see operating efficiencies and leverage as you go forward. So that's modernization of the plant. You're going to have optimization, and you're also going to work on things like making sure that you have the right risk and control framework to give ourselves an opportunity to grow. So just what it means to boil it down is it's a balance, right, of investing for the future, but also making sure that you have the right expense base, rather, as you move forward and you can take advantage and see those efficiency gains. And really the operating leverage that James is talking about as we move forward through the cycle. James Gorman : I'll just say one thing on the war for talent. Yes, I mean, obviously, really high performers are in demand across the street. But we've actually had the opposite issue. We've had very low attrition, which is why we did some of the expense initiatives that Sharon talked about. And I guess we should feel flattered. It's a reflection of the culture and the stability of the firm. But also, that's why we took the initiatives, because you've got to bring in talented people and new generations to keep growing this place. So one's these and two's these, yes, you can lose somebody, a senior person here or there and we've hired a bunch in banking insurance, but the broader across the 80,000 people we've got is the broader messages attrition has been remarkably low and that's something that, you know, we just got to work through. Steven Chubak : That\u2019s great and for my follow-up just a question on capital, James you noted that pro forma Basel III endgame, your capital requirements approximate your current capital base. How much capital cushion do you plan on running with? Also, how it informs your buyback? And you addressed a question on ROTCE targets, curious about 20% target contemplates higher capital under Basel III. So I know there's a lot in there, capital cushion, buyback level 20% ROTCE target? James Gorman : I'm going to have to write this down. There's an old guy, there's a lot to remember. It's not going to affect ROTCE. We're not going to be increasing capital. So that one you can put to bed. The cushion, you know, it's a function where the rules come out. I mean, I've been very clear about this day one. I do not believe the proposal as is will be what we see when the comment period is over. I do not believe that. I have no special insight except that obviously I spent a lot of time with the regulatory community, which I've done for 14-years. I think everybody understands for example the way operating risk RWAs have been calculated in a sort of blunt instrument based on fees is not, you know, it wasn't what Basel was originally going to do though. We're going to take that rule out years ago. And they ended up just not getting around to it. And suddenly we're complying with something that they didn't even want and don't, you know, they don't use in Europe. So it\u2019s not that -- it\u2019s just not going to happen the way it is. And that's not being pollyannaish. That's just, that's my judgment call. That said, what we want to frame with investors is, god forbid, it does happen exactly as is. The rule becomes proposal rule tomorrow, then we're fine. So we're certainly not going to be raising capital. We're going to continue with our buyback through this period. The final implementation of this thing is going to be 2028. You know, there's a lot that's going to happen between now and then. But listen, this is the first time you've had members of the Fed Board and the FDIC, I think, come out in advance of a rule being promulgated, if that's the word, saying that they're not comfortable with it. So there's clearly debate within the regulatory institutions. And if you get past the -- why we need more capital, which I don't think the industry does, into well what should it be, the only place it clearly shouldn't be is punishing businesses that have fees attached to them, whether it's credit cards or wealth management, that's not the regulatory intent. And they've told me that and therefore I believe that will change. So on the cushion it's frankly a function of, you know, where the rule ends up. We'll carry whatever appropriate prudent cushion we need to carry. On do we create more capital? No, not unless we grow the business to reflect that, that we can put it to work. And thirdly, will we continue buybacks? Yes, and I'm sure Sharon can give more play from what we think about on the buyback side and dividends for that matter. Sharon Yeshaya : Yes, on the capital return strategy, we've been really clear that we expect to continue to return capital to our shareholders. Dan said that at the September conference, even when you think about all Basel, we first and foremost, we've talked about the dividend strategy. We doubled our dividend a few years ago and we've continually increased the dividend. That increase has been reflective of the growth and stable revenues that we've had more broadly as an institution. Then, of course, buyback, we're committed to a buyback, but the size of a buyback is always going to be opportunistic when you think about what the alternatives are for capital usage, right? So what are the opportunities that we see going forward and will make the right decision for what we think the right decision is for the company and for our shareholders around the uses of the capital. But we increased the buyback this quarter. So that shows you sort of how we feel about being able to return capital to our shareholders when you compare this quarter over the course of last quarter, moving from $1 billion to $1.5 billion dollars. Operator : We'll go next to Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Devin Ryan : Thanks. Good morning. I guess first question just on the E-Trade conversion, I'm sure good to get on the other side of that. And you spoke to some of the benefits, I think more on the flow side and revenue side. Just curious if there's any -- in a more material expense saving opportunities, just assuming there's probably some redundancies there that can be removed, and then any other efficiencies that might exist? Sharon Yeshaya : Look, we haven't really -- this deal was never contemplated from a cost synergy perspective. It's really been around revenue synergies. Will there be potential savings on the margin? It's possible. But that's not really the point of the transaction. What I think is more fundamentally interesting is that a couple of things when you think about the E-Trade integration, other than the fact that it went very smoothly as it relates to the clients themselves, it creates a really clear foundation when we're trying to migrate clients from channels and move them. So give somebody from an E-Trade channel or a self-directed channel and say, let's make an introduction to an FA and begin that potential migration. If you're on the same platform, it's a much easier and much more seamless transition. So that's a positive use of that. That's an example of how being on the same platform is helpful. The same goes for workplace, right? Everything flows into the same places. Again, that should be helpful as we move forward. It's also very helpful from a bank rails perspective. So as we think about banking products, as you can use, remember E-Trade had bank rails on their platform. Again, a lot of that can be used as we are now looking to potentially grow portions of the bank or grow lending or grow deposits. Those are all things that now that the platforms are put together on a consolidated basis. So I would look at it more from a revenue synergy perspective than necessarily a cost synergy perspective. Devin Ryan : Okay, terrific. Thanks, Sharon. Quick follow-up here just on an interest income trajectory in GWM. So, we can make some assumptions around the trajectory of deposits, but how should we be thinking about the asset yield trajectory from here if we use the forward curve? I guess what are some of the puts and takes to be thinking about there? Sharon Yeshaya : Yes, again, so when I look -- I would look at the movement sweeps, if you're trying to draw a relationship between sweeps and NII really over the last two quarters, the asset yields are going to be a function of what the market yields are. Last quarter, for example, I mentioned that we had the NII was supported by higher asset yields. You'll remember that when we walked out of the first quarter, we were in a position where there was still a regional banking crisis. Some of the yields were higher, as you think about funding yields, simply because of what was going on in the environment. As those yields normalized, that came down, you lost some of that asset yield, and you began to see what we, you know, a different kind of, the deposits themselves had a bigger, more prominent reaction when you look at a sequential change in NII. So what I would try and do is you should take both quarters, for example, into consideration when you're thinking about the relationship between sweeps in NII. And of course, asset yields will be determined by market factors more broadly. Operator : We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, James and Sharon. Thanks for taking my questions. Would like to start, you know, similar to that last question. So there's clearly uncertainty, but also it seems equally clear that NII is no longer a tailwind for wealth. So when you're thinking about the 30% pre-tax margin target that you've provided for that business? How do you think, what are your plans given that tailwind may be turning into a headwind or at least moderating? And how are you calibrating any planned investment and balance that out with the potential for growth on the back of that? Sharon Yeshaya : Thanks for the question, Brennan. As you would expect, it's a balance, right? We've made changes to our expense base over the course of this year, but we want to make sure that we're investing for long-term growth by being able to offer both technology, platforms, solutions, et cetera, so that our advisors. The most important thing about the investment is to create opportunities where the advisors have more time. More time that the advisors have, the more they're able to prospect new business and bring new assets to the top of the funnel. So that's how we're prioritizing the investments in order to get the operating leverage as the market begins to turn. Brennan Hawken : Well, but -- okay so do you have enough? Is that lever large enough? Are you going to be able to or willing to dial back investments in order to support moving towards that 30% pre-tax margin even without NII tailwinds? Sharon Yeshaya : We would see ourselves in a position -- we're not -- we have put out those targets and we have been, it's not that there is a shot clock in terms of the timing of those targets spread in. The goal is to create a business model that has the opportunity to do that on a more sustained basis. And the way that one is to do that from an asset-led strategy is to grow the asset management revenue streams and the transactional streams. And that's what you're seeing over the course of this quarter alone. You're able to grow assets. You're able to deploy those assets into different transactional products, which helps the transactional line. And eventually, it also moves into the advice-based relationship product, which has a higher annuity stream as well. And so that's the strategy, and you're seeing it play out as we move forward. James Gorman : I just point out, Brennan, I mean, on $6.5 billion of revenue, the deficit against the 30% long-term target is currently about $120 million, $130 million. So this is not, you know, we're talking less than 2%. We're already at 28% ex-integration cost. They could take 2% of the cost out of that business tomorrow and hit that number, so this is not you know back in the day when we were talking about 20% margin and we were at 8% that was you know when certain people were skeptical about that. We're in a whole different league now. 28% can go to 30%. We can make that happen. What we want to make sure is we make happen the growth over the next several years. So it is not a heavy lift. I'm not worried about that at all. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thank you for that. If you could, Sharon, maybe just one more clarification, because you talked about the asset side and looking at market yields. What's the duration that we should be thinking about if we're trying to calibrate? Because the disclosure on the asset side for the wealth is not as robust. We have to kind of use a couple creative metrics within the filings? Sharon Yeshaya : In general, when you're talking about the AFS portfolio, the duration of the AFS portfolio is under 2. But what you have to think about is just the deposits themselves and what's going on with right now when we look at it. We're slightly still asset sensitive, but of course if rates rise, the deposit duration also shortens. So I just think you have to think about, you know, you're taking all things into consideration as you move forward, given the cycle. James Gorman : We're going to try and get in the last three questions quickly here, so we might run five minutes over. Operator : We'll go next to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Jim Mitchell : Hey good morning. Maybe just pivoting to the trading business, fixed trading, up sequentially a bit unusual in a seasonally slow third quarter. So maybe just talk a little bit about the drivers, how sustainable you think they are, at least in the near-term and maybe overall thoughts on industry wallet into next year? Sharon Yeshaya : Yes, it's a great question. When you look at what's gone on in terms of the industry wallet, we talked a lot about 2019 and 2020 being bookends. Obviously, you are above the 2019 wallet more broadly, and you see this playing out, because things like fixed income, you do have more central bank action, and you do have more broadly associated vol when you think about pre-COVID levels. So all that is fundamentally positive. In terms of specifically the trading businesses, you had movements like I said in commodities, oil, that ability to capture vol, it's really around being there for our clients, but having greater velocity of sheet. And the more that we're able to do that as we move forward, we restructured this business tremendously over the course of the last eight, nine years. And it's being there to be able to serve our clients and using our resources to some degree more effectively and efficiently. Jim Mitchell : Okay, great. That's it for me. Thanks. James Gorman : Thanks, Jim. Operator : We'll go Next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi, one kind of positive question, one negative question, maybe James. When you think of the permanent improvement from 2019 levels pre-pandemic, how much higher do you think global wallet shares should be for both investment banking and trading? Like as you look out over three to five years, is this 2019 the normal or should it be above that? Because we're drifting back, global wallet share is drifting back toward 2019 and although you know the big U.S. bank is staying above that? And then the negative question is just NII is down 9% quarter-over-quarter wealth and kind of what are you guiding for that to be down and when do you think that will be in flex? Thanks. James Gorman : Sure. I think the wallet -- global wallet will trend higher than 19%. I think you're at a, right now we're obviously had an extreme low on the banking side and trading is kind of muted. I mean fixed income, yes we had a sequential nice run, equities at 3.5%, these are nowhere near top levels. I don't see any of the global competitors challenging the top of the U.S. tree, the top three or four firms. So and I think what's going on, as I said earlier, with the Middle East and India, Japan, parts of LATAM , you're going to see non-U.S. growth over the next several years. So, yes, I feel actually really pretty good about the outlook. And I'll let Sharon, I think we've touched on a lot of the NII stuff. And obviously, you can't model this stuff. You don't know exactly how people behave, because it's a function of how they feel about where rates are and other opportunities at any point in time. But Sharon? Sharon Yeshaya : Yes, we're not given 2024 guidance right here. What we did say is that the next quarter, we have said, will be lower. And that's a function, mathematically, of the exit rates of deposits where we entered the quarter. But what is encouraging is that as we ended September and then we looked into October, client behavior is in line with our modeled expectations. Operator : We'll move on to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, Sharon. Good morning, James. I'll just ask a single question in view of the time. Can you guys give us a view of the outlook for your mergers and acquisitions, your appetite? Obviously, James, over your tenure you guys have done a number of successful acquisitions and as you look out over the next three to five years. I know James you won't be here, but what's the appetite? Is it still something opportunistic if something comes up? It seems like you have all your products lined up by channel, but can you get economies of scale by buying some competitors in different channels? Thank you. James Gorman : Definitely the latter. It's not just opportunistic, it\u2019s strategic in that we have a game plan. We just completed an offsite about a month ago with the whole operating committee and each of the leaders that you know all about, Ted Andy and Dan, we're heavily engaged in that from the business side. I think, you know, there are lot of things -- there are a lot of interesting properties in this world and we've got a machine, Jim Hennessy, I'll give a call out to him, he led the integration of E-Trade, he actually led the integration going all the way back to Smith Barney, 100s of people that work on that. So we've got an integration machine. I mean, you start with, do you have a vision of what the company should look like? And then do you have a set of strategic options, which if available, you would hit the bid? Then the opportunistic is when they become available, like in advance, did you hit the bid? But the real issue is, can you integrate them safely and securely? And then finally, having done that, will that drive growth above the current run rate? So that's how we think about acquisitions. The team is very weighted behind it, but I don't know Sharon if you want to add anything to that, but yes this firm will do sensible, you know, not reckless, not life-changing, but sensible deals as we've done you know we've done many of them Mesa West, Solium and there'll be -- there's a lot of opportunity out there, Gerard. I think that's a wrap. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for everyone for participating.

The reconciliations of these non-GAAP adjusted operating performance metrics are included in the notes to the presentation or the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to chief executive officer Ted Pick. Ted Pick : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. It is a privilege to be with you. Today, I will deliver the annual deck that was a hallmark of James Gorman's 14-year tenure, both to affirm Morgan Stanley's strategy and to provide a level of transparency on our progress that you have come to respect. Let's turn to the slides. Turning first to Slide 3, over the last 15 years, we have transformed the firm's business mix, scale, profitability and returns. If you compare various historical periods, you can see our business evolution. Each period faced its own challenges. In 2009 to '14, Morgan Stanley was a classic self-help story. Transformation began with the acquisition and integration of Smith Barney. The investment bank was reset, and the firm survived the near triple credit downgrade and the euro crisis. In 2015 to '19, we weathered the years of financial repression, resizing our fixed income business and pressing ahead to the top slot in institutional equities. During this period, we also acquired Solium, which was a step toward leadership in the corporate stock plan space. Then in 2020 to '22, the COVID years, we achieved incremental scale in both wealth and investment management with the acquisitions of E TRADE and Eaton Vance, giving us a leading self-directed platform and pushing forward in investment solutions. During this period, each of the two major business lines -- wealth and investment management and institutional securities generated operating leverage and high returns. Transformed Morgan Stanley today has tripled client assets in its durable businesses with significant opportunities for further growth. Notwithstanding 2023's geopolitical, macroeconomic and industry challenges, the firm's business model generated consistent results. In 2023, firm revenues were $54 billion with $12 billion of PBT, double the averages of 2009 to '14. Our return on tangible common equity was a solid 13%, inclusive of notable items that reduced returns by over 100 basis points. Last year's return profile was tripled the post crisis years. Combined earnings from wealth and investment management generated 60% of the firm's top line and PBT, and our category of one asset gathering strategy sets the stage for continued durable growth. The institutional securities business also grew over the transformation years with an eye to investing in its leading franchises. The objective has been to create an integrated investment bank of investment banking, equities and fixed income to serve leading institutions around the world. Taken together, the Morgan Stanley business portfolio of today has well higher and more stable profitability. The actions we have taken over the last 15 years, organic and inorganic, were all within our core strategic footprint. At its center is acting as a trusted advisor to clients, helping them raise, allocate and manage capital. It is what we do. We are a global leader and we are really good at it. This will not change. Turning to Slide 4, since 2010, revenues and wealth and investment management have more than doubled, and today we are number one in the world among our peers. During the same period, our client assets have more than tripled to $6.6 trillion. We see continued opportunities to drive growth and are steadfast in our goal of reaching $10 trillion in total client assets. In wealth management, we have established ourselves as a leading asset gatherer by expanding our business model across three channels -- advisor led, self-directed and workplace. The business generated $1 trillion of net new assets over the past three years, and we are relentlessly focused on sustainable growth. We expect NNA growth to continue to vary quarter by quarter, given seasonality and even year to year given market tone and the cadence of migrating workplace assets and attracting assets held away. We are nevertheless confident in our ability to continue to grow and deepen our 18 million relationships with the breadth of our wealth management offering. Over time, our ability to track, deepen and retain client relationships with our differentiated platform allows us to drive revenue growth and operating leverage, enabling 30% margins. Given some of the recent macro headwinds in our continued investments for growth, it's reasonable to expect reported margins to consolidate in the mid-20s range over the near term. The underlying business has achieved 30% margins before, and we intend to deliver that return profile again in the long term against a higher base of revenue. Our wealth platform is complemented by investment management, where we've added a number of new capabilities to our strong public market alpha engines. This business is well aligned to key areas where we see secular growth, including customization such as parametric, private markets and value add credit. At a holistic level, the wealth and investment management business has achieved the kind of scale which enables us to invest in what matters most to clients and to take further market share through cycles. Turning to Slide 5. Morgan Stanley's Institutional Securities Group, our Integrated Investment bank is a preeminent global franchise. Our capability set, extensive client footprint and premier brand put us in a position to be the trusted advisor to every important corporation, public or private, asset manager and asset owner. Our teams across geographies, businesses and client segments position us at the center of global capital allocation and formation. Over the last decade, we have advised on nearly $9 trillion in M&A transactions, raised nearly $13 trillion of capital for clients and as indication of our market's presence. In a single trading session last month, our equities business transacted roughly $250 billion of notional value. Our leadership position outside the U.S., acting as a true global investment bank, is critical for the Morgan Stanley franchise. After more than five years managing our integrated investment bank, I'd add that it is clear from client visits around the world that the barriers to entry to becoming a global investment bank are real. Today, there are fewer competitors, and we are one of those very few who can provide the full breadth of capabilities. We expect the next economic and financial cycle to be led by corporate finance activity which will drive investment banking growth, and as such are particularly focused on expanding our 15% world share in that advice driven business. Turning to Slide 6. When you combine our wealth and investment management platform with our leading institutional franchise, you see the power of what we will call the integrated firm. Our capacity to source new client opportunities efficiently facilitates the flow of capital and deliver Morgan Stanley's firmwide Solutions has never been stronger. Looking at the right side of the slide, more specifically, our premier corporate franchise spans every business segment, with clients at the center of everything we do. We cover their broad range of needs, from advising the C suite on strategy, to helping them raise capital and hedge risks, on through to advising the broader employee base through our workplace offering. Second, we have a unique capability to serve individuals who range from self-directed, up through to the ultra-high net worth set and small institutions who sit between the traditional segments. We can deliver best-in-class institutional capabilities paired with sophisticated wealth management solutions in an integrated service model. Third, we continue to invest in our ability to deliver investment and client solutions as we are at the center of financial innovation and growth. Our global integrated investment bank is core to our ability to source and structure customized opportunities for corporations and financial sponsors. Our structuring capabilities are augmented by scaled distribution channels, extending from the largest institutions through the individual retail client set. With a central focus on our clients, we see significant opportunities in delivering the integrated firm. Turning to Slide 7. Ultimately, the firm's success relies on our human capital and maintaining a differentiated partnership culture. With James as Executive Chairman and together with Andy Saperstein and Dan Simkowitz as our Co-Presidents, our highest priority is delivering the integrated firm to our clients. Our shared Morgan Stanley experience, having all lived through the 15-year transformation, gives us a lens into where we come from and where we are going. The intentional mobility of our leadership, engineered by James over these many years, is particularly important. Andy, in his expanded role as head of both wealth and investment management, is well situated to leverage his deep knowledge of retail distribution and products to drive client opportunities across the business. Dan, having successfully revitalized investment management for nearly a decade, is returning to lead institutional securities, where he spent 25 years, will play a critical role in connecting the firm around sourcing opportunities, structuring financing and distributing capital for our clients. Both these gentlemen have burnished the brand and successfully integrated acquisitions. To have James, Dan, Andy as partners to open 2024 speaks to the enduring strength of our culture. Our broader leadership team has worked together since the financial crisis through the strategic transformation and today are unified in advancing toward our goals. The operating and management committees of the firm each have an average tenure of more than 20 years. Long tenure is one element that maintains the strength of a learning culture of serving clients in a first-class way. In addition to backing the Morgan Stanley experience set of our longstanding leaders, we're enhanced by the injection of some key lateral hires and joiners via our acquisitions. Our businesses are supported by a world class technology and infrastructure organization, and by 2,320 talented Managing Directors, 155 of whom we promoted to the partnership last week. Our 80,000 people are what makes Morgan Stanley's culture and drives us to be excellent on behalf of our clients, to be prudent fiduciaries of capital, and to maintain a keen awareness of the road we have traveled to achieve the firm we have today. Turning to Slide 8, in addition to one -- the performance of the business, two -- driving an integrated firm and three -- maintaining our culture, we are four highly focused on the state of our financial capital. Given our deliberate growth and durable earnings over the last several years, our capital position is strong, going to the finalization of Basel III Endgame. Our regulatory requirements, as ventured within our stress capital buffer, have steadily come down since 2020, reflecting the improved resilience of our businesses. With respect to Basel III Endgame, we continue to believe after fulsome industry comment and further evaluation of economic and competitive impacts, that the final rule will result in a well more constructive outcome than originally proposed, particularly as it pertains to matters that are driving our estimated RWA inflation. Looking ahead, we remain committed to the dividend as it is at the core of our business model's durability. While we will toggle among opportunities to support our clients, grow our businesses, and repurchase our stock, the core strengths and strategic decisions of the last 15 years are reflected in our quarterly dividend, which we have grown from $0.05 to $0.85 per share. The continued sustainability of that dividend is paramount. With the firm coming together, we will drive toward our performance goals. Slide 9 reiterates our confidence in them. Our strategy and long-term value proposition remain intact. The four firmwide goals are in place, hitting $10 trillion in client assets, achieving a 30% wealth management pretax margin, a 70% firmwide efficiency ratio, and achieving 20% returns on tangible equity. Our management team is steeled to execute against our priorities to reach these goals. We enter 2024 with confidence, and our base case for the coming year is constructive. There are two major downside risks. The first is geopolitical, that global conflicts intensify and conflagrate. The second is the state of the U.S. economy over the course of 2024. The base case is benign, namely that of a soft landing. But if the economy weakens dramatically in the quarters to come and the Fed has to move rapidly to avoid a hard landing, that would likely result in lower asset prices and activity levels. On the other hand, if inflation in fact has not been beaten back and continues to challenge consumers and supply chain, that could result in a stickier fed and the resulting higher for longer will have to be absorbed in the way of a higher-than-expected cost of capital and the dangers of a bifurcated economy. These risks, the geopolitical and that of the U.S. economy, present some uncertainties as we start 2024. Nevertheless, as we have discussed this morning, the Morgan Stanley of today is meant to perform through the cycle, and based on the evidence we see, our building M&A and IPO pipelines, improving boardroom confidence, and an increasingly positive tone from our retail and institutional clients, we remain constructive on the year ahead. We will execute on our clear and consistent strategy. We have a global business, a world class wealth and investment manager alongside a leading investment bank. The growth opportunities are extraordinary, especially given how our businesses and regions intersect and support the business strategy. We will continue to lead with asset consolidation across wealth and investor management, and remain committed to growing high quality share in institutional securities to consistently deliver our integrated firm to clients around the world. In so doing, we will continue to execute towards our key objectives and to deliver for shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Sharon, who will discuss our fourth quarter and annual results, and then together we'll take your questions. Thank you. A - Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $54.1 billion in 2023 and ended the year with fourth quarter revenues of $12.9 billion. For the full year, ROTCE was 12.8% and EPS was $5.18, and for the fourth quarter ROTCE was 8.4% and EPS was $0.85. The full year efficiency ratio was 77.2%. A number of factors impacted our annual and quarterly results. The full year results include nearly $900 million of notable items. Over half of these items were reflected in the fourth quarter. A $286 million FDIC special assessment charge and a legal settlement of $249 million were both realized in the fourth quarter. In addition, the full year results include $353 million of severance expenses, primarily related to a May employee action. The combination of these three items negatively impacted full year EPS by $0.44, ROTCE by 105 basis points and the efficiency ratio by 164 basis points. Total integration related expenses for the year were $293 million, nearly 70% of which was related to E TRADE. With the E TRADE integration now complete, we remain focused on continuing to manage our expense base, supporting our long-term efficiency goals while still investing in growth. Now to the businesses. Institutional securities' full year revenues were $23.1 billion and quarterly revenues were $4.9 billion. Full year results were impacted by the weak investment banking environment that began with the onset of the hiking cycle and geopolitical events in early 2022, and persisted through most of the past year. Fourth quarter revenues reflected stronger investment banking results and prudent risk management across fixed income and equities. Investment banking revenues were $4.6 billion for the full year. Lower completed M&A transactions followed a dearth of announcements in the back half of 2022 and early 2023, which weighed on results. However, optimism began to rise midyear followed by a notable increase in Morgan Stanley's announced volumes starting in the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenues were $1.3 billion. Results were supported mostly by fixed income underwriting as the investment grade market remained open for regular way issuance and was supported by event driven activity. Advisory revenues have begun to recover versus recent quarters, and were roughly flat year over year. Equity underwriting revenues were also flat as activity remained muted. As we enter 2024, we are positioned to capitalize on the opportunity set, while downside risks are linked to the consumer with the rate path and geopolitics as two key determinants, we expect the US will lead the recovery globally. Corporate confidence will ultimately drive the cycle forward and we are encouraged by signs the CEO and boardroom optimism is growing, evidenced by the build of our advisory and IPO pipeline. Our integrated investment bank is well positioned to capitalize on the recovering backdrop, particularly where the institution works across the businesses with CEOs, CFOs and Treasurers on corporate solutions. Strength and sentiment should support broad M&A and new capital market issuance, and eventually feed through to the broader market activity. Equity full year revenues were $10 billion, reflecting lower revenues across regions. Tempered client engagement was reflective of broad market uncertainty. Revenues were $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Prime brokerage revenues in the fourth quarter were solid. Results reflected narrower spreads and the geographic mix of client balances. Cash results declined versus last year's fourth quarter, reflecting lower volumes, particularly in Asia, ex-Japan. Derivative results were up versus last year's fourth quarter as the business continued to grow the client base. Fixed income revenues were $7.7 billion for the full year, declining from 2022 strong results. The full year decline was driven by lower client activity in foreign exchange and commodities, which were impacted by greater uncertainty around the rate outlook and less volatile energy markets. Quarterly revenues were $1.4 billion. Macro performance was down versus the prior fourth quarter. Results reflected fewer monetization opportunities, particularly in Asia compared to heightened engagement in the region last year. Micro was down year over year, driven by lower revenues in credit corporates which was negatively impacted by movements in credit spreads on the back of geopolitical events. Results in commodities were up versus last year's fourth quarter, primarily reflecting improved performance in the power and gas business. Turning to wealth management. For the full year, wealth management's revenues were $26.3 billion and the pretax profit was $6.5 billion, which resulted in a PBT margin of 24.9%. Reported results reflect the complex macro backdrop as well as several idiosyncratic events. The unprecedented rise in the absolute level of interest rates were particularly consequential as the subsequent shifts in client behavior impacted the revenue mix and margin. In addition, there were several expense items that impacted the margin including integration related expenses, the FDIC special assessment, severance charges and the impact of DCP, which saw meaningful swings compared to last year. Taken together, these four items impacted the full year margin by over 250 basis points. Total client assets ended the year at a new high, reaching $5.1 trillion of assets. Full year fee-base flows were $109 billion. These flows and associated fees offset the market levels and changes in interest mix of client portfolios, supporting the year-over-year increase in asset management revenues. Fourth quarter revenues were $6.6 billion, and the reported PBT margin was 21.5%. The aforementioned notable expenses negatively impacted the fourth quarter margin by over 400 basis points. Asset management revenues in the quarter were $3.6 billion, up approximately $200 million from the prior year's fourth quarter. Quarterly fee-based flows were strong at $42 billion, underscoring the value clients are seeing in our advice-based model. Client allocations to higher yielding cash alternatives remained elevated, and clients continue to deploy monthly inflows into equity markets from sweep balances. The eventual return of the new issuance calendar and improved retail sentiment should provide a tailwind as clients look to redeploy into broader asset crosses. Net new assets of $282 billion for the year represented 7% annual growth rate of beginning period assets. Fourth quarter net new assets were $47 billion. For the full year, net new asset growth was driven by the advisor led channel across existing clients, new clients and net recruiting. Transactional revenues in the fourth quarter were $1.1 billion. Excluding the impact of DCP, transactional revenues increased slightly year-over-year as clients invested in structured products and fixed income products. Bank lending balances of $147 billion remain roughly flat, consistent with the environment. Total deposits increased 2% quarter over quarter to $346 billion, driven by continued demand for our savings offering from our wealth management channel and a modest increase in sweep balances. Net interest income was $1.9 billion in the quarter. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by the mix of average deposits and the blended deposit cost in the quarter. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, the deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of net interest income. The modest sequential build and sweeps was promising and suggests we are nearing a level of frictional sweeps and client accounts. Assuming that the forward curve holds and that our assumptions around client behavior materialize, we would expect NII in the first quarter to be roughly in line with the fourth quarter. Our asset led gathering strategy remains unchanged, and we expect it to deliver margin expansion over time. The path is clear and includes the following objectives -- First, increase relationships through our channels. Second -- migrate assets to advice. Third -- deepen existing client relationships with enhanced capabilities including new products and solutions, and finally, realize scale benefits of our investments over time. These efforts are well underway. In the year, we grew client relationships by over 600,000 across the franchise. This was led by success in the workplace channel, as we continue to win corporate plans and add participants in stock plan. In the prior three years, we saw an average of $50 billion of workplace assets migrate to the investor led -- the advisor led channel on an annual basis. This year, client migration was up 25% year-over-year despite economic headwinds, and on the product side, our financial advisors are offering clients investment opportunities such as private credit, private equity, and all their other alternatives. Bringing wealth and investment management closer together will create greater opportunities for ongoing product creation. As we move forward and transition from integration to optimization for client experience, we expect to see greater scale benefits from our investments over time. Investment management reported full year results of $5.4 billion and fourth quarter revenues of $1.5 billion. AUM increased year-over-year to $1.5 trillion, supported by higher asset values. Long-term net inflows of approximately $7 billion -- excuse me, long term net outflows of approximately $7 billion were driven by headwinds in our [MSIM] active equity growth strategies. Within alternatives and solutions, we continue to see demand for parametric customized portfolios across both equity and fixed income strategies as more retail clients seek customized solutions. Liquidity overlay services had outflows of $6.6 billion. Weaker institutional liquidity flows were partially offset by demand for parametric's overlay product and the combined parametric brand, inclusive of overlay and its retail offering had net inflows of over $5 billion again this quarter, underscoring the strength of our differentiated customized offering. Fourth quarter asset management and related fees of $1.4 billion increased slightly versus last year. Quarterly performance based income and other revenues were $61 million. Gains in U.S. private equity and infrastructure offset losses in real estate, reflecting the benefits of diversification in the franchise. Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Standardized RWAs increased by $13 billion sequentially to $457 billion, as we actively supported clients. We prudently managed our capital profile and ended the year with a standardized CET1 ratio of 15.2%, while focusing on our strategic priorities, including our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. Utilizing the flexibility of our repurchase authorization, we were opportunistic at the start of the 4th-quarter, and we bought back $1.3 billion of common stock. The full year tax rate was 21.9%, reflecting the realization of certain tax benefits earlier in the year. The fourth quarter's tax rate was 26.5%, primarily reflecting the tax implications of a specific legal matter. We expect the 2024 tax rate to be approximately 23%, consistent with prior years, we continue to expect some quarterly volatility. A number of idiosyncratic and macro headwinds added complexity to the backdrop over the last year. Notwithstanding these challenges, we ended the year better than where we started. We now have $6.6 trillion of client assets, and we successfully completed our E TRADE integration. As it relates to capital markets, boardroom confidence is rising and our calendar is building. We approach 2024 with optimism, keenly aware of the dynamic environment we operate in, as we continue to drive towards our performance goals. With that, we will now open the line up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. It looks like we lost Dan, we'll move to Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. I love how you laid out the picture on the wealth management margin potential. And I do like that sweeps have settled in. So I'm curious, in the big picture, has FA and client behavior changed a bunch on the cash management front such that, that's a potential driver of margin potential and why you're leaning towards that mid-20s near term versus the 30% where we were kind of hanging out when rates were lower end deposits were higher. Is that the primary driver of the margin thought? And do you think behaviors changed like permanently? Sharon Yeshaya : I can't speak about behavior permanently. But I appreciate the question, Glenn. If we take a step back, it was always an idea, the premise of a sustainable growth in margin was really about ensuring that we continue to see growth in fee-based assets, and we see growth in that migration towards the advice-based channel. And in fact, that is what you've begun to see -- look at our fee-based flows this quarter alone and think about the fee-based flows that we've had over the course of the year. We continue to educate our clients. So when we think through the funnel, we have more participants, we begin to see more assets and then those assets will, over time, migrate to advice. What you point out as we think about the cash and what some might call cash sorting, et cetera, is that we still have that 22%, 23% sitting in cash equivalents, so not necessarily BDP, but rather cash equivalents, that don't necessarily earn a fee, right? Money markets think of a savings product over time, et cetera, that you might see as individuals begin to take that money and deploy it in the markets or deployed into fee-based that will be accretive to the margin over time. And that, to your point, is a place where you should begin to see a margin build and something that becomes more sustainable as we both grow our asset base and grow the advice and the client migration towards advice in those fee-based assets. Glenn Schorr : Makes sense. I appreciate that. Maybe just a follow-up in wealth, if I could. It certainly doesn't show in your flows this quarter. So I guess I know where you're going to go with this, but you're definitely hearing a lot more from the bank-owned wealth management companies that are turning up the heat a little bit on recruiting and a lot more on their intent to better penetrate their banking while clients wallet. So I'm curious if you feel any of that in your franchise, any of that where you compete and whether or not that impacts your thought process on your ability to attract some of the trillions of dollars held away that is always part of the growth story. Sharon Yeshaya : So the first point I would say is it's obviously always a competitive market, but we're very well positioned given the tools that we've given to our advisers. A couple of points that I would make to you. The first is when we look forward into the first quarter, that recruiting pipeline is healthy. So when we think about January and what we're seeing, we see the recruiting being healthy. The second point that I'd mention is what I find to be most encouraging when you look under the M&A data, is that we're seeing new clients from the Morgan Stanley. So it's not just attracting assets all the way but rather you're actually getting new clients from those participants. And then you're seeing conversion. So when you think about some of the statistics that I gave you around workplace and we've talked about these statistics, the workplace assets that move over you have 80% of those assets are actually assets that are coming from outside the institution. So you're bringing new clients in, and then they're bringing their assets that are sitting away into the institution. So I think we're well positioned to capture those opportunities. Final point that I'd make is on your banking products, actually, this idea of the E TRADE integration, right? And we talked about, we've completed the integration, and I said we're looking towards the forward of the front office integration, some of that will be around banking products, et cetera, as we think and we look ahead over a multiyear journey. Operator : We'll take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the new role, Ted. I was hoping you could elaborate on the current environment and a little bit more and maybe what you see as the biggest opportunities for growth as you look to make progress against the longer-term targets that you've outlined? Ted Pick : Thanks for your question. I think we -- as you heard from my comments, we're generally constructive about what 2024 brings and it should be beneficial to both arms of the firm. Some of the reorientation of cash equivalents, whether they be in money markets or treasuries and the like that Sharon referred to and redeploy by our wealth clients into the markets, given increasing sense of stability, clearly good for FAs and for the wealth channel. In the investment bank, we've had a decade's long route in IPOs slowest volume we've seen in decades. As you know, we've had very light M&A calendar. So that also has been at a trough sort of early cycle type activity from our highest margin products inside of the investment bank, specifically inside of investment banking, we think, in order to our benefit to. So we quite possibly could have a dynamic where if we are in this soft landing zone, we could see increased activity. Ultimately, we are in the tickets business activity based in both channels and benign economic conditions augur well for both wealth and investment but also for the investment bank. And part of the reason I wanted to talk about the integrated firm today was because the two segments are working together will bring inevitably additional growth opportunities in the firm. We have folks that have mobilized around the enterprise are now in a position to talk to clients across the product spectrum and to bring in additional business. We have a big business, as you know, in Europe and in Asia. So if economic conditions are better than the expected, which is that Europe will struggle in China might as well. If we do any better than that, we would expect to see some increased activity coming out of those regions, too. So it's not just a U.S. proposition but a global one as well. Dan Fannon : Great. Thank you. And you mentioned margin within the wealth chain or wealth segment will consolidate around the mid-20s here in the near term. Can you maybe unpack some of the inputs that will drive that outcome? Sharon Yeshaya : Certainly. I worked through that, I think, Dan, when I actually tried to explain it in the script. So the premise in terms of the growing wealth management margin, again, is about the conversion to the advice-based model over time. Of course, individuals will have different pieces, right? But we have three different channels that we've talked about. We've talked about self-directed. We talked about workplace. We've talked about advice. From the self-directive side, we will continue to attract those clients and those that might be interested in advice, we'll see it as we have different ways to give people a sense and a connection to FA. So we've talked about that. On the workplace side, we continue to get new participants, new corporate relationships and that as we educate people with the wellness offering, et cetera. And we've seen evidence of this to bring people yet again to that advice-driven model. And the fee-based flows, as you see those, those will help us grow the asset management line. Then you can break it down again, the transactional line we've talked about, you're going to have new products and you're going to have a deployment of this cash that's been sitting on the sidelines that we've talked a lot about, the dry powder that could impact either the transactional line or the asset management line. And again, we're encouraged by the signs that we're seeing in NII. That too suggests that we are seeing as of right now, it looks like that cash, that frictional level of cash is stabilizing. So I think you have the drivers in each of those lines as we think about the revenue side. And then as you think about the expense side, those we are looking for place to invest and gain from the scale of those investments and that will be a part of the objectives that Ted laid out when you see $10 trillion of assets. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : Thanks. Good morning. Welcome, Ted. Maybe just going back to the strategic update, going to Slide 13, where you sort of lay out very nicely the transformation over the last 15 years. As we look forward over the next three to five years. I was wondering if you can help fill in the blanks around strategically, I mean M&A has been a key pillar of this transformation as we think about both organic and inorganic one on the M&A side, give us a sense of just where you see deal making happening over the next few years. We saw a big private asset deal being announced on Friday. And so would love some perspective there. And then I think the second thing you mentioned in terms of wallet share on the investment banking side, if we can unpack that a little bit in terms of how you expect to achieve a greater wallet share. Thank you. Ted Pick : Thanks. Good to talk to you -- with you. It's an interesting question. You're effectively asking what will over the slide look like three, four years from now. We believe that the revenue mix will toggle around. There could be periods like in 2020 or '21, where the investment bank is really firing on all cylinders. Again, early economy type of activity, and that could grow again towards 50%. And we could have other periods where as we continue to invest in the wealth and investment management piece of the firm, that could expand further. I think where we are right now is a revenue and profitability matter where 60% of the firm is in wealth and investment management is not a bad place to start. I think the main message I want to convey today is that while there is a change in leadership after 14 years of James stewardship, there's not a change in strategy. We have undertaken and integrated, if you really go back into time and then include Mesa West five different acquisitions. And I think the view inside the house is that's good for now. We can execute our business with the growth plans in front of us and it feels organic. Now that having been said, there are ideas that come across the transom and we naturally would take a look. But I think for the next period, the view that I would have is that we really work to grow the organization and to do so organically and efficiently. I think on the margin, one comment might be that we could work on sweating the income statement a bit more. There's a little more work to be done post integration where there could be inefficiencies along the income statement. And I think we are much focused on looking for those efficiencies without giving up any of the strategic investment that we want to make on our way to 30% PBT margins in wealth and 70% efficiency of the firm. The way I've articulated the strategic goals is to effectively reiterate -- we will achieve those goals. But along the way, we will invest, and that investment opportunity exists on the current portfolio in an exciting way. And that is why for me, the most important message we wanted to send out to folks today with this concept of the integrated firm. Now we have the portfolio of businesses together. We have a unified partnership culture. We have the two halves of the firm, will toggle by 5 or 10 points on revenue or profitability given a period of time and now we can scale that organically and hit the numbers and work the income statement a little bit. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So what I wanted to start off and Sharon with just a question on incremental margins and comp leverage in a lower rate backdrop. We know NII is going to be a source of drag in the coming quarter, certainly if the forward curve manifests, but you should see improved momentum from equity market tailwinds, stronger fee base flows, a better IV backdrop. But the Street is modeling comp dollars flat, revenues up about $2 billion. I'm just trying to get a sense of how we should think about incremental margins as revenue momentum improves but the growth is coming in mainly for more compensable areas. Sharon Yeshaya : So you obviously did hit the nail on the head in terms of the different pieces, right? So you can't look at the different line items the same way. You're going to have a comp ratio change as FAs get compensated, as you would expect, on the grid associated with those fee-based revenues. As it relates to NII, yes, that was noncompensable as I just told you the expectation on a quarter-over-quarter basis, if client behavior remains unchanged, you are sitting in a position where you're beginning to better understand what that behavior is and that NII will be roughly in line with where it was in the fourth quarter, at least for the first quarter. So yes, the comp itself might change, but the actual growth in the ability to see the fee-based assets grow is higher. There are also other offsetting factors that we have to think about as we look back into the last year. Remember that what I highlighted was you had negative implications associated with mix of revenue in those asset management lines because of the fact that we saw investors invest in the fixed income products. You add market dynamics associated with billing, et cetera. So there is place -- there are rather places that you can see growth in the asset management line. Yes, they will be compensable, but we would see benefits of scale, both from the asset side and hopefully, from the market side as you see different pieces being invested as you move forward. I hope that helps to frame the answer to your question. Steven Chubak : No, that's really helpful. And just for my follow-up, I was hoping you could just speak to the sensitivity to lower rates. It's a big area of focus for investors. You benefit from having the majority of your deposits in premium savings where admittedly you have bigger pricing flexibility at the same time, the asset side is still very sensitive to the short end. So I wanted to get a sense as to how you expect the NII trajectory to unfold as the Fed begins easing and whether there's any appetite on your side to extend duration to maybe lock in some higher yields. Sharon Yeshaya : That's a great question. And the answer is fully premised on what we see first with deposits, right? So your sort of first order condition, as you look ahead into 2024 is what happens to the deposit mix. What I said on the call is that we're encouraged in my prepared remarks, we're encouraged by what we've seen to date as the beginning of January. If you were to assume that, that were to hold, the next question is, what is the pace of the interest rate cuts that we see? If you see an instantaneous shock, we disclose to you what that means, right? So an instantaneous 100 basis point shock lower will be negative, around $600 million, right? However, if it was more gradual in nature, which is similar to what you might see in the forward curve, you will have offsets associated with the reinvestment of the portfolio. So that will offset the rate decline, right? We'll largely offset those rate declines. But it will depend first order condition is -- our deposits stable is the mix stable, and that's what we've seen so far. So let's see if that holds. And then second, what is the pace of the cuts over the course of the year. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Devin Ryan : Thanks so much and good morning Ted and Sharon. Maybe just start with a question on investment banking and good to hear about the tone improvement there. Sponsors have been less active than corporates, at least from the data we track, and we know sponsors have record dry powder, but higher interest rates, current valuations have been a little bit challenging for them. So just the question is whether they are in a position to return in force over the next year. I think that's probably going to be necessary for full normalization in investment banking. And then just what you're seeing when you talk about the pipeline that you have, which are good, what are sponsors doing in those pipelines? Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. Overall, the pipeline is more diversified than we've necessarily seen in historical years. We expect to see continued momentum in energy that we've seen over the past year, we see optimistic signs in real estate, and we see optimistic signs in technology. As it relates to sponsors, we would expect sponsors to come back that will obviously take time, and I do think it will likely take a couple of potential prints in certain places and other things that will be encouraging will be on the equity IPO side. What I'd say is we've moved from a period of time that was window driven and that market is beginning to build momentum. And so the juxtaposition between the outlook for '24, I think in '23 is important there as well. Devin Ryan : Okay. Terrific. And then a question for Ted. So I think you're pretty clear here, the strategic trajectory is not changing dramatically. But we often get the question around stylistically what's changing. And so you have a different background than James. I think everyone has their own management style, and you run some big businesses very successfully from Morgan Stanley. So what could maybe just hit on briefly how you would characterize kind of your style and just the ability to leverage your experience and what may change as a result of that? Thanks. Ted Pick : Well, I\u2019d say that's a great question. James and I are more -- much more similar than not. He brings to the table a positive mojo to the business from the time that he took over CEO when things were in, as you know, a pretty rough shape and for now in his 15th year of leadership as Exec Chair, he brings a positive spirit to every single interaction that we have, whether it's our operating and management committees, our risk meetings, these calls, client interactions, cultural work with our - with our newbies and folks that are looking to get promoted in the organization. I think that spirit of positivity is something that has been contagious in the organization. It's something that I'm a big believer in and has worked well inside of the trading businesses inside of investment banking, and I think you can feel it throughout the firm. So the reaffirmation of our partnership, our core values and this articulation of the integrated firm, which is the next step now because we went from trying to build our way back to generating the kind of enhanced scale and deep remote through these gutsy acquisitions. That brought us to a place now where we can look around and see how we can bring the firm closer together. I think the tone is one of determination. I've been at this place for more than three decades, and we had our moment sort of before the [abyss] in '08 and I think it's fair to say that the entire senior partnership, James, but also the folks that came through the organization like myself, we are determined to not revisit anything that feels like those days. So the calling card here is durability is consistency. We want to put up consistent results Part of what you see in the strategic deck in the back page, those are very clear numbers, and we will hit them. We will hit those numbers. It will take time. We will have to do all of the three yards and a cloud of dust work associated with a thoughtfully working our way to those numbers such that when we hit them in a normalized environment, which will be part of the next arrow on Page 3 and the years to come, we will have done so in a way where we can achieve full valuation on it because the view will be that they are not only achieved for a moment in time, but sustainable. And that obviously is also the calling card of James tenure, which is that of consistency and durability. So if the first is this positive mojo and the second is this ethos of consistency, rigor durability I think the third, at the end of the day, has been to believe in what Morgan Stanley can aspire to for clients, and that is this integrated firm that we are something differentiated in our two channels very clear on what we do and what we don't do, and that the cycle is very much a tailwind for us. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Christian Bolu : Good morning, Ted, and welcome to the call. Good morning, Sharon as well. Maybe Ted, for you, on the trading businesses, Morgan Stanley has suffered some share loss over the last couple of years and your peers have been aggressively allocating capital to that business and gaining share so maybe curious on how you're thinking about opportunities to grow those businesses and any plans to either invest more capital or resources into that business? Ted Pick : Thanks for the question. Christian, good to hear your voice. I think we know that we have -- we have achieved the top three position in the Institutional Securities business over the last number of years. But as you say on the margin, we have lost share to the number 1 and number 2 and I think our view has been that, that is a trade that we've been willing to make both to continue to toggle the organization to the kind of revenue and profitability mix that you see today. But also importantly, the preservation of capital, which allows us today irrespective of where we are in Basel III end game to have a CET1 ratio that is well above 15%. As you've heard, I am with the team much focused on the durability of the dividend. And so there's been a real focus on what shareholders want and what the business model ought to be for folks that want a durable Morgan Stanley. Now that having been said, what you saw in 2020 was that we can be quite agile about getting capital resourcing to the client base if the tailwinds are there. Part of the proposition of being a global investment bank is that, if, for example, balances start working in the prime brokerage context or is there '21/'22 highs where we're about 10% away from those figures, well, then perhaps capital needs to be put towards equities, namely the prime brokerage business on behalf of clients. There may be other periods where the event space, which was an illusion made on the previous question with respect to activity around financial sponsors, that, that activity may come back because, of course, at some point, these large assets need to trade in the sponsor community is dependent at some level on the street to engage in velocity. So there is no strategic decision at all to withdraw from the investment bank. I think what we would say in 2024 is that it's not really a choice between wealth and investment management or the insured securities business. We will engage in both activities, but we will not be looking to chase the ball simply to have wallet share. The name of the game is to have an income statement that demonstrate operating leverage in each of the two businesses and ultimately, to get to holistic returns. So we are much focused on what the durability of that capital put uses and where we can serve clients over a long period of time. We're paying attention to it very, very carefully. And what I'm most excited about, Christian, is that the cycle that's coming investment banking-led cycle is coming at a time when we spent years putting together, and I know you've met some of these folks are so-called integrated investment bank. What is differentiated about this place is that we have bankers, equities people and fixed income folks who work together. They work together on client solutions. What I'm proposing on our behalf is now we extend that proposition to the firm. We're at -- in the wealth business, the investment management business and inside the investment bank, we can work together around clients ultimately to generate operating leverage and returns. And that is for me, the most exciting part of the next chapter, which is we got the team, we've got the excess capital. But again, I like the excess capital because it's part of what has differentiated us from the group and allows us to weather whatever comes through on a Basel III end game. I would add if, in fact, the Basel III end game outcome is more favorable than perhaps the Street expects. We will adjust accordingly, but we have tools. And part of that is dividend or that's investing in the business. Part of that, obviously, is buying stock back. But ultimately, having a real capital cushion is something that shareholders have come to expect from James, and that's something they should continue to expect for me. Christian Bolu : Awesome. Very clear, and then maybe another one on Wealth Management margins, unfortunately, maybe for Sharon. I can hear you Sharon very clearly that you think higher revenues will drive margins over time. I guess, but if I guess if I look at the business, 2019 versus today, wealth management revenues are up 50%. This is where they were in 2019, where your margins have compressed. And again, I know there's onetime items in the quarter, on the year, but it doesn't seem to me like bigger revenues have driven operating leverage. So what gives you confidence that going forward, our revenue growth will drive meaningful operating leverage? Sharon Yeshaya : Really around the conversion. That's why I keep talking about the conversion, Christian. We brought the statistics up last year. We've brought the statistics up again this year in terms of seeing conversion from Workplace about seeing net new assets coming in and then seeing those assets migrate. New clients giving FAs time. All of those things are able to give us more durable asset management-based revenue as we move forward. So to your question, and I think Steve asked a similar question, the NII will fluctuate, obviously, based on rates and on consumer and customer behavior. And so the goal, well, that has been something that we say, don't forget the bank. Don't forget the margin that you'll get from that. Over time, the goal is to have a more sustainable $1 trillion of assets coming through both wealth and investment management, those assets will earn fees to some portion of it, and we see the migration into fee-based, right? We have 50% of advisor-led assets sitting in fee-based accounts. That's the ultimate proposition from seeing an expanded margin and seeing the benefits of scale. And we have invested in workplace. We've invested in getting new channels and getting new participants. The time is now to begin to see conversion, and we have evidence factual evidence that I pointed to on this call to show you that we're making progress towards those goals. Ted Pick : What I'd add, Christian, is, again, all goals being equally important, we will hit that $10 trillion number. So part of it is to allow for some of this latency, if you will, on assets held away on assets working their way through workplace. It's a space that we are a leader in. It's a space that is relatively embryonic in the wealth business. And we will allow for some time for those assets to convert. But the key, of course, is to have them in-house and then as well to see that folks who are our new workplace customers have assets held away in other existing brokerage accounts that they bring them the firm as well Operator : Due to time constraints, we'll take just one question and no follow-up going forward from analysts. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning and congrats to Ted on the new role. I will -- since I only get one shot at this, I will ask on the long-term targets. So we -- there were some slight changes here. We lost some pluses and we lost a less than on the efficiency ratio, although in fairness, we gained a plus on the client assets. So was that a reflection of these are long-term targets, so I'm guessing it's not really a reflection of the current environment. So what drove the tweak there to maybe signal some reduction in some of the upside scenarios? And how should -- you've referenced the fact that you need the environment to normalize, how should we be thinking about progression towards these targets? And what specific nonenvironmental actions you can be taking in order to move the ball there. Ted Pick : Yes. Excellent question. And a lot of time given to consideration on pluses and the like. This, for me, was sort of an easy call the page is one that we all own and getting to 30% margins is a number that we want to achieve. And at that level, having hit something that is approaching $10 trillion assets, we're going to be in a really great place. And that would be a reasonable time to say, hey, how about more. And we'd say, okay, well, clearly, we're going to continue to grow assets because the asset number way that TAM is gigantic. James has mentioned, $20 trillion at one point. There are client assets that will keep us busy for many generations to come. Whether the pretax margin of wealth's should go about 30% at that point before or not, I'd like to get to the 30 and I want to get there durably and thoughtfully and the mid-20s is a range that you've seen us trade at the business to work well at, and we believe we can when economic conditions normalize, as Sharon described and as new assets get put to work some combination of money markets and T-bills coming into the market again, workplace coming through the funnel. All three channels working on the back of increased transaction activity and new issues and the like. We should slowly and durably work our way back to 30% The efficiency ratio, as you know, is just another way of saying 30% margins for the enterprise. Now by definition, the investment bank which has more capital and more underlying risk should have margins that exceed 30% over time. So it's fair to say that if we're hitting 30% margins in Wealth Management, we certainly should be at an enterprise efficiency ratio of 1 minus 70%, 30% as well. So 30% plus could be a way of thinking about it, but I wanted to set up numbers where the team knew that they are specific and that we needed to hit them. And then finally, with respect to returns on capital, this gets to the importance of our being stewards of that capital, what we pay out in the form of dividends, what we buy back and durably how we run the place. So we thought that 20% ROTCE which is something we hit during the COVID years. But of course, those were against macroeconomic conditions, which were unusual and highly favorable that we can do 20% in a normalized environment. So this may be on the margin and James liked it too, when we talked about it, stylistically, my view was and the team shares it that 10 trillion of client assets, we should get there and just keep on going. But the other three, effectively in removing the pluses, it's simply reaffirming that those numbers will be hit. We will hit 30% pretax margins in wealth, 70% efficiency ratio for the firm and 20% ROTCE. It will take time. It will be the challenges you would expect in making that happen. And of course, we need economic conditions to line up in a favorable way. But over time, those are the firm-wide goals, and we wanted to be very specific about that for you. Operator : We'll take our last question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Mike Mayo : Okay. Well, it looks like you have a heavy lift after following James [indiscernible]. What is your message to the wealth managers and investment managers at half of the company that you haven't run in the past. So you've proven yourself in half the company, that's clearly capital markets and Wall Street banking. But what's your message to the other half of the company at a time when they've had a step down in their -- the growth rates, new asset flows on wealth and outflows in investment management. Ted Pick : Well, thanks for the question, Mike. The Wealth business is actually in my blood. My dad and my father-in-law were both brokers once upon a time, and I grew up studying that business as a kid. And I think it is absolutely that, which is differentiated on Morgan Stanley during this 15-year period. The ability to integrate Smith Barney and build out something that's truly special is -- has been existentially, as you know better than most, but also thematically exactly what the firm as needed. In no way has it actually worked to the disbenefit of the investment bank. As you know, the history of our -- of our merger '97 was largely about social issues, but the industrial idea wasn't necessarily off at all. to build a world-class wealth manager would be something that would have enormous barriers to entry and have run well and run their first-class way to deliver value to clients in a differentiated manner. And what we have done, thanks to the leadership of Andy Saperstein with Jed Fin and then the investment management business with Dan Simkowitz now moving over to the Investment Bank and [Ben Huneke] and [Jacques Chappuis] running investor management today is we've got effectively the full funnel. We've got the soup to nuts self-directed the traditional advisory channel and this new channel workplace are working as one. I've spent time working some of the chairman\u2019s and hitting a branch here in Midtown and spending some time with folks that are actually making the engine work. And I think it's fair to say that We, at one point, we're calling the wealth and investment management business, the ballast, which was the right word because we wanted to convey durability, but I'd submit to you, Mike, and hopefully, you'll appreciate spirit of which I say this, I think it's actually the engine. I think this will be the engine for further Morgan Stanley growth. If opportunities were to come before us in the years to come, of course, we could staple them on and do something inorganically. As James alluded to, perhaps that would be outside the U.S. where I spent a whole bunch of time but in running the actual organic business as it currently stands, we are truly a group of one. And as you know, having spent time inside the knitting of MS what we're most excited about, Mike, you as a student of corporate culture and these investment banks, I think what you'd be most excited about is just how well we all get along. There is a zero friction in the leadership ranks across infrastructure, across wealth and investment management and across the investment bank. So the beauty of where we are today, is that all of us as shareholders and custodians of the Morgan Stanley idea and the Morgan Stanley culture of first-class business in a first-class way are very much focused on growing both pieces of the firm and is leading wealth and asset manager has a lot more room and will grow, as I said, to the $10 trillion of assets. And at the same time, I don't see any reason why we can't continue to pick up high-quality durable wallet inside the investment bank and generate operating leverage in that business, too. Operator *: That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you again for participating. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. Welcome to Morgan Stanley's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimer. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplements, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Morgan Stanley does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements in this discussion. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Ted Pick. Ted Pick : Good morning, and happy spring in New York. Thank you for joining us. We entered 2024 with optimism, encouraged by improving boardroom confidence and an increasingly positive tone from our institutional and wealth management clients, the quarter was strong. We generated $15 billion of revenue, a 71% efficiency ratio, $2.02 in earnings per share and a 20% return on tangible equity. In a relatively constructive environment, these results highlight the power of our clear and consistent strategy, serving as trusted advisor to our clients, helping them raise, allocate and manage capital. During the quarter, higher asset prices and an improved economic backdrop supported confidence with our wealth management client base. We saw greater activity both in the advisor based and self-directed channels, resulting in higher adjusted margins of 27%. Net new assets grew by $95 billion. Investment Management also generated positive long-term flows in the quarter. Across both wealth and investment management, total client assets grew to $7 trillion advancing toward our $10 trillion goal. As the new issue calendar returned for the first time in a number of quarters, it was great to see us regain our leadership position in equity capital markets. More broadly, we saw building momentum in investment banking, both in our M&A and underwriting pipelines across corporate and financial sponsor clients. [Audio Gap] both generated very solid results to round out a strong quarter in institutional securities. As ever, we remain focused on managing our resources, sweating the income statement and being judicious with our capital. Our CET1 ratio was 15.1%. Our excess capital position allows us to support our clients, invest in our businesses and return capital to our shareholders, particularly as regulators continue to evaluate Basel III endgame. Additional regulatory clarity and a sustained capital markets recovery should have a multiplier effect across our global franchise, further unlocking the unique power of our integrated firm. I wanted to touch on the topic of client onboarding and monitoring in the wealth business with 3 short observations. First, this quarter's wealth management results speak for themselves with record revenues and strong metrics across the board, including strong margins and very strong net new assets. We are really pleased with this terrific performance and we are going to keep ongoing. Second, this is not a new matter. We've been focused on our client onboarding and monitoring processes for a good while. We have ongoing communications with our regulators, as all the large banks do. As James said in January, we want to ensure we continue to be world class in every aspect of this growing business. And third, to be clear, this is about processes. We have been spending time, effort and money for multiple years, and it is ongoing. We've been on it. And the costs associated with this are largely in the expense run rate. To conclude, the first quarter of 2024 aligns with the goals outlined in the January strategy deck : $15 billion of revenue, a 71% efficiency ratio, $2 of earnings, $7 trillion of client assets, and a 20% return on tangible. We have strong backlogs and momentum in every part of the firm. While the pipelines are healthy, there remains a backdrop of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Our job is to generate these kinds of durable results on a consistent basis. I'm very optimistic what lies ahead for Morgan Stanley. And on behalf of our 2,300 Managing Directors and 80,000 employees, say to those listening to the call, we will deliver an integrated firm to clients and shareholders that is unmatched in both its integrity and in its intensity. Now, I'll turn it over to our excellent CFO, Sharon Yeshaya to discuss the quarter in more detail. Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you, and good morning. In the first quarter, the firm produced revenues of $15.1 billion. Our EPS was $2.02 and our ROTCE was 19.7%. Our model is working as intended. The first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our scaled business and an improving backdrop. Benefits of durable revenues, particularly asset management fees in the wealth management business, stronger capital markets and a continued focus on managing the full income statement, all contributed to results. The firm's first quarter efficiency ratio was 71%, illustrating the inherent operating leverage in the model and our ongoing efforts to consolidate our expense base following multiple years of integration. Efforts are evidenced by the year-over-year reduction in professional services and marketing and business development spend, lower legal expenses further supported the improvement in efficiency ratio. Now to the businesses. Institutional securities revenues of $7 billion were up 3% versus the prior year, reflecting strong performance across businesses. First quarter revenues underscore the power of the integrated firm as our cross divisional collaboration positioned us to capitalize on market opportunities. The geographical breadth continues to distinguish our franchise and puts us at the center of client activity as the backdrop improves across regions. Investment banking revenues were $1.4 billion for the first quarter, up 16% from the prior year. A pickup in both equity and fixed income underwriting supported results, offsetting the year-over-year decline in advisory. Leading indicators continued to progress positively, including the preliminary reemergence of sponsor activity. Advisory revenues of $461 million reflected a decline in completed M&A transactions. Equity underwriting revenues of $430 million more than doubled versus the prior year as IPO markets reopened for most of the quarter alongside conducive markets for follow-ons. Our global reach supported our ability to lead cross-border transactions, and we regained our premier leadership position in equity underwriting lead tables as global market volumes picked up. Fixed income underwriting increased year over year to $556 million, results were driven by strength in investment grade and noninvestment grade bond issuance as clients took advantage of tighter credit spreads. Looking ahead, we expect the steady build of this business to continue. We are encouraged by the health of the advisory and underwriting pipelines. While the uncertainty of the rate path and geopolitical developments may impact the near-term conversion of pipeline to realized, conditions should improve over time and the underlying trends suggest that confidence is increasing. We remain focused on expanding our reach through opportunistic hires, particularly as we continue to see diverse pipeline and increased sponsor activity. Turning to Equity, we continue to be a global leader in this business. Revenues were strong increasing 4% from the prior year to $2.8 billion. Results were supported by performance in derivatives and cash, and the franchise benefited from the scale of our prime brokerage business. Cash revenues increased year-over-year, reflecting broad based strength in equity markets across the region. Performance in Japan was particularly strong supported by higher volumes. Our increased coverage augmented by our longstanding and unique partnership with MUFG should be supportive over time. Derivative revenues were robust as the business navigated the market environment well and client activity was strong. Prime Brokerage revenues were solid as client balances increased back towards all-time highs on higher market levels. Results reflect the mix of client balances and narrower spreads. Fixed income revenues were $2.5 billion results declined slightly compared to the strong result last year. Recall, last year's result benefited from increased client engagement on the back of idiosyncratic events, including those related to the U.S. regional banks. Client demand for corporate solutions acted as a partial offset, reflecting the strength of our integrated franchise. Macro and micro revenues declined modestly year-over-year on lower volatility and client activity, which resulted in less transactional flow. Results in commodities increased year-over-year, supported by higher revenues in the North America Power and Gas business. Turning to Wealth Management. The business delivered strong results across all key metrics, demonstrating the continued power and differentiation of the engine we have built. Record revenues increased from the prior year to $6.9 billion driven by record asset management fees from both a rising market and ongoing success in migrating clients to advisory relationships to better serve their needs. Transactional revenues, excluding DCP, were also strong as retail sentiment improved alongside institutional investors. Importantly, net interest income remained in line sequentially. Pre-tax profit was $1.8 billion and the PBT margin was 26.3%. Together, DCP and the FDIC special assessment impacted the margin by approximately 115 basis points. The results highlight the inherent operating leverage embedded in the business, particularly as revenues rise on the back of cumulative strong fee-based flows as clients invest more in higher beta assets and transactional activity rebounds. Net new assets for the quarter were strong at $95 billion with contributions from multiple channels including our family office offering. Over time, our ability to deliver unique solutions to clients should continue to attract assets and lead to share capture. Fee-based flows of $26 billion were strong. Within fee-based flows this quarter, we saw particular strength from the migration of assets from the advisor led brokerage accounts to fee-based accounts. This demonstrates that over time, assets migrate through the funnel into recurring revenue generating accounts. Fee-based assets now stand at over $2 trillion. Asset Management revenues were $3.8 billion, up 13% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market levels and the cumulative impact of strong fee-based flows. Transactional revenues were $1 billion and excluding the impact of DCP, were up 9% versus the prior year. The first quarter's results were driven by client engagement across products, including record activity in structured products. Investments in our platform allow us to support increased client demand. Bank lending balances were $147 billion, up slightly quarter-over-quarter, reflecting modest growth in mortgages. Total deposits of $347 billion were roughly flat quarter-over-quarter as the decline in sweep balances was offset by continued demand for our savings offering. While sweep balances were down on a spot-to-spot basis, average sweeps were roughly in line with last quarter, broadly consistent with our modeled expectations. Net interest income was $1.9 billion flat to the fourth quarter's results, consistent with our guidance. The moderate increase in average deposit cost was offset by several factors, including the reinvestments of assets at higher market rates. Looking ahead to the second quarter, the deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of NII. Assuming the current forward curve and that our assumptions around client behavior materialize, we would expect NII in the second quarter to again be roughly in line with the first quarter. Our strategy is working. We have a clear path to $10 trillion in client assets across wealth management and investment management. We remain focused on supporting clients on their path to advice, deepening existing client relationships and using our scaled platform to achieve sustainable 30% pretax profits over time. Investment Management reported revenues of $1.4 billion increasing 7% versus the prior year. Results reflect higher asset management revenues, which increased 8% year-over-year, driven by growth in average AUM on higher market levels. Total AUM increased to $1.5 trillion, long-term net flows were strong at $7.6 billion inflows were driven by strengths in alternatives and solutions and reflect the benefits of our diversified product offering. Within alternatives and solutions, demand for parametric customized portfolios was robust as retail clients, including our own wealth management clients, allocated investments to Parametric's equity based products, underscoring the value of the integrated model. Flows were further supported by global interest in our active fixed income strategies. Liquidity and overlay services had out close of $12.9 billion. Performance based income and other revenues were $31 million. Gains in U.S. private equity and private credit offset lowered accrued carried interest in Asia private equity and real estate demonstrating the benefits of a global diversified platform. We are seeing the benefits of ongoing investments in this business. We remain focused on customization, private credit and our global distribution. Parametric, in particular, has allowed us to deliver the integrated firm, evidenced by the ongoing demand from our wealth management client base. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.1%, down 14 basis points from the prior quarter. Standardized RWAs increased quarter-over-quarter as we actively supported our clients in more constructive markets. We continue to deliver our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, buying back $1 billion of common stock during the quarter. Our tax rate was 21% for the quarter. The vast majority of share based award conversion takes place in the first quarter resulting in a lower tax rate. We continue to expect our 2024 tax rate to be approximately 23%, which similar to prior years will exhibit some quarter to quarter volatility. The first quarter is clear evidence that as the backdrop improves, our franchise is strategically positioned to capture upside as it was designed to do. With client assets at a record of $7 trillion across Wealth and Investment Management, we are on strong footing. Our Wealth Management business continues to focus on growth as well as supporting our clients with advice in delivering our differentiated offering, and our institutional franchise is supported by our scale and our global footprint. This combined with the build of the investment banking pipelines and market confidence provides us with momentum to deliver on our objectives over time. With that, we will now open the line up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll move to our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate you not running away from a sensitive subject. I'm going to push the envelope and just ask one follow-up if possible on the wealth matter. I wonder if you could size the non-U. S. wealth piece whether it be in client assets or revenue for us. And correct me if I'm wrong, if that's the focus? And then more importantly, do you think obviously, you had a pretty darn good quarter. So, do you think this impacts any day-to-day or your ability to grow and onboard clients in the future? That's my real main question. Sharon Yeshaya : I think it's a great question, Glenn. Happy to take that and just follow-up on exactly what Ted said, which is as you said, the results really speak for themselves. This is a phenomenal business. We had record revenues and we're in a great position. We have strong margins, strong net new assets, and no, there are no strategic changes to our business. There is no changes in our ability to do business, and we're extremely confident in our ability to grow and to deepen the relationship with the breadth of firm offerings that we have to serve our clients. Specific to your question on the international business, it is small. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Maybe Ted for you, as we think about, so it was a strong quarter for Investment Banking Underwriting. There seems to be a fragility to the macro outlook based on what how rates have behaved on the back of inflation, geopolitics? Just give us a sentiment check of when you're talking to your corporate clients, like how resilient do you see the investment banking sort of trends and the sort of desire and appetite for corporates to engage in either DCM, ECM or M&A, large M&A activity as we look into sort of later in the year into the U.S. Elections? Ted Pick : The pipeline is clearly growing. It's growing across sectors. It's growing on a cross border basis. There are some who will be willing to take the regulatory risk at this point in the cycle. And there is activity that we will see both from the financial sponsor community and the corporate community will effectively be bidding with and against each other for assets. This is a moment when most want to purify their business model or grow. And that scaling needs to take place now that the effects of COVID and supply chain are in front of us and geopolitics continue to be on our minds, it is not surprising that the C suite wants to act. So I think we are in the early innings of a multiyear M&A cycle. On the back of that, we should continue to see all kinds of underwriting. What was interesting about this ECM quarter where we had real success was that it was a combination of IPOs from the Valley, capital raises from industrial companies, regional trades, cross border unlocks. It was the whole potpourri of offerings and we've also begun to see the beginning of event financing in the high yield and leverage loan market. So I'm feeling good about this being early to mid-cycle for the classic investment banking capital markets business around the world. And as you know, we are very active in Japan where we think activity will be heightened for years to come. Ebrahim Poonawala : And just one quick follow-up Sharon, on the wealth management NII and sweep deposits. I think the sense is that we're getting to a bit of a bottom on NII. Is that an accurate characterization? And should we stop worrying about a big cliff event where NII declines meaningfully from where we trended? Sharon Yeshaya : I welcome the day where I stopped getting questions on NII. I would characterize this, it's now the third quarter in a row that I've said that our suite models and the client behavior is following client expectations. It does feel as though we are reaching that frictional level of cash. Of course we'll have to wait and see how things play out, but broadly speaking it feels as though like I said we are at a place where you have what we would say is inter quarter volatility associated with things that might be T-bills maturing, people putting things in markets. But that again is frictional levels of cash rather than large changes or movements in real client behavior, which is what you saw 2 years ago in the summer when we saw the large move in rates, which was a one off event, and then you had again a very large event with the regional bank movements in the first quarter of last year. So those are very specific events that we can look at and since then, like I said, we have been working with our modeled expectations. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So maybe just starting off on the expense outlook. We saw some good progress on the expense front and the KPIs are encouraging. Headcount was down year-on-year. Comp and non-comp surprised positively in ISG and Wealth. And I was hoping you could just speak to your efforts to rationalize or optimize the expense base. And with IB and Wealth fees expected to ramp consistent with the M&A commentary, Ted, that you cited, how should we be thinking about incremental margins as these businesses and particularly fees start to grow? Sharon Yeshaya : Certainly, let's take just the expense big picture and we obviously disclosed the SEC drivers of expenses, I called them out. We've had multiple years now where we've been looking to integrate multiple acquisitions, and as we've come out of that we've been able to reevaluate our expense base. And I've talked about it in different pieces of our earnings call, many times I've mentioned space. You can see even in the lines around occupancy in the actual disclosures, you can see bump ups in spaces where you're taking write offs down in space and then it begins to trend down again. So we're making big picture decisions around what do we actually need and where do we want to invest those growth drivers as we move forward. So consolidating the marketing dollars and figuring out what is the best use of those marketing dollars, consolidating professional services, how do we actually want to deploy full time hires in those growth objectives. So in my prepared remarks, we talked about 2 things. We talked about taking expenses down in certain line items, but we also discussed investments, right. I talked about the fact that we're looking at opportunistic hires in M&A. We've discussed a lot about investing in parametric and technology. We've been giving technological tools to our advisors and investing in the business. So it's a push pull and it's making sure as Ted said that we're sweating the income statement and we're thinking about our resources efficiently and durably as we move forward through the cycle. Ted Pick : What I'd add to that is if you just sort of had an intangible sense of what we talk about at our leadership meetings, our operating committee of a dozen people and the next group, the management committee of about 3 dozen and then their leadership teams. I think it's fair to say Steve over the last 5 years, a large chunk of time was spent talking about capital efficiency, how we can optimize those toggles and of course with Basel III endgame pending and the annual CCAR process ongoing. We, of course, continue dedicate time to that. But the C change over the last number of quarters and it is accelerated now into 2024 is we're actively talking about the income statement, about delivering earnings growth, earnings momentum that obviously then ties into the returns on capital that we were able to generate this quarter. But we're looking to make investments, strategic investments in top human capital now and then when it comes about, but we're being pretty judicious about that. This is a great platform and we have a great team, but we need to be running this thing super efficiently. And that is why reiterating the efficiency ratio of 70% in January was so important and that we put up 71% this quarter where it was a generally constructive environment. I think I called it a relatively constructive environment, but there's clearly more operating leverage to be had when you get to the higher brackets of ISG and then as you move to the funnel of wealth. So the focus on generating that operating leverage and keeping the income statement really tight is very much on the minds of the leadership team. Steven Chubak : That's great color. And just for my follow-up, relating to the wealth management margins, unpacking some of the different component pieces, given continued strong fee momentum, nice to see the inflection in NNA too. It sounds like NII is close to stabilizing just given some of the key drivers and inputs. And the focus on efficiency just throwing all of that in the blender does suggest that this 26% is probably a reasonable jumping off point and you can build off that base, but I was hoping you could maybe provide some context around that? Sharon Yeshaya : Well, what I would say is that we put out our goals in the last strategy deck and we're obviously making progress towards those goals. When you think about what gets you to 30%, the framework that we've offered the investment community is that there is sort of 3 parts to it. The first is migration to advice, the second and really the monetization of the funnel will go through this. The second when you think about it is solutions and products that we're offering, and then the third is the benefits of scale. And what was encouraging about this quarter is that all three of those things happened. The first being the fee based flows that we saw at $26 billion came from brokerage accounts. They came from people taking money that was already in the channel that we said will eventually be deployed, and it is being deployed and that's what you're seeing here. If you look back, it's a, that particular transition, that conversion is at a 2-year peak. Again, encouraging color, Steve. The second piece, solutions, products, differentiated offering. I called out structured products. People have interest in products, as Ted said, as markets begin to improve, those could be new issuance, that can be derivatives, that can be solutions through structured notes. That's what we're seeing beginning to happen here. So yes, again, an encouraging sign. And the third is that we continue to gain the benefits of scale and operating leverage. So all three things are working, of course there is room to run, but what we're trying to do is make sure that we also have the right tradeoffs between investing in the business, giving ourselves room for technology, and being able to build a 30% margin for sustainable business and durable revenues over time. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : I'd love to start with a question on NII. I know I've asked this in the past, but we saw stability in the Wealth Management NII, which Sharon you've spoken at linked about both from this and in fact, but we did see the firm wide NII dip again and it was the fourth quarter where the firm wide NII declined. So could you explain how those diverged and maybe what caused some of that divergence? Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. I think we've talked about it before, Brennan. But I'm happy to talk about it again and highlight that the reason that we point you to the wealth management NII is it's a business driven NII. When we look at the trading NII and we look at firm NII, it really depends on the products that you have, where you're booking them, what you're using as your funding sources. That falls into the various pieces of the trading revenue. So we call, we focus you in from our disclosures really on the wealth management NII when that NII is being driven by a business concept rather than just where you might be booking certain trading trades. Brennan Hawken : Is there something going on in the institutional NII that would cause sort of steady declines, and with those specific products that maybe might be a trend that we could explore a little bit? Sharon Yeshaya : No, I would really step you back and tell you that that's not how we manage the business and the trading revenue is going to fall where the trading revenue falls based on the products that we transact in that quarter. And the wealth management revenue, I've given you the drivers with the deposits, with interest rates, with spreads and with reinvestment and really two separate things that you should looking at. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : You had big year-over-year growth in Wealth Management client assets up by about 20%, but the Wealth Management revenues increased by 5%, still decent growth, but it seems like a little disconnect there. So I'm wondering what kind of wealth management client assets you're growing? Sharon Yeshaya : Certainly. So when you're growing the wealth management client assets, it's going to be all sorts of places. Like I said, we begin to see assets, they can come in actually in the brokerage side. And over time they will migrate or can migrate based on the client preferences into the advice side. Those different assets are going to have different fees associated with them. For us it's about growing the funnel, Mike, and then beginning to see this movement towards advice. Now I'd also point out that once you're in the advice led channel, even if you're in the fee-based channel, you might not directly be in the S&P. There is a composite, there might be preferences to be in fixed income products, there might be preferences to be in equity products. But for us it's about building sustainable durable revenue over time. First, you bring in the clients and the participants, we've seen the participants grow. Then you bring in the assets. We've seen the assets grow. That then comes into the brokerage accounts, which eventually moves into the advice-based accounts, and we continue to see great trends in the advice driven model, in fee-based assets and the advice the asset management revenues. The asset management revenues, Mike at a record high, so I would just highlight that as well as proof point that this model is working. Mike Mayo : And then just one follow-up for Ted. Ted, I think your outlook for the industry capital markets was about as bullish as we've heard yet. I think you used the word potpourri. IPOs in the valley, cross border by sector, financial sponsor, Japan, highest in years, event financing, specifically, what are your backlogs? How do they compare with last quarter? And just one more time, the level of your conviction that this time is for real, because there's been a lot of false starts the last 2 years? Ted Pick : Yes, I think it's a reasonable question. The backlogs are all up. I think it will be a slow march back. People are not going to jump into some of the speculative paper that we saw during the SPAC period clearly. But the receptivity to recent IPOs that were high quality was quite impressive, quite broad interest among investors. The need to execute on cross-border M&A is here. It's for many companies an existential reality. Their supply chains have been disrupted by 2 major global conflicts and they need to near shore and make the trade off, which means they need to potentially bolt on piece of supply chain that's in front of them. They may need to take regulatory risk. There may need to be structuring and financing advice around that so called solutions where we think we're strong. The other motivating piece, Mike, is and I do think there's going to be growing consensus on this. The financial sponsor community is sitting on product that has a 3, 4, 5-year life as a private company ready to come out one way or the other, either through a public offering or to be sold in the private markets. That is the best way for the financial sponsor community to return capital to their LPs and keep the thing going with raising ever big funds. So there will be a competitive dynamic I believe between the financial sponsor and corporate community with respect to assets that are available, whether they are public or private in order to continue to create value for their LPs or shareholders. The fact that the U.S. Economy continues to grow, that China is weaker, that parts of Europe are weaker, highlights the fact that people indeed want to get even more exposure to the U.S. With respect to Japan, what's interesting there is most of our client base are both buyers and sellers of assets, which is to say they're sitting on enormous yen denominated deposits, but they wish to grow the economy. So that is a market obviously where we're active in the financial sponsor and corporate communities both in and out will continue to be. So, I am quite bullish about the full investment bank capability for those that have a global reach. It could take several years and have some lumpiness along the way. But I think the next 3, 4, 5 years will be quite active. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : I'm hoping you could provide an update on overall client cash levels within wealth and how you think about the revenue opportunity as that cash is eventually redeployed? Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. So we did see the percentage of client cash. So we've given you I think 22% in the advisory channel is now down to, say, 21%, 20% levels depending on what channels that you're looking at. But that, I would say, is not a function of the actual cash levels coming down, but rather that the equity markets have risen, so just to be clear in terms of the actual mix. The reason I bring up those percentages is they are still high relative to the pre-COVID historical levels of, say, 17%, 18% that we've given on previous calls. So there is still room to see the deployment of cash over time into the markets. Dan Fannon : Understood. And as a follow-up, in the release you mentioned about half of the flows came from your family office offering. Not sure we've heard that stat before or so I was hoping you could bring in, some provide some context in terms of the size of that business for you? And then also just the mix of flows more broadly in terms of the channels, if you could provide a few more specifics in terms of the percentage breakdown? Sharon Yeshaya : Absolutely. I'm so glad you asked, as it relates to the family office offering because we have been talking about it for some time. We launched and we really formally enhanced our family office offering in 2021. We discussed it on some of our earnings calls as a place where you could begin to see the integrated firm, and by that I mean a way to offer our wealth management clients different solutions from institutional securities. So our fund management products, where you're actually able to look at your portfolio from a more integrated basis the way that you would as an institutional client. As we begin to offer new solutions to our clients, these are more ways to get touch points with different and deepen different client relationships and bring them on board. So this is an example of that. The reason we pointed out is also to highlight to you that there are lumpy flows that come through these channels. And so when we say these flows can be lumpy, there are different sales channels across the offering and those different channels have different sales cycles and so therefore you will see ins and outs of various pieces of NNA over time, but in this particular quarter and over the long-term history we have seen a very diversified set of channels. We have the workplace, we obviously have the advice-based relationship, different pieces of stock plan, et cetera that come in through the channel and there is diversification there. Ted Pick : Yes. What I'd add to that is, to Sharon's point on integrated firm, we have this Sharon made reference to this gem of a business that we have in the institutional equities division called Fund Services, which caters to alternative asset managers and effectively does their documentation work and effectively all of the release to their LPs. The question that has been asked over the last number of years is, when some of these folks go on to open their family office and manage their own wealth? What about having a product that has the feel of an institutional product from when they were running their asset manager for their family office or for related business. So the folks in Fund Services got together with the folks in wealth management who run our outsourced CIO product and they effectively came up with a mousetrap that gives the look of an institutional product for folks who are very much in the ultra-high net worth category. And this helps work towards a piece of the wealth bracket that we've all been focused on over the last number of years, which is the very high net worth space, which is very competitive. But in bringing together some of the capability and kit from the equities business over to the wealth business and have them work together with the founder in her next life managing a family office. It's actually a nice seamless way to keep the funds in house and to deliver institutional style capability to clients. So this is something we are putting our foot on the accelerator on and is a great example of our equities division and the wealth management folks are working hand in glove to deliver something for clients. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP. Devin Ryan : A question just on trading. Obviously, results have just been incredibly resilient at a high level. And I know you all have spoken about both market share opportunities for Morgan Stanley, but then there's still this kind of expansion of the overall industry wallet. So love to maybe just hit on that second point. And when you think about that wallet opportunity, the expansion of the wallet, what are some of the biggest opportunities in kind of the growth out rooms? I think a lot of us are sitting here saying results have been phenomenal. How can they continue to improve from here? Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. I'll take that. When you think about the expansion of the wallet and consider where we came from and where we are now, as more and more of the corporations and coverage of the corporations is becoming more integrated, there are many solutions that a bank such as ourselves can offer, be that from a global perspective, if you think about where rates are as just a tangible example, interest rate hedging that you can offer corporations as they think about transactions. There are different types of foreign exchange transactions that you could think about when you're looking at M&A or you're looking at other corporate deals that you have to do in house for a global franchise. So there are corporate solutions that you see, we expect to see growth in from a wallet perspective, and there's also financing where you have different types of markets and channels that are growing, private credit being an example. We're financing different assets by different types of sponsors are places where we could see opportunities for a wallet share growth more broadly. Ted Pick : And what I would add to that is, we're in the middle of the PE ecosystem. With respect to M&A financing risk, if you ask a number of the asset managers, both real money and alternative asset managers, they would say we are a partner of choice. So opportunity exists within credit, where there's a big focus on the financing side. It's obviously stable revenue and we're getting after some of the opportunities that lie across fixed income and inside of our new issue business to originate structure, finance credit, of course, a focus on private credit and then in equities to continue to expand our prime brokerage capability and to build out derivatives. So this ecosystem around the financial sponsors who know our firm very well with all of the integrated firm capability, this is a space and a client base that we are focused on along with, of course, our leading strategic clients on the corporate side. Devin Ryan : And then a follow-up just on the debt capital markets outlook, obviously very strong quarter. We have heard a little bit about maybe some pull forward, just on the year in terms of people front loading. And so, just want to get a sense of whether you feel like that may play down as well for Morgan Stanley. And then when you think about the pipeline for debt underwriting, I appreciate that deals come together quickly, so there's maybe not as much of a formal pipeline. But is the tone there similarly strong is what you're seeing for M&A and equity underwriting? And also appreciate there's probably some interconnectivity there as well. Sharon Yeshaya : Yes. I would point you to as you said there is interconnectivity. Remember that I think many of the peers have also mentioned there could have been some pull forward that you saw. It's also been a market that's been open over the course of the last 2 years. So I wouldn't draw these same parallel that you might have seen in M&A or in equity where you had a real dearth of activity the last 2 years, but rather that market especially in IG has been relatively open. When you think about high yield and other non-IG kinds of concepts and of course there is the event related transactions, but from an IG market, that market has been well open over the last 2 years. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Ted, you had some very encouraging comments on the outlook for the capital markets, which is great. Question for you, you mentioned about the high yield and leveraged loan market. You're starting to see event financing, which is good. How is the competition from the private credit side because they have made inroads obviously in the last couple of years? Are you guys seeing that the traditional investment banks are gaining some of that market share back? Ted Pick : The competition is real. And we all need to adapt to stay relevant in the ecosystem. I think there's going to be room for folks in the private space to participate in deals. But I certainly do not believe as some seem to suggest that the global investment banks will not have a large role to play as underwriters of securities and all the benefits that that brings to the issuer versus someone issuing private credit and potentially being the owner over time if things don't go well. So I think we're in a world where the ecosystem will at times have many of the players acting as partners. Sometimes we'll act as counterparties and at times even competitors. But I think the ecosystem has more than enough room on a global basis for both the emerging private credit space, but also the incumbents to continue to be able to do their thing. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And just as a quick follow-up to that, once again your outlook is very encouraging. 10 years up again today, there's talk of it moving even higher. You know, the front end of the curve is talking about higher for longer. If we get into a really higher for longer rate environment, does that kind of weigh on some of the optimism of the outlook that you presented today or no, it doesn't really have a material impact on it? Ted Pick : Well, it's a great question. It depends on whether rates are higher because they are sustaining continued growth in the U.S. or if they are higher for a period of time and are followed by a tough landing, in which case we're in recession and clearly then things will slow down. I think our view is that the U.S. economy continues to progress quite nicely, that balance sheets amongst our client base are quite strong, both on the institutional side and on the wealth side, and that there is plenty to do and that the higher rates that we see are in part, if not more than in part dictated by a view that we continue to have some inflation and that the economy is in healthy shape and maybe asynchronously relative to other places in the world. But that again speaks to U.S. strength and as you know, first and foremost, we have our activity based in the U.S. But over time, there will be strength in places again like Japan and Europe, and then eventually in the China complex where we will be busy too. So my bullishness is not a mark-to-market on any given week or month. It's a view that corporate boardrooms have been quiet for 3, 4 years and that is not sustainable. They need to move. They're ready to move before the pandemic, then the pandemic came and then there were higher rates. Those higher rates seem to be well absorbed. Yes, now we need to have models that factor in appropriate cost of capital, as we saw in prior regimes where cost of capital matter. And now we're in a period that comes after financial repression, where we'll have some inflation and some real rates and companies and financial sponsors will adapt and the strong companies will prosper. So we are setting up for that and we believe will be a multiyear cycle. And I would say finally that what we're most excited about of course is the model that we are working with both the institutional community, but also our wealth management clients to adapt and to optimize as we move into the next cycle. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone, for participating. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. Welcome to Morgan Stanley's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimers. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Morgan Stanley does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements in this discussion. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Ted Pick. Ted Pick : Good morning and thank you for joining us. The firm generated $15 billion in revenue, $1.82 in EPS, and a 17.5% return on tangible in the second quarter. [Solid earnings] (ph) and demonstration of operating leverage completes a strong first half of 2024. $30 billion in revenue, $6 billion in earnings, and an 18.6% return on capital. In institutional securities, we're beginning to see the benefits from our continued focus on our world-class investment banking franchise, with revenues up 50% year-over-year, including a 70% increase year-over-year in fixed income underwriting. In institutional equities, we are back with a $3 billion quarter. In wealth, we posted margins of 27%, and across wealth and investment management, we've now grown total client assets to $7.2 trillion on our road to $10 trillion plus. Together, we delivered strong operating leverage. Further, on the back of the annual stress test results, we announced that we will increase the dividend by $0.075 for the third year in a row to [$0.925] (ph), reflecting the growth of our durable earnings over time. During the quarter, we built $1.5 billion of capital, and at quarter end, our CET1 ratio is 15.2%, 170 basis points above the forward requirement. Our capital position provides us the flexibility to continue to support dividend growth, support our clients, and buy the stock back opportunistically. The quarter also showed continued balance in both top-line and profitability across the major segments. Wealth and institutional securities produced $6.8 billion and $7 billion in revenue respectively, with earnings also roughly split between our institutional businesses and wealth and investment management. Our businesses are working closely together to maximize adjacent opportunities across the integrated firm. Across the investment bank, navigating changes in the cycle means being deliberate around risk management and, given geopolitical uncertainty, where we spend our time to deliver clients, solutions, and to capture share. In wealth management, we continue to focus on aggregating assets and delivering strong advice. In investment management, we are investing in secular growth areas, including customization and real assets. Year-to-date, annualized growth in net new assets and wealth management is over 5%, with another strong quarter of over $25 billion in fee-based flows. Strong fee-based flows support daily revenue, which on average continues to be about $100 million each day this year throughout and show the stability and continued growth of the wealth franchise. We are well navigating the continued uncertainty around forward rate path, geopolitics, and now the US Political cycle and expect those to be the themes for the balance of the year. We remain focused on our best-in-class talent and building out best-in-class infrastructure to support ongoing growth across wealth and investment management and institutional securities. I wanted to reiterate our strategy, which is clear to advise individuals and institutions around the world in raising, managing, and allocating capital. World-class execution demands that we deliver strong earnings and returns through the cycle, that we do so while maintaining robust capital levels, and that we deliver on a durable growth narrative across the segments. And then Morgan Stanley executes on this strategy in a first-class way [Blue] (ph). That's it in a nutshell. And finally, in reflecting on this weekend's assassination attempt, we share in the hope that in the months to come, we will as Americans, find ways to unify and preserve our better selves. With that, Sharon will now take us through the quarter in greater detail. Thank you. Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you and good morning. In the second quarter, the firm produced revenues of $15 billion. Our EPS was $1.82 and our ROTCE was 17.5%. Results highlight the power and scale of our integrated firm. The resilience of the US economy and a more stable near-term outlook on rates supported conviction amongst clients. Institutional securities drove performance, led by strength and equity and a pickup in investment banking. Wealth management also delivered on our established strategy, reporting record durable asset management fees and strong fee-based flows. Together, improved confidence and higher client engagement along with our focus on prioritizing investments, yielded operating leverage, and profitability. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 72% benefiting from scale and reductions in our expense base. Year-to-date expenses benefited from lower litigation expenses, the absence of back office integration related costs and severance, as well as our dedicated effort to prioritize our current spend. On prioritization, we remain committed to client and asset growth, technology, and targeted investments to ensure robust infrastructure that supports growth and addresses ongoing regulatory expectations. Now to the businesses. Institutional securities revenues of $7 billion increased 23% versus last year, capturing the strengths of the integrated investment bank across US, and international markets. Higher activity in Asia contributed to results. Strong performance in institutional equity, as well as debt underwriting, demonstrate the breadth of our client franchise. In our markets business, opportunities unfolded on the back of global political events and macroeconomic data. Investment banking revenues were $1.6 billion. The 51% increase from the prior year was broad-based. We continue to invest in investment banking across talent and lending, broadening and deepening our global coverage footprint in key sectors, including financials, healthcare, technology, and industrials. These investments are beginning to have an impact as capital markets improve and activity picks up. Advisory revenues were $592 million, reflecting an increase in our completed M&A activity versus the prior year. The pre-announced M&A backlog continues to build and suggests diversification across sectors. Equity underwriting revenues of $352 million improved versus the prior year, driven by increases across most products, but remain below historical averages. From a geographical perspective, we brought a number of transactions to market in Europe and Asia, demonstrating the importance of having a strong global market footprint. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $675 million, well above five-year historical averages. Results reflect a meaningful pickup in non-investment grade loan and bond issuance, as tighter spreads and strong CLO issuance provided opportunities for refinancing. The investment banking backdrop continues to improve, led by the US, the advisory and underwriting pipelines are healthy across regions and sectors. Inflation data has continued to moderate, which has helped stabilize front-end rates and support boardroom confidence and sponsor reengagement. As buyers and sellers make progress to close the valuation gap, we expect that we are still in the early innings of an investment banking rebound. Subject to changes in [rate past] (ph) expectations and geopolitical developments, our integrated investment bank is well-positioned to service our clients. Turning to equity, we continue to be a global leader in this business. Equity revenues of over $3 billion, up 18% compared to last year, reflect strong results across business and regions. Higher client engagement, dynamic risk management, and strength in Asia all contributed to performance. Prime brokerage revenues were strong and increased from the prior year as client balances reached new peaks. Regionally, we witnessed higher client activity in Asia and seasonal patterns in Europe. Cash results increased versus last year, reflecting higher volumes across regions. Derivative results were up versus last year's second quarter as client activity was higher and the business navigated the market environment well. Further, the business benefited from corporate activity on the back of convertible issuances, additional evidence of the integrated firm at work. Fixed income revenues of $2 billion increased year-over-year. Macro performance was up versus the prior year. Despite lower realized volatility, clients were engaged around elections and political events in the quarter. Micro results improved year-over-year, driven by the growth of our more durable revenues as we continue to support our clients with financing solutions. Solid results in commodities were in-line with the prior year. Turning to ISG lending and provisions. In the quarter, ISG provisions were $54 million, driven by certain individual commercial real estate loans. Net charge-offs were $48 million, primarily related to two commercial real estate loans for which we had previously already taken provisions. Turning to Wealth Management. Wealth Management generated strong results generating revenues of $6.8 billion with record asset management fees. Our PBT margin continued to make progress towards our goal, demonstrating our ability to grow and generate operating leverage through the cycle. We are delivering on our differentiated, scaled multichannel asset gathering strategy. Wealth Management client assets reached $5.7 trillion. Moving to our business metrics in the second quarter. Pretax profit was $1.8 billion up year-over-year with a reported margin of 26.8%. DCP negatively impacted our margin by approximately 100 basis points. The margin demonstrates the inherent operating leverage of our asset gathering strategy. We are improving the efficiency with which we run the business. Asset management revenues of $4 billion were up 16%. That is more than $500 million in fees versus the prior year. It's driven by higher average asset levels and the impact of cumulative positive fee-based flows. In the quarter, fee-based flows of $26 billion were strong, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of over $20 billion, bringing the year-to-date fee-based flows to $52 billion. We are seeing a steady migration of assets from adviser-led brokerage accounts to fee-based accounts, evidence that investments in our client acquisition funnel are paying-off. Fee-based assets now stand at $2 trillion. Net new assets were $36 billion reflecting headwinds from seasonal tax payments. Year-to-date, net new assets are $131 billion representing 5% annualized growth of beginning period assets. Net flows will be lumpy in any given period of time and impacted by both the macroeconomic environment and business specific factors. We believe both tax-related outflows and increased spending, particularly among high net worth clients, impacted flows this quarter. Still our first half NNA growth remains solid. Transactional revenues were $782 million. Excluding the impact of DCP revenues were up 5% versus last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher equity-related transactions. Bank lending balances grew by $4 billion to $151 billion evidence that as the macroeconomic backdrop stabilizes, our lending capabilities can be met and can meet our diversified client needs. Total deposits of $343 billion remains stable, with sweep deposits down approximately $10 billion sequentially mostly offset by growth in CDs. Net interest income was down modestly to $1.8 billion reflecting the decline in sweeps, which was largely attributable to the seasonality of tax payments. The Wealth Management business continued to perform well, aggregating assets, generating fees and benefiting from scale and our differentiated offering, consistently earning approximately $100 million a day. In the third quarter, we intend to make changes to our advisory sweep rates against the backdrop of changing competitive dynamics. The impact of these intended changes will be largely offset with the expected gains from the repricing of our investment portfolio. Therefore third quarter NII will be primarily driven by the path of sweeps, and NII could decline modestly in the third quarter. Importantly inclusive of these pricing changes, the rate path and our expectations around client behavior, we believe that NII should inflect higher as you look out into next year. Our Wealth Management strategy is predicated on gathering assets, meeting our clients' lending needs and offering advice. Asset management fees, the core of our Wealth Management strategy, continues to produce strong results reaching a record this quarter. Taken together, we delivered a strong margin, and we continue to work towards 30% margins over time. This quarter, we reached approximately $19 million in relationships across our three channels, and we continue to invest in order to deepen engagement. AI tools are helping advisers grow, and Wealth Management's partnership with institutional securities is increasing connectivity around our workplace offering. These investments have supported flows to our adviser-led channel, where average client duration is nearly 15 years and growing. The steady progress supports our journey towards $10 trillion-plus in total client assets. Turning to Investment Management. Revenues of $1.4 billion increased 8% from the prior second quarter, supported by higher asset management revenue. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion up 6% year-over-year, reflecting higher average AUM. Total AUM ended the quarter at $1.5 trillion. Performance-based income and other revenues were $44 million as gains were driven primarily by our infrastructure, US private credit and US private equity funds, reflecting our investments in secular growth areas. We recorded long-term net outflows of approximately $1 billion. We continue to see strong momentum across areas of strategic focus, namely Parametric. Consistent with current industry trends, we saw outflows in our active equity strategies. Our business is well-positioned given strength in areas of secular growth, such as customization, direct indexing and private alternatives. Our continued focus on global distribution combined with our deep structuring and product creation capabilities, should support incremental growth. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets decreased $16 billion from the prior quarter to $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.2%. Client activity was strong and markets were open. We actively supported clients with a focus on velocity of resources. We also grew our CET1 capital by $1.5 [billion] (ph), reflecting strong earnings and continued capital distribution. The most recent stress test results reaffirm our durable business model and strong capital position. For the third year in a row, we announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.075. Having generated over $3.85 of earnings per share and an 18.6% ROTCE year-to-date, we enter the back half of the year from a position of strength, with a robust capital base to support clients. Investment Banking pipelines are healthy and diverse, dialogues are active and markets are open. In Wealth Management, strong fee-based flows and the realization of operating leverage continue to demonstrate that our strategy is working. As capital markets become more active, we see opportunities for retail clients to engage and over time deploy their cash and cash equivalent balances into fee-based products. With that, we will now open the line up to questions. Operator : We are now ready to take any questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, there. Thank you. Ted Pick : Good morning, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. Sharon, I appreciate all the upfront commentary on NII and Wealth. I wanted to drill down a little bit on what you said. So if you have $2 trillion in client assets in advisory and they keep a handful of percent of money in cash, that change you are making in rate paid on advisory -- on deposit in advisory accounts, can add up to like a good amount of money. So I wanted to get a little more sharper focus on what you said about 2025 NII? And then what exactly did you say the offset is on the NII? Thanks. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. Thanks, Glenn for the question. Actually, the portion that -- of the sweep balances that are impacted are as you mentioned, the sweep on the adviser-led channel, which is actually a small portion of the overall BDP that we disclose. So it\u2019s a small portion of that overall stack. And the increase in pricing is being offset largely by the repricing of the investment portfolio, right? So as things mature and that investment portfolio reprices, it's that change in the quarter amount that will offset it when we look ahead. Glenn Schorr : And is there a particular reason why you only have to focus on repricing in this smaller portion than of the adviser-led channel, meaning not --. Sharon Yeshaya : Certainly. Yes, what I would note there is that what we think about -- when we think about sweeps, broadly is mainly in transactional accounts. And in those transactional accounts, we have a wide range of choices and products for our clients. And so therefore, they have a lot of options as you think about their transactional accounts and brokerage. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hi, good morning. Ted Pick : Good morning Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning Ted. Just maybe sticking with NII and more importantly, on pretax margin, right? You had an extremely strong quarter. The stock's weaker this morning, and it has to do with the NII drag on wealth revenues and margin. So one I think, Sharon, your level of visibility into NII, lots of moving pieces around client behavior, maybe we get interest rate cuts. Just give us a sense of, if history is any guide on, what rate cuts would imply for client behavior? Or is there cash to assets that you are looking at that gives you comfort around NII potentially stabilizing post 3Q? And then maybe a question -- go ahead, yes. Sharon Yeshaya : Yes. So why don't I take that, and then you can ask your second question. So you are pointing at a great point Ebrahim, as we look ahead through time, which was the second point of my guidance, is that when we look over the next year, we\u2019re seeing and we expect that we should see an inflection in NII. And that is predicated on the points that you mentioned, which is that as you see rate cuts, we would expect those balances to stabilize. Remember, outside of the tax quarter this particular quarter, we had been seeing a stabilization in those sweep deposits. So it's important to recognize that, that has been happening, reaching that frictional level of transactional cash. So that would likely continue. And then over time, you would also begin to see a benefit as rates to be cut, that BDP could actually see inflows, which you've seen from a historical perspective. But in addition to that, you have two other factors. One is the repricing of the portfolio, which I've also already mentioned. And the second piece has to do with lending. We look to continue to support our clients with lending products, and you are beginning to also see that potentially reach an inflection. This is the first quarter that we've seen this type of lending growth since the interest rate hikes began. We've seen now use of SBL products rather than just it being offset by paydowns. So those are all encouraging signs when we look ahead over the course of the next year for NII. Ebrahim Poonawala : That\u2019s helpful. And I guess my second question was, just talking to investors, when we look at the 30% pretax margin target, the question is whether this is aspirational, whether the bar is set too high given how competitive the business is. So remind us in terms of your comfort level on the 30% pretax margin, to the extent you can, the time-line of when we get there? And when we get there, should that be a sustainable pace for the business? Thanks. Ted Pick : Thanks, Ebrahim. Confidence level, high. If you take a step back, there are three pieces to the Wealth Management line; asset management, transactional, net interest income, as you know. In the asset management context, those are fees that are going to fee-based accounts, advisory-led. Those figures are up 4% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. That is fee-paying advice. Last quarter, the net new assets into that category was $26 billion. So fee-based flows -- that continues to be a growth piece of the Wealth Management store. The second cylinder is transactional. Transactional has been relatively weak, which is a link to general weakness in overall capital markets activity. And as you hear from our bullish commentary with respect to overall corporate finance activity in the investment bank, that will bleed through over time to the transactional line. And then third, the net interest income line. And as Sharon said, that will inflect and should inflect over the next year. You put those together, the scale of the business, the funnel, and the processing of $100 million of revenues a day that continue to grow, we are going to continue to achieve operating leverage. It's that simple. We're investing in E TRADE. We're investing in the traditional advisor, and we're spending a lot of time top of house focused on workplace, which we think is an enormous opportunity across our corporate and sponsor base. In January, I had said 30% was the goal. We were in the mid-20s. We just printed 27% GAAP, 28% [Ex-CPE] (ph). It's a core stated objective. It will take some quarters to get there, but we intend on achieving it over time as we continue to grow assets and scale in the business. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Ted Pick : Good morning Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi, Ted, you've said this and Sharon repeated this that the industry is only in the early innings of an investment banking rebound. I have to say we've heard that for a couple of years and there now is this time, why is this time real? Do you expect the rebound to continue through the normally slow summer period before the election? How many years? What gives you confidence that this is for real? And how much is your backlog up quarter-over-quarter? Ted Pick : It's an excellent question because you're exactly right that a number of folks have been calling for this and it has been sort of a delayed shoots if you will. But I think now we are seeing some tempering of the inflation prints and some normalization rates. We are also beginning along with that to see the market broaden-out. You of course have seen that over the last number of weeks. And I think, we can now expect broader corporate finance activity to quicken, whether that is across the corporate community or sponsors or other institutions. And the early sign of this kind of activity can be seen in the convertibles product. Global convertibles activity is up significantly. And as you know, on the margin ladder, it typically goes converts, IPO, and then M&A. In the context of bake-offs and the like, in some spaces we are seeing bake-offs running at triple plus the year-over-year rate that they were at for sectors and for some of our client groups. We've been seeing now the launch of traditional IPOs and we are seeing M&A pipeline kicking in. So corporate community, sponsor community, cross-border community, I think we are in the early stages of a multi-year investment banking-led cycle. If you believe the economy is going to hold up led by the US, you should expect then to see that if there is some regulatory normalization too across a whole bunch of the sectors that are typically most active. So we are quite convicted on this call. Mike Mayo : And just one pushback, I mean with interest rates, you know, so much higher than they've been in the past. Don't you think that could get in the way when people are looking to borrow money for deals and the like? Is this a matter of simply waiting for rates to go lower? Or that's not going to get in the way? Ted Pick : I mean it's a fair question. You've written about this in the context of what was the normal before financial repression, right? And I would take the view that in the context of the last 15 years, even some normalization, because I don't know that we are going to go into a full-blown rate cycle to your point, some normalizations of rates will still have you at 3% or 4% on the front-end and even some steepening potentially. So now we are just back to the old weighted average cost of capital of mid-90s in most normal economic periods. And the game will have to go on because there is just been some activity that has been suppressed by any kind of measure percentage of asset stock percentage of market cap. And the stickiness that we are seeing in the sponsor community, too needs to unglue. There is an enormous, as you know multitrillion-dollar stockpile between the two sides of sitting on inventory that needs to be released and then dry powder that's been raised. That will act as a competitive weapon against the competitive bid from the corporate community that has to contend with the reality of a smaller world with real sovereign risk and real cost of capital differences from one jurisdiction to another. So in short, unless you were to tell me we are going to go into a full-blown recession, which none of us can call, and that even if we saw rates normalize to something that is along the lines of the historic 4% on the front end, I think you will see over the next number of quarters and really over the next number of years, a resumption of more normalized M&A activity, with the key difference being that the financial sponsor community is now institutionally come of age. They have global reach. They can work the entire capital structure. They will work in concert with corporate partners, as you know. They don't actually have to act as a lone wolves, and they can work with us to finance the package. So it is not just the straight M&A advise or the straight IPO, it would also be bespoke offerings in the private public space, interest rate and foreign exchange hedging and the other ornaments on the investment banking tree that a couple of the leading global investment banks can bring. And this is really why, over the last couple of years, the extent we've done a so-called front-office hiring, it really has been to target several very high-quality investment bankers who typically have spent their entire careers at one firm and have decided to come to the Morgan Stanley platform. And we are seeing the fruits of that across industries. So I am quite bullish on it. Certainly take your point that has been a number of quarters on sort of on the promise. But I think as we get into 2025 and the election coming and then the election behind us, we should see that activity continue on a sustainable pace. Operator : Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ted Pick : Good morning Dan. Dan Fannon : Thanks good morning. I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the flows in the quarter within Wealth, maybe the breakdown from the channels and contribution. Last quarter, I think we saw a Family Office be an outsized contributor. But hoping to get a little bit more color on where the flows were sourced in 2Q. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. I'll take that. It's -- we continue to see broad-based sourcing in terms of where those assets are coming from. In this particular quarter, as I mentioned the biggest offset and drag though, is really from taxes. So it's -- you still have a workplace accounts. You still have the advice-based account directly. You still have self-directed. All those places remain contributors. What continues in my mind to be most interesting though, isn't just the contribution that you are getting from the three various channels, but the fact that you have in the advice-based channel, it's not just coming from existing clients, but it's split with existing and net new clients. And some of those net new clients are also relationships that are being sourced from workplace. So I would not just directly focus on what channel is it coming from, but how are you seeing those channel in that interplay work, because that's actually the power of the differentiated platform. Once you have somebody who wants more differentiated advice for self-directed speaks to an advisor, that advisor sees net new clients, bring in assets, and then that's new acquisitions into the funnel and eventually into fee-based. So it's really the whole ecosystem that I would call your attention to, rather than just one isolated leg. Ted Pick : Which is part of the reason that workplace is so important, because at workplace, I can continue to experience success amongst the corporate and sponsor community that has an affinity effect on the top of the house at those institutions in terms of their own wealth, and then potentially other products around it. So it can be an indirect sale where you aren't necessarily going directly to the prospective client via the FA, but you could actually work potential clients through the institutionalized effect of workplace where we do a great job educating on wellness -- financial wellness and then effectively institutionalizing ourselves by overseeing incentive comp through the Morgan Stanley Solium product and having succeeded on an MS at work mandate, which, as you know is a durable, sticky asset that effectively is seen by the entire employee base, you can start working your way up the funnel to the senior executives of that front. Dan Fannon : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ted Pick : Good morning Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Good morning Ted. Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to just drill down a little more to give the second follow-up here on the repricing change that you mentioned in your prepared comments, Sharon. So the repricing that we've seen in the securities book has been slow. So I'm just kind of curious as to why you think that will help offset the repricing actions that you are taking on the deposit side. Is that because it will be a phased repricing, and therefore there is an ability to have the phased benefit in the asset side offset? And then just a nitty-gritty question on it, is the switch going to be to money fund sweep rather than higher yielding deposits, and then that way you can just slowly replace that funding as you see [fit] (ph)? Sharon Yeshaya : So thanks, Brennan, I'll take that question. No, all the changes that we'll make will happen, are expected to happen in the third quarter. And so those different changes will be made, and they'll be based on various competitive dynamics. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Got it. And then is the -- is this going to be focused on the advisory relationship similar to what we've seen from some other wirehouse competitors? And could you just -- is it the changes that have been announced by Wells and BofAs, is that what you mean by competitive dynamics? Or is there something else that I'm not aware of? Sharon Yeshaya : That's exactly as I stated it, and it will just be limited as you said, to the sweeps that are dealt within the advisor-led channel. Operator : Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Ted Pick : Good morning Devin. Devin Ryan : Great. Good morning Sharon and hi. The first question, just on -- another one on the GWM flows. Sharon, you mentioned tax season is a factor, which you completely get. But then you also mentioned increased client spending. And I just wanted to drill into that, just whether that's something that could continue, whether it was seasonal or influenced by inflation? Just trying to understand that component of the impact on flows. Sharon Yeshaya : Yes. I think that's a really interesting question. I did call it out. We've seen increased spending by higher net worth, and so higher income bands are certainly spending. We see that in the data alongside actual spending. We see that in purchases of homes. We see that in various tailored investments. So they are -- that cohort, so to speak, is using its cash in different ways and its various investment in different ways. So I do think that -- that's an interesting dynamic that's playing out. I know that others have mentioned it within their portfolios as well. It's only something we are seeing in our data. Devin Ryan : Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then a follow-up just on the interplay between Investment Banking and Trading, and I appreciate the commentary on kind of the improving capital markets backdrop, which is great to hear and kind of the expectation from our end that there's going to be a lot more primary issuance in equities, maybe in debt as well as M&A picks up. So just trying to think about what that means for the trading businesses, equities and fixed income and whether you guys feel like we could maybe sustain around these really high levels or even maybe -- even the wallet could move higher just as you get a stronger primary issuance market? Ted Pick : Well, I know that competitive set will naturally speak to areas where integration can be an asset. Here, we have -- we believe, something really special inside of our Institutional Securities business, our so-called integrated investment bank, which has been ongoing for -- now we are getting on seven or eight years. Now under Dan Simkowitz's direction. And this is a sort of critical facet of business strategy at our place because you have now the appropriate and important relationships that have been built across fixed income, equities and banking through our capital markets new issue business. You have those now having been compounded and advanced by the mobilization of some folks from one division to another. So there is real familiarity now with the work product. A lot of the work product, as you know, is not traditional vanilla IPOs. Yes. There are some on the horizon that are quite substantial, and we'd expect that to be an important part of the calendar. But there is also a more bespoke product, whether it be convertibles or products in the private area or products that effectively necessitate high-quality structuring and advice, and that can only be brought to the boardroom if you have world-class investment bankers who can lean on the expertise of their colleagues, not just in the new issue business but as appropriate, in institutional equities and in fixed income. And if you look at our fixed income business, for example and fixed income underwriting, you'll see that the share gains have been quite extraordinary. And that the year-over-year revenue number, I believe is up 71%. That speaks to the fine work that's been done by folks, not just in the debt capital markets business which is housed inside of our new issue business linked to banking, but also working closely with fixed income professionals, whether they are in the securitized products group and our commodities area broader credit or in our macro space, i.e., interest rate and foreign exchange. So when you get into the knitting of ISG, our Integrated Investment Bank, you see that part of the reason that we are bullish, not just to Mike's earlier question on the denominator, but also on our ability to increase the numerator, is not so much because we think there is a need to deploy a lot more capital. We will do so as appropriate when the markets demand it. But that we are able to get the kind of bespoke advice for clients that comes from the familiarity of our people, the quality of the advice that is differentiated and importantly, that it's global, so that we can bring it to the client base. So that is part of, I think, the secret sauce that we've been working hard on to generate above cost of capital returns, inside the investment bank on a stand-alone basis. And that obviously doesn't include even the synergies that we'd see across the Firm into Wealth and Investment Management. But your question is on the investment bank specifically. And I feel really good about the way it's structured, the leadership that we have within it, the experience set, and then our ability now to tap into this next cycle which will be different than the last one. Rates will be well higher than that of financial repression. We'll be toggling between some bouts of inflation and potential recession. We'll be dealing with the unpredictability going to not only our own cycle, US election cycle, but the world around us. But also the coming of age and the institutionalization of the financial sponsor community, where we have very strong relationships with that leadership group from top to bottom across the Investment Bank, Wealth and Investment Management. Operator : For our next question, we'll move to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. Ted Pick : Good morning Steve. Steven Chubak : So maybe just starting off with a question just on operating leverage within ISG. Year-to-date, the incremental margins are quite strong, just north of 80%. You spoke constructively on IB and Trading and inflecting positively. Just want to better understand what you believe is a sustainable incremental margin as activity steadily builds especially given some of the growth, at least from here, may skew a bit more heavily towards Investment Banking, which tends to be more compensable. Sharon Yeshaya : So when you look at it, I would really focus Steve, on the efficiency ratio targets that we put for the whole firm, right? We think that the firm can run at or below the 70% over time through a durable cycle. The issue with your specific question, as you yourself highlighted is, it depends on where those different revenues are coming from. So there might be periods of time where it's higher BC&E related, there might be periods of time where you have different jurisdictions associated with it. But broadly speaking, the enterprise we've given 30% margins as it relates to Wealth and the sort of Wealth and Investment Management space, and then you have the ISG space. So by definition, if you're running at 70% efficiency ratio more broadly, you look for an entire enterprise to run at somewhere of a 30% margin. Ted Pick : Yeah. The only thing I would add to that is, of course as you know, there is real seasonality in the business. Fixed income tends to have its strongest quarter, street-wide in the first quarter, Investment Banking typically in the fourth quarter. That's not every year, but that's typically out shakes out. Third quarter tends to be weaker in the summer months, and then it's sort of all about September. And obviously, this September will be one that will be driven in part by sentiment around the upcoming elections. So that's kind of the seasonality piece. The other is just the scale within the businesses, I'd be remiss again, not to sort of underscore the importance of having reached $3 billion in the equities business. This has been a leading business where we have been Number 1 and Number 2 for the last dozen years. And we see the clients are much in demand of our services across cash, derivatives and prime brokerage. And then connecting to Investment Banking, I think that business has too hit an inflection point again where they can continue to prosecute high-margin business through the cycle. All of this, of course is dependent on the economy holding up and general asset price levels. But given where we are right now, we are feeling good about that, too. Steven Chubak : Thanks for that perspective. And just a follow-up on the deposit discussion. Both you and your wirehouse peers announced similar actions on deposits, which you noted, Sharon. You mentioned it was informed by competitive dynamics. But I wanted to better understand if there's any feedback you or your peers had received from regulators that prompted the decision? Because from our vantage point, the timing of these pricing actions at this stage of the rate cycle is simply difficult to reconcile? Sharon Yeshaya : I'm sorry, Steve, we don't comment, as you know on regular matters. Steven Chubak : Okay, fair enough. [I had to try] (ph) thanks for taking my questions. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning Ted, good morning Sharon. Ted Pick : Good morning, Gerard. How are you? Sharon Yeshaya : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Good. Thank you. You gave us good insights into your thinking about what the capital markets could bring, especially Investment Banking. And I think you touched on it in your comments with Ted, or maybe you Sharon, that the transactional numbers could benefit from a stronger ECM business. Can you then take the next second derivative and share with us from your experience of Solium, should we -- that business pick up the workplace channel, if more of these maybe private equity sponsor companies go public. Should the workplace channel see stronger revenues potentially in a stronger Investment Banking market over the next 12 months to 18 months? Sharon Yeshaya : I think that's a great question. I know, Gerard a few years ago, you also asked me about different values of those assets associated with what the underlying is. I completely agree with you. As you have workplace assets rise, the value of those client assets rise. New corporations issue their employees more stock. They also grow their employee base. It should absolutely add participants. It should add new corporates. It will add new net flows. And now that we have all of that -- when you just have Solium, now you also have E TRADE and workplace, and the platforms are integrated. So as those flows -- flow into an E TRADE account, people can transact on that. And then, as Ted said, we can also offer financial wellness. So absolutely, it helps that ecosystem begin to work. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And just as a follow-up, Ted, if I take a step back, obviously you guys have done a very good job in the last 10 years of growing organically, but then complementing that growth with acquisitions. Once we get the Basel III end game final proposal, maybe some G-SIB relief, can you share with us, as you look out over the next two, three years -- is there any parts of the picture today that you'd like to enhance possibly with acquisitions? Or -- are you good where you are today? Ted Pick : I will take the opportunity to sort of give a brief view on capital, if I could, Gerard, and link that to potential external opportunities. We anticipated or we believe it was possible that we could have a tougher annual CCAR test, and indeed it was. And what we've prioritized in potential uses of capital, above all things has been dividend policy. And as you know, we are increasing the dividend again to [$0.925] (ph), which at spot offers a 3.5% dividend yield. So that is the continued highest priority on use of capital. If you include of course, use of capital to inorganic opportunity. Second our clients. We have continued to lean in for clients, across the business segments as appropriate, and you see the operating leverage across the businesses, particularly across the investment bank. But we've also thought about the buyback opportunistically and have been buying stock back and returning capital. This past quarter, more than $2 billion between the dividend and the buyback, in a way that has been reflective of offering us that optionality. As we sit here today, we are 170 basis points above the buffer. And importantly, we continue to be in the 3.0 G-SIB buffer, which in one context would normally get much attention, but does get attention in the context of your question, which is sort of forward-looking strategic opportunity. It is worth noting if we can manage to stay at 3.0, assuming the framework holds through whatever Basel brings, that will be our buffer in 2026. So we are [170 basis points] (ph) over and we accreted $1.5 billion this quarter. External, i.e., inorganic, therefore, is something we can think about. It's just not something we're going to think about in the short term. The reality is we've got our forced hierarchy, the forced hierarchy is dividend first, investing in clients as appropriate, achieving operating returns against that second. And then third, the buyback opportunistically. Down the road, two, three, four years out, if opportunities come across the horizon, importantly after we have some definition around Basel and continued potential refinement of what we understand to be inside CCAR formulation, so just general regulatory uncertainty, sure, we might look at stuff. But I would tell you in the short-term, we're very happy with the acquisitions that we've made over the last 10 years, 12 years. And we are determined to generate operating leverage in each of the two major segments; Wealth and Investment Management and the Integrated Investment Bank, and then to obviously hit our efficiency ratios of 70% and the margins and returns that we've talked about. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Ted Pick : Good morning Saul. Saul Martinez : Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on an earlier question on the outlook for your sales and trading businesses. You've kind of consistently done about into $18 billion to $20 billion of annual revenue in the post-pandemic period, in [fixed and equities] (ph). And right now, we have a backdrop where we're going to see rate cuts, markets are strong, issuance activity may pick up. At the same time, you have perhaps more competition from foreign banks who have lost share. So how do you see -- do you have a view on how you see the wallet evolving for these businesses, your ability to maintain or gain share in this backdrop? And then I guess, ultimately, do you think you can grow revenues here from a base that is materially higher than what it was pre-pandemic? Ted Pick : I think the answer to that is that we would like to grow share that is durable. We want to grow share in businesses that are connected to the core client base, whether it be global asset managers, the leading alternative asset managers, private equity and private credit players that have come to the floor, and then our lead corporate and sovereign clients. There are products that can be offered. There are very few firms that can do that globally. We continue to have a world-class market space, for example in Asia, where I believe we have the largest equities business. We've been growing the business quite assiduously on the continent in the UK, where our senior management has been putting in a lot of time and attention. And as you know, we have a differentiated joint venture with our friends and partners at MUFG in Tokyo. So if you consider the global footprint of the firm -- in a world that continues to be equities-based. It continues to be an equities world. You see it in the asset price momentum in the US. You see now the potential for that to broaden to more names and more sectors. And that obviously gives opportunity for folks in the stock picking business for example, where we've been very strong traditionally in equities, to do the [cash rise] (ph) and prime brokerage suite that we offer. You could see continued uncertainty based on how the next administration handles the significant macro challenges facing the US, whether you'll see a steeper yield curve, where you'll see activity on the front and to the belly of the curve. That of course, offers all kinds of opportunities for the rates business. And connected to corporate catalyst activity, where, on an M&A acquisition, the acquirer may wish to inoculate themselves from rate or foreign exchange risk, and that's the service that we offer. Again, I like the idea of growing durably inside the integrated investment bank. I like the idea that we are working in sandboxes with the appropriate capital controls around that. But that we are allowing enough breathing space so that when our lead clients are looking to engage in a -- once in every few years catalyst event, that we can fully offer the entirety of the advice and financing spectrum to them on demand. So the answer would be to grow and grow responsibly. I'd like to think we can inch up the numerator along with the denominator, and then you would see that almost imperceptibly over the course of quarters and years. Saul Martinez : That's helpful. Thank you. Just I guess a quick follow-up, related follow-up. The ROE, 14% in ISG in the first half of the year early on, as you highlighted, in Investment Banking cycle. Do you have a view on where the ISG -- Institutional Securities ROE can get to as the Investment Banking cycle kind of plays out? Is there a view on sort of what a normalized ROE would be here. Ted Pick : We're still early. We're still early in the cycle. We're watching it of course. To the earlier question on when the green [shoes] (ph) come through on the high-margin M&A product, the reality of seasonality, the uncertainty of rate path, geopolitics, US elections, it's hard to put a pin on what the returns will be in a given forward quarter until we kind of see some normalization in those uncertainties, not to mention some of the regulatory stuff that we are dealing with as we speak, Basel namely. But yes, you're right to point out that we are seeing some real operating leverage in the Investment Bank. And over the course of a number of years, as we think about not just the integrated firm, but the returns generated inside of Wealth and Investment Management. And then we look at the returns inside the Investment Bank, we are measuring that. And we are looking to have that contribute to the overall sustainable 70% efficiency of the firm. Operator *: There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you everyone for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. Welcome to Morgan Stanley's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimers. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Morgan Stanley does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements in this discussion. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Ted Pick. Ted Pick : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, Morgan Stanley delivered strong revenues of $15.4 billion, $3 billion of net income and a 17.5% return on tangible. The results reflect top-line growth across our businesses and demonstrate operating leverage. Year-to-date results reflect the firm's ability to generate consistent quarterly performance, $15 billion of revenues, sequential EPS of $2.02, $1.82, and $1.88, and year-to-date returns on tangible of 18%. Across the firm, we advanced toward our strategic goals while continuing to invest in growth. We are delivering on asset aggregation by leveraging our unique platform and scale in Wealth and Investment Management. Through the first nine months, we achieved $200 billion of organic growth. It's worth noting that over the last year, total client assets are up almost $1.4 trillion. Total client assets across Wealth and Investment Management have now reached $7.6 trillion, on the road to $10 trillion. Our strategic investments across the Integrated Investment Bank are reflected through share gains in our Institutional franchise. The breadth and depth of our global team working seamlessly across all three regions was evident through the summer and post Labor Day, as we helped clients navigate volatility against economic and policy uncertainty. As a whole, the Integrated Firm is achieving operating leverage with our year-to-date efficiency ratio improving by approximately 300 basis points to 72%. We have achieved this while continuing to thoughtfully invest across business and infrastructure priorities. Institutional and individual clients are engaged and we are well-positioned to capture opportunities against different market condition backdrops. Strong fee-based flows in Wealth and the strong performance in Institutional Securities speak to clients seeking Morgan Stanley's advice. Improved underwriting markets combined with increasing participation among financial sponsors and corporates across Investment Banking support a constructive outlook. A broadening equity market and evolving interest rate policy are favorable backdrops for our markets businesses. Continued individual client focus on tax customization strategies are a tailwind for our Parametric business inside Investment Management. Now, with three quarters of 2024 on the board, we are striking a cadence that we will execute against. Our team is unified across the four pillars of : strategy, culture, financial strength and growth. Morgan Stanley's strategy is to raise, manage and allocate capital for institutions and individuals. We will continue to execute on this strategy with a culture of rigor, humility and partnership. And with high levels of capital and liquidity, Morgan Stanley will continue to execute on a plan of durable growth across our Integrated Firm. Sharon will now take us through the quarter. Nice job, SY. Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $15.4 billion in the third quarter. Our EPS was $1.88, and our ROTCE was 17.5%. Results in the third quarter show the inherent strengths of our business model and our ability to grow revenues while also driving profitability. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 72%. In addition to strong revenue growth, efficiency gains are the result of disciplined prioritization of our controllable spend. An ongoing review of our real estate footprint as well as lower litigation and consulting spend contributed to this year's operating leverage while maintaining strong infrastructure to support ongoing growth. Now, to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues were $6.8 billion. Notwithstanding advisory and equity underwriting markets remaining below historical averages, the segment's revenues represented a near record third quarter. Performance accelerated towards the end of the quarter and was driven by the benefits of scale and the global reach of our Integrated Investment Bank. Activity outside the U.S. drove the segment's outperformance relative to historical averages. Our global footprint positioned us well to capture share. As risk events around the world drove activity, including the Bank of Japan's monetary policy changes, shifting expectations around the size and the timing of the Fed's first rate cut and China's announced stimulus, we supported our clients. Investment Banking revenues increased to $1.5 billion. The year-over-year improvement was driven by continued strength in underwriting, led by debt underwriting, and further aided by a pickup in advisory revenues. Steady improvements in corporate and sponsor activity as well as our investments in talent and client relationships are yielding results. Advisory revenues of $546 million increased year-over-year on modestly higher completed M&A transactions in the quarter, with particular strength in EMEA. Large fee events from closed deals in EMEA, including those involving financial sponsors, supported the strongest quarter in over a decade for the region. Equity underwriting revenues were $362 million. While global market volumes remain well below historical trend lines, revenues were higher year-over-year, with a notable pickup of activity in Asia, driven by IPOs and follow-ons. Fixed income underwriting revenues more than doubled versus the prior year to $555 million. Results were driven by strong non-investment grade issuance, supported by both refinancing and event-driven activity, as well as a record third quarter volumes in the investment grade market. Pipelines are healthy and diverse. We continue to believe we are in the early stages of a multi-year capital markets recovery. Corporate activity is gaining momentum, and the desire among sponsors to transact is steadily materializing, not only domestically but also abroad. While we are cognizant of the broader macroeconomic risks at play, we are well-positioned to deliver the Integrated Firm with a deliberate focus on comprehensive solutions for our global clients. Equity revenues were robust at $3 billion. The business navigated bouts of market volatility well and remained nimble as we supported clients, in particular, performance in the Americas and Asia was strong. Prime brokerage revenues were above historical averages, as client balances, once again, reached a new peak, driven by higher equity markets. Cash results improved versus the prior year, reflecting higher volumes across the regions. Derivative results were also up year-over-year, reflecting an increase in client activity coupled with an improved trading environment in Asia associated with China's announced stimulus in the final weeks of September. Fixed income revenues were $2 billion, driven by strength in macro, particularly rates, largely offset by results in commodities that were stronger in the prior year. Results reflect solid performance in EMEA and Asia, as well as a coordinated global effort to support clients through periods of volatility. Macro revenues increased versus the prior year, attributed to higher client engagement as our rates business navigated the markets well amid shifting expectations around the size and the timing of the Fed's first rate cut. Micro results were roughly flat year-over-year. Results in commodities declined compared to the strong prior year, which benefited from elevated volatility in energy markets. Turning to ISG lending and provision. In the quarter, ISG provisions were $68 million, driven by portfolio growth, partially offset by an improved outlook. Net charge-offs were $100 million in the commercial real estate and corporate loans. Turning to Wealth Management. In the third quarter, the business produced a record revenue of $7.3 billion and record PBT, highlighting the model's strong operating leverage. Strength in Wealth Management reflects a combination of constructive markets and a disciplined execution of our strategy. Client assets in Wealth Management reached $6 trillion. Fee-based flows were strong, demonstrating the power of our scaled and differentiated client acquisition funnel and the value of advice. Our multichannel model is driving durable long-term growth and profitability, benefiting from continued investments in our expanded offering and technology. Moving on to our business metrics. Pre-tax profits of $2.1 billion drove the margin to 28.3%. In the quarter, DCP negatively impacted the margin by approximately 90 basis points. Asset management revenues were $4.3 billion, up 18% year-over-year, driven by the cumulative impact of positive fee-based flows and higher markets. Fee-based flows in the quarter were robust at $36 billion and year-to-date flows are on pace to exceed last year, supported by an ongoing contribution of assets from advisor-led brokerage accounts to fee-based accounts. Clients are diversifying fee-based accounts to include fixed income and alternative products. Fee-based assets now stand at $2.3 trillion. Net new assets were $64 billion, bringing year-to-date net new assets to $195 billion, which represents 5% annualized growth of beginning period assets. Net new assets in the quarter were supported by our advisor-led and workplace channels, with a notable contribution from new clients in the advisor-led channel. Transactional revenues were $1.1 billion, and excluding the impact of DCP, were up 10% year-over-year. Overall, higher levels of client activity supported results. Loan growth was $4 billion for the second consecutive quarter, driven by mortgages. Total deposits increased sequentially to $358 billion. While average sweeps were down slightly, the recent stabilization, particularly -- we've seen recent signs of stabilization, particularly as the Fed began cutting rates. This is encouraging. Net interest income was $1.8 billion. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we would expect NII to be modestly down from the third quarter results, largely on the back of lower rate expectations, consistent with the forward curve. We are committed to continuing to execute as the opportunity in front of us remains significant. We currently touch 19 million relationships, 1.3 million more than last year. Our expanded offering includes unique market access for high-net-worth clients across a broad range of alternative products and, more recently, robust private market services, which continues to attract demand. We are investing in our intellectual capital, unique products and an integrated infrastructure to help our advisors serve their clients. Turning to Investment Management. Revenues of $1.5 billion increased 9% compared to the prior year. Results reflect higher asset management and related fees, which increased 5% year-over-year, driven by higher average AUM. Long-term net flows were approximately $7 billion. Inflows were primarily driven by continued demand in alternatives and solutions, and were further supported by our fixed income strategies. Since the acquisition of Eaton Vance within alternatives and solutions, Parametric customized portfolios have been a consistent source of strength. Our multi-year investments into Investment Management's partnership with Wealth Management includes initiatives around advisor education on our tax-efficient product capabilities. This has helped drive steady demand originating from our own Wealth Management clients as well as the broader retail base. Liquidity and overlay services had inflows of $9.3 billion, led by our Parametric overlay strategies. Performance-based income and other revenues were $71 million. Results supported gains in infrastructure and real estate. MSIM's total AUM now stands at $1.6 trillion. Our investments in customization and alternatives are showing returns, demonstrated by positive long-term flows this quarter. We continue to invest in secular growth products in order to meet global client demand. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets grew to $1.3 trillion. Standardized RWAs increased sequentially to $490 billion, as we actively supported clients. We accreted approximately $2 billion of Common Tier 1 capital. Our standardized CET1 ratio stands at 15.1%. We continue to deliver on our commitment to the dividend, which we raised to $0.925 per quarter in this quarter, and we bought back $750 million of common stock during the quarter. Our year-to-date results serve as hard evidence that we are executing on the opportunity set, benefiting from being global and diversified with the resources to invest in growth. Across Wealth and Investment Management, we reached $7.6 trillion of total client assets. Expanding markets and increased client engagement should further support asset growth as we progress toward $10 trillion in client assets. With that, we will now open the line up to questions. Operator : We are now ready to take any questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. Sharon Yeshaya : Hey, good morning, Steve. Ted Pick : Good morning, Steve. Steven Chubak : Ted. Hey, Sharon. How are you both doing? So, wanted to start off with just a question on op leverage. You noted that the management team has been very focused on driving more efficiency. We're definitely seeing now on the ISG side, 75% incremental margins, even in Wealth, you're delivering 35% incremental margins. Just wanted to gauge the sustainability of some of those higher-marginal margins, just given some of the efforts you cited on the efficiency side while continuing to invest for growth? Sharon Yeshaya : Certainly. Thank you for the question, and thank you for noting the progress. We have been really focused on this over the course of the year, and I'd say that it's not -- the intention has not been to be shortsighted, but rather to take a very long-term lens as we think about efficiency. Over the course of this spring, we began to look not only at one-year budget, but really two- to three-year outlook, not just about revenues, but also understanding where are the efficiencies that we have to gain and where can we consolidate certain investments in order to make room for what would be investments in growth. I highlighted occupancy, because that's one that's notable in the SEC disclosures. You'll see that over the course of the year-to-date-to-year-to-date basis, so that line item has really only increased about $11 million. And we've made a lot of room to invest in optimization of the space, but also investments of space. You think about data centers, you think about new buildings, you think about new technology and new places that you think need to be used for occupancy. So, there is a way that we're thinking about self-funding. Same goes for a decline in professional services. Some of that was related to -- remember, we were going through many years of integration, and while we stopped disclosing on an integration basis, there were still places that we thought that we could augment what we were looking at from a professional service basis and where we were thinking about long-term gains. On the other side of that, you've seen increases in places like BC&E, because we have been in a position where we've been supporting our clients. We're also making space investing in the infrastructure as we think about the growth that we have going forward. Some of that just has to do with cyber resilience, thing that you would expect us to do as we grow the business going forward. But we're also looking at places where we're investing for FAs, new products, new technology that can give them space to go and prosecute new clients, which you see in our net new assets the course of the quarter. And broadly, as you think about risk and controls, you need to make sure that you have all of the right, like I said, infrastructure, really the foundation and the building blocks so that when you have growth, you're able to support it on a go-forward basis. So, we've been looking at it from both sides, Steve, and it is a multi-year process, and we would continue to do that not just in this business cycle and this budget cycle, but as we go forward over multiple years. Steven Chubak : Thanks for all that perspective, Sharon. And maybe just for a quick follow-up, on the Wealth business, the KPIs were quite strong across the board, clearly reflects very strong momentum in the third quarter, especially in September. Just wanted to better understand what -- if there were any idiosyncratic factors that maybe drove some of that strength. Inevitably, when you see that type of momentum, it begs the question as to how durable or sustainable some of those KPIs might be and especially focused on just the growth in sweep deposits, which was certainly a nice surprise? Sharon Yeshaya : Yeah. Specifically, I'd say actually all the KPIs and all the underlying is strong, sweeps being one that I called out as the deposit trends are certainly encouraging, especially since the Fed began to cut rates. We've seen that over the back end of September and even as we look into the beginning of the fourth quarter on a relative basis in terms of expectations. So, that has been positive. The underlying for me on all of the asset growth, both on NNA as well as fee-based assets, there's not one particular driver, but rather you've seen the advice-based side really picking up. You've seen clients and FAs engage. There continues to be investments into markets on a monthly level from brokerage sweeps, which you didn't see last year. So, needless to say, the markets are improving. You're seeing momentum in the economy. Uncertainties are lifting and retail clients are engaged both from seeking advice but also coming to the platform as new clients, which I think is a particularly good trend to watch. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ted Pick : Hey, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning, Ted. I guess, maybe just first question on capital priorities. Just talk to us in terms of how you're thinking about the capital ratio today in context of -- we're still waiting for the Basel re-proposal, but more importantly, I think the history of the last 10 years has been excellent capital allocation organic or inorganic. As you're looking at the world today, Ted, where are you deploying capital? Where are the best investment opportunities? Is it in market? Is it in wealth? Is it in international? Would love to get your perspective. Ted Pick : Thanks for the question. As you know, we're at 15.1% CET1. The new number is 13.5%. So, our buffer is 160 basis points. We like that buffer. It gives us room to operate. You saw that we had some risk-weighted asset increase, but we still managed to keep the ratios at 15%-plus. So, there's a story here, which is to continue to price best-in-class financial strength along the lines of capital and liquidity, but also to lean into the businesses as the market opportunity affords. We did that clearly in both businesses. You saw it in the Investment Bank, where we gained share across the primary and both markets businesses, but you also saw it in Wealth Management, some of the technology spend that Sharon described. In the sort of forced hierarchy of what we would wish to do at any given moment around capital allocation, as we said before, it's the dividend first that is sacrosanct and we continue to grow it. Second here, because of the secular growth and where we are in the cycle, as Sharon just described, there is a good cause to be investing in all three segments, Wealth Management, Investment Management and the Investment Bank, and to do so across the world. We're clearly seeing rates of equitization increasing in places like Japan and India and on the continent. So, having a global franchise and investing in that, we think is existentially important. And then, the buyback is opportunistic. We'll be buying back $3 billion-plus this year, as that's an ongoing lever that we're going to pull. Of course, the Basel uncertainty likely lasts through the election and we have our points of advocacy that are aligned with the industry, but also those things that matter very much to Morgan Stanley specifically. And we're going to continue to make our case concertedly, respectfully, and we'll see how it plays out after the election. But as it stands now, 160 basis points of buffer on CET1, 5.5% SLR, we are investing in the business, we're achieving operating leverage. So, these things are always a movable feast, but we are keeping a very close eye on it and we're happy with how we're optimizing the allocation. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And one quick follow-up for you, Sharon, on sweep deposits, NII, all that good stuff. Just as we think about rate cuts, clients kind of -- maybe serving a trigger event for clients to reallocate how they'd invest. Is the NII, give or take, close to a bottom because of a certain level of sort of -- I think you've talked in the past about cash balances that clients have maintained. Are we close to that? And if we get QT maybe before the end of the year, could those deposit balances potentially have one less headwind and as a result grow looking into next year despite rate cuts? Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. So, let me take the last part of your question first just to be clear. QT hasn't really been a driver for us. I'd say that's more for a commercial bank. So, in either direction, I don't think it has to do with a decline or an increase. So, I'd put that aside, because our deposit base is just slightly different. When we look at where we've been and the types of language that we've used historically, I'd say that just to put it in context, the rate environment has changed. It's changed since the second quarter and I'd say it's changed pretty materially. So, we don't have control as we all know in terms of where interest rates are going. What I can speak to is where we are from a deposit level. And as I said, the trends that we've seen are extremely encouraging. If you think about where we've come from and where we are over the course of the last couple of weeks, especially when the Fed -- ever since the Fed has cut interest rates. The near-term guidance that I gave is that we will likely be modestly down over the course -- on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And where we will be as we look into 2025, I think we will re-evaluate based on where sweeps are, one, but more importantly, on the forward, is likely where interest rates are, which will be a function of what does the Fed do in November, what does it do in December, and what is the path for '25 when we sit at the beginning of January. But I just want to put a little bit of perspective around the conversations that we've had about sweeps and NII over the course of the last couple of years. I understand that it's been a very important topic for investors, especially when you think about sweeps, in particular. But sweeps, as I said, have been, to some degree, stabilizing. And when you look at NII for Morgan Stanley, on a relative basis, think about where we were last year in the third quarter. The delta between NII this quarter and last quarter is $175 million. We make $100 million a day in this business every single day. And so, I think that we really need to begin to think about what is the model, what are we thinking about and how are we executing in the model. Asset management fee-based revenues, that increase this year, is double the decline of NII. So, we just need to gain a bit of perspective now that we see where sweeps are, that the markets are coming back and that we continue to see asset management fees rise and that is the durable revenue and what we expect to see from this business model as we move forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Ted Pick : Hey, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Hello there. Okay. So, with RWA up 10%, I had assumed that it was trading and client-led with PB balances at record highs and it comes with a bar that's actually down a little bit. So, I'm curious, do you think that ebbs and flows with just the environment, or is there some of the -- your capital plan continue to feed this great client franchise across markets? And I'll just ask the follow-up with it, because I think it goes together better. With all of that, Wealth hasn't -- now that you've made a lot of investments, Wealth doesn't need a lot more capital infusion if you will. Based on how you're going about your capital plan, do you envision any material shifts in literally business mix? We've gotten all very accustomed and used to a big percentage of this company being asset and wealth management. Thanks for both of those. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. Let me take them backwards, Glenn, just so I'll talk to Wealth. Wealth sees a steady -- a very small but steady increase when you look back in history associated with RWAs. And a lot of that just has to do with the lending growth. And as we think about greater household penetration, greater usage of those products by FAs and offering that to our client base, that will probably -- that's kind of where you'll see that capital allocation as we move forward. When you think about ISG though and the RWAs has been implemented in the business there, if you look at the loans and lending commitments, you'll see that where we've actually seen a lot of the growth is really on corporates. And a lot of that underlying is corporates, and all of the FSL, so the FID Secured Lending. That is inherent to the Integrated Investment Bank and the Integrated Firm. We have said over the course of the last two years that we expect this to be a Investment Banking-led recovery. We've also said and we've invested in individuals. And when you think about talent in terms of the Investment Bank more broadly, that's where you're seeing the RWAs being put to work. And that's actually also where you're seeing the results, right? That's where you're seeing an increase in DCM, an increase in different parts of the balance of fixed income coming from more lending durable financing revenue. So, it's very much alongside what we're thinking about the stabilization and the durability of the Investment Bank rather than something that's necessarily more episodic. Of course, it will ebb and flow as you see deals and transactions and that environment for those corporates, but that's how I would think about it broadly. Ted Pick : Yeah. What I'd add to that is what is important, too, as you look through the metrics, Glenn, is that the revenues in the Investment Bank are up 20% year-over-year and roughly flat down 2% sequentially, but in that same period, the trading bar, the value of risk across the Investment Bank is running flattish. And that is -- in fact, it's slightly down. So, we were able to put up some real operating leverage without taking up the underlying measured risk in the business, which speaks to sort of the type of durable revenue model that Sharon described across our Integrated Investment Bank. Operator : Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP. Ted Pick : Hi, Devin. Devin Ryan : Hey, good morning, Ted and Sharon. First question on NII in Wealth. Obviously, a lot goes into that, but it would be great if you could maybe speak to some of the second order impacts of lower interest rates that we should be thinking about and maybe some that are a little bit less obvious like changes in margin utilization or securities lending or securities-based loans or even customer engagement with certain types of products or really anything else I'm missing there. Just love to kind of get some more flavor around the implications and how you guys are thinking about the second order impacts on NII as you look out over the next year or so. Sharon Yeshaya : Yeah. We continue -- as I mentioned, this is the second quarter that we've seen loan growth. I wouldn't -- we've seen stronger quarters. So, this is just the beginning. Basically, there's been a steady increase in mortgages, even though there's the rate hike cycle where it is and the rates were higher. And over time, as rates would come down, you'd expect to begin to see refinancing activity, which will spur lending. You'll also likely see, as you get into tax cycles with asset levels where they are, an increase also in SBL. So, there's -- those lending products have been relatively muted versus the historical basis. And you -- it wouldn't be surprising to begin to see more and more of that activity on the forward. Devin Ryan : Okay. Great. Thanks, Sharon. And then, just want to come back to the -- really nice quarter you put up in net new assets in Wealth. And you touched on a notable contribution from new clients in advisor-led. And so, I'm just curious if there's anything else you can highlight that supported that momentum with new clients, specifically, whether it's new products or if there's programs internally that you're running to support that because it sounds like it was a catalyst. I'm just curious if that could continue. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. So, specifically on new clients, Devin, I'd remind you a conversation that Jed had when he spoke publicly recently, which was really about what we're doing on stock plan and different ways that we're introducing FAs to new clients. We call them human referrals. It's a place where you begin to think about if someone's calling, for example, into a call center or they've come to a different event, and they'd like to actually be matched with a financial advisor. Remember, we're using technology, different parts of AI and different ways to begin to appropriately match individuals with FAs we think will suit them. That -- those human referrals are double and over 100,000 year-to-date versus what you've seen in the past. So, I think that, that's a place where we've invested in technology. We understand now how to better match and understand individuals and their needs. And we're giving them an opportunity to see the value of the advice on the forward, and that's what you're seeing in those numbers in terms of the net new assets. So, it's really bearing fruit in terms of the investments we've made. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Ted Pick : Good morning, Dan. Dan Fannon : Hey, good morning. I was hoping you could expand upon some of the strength of activity outside the U.S. Some of the events you cited seem country specific, but can you talk to how you see the rest of the world participating and what you guys have said will be in Investment Banking recovery? And certainly we know the U.S. is focused in terms of the potential cap markets recovery, but curious as how you think about the broader base outside the U.S. Ted Pick : The Integrated Investment Bank premise that we built over the last 10 years and really intensified over the last five years was that it takes a real local commitment to have a global investment bank. We've made real investments on the continent, for example, in Iberia, in Italy, in France. We continue to be the largest presence actually as tenancy matter in Canary Wharf, so in the UK. So, our European commitment is real across both Investment Banking and increasingly in the markets business. That's in the Investment Bank. But also we have a thriving Investment Management business, LPs, who are well ensconced on the continent, and we're building that integrated capability with alternative solutions and the like. We have been strong, as you know, in Asia for really decades. And that spoke to the power of a global investment banking institution that when we had disruptive events, as Sharon alluded to, in Tokyo and then in China in the last couple of months leading into this quarter, it was important that we have a leading investment banking and markets presence, both in Japan and in Hong Kong and Mainland. So here, the seamless execution will pay off as cross-border M&A intensifies as parts of the world outside of the U.S., where, of course, we have our concentrated bet as a regional matter, to the point you were asking, you see good growth in revenues both in Asia and in Europe. You saw year-over-year growth of almost 25% for the firm in EMEA, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and then 30%-plus in Asia. That speaks to having a local presence such that when the Investment Banking cycle really kicks in and companies wish to engage in strategic activity, which includes, obviously, getting bigger or making a sale and potentially go public locally that we're going to have the kind of presence to transact. So, running the global investment bank is going to pay for years to come. And I would add, by the way, that an important part culturally of what we've done at Morgan Stanley for many years which is bearing fruit, is to mobilize some of our senior talent from one region to another, not just across businesses but across regions, which is important when you have 30 of your 80,000 people outside the United States that they're familiar with our operations in places like India and Budapest. Dan Fannon : Great. That's helpful. And then, just as a follow-up, within Investment Management, [longer-term] (ph) inflows certainly a positive, but if we look at the backdrop, markets are up significantly year-to-date, revenues have moved modestly, but still have expenses. So, as you think about the asset mix that's coming in the door that's skewed more towards lower fee, whether that's within Parametric or fixed income, how do you expect or how do you plan on improving the overall profitability of that segment as you think about the longer-term trends that are putting more pressure on fees? Sharon Yeshaya : I'll take that. So, you're right to identify that there is a mix shift as we're seeing different types of flows. I'd also note, though, there are also investments being made when you think about just the expenses to help make sure that we're there to service the clients in terms of where we're seeing the secular growth trends. So, it's an asset story on Parametric. It's an asset story on alternatives. We're investing in both. Both of those are places we see secular growth trends, and we're making sure to be there with -- for our clients. Now alternatives is going to be higher fees, just basic private credit, et cetera, will be higher fees than you might see in Parametric. That being said, I don't see it simply as a fee sort of game, but rather the greater the assets, the more opportunity and the more to be the leader in the space and to continue to attract new capital to seek new opportunities. So, overall, I see it more as a strategy associated with asset building, aggregation and being there to service our clients, but also making sure that we have the capital there to invest. So, things like Parametric, you're going to need to spend money on more market data. You're going to need to build relationships with Wealth. And that's going to cost money on margin in the short term, but it will give us the opportunity for growth as we move forward over the long term. Operator : Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Ted Pick : Good morning, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Hey, Ted, good morning. All right. So, I'm willing to risk the wrath of Sharon here and ask a question on NII. And I totally appreciate it's just a part of the Wealth business, right? So, totally get that. But I thought it was really encouraging to see the end-of-period deposit costs tick down pretty decently quarter-over-quarter. So, maybe is that driven by the fact that you've seen a lot of those deposits shift into like the higher cost and therefore, higher beta products? And so, would that be sustainable? And then, when we're thinking about a combination of that de facto higher beta, the potential for reinvestment tailwinds in the securities book and loan growth, is it too optimistic to think that NII could grow next year? Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you, Brennan. I appreciate that you do understand the business, and you do understand that there are multiple drivers of this business. I think what you're hitting on is that there are a lot of places that you can still see growth that is not specific only to the deposit mix. So, yes, it's encouraging to see certain pieces. Now, of course, you also had our Fed rate cut in there. So that will continue to bring the cost of certain types of deposits. You think about the beta, the beta will really depend, like you alluded to, also on products. So, things like a savings product will have a much higher beta than something like a sweeps product, which will have a much lower beta. They just -- they are two different products with two different purposes in terms of the dynamics of what they're used for. Now, on the forward, it will, of course, depend on the Fed rate path. There are so many changes that have taken place over the course of the last quarter that make it very difficult to say, well, where will the Fed be, and where will be those investment opportunities. So, where I would sort of point to is there are three pieces that we've always talked about that will drive NII. Two of them are encouraging. That's the growth on the asset side in terms of where you're seeing us being able to actually deploy the capital, where you're seeing people ask for lending opportunities, et cetera, it's growing, it's encouraging. Sweeps, what we know and what we've seen, especially since the first rate cut, is also very encouraging, particularly as historically, if you look back, and I said this in the last quarter call, generally speaking, when you begin to see interest rate cuts, you do begin to see different parts of deposits rise. So, again, an encouraging sign. Where will it be when you think about reinvestment and the rest of NII? That in and of itself is really the Fed. And if we go back a quarter ago, no one -- it was a very low probability to see a 50 basis point rate cut, and lo and behold, we have one. So, why don't we see where we are after the November and December meetings and then restate kind of where we think we'll be over the course of the year just from a rate perspective. But those three building blocks, you know what they are and you know that the two that are under our control or they have to do sort of -- I wouldn't say, under our control, but rather have to do with what our clients are doing. I've told you what I'm seeing from our data, and it's all positive. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Totally. That's helpful. Thanks, Sharon. And then, for the follow-up, maybe shifting gears a little bit. You spoke to sponsor engagement. We've seen some sponsors actually start to hit the IPO market. Given your strength in ECM and the strong franchise you have there, what are you seeing on the IPO pipeline front? And how should we be thinking about that outlook into next year? Ted Pick : Well, as you know, the sponsors have roughly $1.3 trillion of dry powder. They have $3 trillion to $4 trillion of portfolio companies in the ground by some measures, 10,000 companies in the ground. And for the first time in close to 15 years there, the deployment is outpacing the fundraising. So, there is a need for that group to move. And they act as a liquidity source, but they also act as a competitive player to our traditional corporate community. I think much has been said about the barriers to entry to be a highly regulated [indiscernible] public company. But I would take the view that there are a whole bunch of great companies that are owned privately that do want to make their way into the public markets. That currency allows them to make acquisitions, to set up long-term compensation plans and like, to go global. So, what I'd expect to see are larger companies going public, having been private for some time, reaching a level that makes them a tougher sale on the private front. There are private alternatives, but the going-public phenomenon is not going away. And I made reference to this earlier, I think there is a going-public phenomenon that will exist around the world, whether it's select countries doing privatizations, whether it's exciting companies that for the first time are reaching global benchmarks. So, I think we're going to see the IPO market slowly work its way back, larger names coming to market. And then, when they do, quite quickly needing the full service suite of a global investment bank, needing the treasury capabilities, needing hedging services, needing the kind of advice at a mid- or large-cap mature company needs, and that, of course, on a global scale is right in our sweet spot. So, I'm bullish on IPOs and M&A coming back. It may take some time. And the size of the companies when they come will be likely larger. So, there will be slower unit volume than the sort of the heyday of post-COVID stimulus and quick listings, but I think these are going to be global mature companies which are going to very much need our advice. Operator : Our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Ted Pick : Good morning, Christian. Christian Bolu : Good morning, Ted and Sharon. On Wealth Management, really nice to see solid loan growth in the last two quarters. Just thinking a little bit looking forward here as rates come down, kind of how are you thinking about maybe longer-term growth? Do you think loan growth can maybe reaccelerate back to pre-COVID levels where we were seeing 20%-plus growth per year, or is that business more mature today with less growth upside? Sharon Yeshaya : No, I actually -- thank you for the question. I don't think that it's more mature with less upside. I actually think there's more upside to go when you think about the penetration of FAs using those products. So, we used to be sort of in the low-double-digits in terms of that penetration. That's moved up to somewhere in the teens. But we do think that there's opportunity to surpass that higher. And if you look sort of at peers even in similar kinds of channels, so not lending through a commercial bank, but more on the wealth side, those numbers are higher. So, there are certainly opportunities there, Christian. So that's why I appreciate you asking the question. I wouldn't say it's not just on the mortgage side. That certainly can come back. But SBLs have been relatively flat. And it's not surprising. We've talked a lot about the uses of those lines. And especially if rates are low, thinking about how to use those lines to pay taxes, for example, and think about what you're doing from an efficiency perspective with your portfolio as an individual investor. Christian Bolu : Okay. Very helpful. Thanks. Maybe one more on deposits, Wealth Management deposits again. Appreciate this is maybe a smaller issue now and fading away. But how are you thinking about just the philosophy around deposit pricing within Wealth Management, given some of the SEC scrutiny? And then, maybe any data you can provide around how much of the sweep cash is in the advisory-related assets? Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. So, why don't we just -- I'll take it to sort of, I guess, together but answer it slightly backwards, which is we talked about different pricing changes. And last quarter, we also said that, that was a small portion in terms of where the changes are going to be made. So, it's small. It's in the run rate. You saw it over the course of the quarter, and it was in the results. When we think about deposit pricing, we take a number of factors into consideration. And one of the most important factors that we highlighted last quarter and we've been looking at even through this cutting cycle are competitive dynamics and where competitive pricing is. So that's -- it's the market, and it's also competition. It's the need for deposits and it's where that is on a relative value perspective. So, all of those things that include the customer as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Ted Pick : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Ted. Hi, Sharon. In your prepared remarks, you guys talked about your prime brokerage revenues were historical -- above historical averages as clients' balances reach new peaks. Can you share with us how much of that is driven by just existing clients or also you're expanding your client base where you're growing that as well? Can you compare the two areas of driving these numbers? Ted Pick : Well, I think the question is an interesting one because the barriers to entry to scaling a new asset manager are quite high. But we host, as you're aware, our cap intro conference every January down in Breakers. We've done that for decades and continue to draw enormous demand to try to get a slot. Because once you've made it, the platform economics of success and your ability to penetrate various distribution channels enables you to get big quite quickly. So, it's sort of tough to make it, but once you've made it, you can really scale into a large institution. By and large, though, the growth that we've seen across equities to hit the $3 billion mark over the last couple of quarters you've seen has not been consuming additional VAR. It's just staying close to our clients. These results indicate that we've increased wallet with predominantly the existing base. We've done that around the world. And the leverage levels for a lot of these clients in the quantum platform space are actually run close to the typical range for that subgroup. So, we've been able to interact with them in a productive way across not just prime brokerage, but cash and derivatives, too, and then importantly, across the markets business. So, this is part of this Integrated Investment Bank philosophy that you can have folks that are traditional players in one pocket moving across the asset spectrum, and the leadership in the market business has done a great job facilitating that, not just across underliers, but as I mentioned in the past quarter, across regions. And to the extent that there are spin-outs or others, we have a vibrant business now in the Middle East too, in Abu Dhabi, and in Scandinavia in Copenhagen. Those are the two offices we recently opened. And I mentioned them because they are not just great possible for Investment Banking and for our Investment Management business, but they're also very interesting for our markets business, too. Gerard Cassidy : Very helpful. Thank you. And then just as a quick follow-up, I always appreciate your guys' insights and others that really don't have big exposures to credit. And so, you mentioned that you had charge-offs of $100 million in commercial real estate and corporate loans. Can you give us any color? Again, you're not a big lender like a JPMorgan or a Bank of America, so insights from folks like you, I think, are very helpful. Any color here? Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. Those are largely provisioned for. And so, I think what you've seen is that it's almost as though some of the credit changes have been working themselves through the market. If you look back over the course of the last two years, we've had a lot of conversations, Gerard, specifically talking about CRE. You've had some great questions as it relates to that space. We saw that, that was happening. We provisioned for it. And over time, you will see that likely come through on the other side as charge-offs, and that's kind of where we are at this point in the cycle. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Ted Pick : Good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hey, good morning. Earlier, you talked about your tech efforts. And so, Ted, as you think about AI, is Morgan Stanley a leader or a close follower, you wait for others to do it? And then, more specifically, what's going on with your partnership with OpenAI? I see a quote here from Morgan Stanley, \"OpenAI is perhaps the best example to date of empowering Morgan Stanley with the marriage of human advice and technology.\" I think you're unique in using OpenAI. So, any color you can provide would be great. Sharon Yeshaya : Sure. I'll take it because we continue to do work with OpenAI. In terms of where we are overall on the technology side, Mike, you saw a lot of our products very early, say, almost 10 years ago at this point in time when we did our first tech expo. And we looked at tools that we were using AI and different types of machine learning, et cetera, to give our advisors tools to give them more time to prospect business. As it relates specifically to that partnership, that partnership is going extremely well. We continue to look at new platforms and new applications that we can use with them. And there are new places that we're using AI that we've launched and we've discussed over the course of the last two quarters or so. One is, we, obviously, do have a tool where FAs can use and speak to our research portal, so to speak, and understand that AI will basically read everything and then can help you answer different questions associated with what's already been published in terms of that volume of data. In addition to that, as we've moved forward, we can have tools like debrief where an individual, of course, gaining permission in a meeting can use what they've heard in a meeting through AI translate languages, et cetera, summarize and then be able to send out emails as follow-ups based on the conversations had in those meetings with a draft. Obviously, you have human interaction after in a human overlay, but just gives you the bare bones again to save time for the advisors as we move forward. We're doing that across the institution in different pockets and spaces as part of the -- if we think back to the efficiency work that we started this call with, there will be places where we can use AI to also think through efficiencies. So, it's a balance of understanding where to invest and then how to use that to gain time back from a productivity perspective as we move forward. Ted Pick : And I also like the -- I like the question because it suggests that there are going to be opportunities where being a fast follower is just fine, where you can take existing capability and make the digitization process easier on a straight cost effectiveness play, where -- to Sharon's comments, where we are really digging in as a, call it, proprietary matter is around the productive efficiency inside of Wealth Management. This entire -- we call it AIMS, as you know, AI @ Morgan Stanley. The AI @ Morgan Stanley Assistant is just the first chapter of what we're going to do across the financial advisor platform specific to our own offering with clients where we think we're going to have some real edge. Mike Mayo : You say it's the first chapter of what just -- I know this is looking forward, but what could be some other chapters as it relates to AI? Ted Pick : At our place? Well, it's going to be a tool at the very least that is going to help inform FAs on what is relevant at any given moment under any different -- any given paradigm. They are going to have access to information across a whole bunch of data sets, ongoing conversations and interactions that are going to allow for crisper and more effective conversations with their clients. I think that will take some time to play out. But when you think about it, extraordinarily effective in terms of the interactions when there will be heightened proclivity to activity between the client and the FA, whether it's around an exogenous event or a life event for the FA to be well-equipped to know what types of products and services might be available down the road is something that we think will be part of the embedded offering. Operator : We'll take our last question from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Ted Pick : Saul, good morning. Saul Martinez : Hey, good morning. Hey, you've had a pretty sustained good fee-based asset flow for some time now. And maybe this quarter was a little bit outside -- outsized. And Sharon, you mentioned the trends of advisor-led brokerage moving to fee-based, clients diversifying to alternatives and fixed income instruments or fixed income. Can you just comment on the extent to which you think these dynamics have legs where we are in terms of these dynamics occurring, given the strength in asset prices and equities and rates coming down and what that might mean for your flow expectations and for fee rates? Sharon Yeshaya : Yeah. I actually really appreciate the question. I appreciate that you took note of the comments that I gave in the prepared remarks, which is what we've been focused on is really migration and understanding migration of assets. So, we look at -- there's brokerage accounts in self-directed, and there's brokerage accounts when you think about on the advisor side. You have an advisor, but you also have a brokerage account, and not everything is in fee-based. The numbers from brokerage is -- those numbers are increasing in terms of what's actually migrating into fee-based. And why I think that's important is we've always said that we would expect -- oftentimes, the way you see net new assets come into the institution, they come in maybe under an advisor or not. But let's say you're in the advisor side, it comes into a brokerage account first. It doesn't go directly into fee-based. And so, it's really the migration of assets coming in and then seeing that pick up, say, oh, I understand that there's a value to advice, and let me now figure out where I'd like to put it in what type of fee-based wrapper, so to speak, that is going. If I go back sort of 10 years or so, it was really only in equities. That's where you saw most of those fee-based advice coming in. Now, that has changed. Over time, we began to talk about fixed income. Remember that had to do some of -- we would talk about fee degradation. We'd say it's not fee degradation, but it's mix and it was mixed into fixed income. Now we're seeing that mix also into alternatives. So that's what's interesting is that there are more products also being offered under the fee-based wrapper that people can begin to think about. And as those products increase, and we have more products than others, we have more tools, more opportunities to people -- for people to invest, we'll see more assets come in, there's more value to advice and there are more places to put it in when you think about the fee-based offering. So, I think that it has momentum, and as you know, those are the durable revenue streams that we expect to gain over time. Saul Martinez : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone, for participating. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",

On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release, financial supplement, and strategic update, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release and strategic update. Within the strategic update, certain reported information has been adjusted as noted. These adjustments were made to provide a transparent and comparative view of our operating performance. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP adjusted operating performance metrics are included in the notes to the presentation or the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ted Pick. Ted Pick : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. First, we would like to acknowledge our colleagues, clients, shareholders, friends, and family in Los Angeles. Our hearts go out to all those impacted and dealing with the horrific devastation from the wildfires. We're grateful to all the firefighters and first responders, we are thinking of you. Over the last several years, we've been faced with two central themes. One, the end of financial repression, namely the passing of the era of ultra-low interest rates and the reemergence of inflation. And two, the end of the end of history with the resumption of geopolitical uncertainty. These paradigm shifts juxtaposed against renewed investor and corporate confidence, present opportunities to support clients with exceptional advice and market access. Morgan Stanley is well positioned to execute against these opportunities. The firm's consistent execution is demonstrated by the cadence of top-line and bottom-line in 2024. Revenues across the four quarters of $15.1 billion, $15.0 billion, $15.4 billion, and $16.2 billion, and earnings per share of $2.02, $1.82, $1.88 and $2.22. The fourth quarter was a top-line record with the highest earnings per share in over 15 years, capping-off one of Morgan Stanley's strongest years. For the full year, the firm delivered a return on tangible of 19% and earnings per share of $7.95, making significant progress toward our long-term goals. The results reflect consistent durable earnings across the firm, evidencing that Morgan Stanley can deliver during this period of continued macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. As we do every January, let's begin with our 2025 strategic update entitled Four Pillars of Morgan Stanley : The Integrated Firm. The slides can be found on our website. On Slide 3, we introduce the four pillars of Morgan Stanley to support our integrated firm, strategy, culture, financial strength, and growth. Strategy is about consistently serving our clients and raising, managing, and allocating capital. Culture is about rigor, humility, and partnership. Financial strength is about strong capital and liquidity alongside durable earnings and growth is about smart strategic investments across the firm, which generate new opportunities to capture client share. The investment thesis for Morgan Stanley rests on our ability to deliver the integrated firm supported by these four pillars. Slide 4. First, to reiterate, Morgan Stanley's clear strategy to raise, manage, and allocate capital for corporations, individuals, asset managers, and asset owners around the world. In the past year, our engagement advice across the full range of institutional and individual clients drove results. Slide 5. Morgan Stanley culture is defined by rigor, humility, and partnership. The leadership group on the operating and management committees have an average tenure at the firm of more than 20 years, many of them across business segments and regions. More broadly, our leadership body of 2,312 Managing Directors, 173 of whom we recently promoted to the partnership have been with Morgan Stanley for an average of 15 years. 30% of our Managing Directors have been at the firm for two decades. Our partnership is defined by Morgan Stanley leaders who embody this homegrown culture, joined by acquisition and lateral talent who bring an incremental skill set to the platform. Morgan Stanley's culture of first-class business in a first-class way forged over many years of trial and success is a competitive advantage and will contribute to the success of the integrated firm. Slide 6 highlights our position of financial strength, the third pillar of the integrated firm, and is the output of a clearly defined strategy and a tightly knit culture. Our consistently strong capital position over recent years is a standout. In 2024, we accreted over $5.5 billion of CET1, while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. We will continue to prudently grow the dividend, continue to invest in each of our three businesses and across our infrastructure, and continue to opportunistically repurchase the stock. In 2024, we effectively deployed capital to support clients and translated that into earnings growth. High capital levels protect us in challenging climates and sustain us for long-term growth. Slide 7 brings us to the fourth pillar of the strategy, revenue and earnings growth. Earnings expansion in 2024 reflects a return on multiyear investment to support clients. We will continue to invest heavily across the firm, in our talent, our clients, in e-trade and in parametric, in our bank, across resiliency in technology and infrastructure, and in the development of the integrated firm. In the past year, expense growth was tempered by our focus on rolling off initial integration spend and taking opportunities to consolidate our real estate footprint. Investments for growth will continue to be supported by ongoing disciplined prioritization of our expense base. Slide 8. The last six years shows step function change in the firm's growth across our businesses. In the Wealth and Investment Management segments, combined revenues have grown from $20 billion to $34 billion and total client assets have nearly tripled to $7.9 trillion. This growth has been achieved both by way of acquisition and through organic execution. You will also note that institutional securities wallet share has grown by nearly a 100 basis points. These results reflect not only constructive markets, but also a sharpened focus on key client relationships and an expanded coverage of corporates and asset managers. Morgan Stanley scale positions us over the long-term to deliver growth in each of our three business segments. We win both through an expanding denominator of global securities, banking, wealth, and investment management activity and by increasing our numerator as in our wallet share in each segment. In short, we seek to gain durable share in the secular growth businesses in which we participate. Slide 9, goes a level deeper into institutional securities. First, the growth in institutional securities has been both broad based and crucially is global. It is important that we are relevant in all the major regions around the world. Amidst geopolitical and interest rate uncertainty, each region grew revenues by roughly 20% in 2024. These results follow multiple years of investment in talent and leadership, as well as efficient and disciplined RWA growth. In 2024, we saw institutional securities deliver an operating margin of 31% and revenue growth that was significantly higher than our RWA growth. We are in a leadership position and can offer trusted advice and market access into the investment banking new issue and M&A cycle, which just lies ahead. Slide 10. In Wealth Management, investments in our self-directed and workplace channels drive our differentiated client acquisition funnel. Today, with our expanded offering, we reach over 19 million relationships and have added net new assets of over $250 billion in each of the past two years on track to delivering $10 trillion plus of total client assets. An important indicator of Wealth Management momentum is fee-based flows, which reached an exceptional $123 billion in 2024. Delivering on new relationships and net new asset growth creates opportunities for our team of world class financial advisors to tap into the integrated firm for their clients. Slide 11 highlights the breadth and tenure of wealth management's client relationships as 60% of advisor-led assets are associated with clients who have an average duration of 20 years. We retain 99% of our clients reflecting their enduring trust in Morgan Stanley. The slide illustrates our multichannel model, which continues to drive new assets to the platform. 30% of our advisor-led assets are associated with clients who have a Morgan Stanley relationship of less than 10 years and 10% of advisor-led assets are with clients of less than two years. The client acquisition funnel supports durable growth, namely as clients mature with our financial advisors, they become the foundation for the continued growth of recurring fee-based revenues. Slide 12. In Investment Management, we continue to focus on the secular growth areas of customization and alternatives. Our industry leading parametric platform, inclusive of overlay has grown to $575 billion. In alternatives, our investable assets have more than doubled in size to $240 billion. Investments in these secular growth areas have brought more balance to our investment management business and supported fee-based revenues. Additionally, the integrated firm, particularly the relationship with wealth management continues to benefit the investment management platform with the enhancement of retail oriented distribution offerings and additional product capabilities. Slide 13. An area of investment is in the incremental growth of our U.S. banks. Since 2018, the firm has significantly grown deposit balances and continues to source deposits from wealth management clients with an expanded product offering. On the asset side, we will continue to grow our wealth management lending capability by covering clients holistically as their financial needs evolve. In addition, we will continue to utilize the bank platform to support growth in eligible institutional businesses. As we continue to grow our capabilities across the integrated firm, we are well-positioned to provide a full suite of solutions to our clients. Slide 14. A dividend that is aligned to the growth of fee-based earnings has been a leading priority. Our durable results demonstrate consistent execution of our strategy, and we have raised our quarterly dividend by $0.075 for three years in a row to $0.925 per share. Slide 15. As you've heard us discuss during the past year, the integrated firm brings together our world class wealth and investment management franchises with our world class institutional securities franchise. We are consistently strengthening the pillars underlying the integrated firm to deliver on our strategic goals. Across the integrated firm, Morgan Stanley is relevant to our clients, spanning from the advice dispensed and corporate boardrooms to our financial wellness programs for that company's employees. We are also the premier holistic partner to asset managers partnering with them to grow their businesses and to generate alpha. We can deliver institutional capabilities to our clients alongside sophisticated wealth management advice and distribution in an integrated service model. And in so doing, be mindful of potential conflicts. To open 2025, we have formalized the integrated firm by positioning leadership talent at the center of client coverage, integrated data, risk management, and infrastructure to drive growth as we serve more clients across their full suite of needs. This effort will be led by Mandell Crawley, a three decade Morgan Stanley executive and a member of our operating committee. Together with Co-Presidents Dan Simkowitz and Andy Saperstein, the integrated firm organization is aligned to scale client opportunities across Morgan Stanley. Slide 16. The Morgan Stanley investment thesis is robust. In 2024, we deliver top-line and bottom-line strength and consistency. The full year results are strong relative to our long-term firmwide goals. We ended 2024 with total client assets at $7.9 trillion, wealth management pre-tax margins of 27%, a firm efficiency ratio of 71%, and a return on tangible of 19%. Of note, we added a new goal to achieve durable wallet share gains in institutional securities. The additional metric for institutional securities is an appropriate reflection of the expected contribution of this business segment to the firm's growth narrative. The key word is durable. There will always be market and business cycles in each of these businesses. Morgan Stanley's trusted relationships over the very long-term lead to superior results. Against the four pillars of strategy, culture, financial strength, and growth, delivering the integrated firm is foundational to durable earnings growth and 20% returns through the cycle. Thank you. Now Sharon, will review our fourth quarter and annual results, then together we will take your questions. Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $61.8 billion in 2024 and ended the year with fourth quarter revenues of $16.2 billion. For the full year, ROTCE was 18.8%, and EPS was $7.95. For the fourth quarter, ROTCE was 20.2%, and EPS was $2.22. The full year efficiency ratio was 71.1%. Improved efficiency not only demonstrates our ability to grow revenues, but also to prioritize our controllable spend. Occupancy and equipment costs held flat, benefiting from the prior year's consolidation of our real estate footprint. During 2024, we took real estate charges of $62 million, which impacted full year EPS by $0.03. Professional services declined year-over-year, aided by the roll off of integration related expenses and discipline across project spend. These savings helped self-fund investments across infrastructure to support growth such as expanding data center capacity, renovations, and technology modernization efforts. Self-funding investments remains a priority. In the short run, similarly sized additional modernization efforts focused on decommissioning legacy technologies may result in higher amortization costs. This alongside business enabled innovation and process optimization with AI should support the firm's future efficiency path. Now to the businesses. Institutional securities delivered very strong annual results across business and regions, demonstrating the high quality breadth and depth of our world class global franchise. Full year revenues of $28.1 billion included our highest reported equity revenues and the highest results across combined equity and fixed income markets. The strong annual performance showcases our global footprint and our ability to capture client share amidst an increasingly constructive backdrop. Fourth quarter revenues were $7.3 billion as markets remained active, bucking the typical seasonal slowdown. We supported clients throughout the quarter and ended the year with momentum. Investment banking revenues were $6.2 billion for the full year, reflecting growth across regions and products. 2024 commenced with strong debt underwriting activity, followed by M&A announcements that picked up in the second half, and ended with increased equity underwriting activity as the IPO market posted its highest volumes since 2021. Fourth quarter investment banking revenues were $1.6 billion. Results were largely driven by accelerating strength in equity underwriting as follow-on and IPO issuance saw meaningful improvements across -- over the comparison period. We also saw corporates and sponsors take advantage of constructive markets in the quarter. Advisory revenues improved year-over-year on higher completed M&A transactions. Looking ahead to 2025, our M&A pipelines are healthy and diversified, outpacing recent years. Financial sponsors are joining corporates to drive activity, evaluating exit opportunities for long held assets. CEO and boardroom confidence continues to improve as valuations stabilize and financing markets remain strong. Our business is well positioned for a strong continued rebound in deal making activity. Turning to equity. We continue to be a global leader in this business, evidenced by record full year revenues of $12.2 billion. These results reflect year-over-year growth across regions with record performance out of Asia, demonstrating the importance of having a global footprint. Full year results were supported by increased prime brokerage balances and our agility as we navigated the market well. Revenues were $3.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Following the U.S. elections, clients re-risk quickly, given shifting market dynamics. Additionally, third quarter strength in Asia carried into the fourth quarter with renewed investor interest across the region. Prime brokerage revenues were a record for the business as clients remained engaged and balances rose to peak levels. Cash results increased year-over-year, consistent with higher levels of client engagement and volumes. Derivative results increased versus last year's fourth quarter on the back of higher activity across a variety of products, in line with improved risk appetite from clients. Fixed income revenues were $8.4 billion for the full year, driven by consistent quarterly performance across the businesses. The full year results demonstrate our multiyear efforts to recenter our fixed income business around the integrated firm, improved trading performance, growth in durable lending revenues, and servicing corporate and sponsor relationships all contributed to results. Quarterly revenues were $1.9 billion, driven by credit products and commodities. Micro revenues were above historical quarterly averages. Results were driven by securitized products, which benefited from higher loan balances and an increase in securitization activity. Macro performance was relatively flat versus the prior fourth quarter. Commodity revenues improved year-over-year. Results were led by our North America power and gas business, where structured opportunities for corporate clients leveraged the integrated firm. Turning to ISG lending and provisions. For the full year, ISG provisions were $202 million and $78 million for the quarter. The quarterly provision was driven by portfolio growth and a build in a handful of individual assessments. For the full year, ISG net charge-offs were $210 million. For the quarter, net charge-offs were $62 million, primarily related to several commercial real estate loans, which were largely provisioned for in prior quarters. Turning to Wealth Management. 2024 was a strong year for wealth management. Full year highlights include records, revenues of $28.4 billion, pre-tax profit of $7.7 billion, and a reported margin of 27.2%. The strength of our scaled and differentiated client acquisition funnel continues to set us apart. Fee-based flows were $123 billion, exceeding $100 billion for the fourth consecutive year. Clients continue to seek Morgan Stanley's advice, supporting our thesis that as assets move through the funnel, incremental revenue growth and margin expansion will follow. For the fourth quarter, revenues were $7.5 billion and the reported PBT margin was 27.5%. DCP and real estate related charges negatively impacted the quarterly margin by approximately 140 basis points. Asset management revenues in the quarter set a new record of $4.4 billion, showcasing the progress we have made to durable fee-based revenues. With each quarter this year, asset management revenues saw sequential improvement, powered by constructive markets and consistently strong fee-based flows. Fourth quarter fee-based flows were $35 billion. Importantly, over the last two years, we have seen an increase in the number and the pace of assets migrating from advisor-led brokerage accounts to fee-based accounts. We remain an industry leader in organic growth. Net new assets for the quarter were $57 billion. Full year NNA of $252 billion represents approximately 5% annual growth of beginning period assets. This year, our advisor-led channel drove the results, benefiting from both existing clients and new clients coming to the firm. Transactional revenues for the quarter were $1 billion. Excluding the impact of DCP, transactional revenues represent the highest level of activity we have seen since the peak in 2021. Higher retail engagement in equity-related products and demand for alternative products supported results. These revenues will continue to benefit from the breadth and the depth of our growing alternatives platform. Bank lending balances were $160 billion. Loan growth of $4 billion was driven by securities based lending, where we saw demand for new lines and a decline in the pace of paydowns. Total deposits increased 3% sequentially to $370 billion, driven by higher sweep balances. End-of-period sweep deposits have increased for two consecutive quarters, supporting the view that as rate dynamics change and markets turn to be more constructive, sweep balances will be increasingly transactional in nature. While clients deployed more sweep cash in the rising markets, particularly in December, balances held strong as clients showed less rate sensitivity with their transactional cash. Net interest income was $1.9 billion in the quarter. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher sweeps. Looking ahead into 2025, the combination of a more stable deposit mix, higher lending balances, and the rate outlook suggests that first quarter NII should not fluctuate materially from our fourth quarter results. We are intently focused on driving additional growth across channels. In our advisor-led channel, our effectiveness in deepening relationships is evidenced by our consistently strong fee-based flows. In Workplace, our recently announced partnership with Carta, puts us at the center of new client stock plan opportunities as private companies consider going public. And in self-directed, the number of active traders on the E TRADE platform grew, ending the year at levels higher than 2022. Moving to Investment Management. The business reported annual revenues of $5.9 billion and quarterly revenues of $1.6 billion. Our AUM reached a new peak at year-end of $1.7 trillion, supported by market gains and net inflows. Long-term net inflows were $4.3 billion in the quarter, driven by continued demand for our fixed income strategies and parametric customized portfolios. This brings 2024 long-term net inflows to $18 billion. Within Alternatives and Solutions, Parametric remains a key differentiator for MSIM. Growth of the brand will be supported by investments in technology, ongoing education for retail clients on the benefits of customization, and tailored solutions for asset managers. Liquidity and overlay services had inflows of $67 billion on the back of strong fund performance and seasonality, some of which may reverse in the first quarter. Fourth quarter asset management and related fees of $1.6 billion increased 11% versus the prior year, driven by higher average AUM. As a reminder, performance fees are recognized on an annual basis, largely in the fourth quarter, which drove the increase sequentially. Quarterly performance based income and other revenues were $88 million. Gains were concentrated in infrastructure, U.S. private equity, and private credit. In parallel with Wealth Management MSIM is helping to deliver our asset-led strategy. Our efforts to build a business that is well diversified and focused on secular growth areas, as well as global opportunities gives us confidence to drive incremental growth. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Over the course of 2024, we demonstrated velocity of resources. Standardized RWAs declined sequentially to $473 billion, driven by year-end seasonality and market dynamics. Lower RWAs at period end have already begun to reverse as we enter a new calendar year. During the year, we accreted over $5.5 billion of common equity Tier 1 capital and our standardized CET1 ratio ended the year at 15.9%. For the full year, we bought back $3.3 billion of common stock. Our tax rate was 23.1% for the full year. The quarterly tax rate was 24.1%, reflecting the level and the mix of earnings. We expect our 2025 tax rate to be approximately 24%, and consistent with prior years we expect some quarterly volatility. As we look ahead into 2025, our franchise is well positioned for growth, exiting the year with momentum across all of our businesses with a strong capital position to invest in our clients and our businesses. We enter the year with record asset levels, healthy and diversified pipelines, an engaged and institutional retail client base, and a strong global brand. We are focused on disciplined execution as we progress towards our goals. With that, we will now open the line up to questions. Operator : We are now ready to take in questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hey, thanks very much. Ted Pick : Good morning, Glenn. How are you doing? Glenn, how are you? Glenn Schorr : All right. Appreciate it. Where to begin -- I guess, let's talk about trade. There is a lot of upside in trading. We've all seen great trading environments and this certainly was a good one. But I wonder if you could just try to parse out, how you think about great trading environment versus what your words are, just more durable the higher client balances, the record PB, the share gains, and how are you going to measure the success of those durable gains? I'm just trying to separate your actions versus the environment. You've certainly been performing really well. Thanks. Ted Pick : I appreciate that. The focus on institutional securities over the last number of years is of course to deliver to key clients, the whole product set across what -- as you know, we called at one point about five, six years ago, I think it was in 2018, the integrated investment bank. And that was the bringing together of folks in equities, fixed-income, capital markets, and investment banking, minding obviously all the walls between them, but having folks mobilize across those divisions, across the regions and really understand what life is like to sit in the shoes of folks in different divisions. And as you know in this business, you don't actually know what that feels like unless you're in that business, so we had leaders moving around. And six years later now with ISG under Dan Simkowitz\u2019s leadership, we're able to -- in an environment that is friendly to a lot of the businesses because now we have a real corporate finance activity. We have real interest rates and you have effectively two way markets in lots of places around the world with respect to central bank activity, with respect to buyers and sellers of assets. And of course, if you're well organized, you can prosecute that in an orthodoxical way. We have during this period under leadership of Sharon in the office of CFO been quite prudent on the deployment of those risk weighted assets through our Chief Risk Officer, Charles Smith, how do those risk weighted assets and GAAP balance sheet get deployed to clients? One mistake, Glenn, is you can lose the forest of the trees and not think about all the client touchpoints across the integrated firm, we're calling it or you can actually lose sight of the real drivers of what makes that client valuable to the institution. And now we've had six, seven years of really focusing on that and preparing ourselves for the ability to expand our wallet at a time where we believe the denominator is growing as well. It's a little trickier to try to expand the numerator, your wallet when the denominator is not moving as was the case with zero interest rates because you are effectively not a price maker and you are potentially going to be taking some concentrated risk. But here now with the cycle having transitioned, we were able to lean in first across our sweet spot, which is equities to have not just prime brokerage, but the cash equities and derivatives businesses really start to generate above cost of capital ROEs. So the entire basket of equities offering to our clients, but then in fixed income, which has been extraordinarily stable in what is intrinsically an unstable business given the very different businesses of commodities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and credit. On the leadership there Hallik and Horder have done a brilliant job, really running a durable business with a lot of annuitized revenue around well considered financing, structuring, lending businesses that look quite like the businesses we have in classic underwriting such that when we now go into this investment banking cycle where we do think there is going to be an acceleration of classic primary and secondary offerings we're already doing business that looks like that inside of sales and trading, our lending businesses, client advice, and of course, there is real collegiality across the investment bank. The last piece of this is what we've been waiting for, which are M&A tickets, which as you know are the top of the waterfall, the highest margin product that then have multiplier effect through the whole organization and that has begun. The pipeline is very strong, depending on how you measure it, the strongest it's been in five years to 10 years, maybe even longer, and we are excited about pushing that through to the rest of the investment bank. What I've said and I would repeat here too, just to give a lengthy answer, Glenn, is that on ISG wallet share, we are clear that we want those share gains to be durable, which is why we didn't go with quantification. We want those gains to be ones that are not gains by reaching concentration risk, counterparty risk, but the clients know we are serious about bringing ISG to the fore and that the integrated firm now is bringing together these world class wealth and investment management businesses with our investment bank. And the proof is in the pudding, this past year 100 basis point gain, plus or minus in the investment bank to roughly a 15% wallet in a growing denominator. And as you can tell, given we've been quite disciplined on RWA growth against that and you see the operating leverage in the income statement, it's fair to say the institution at large is very exciting. Glenn Schorr : That was a very full answer. I really appreciate it. I'll cede my follow-up to the group. Thanks. Ted Pick : Thanks, Glenn. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ted Pick : Good morning, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. I guess, maybe just -- I know this is -- you've addressed this in prior calls, but as we think about just investments in systems as it pertains to AML, BSA on the wealth management side. If you don't mind addressing where the firm stands there today in terms of sort of meeting all the highest standards from a regulatory compliance standpoint. And I think the essence of my question is, as we think about the growth opportunity in terms of international wealth, do you need to sort of get your ducks lined up on the AML, BSA front in order to pursue those more aggressively or actively? Thanks. Sharon Yeshaya : Thank you for the question. I think that the, the way I would answer your question is more fulsome than just specifically looking at one particular sector. The point that I would underscore is the results themselves in this business speak for themselves. In terms of the investment, the ability to attract clients, both existing assets as well as new clients across the wealth management platform. So that's the first point that I would make. Second point that I would make is that over the course of the -- not just the last year, but really multiple years, we've been investing in all of our processes and our systems in order to engage and make sure that we have a robust infrastructure in order to be allowed to grow broadly and meet all of our growth objectives. And that has to do with everything that I mentioned across the technology side, across better understanding our data, better servicing our clients in terms of investment dollars and in terms of the underlying infrastructure. So what we're trying to do and what we've been actively pursuing is making sure that across the firm, not just specific to wealth, we can service and look and impact all of our clients. And moreover, you can see that very well in terms of our ability to actually continue to attract assets, we'll be making all of the necessarily investments to continue to be world class, both across people and our technology. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you. And I guess, a separate question, Slide 13 with regards to the investment into the bank. Just remind us in terms of the -- where we stand in terms of the integration of the bank. And as we think about -- with some of your peers where the bank and the wealth businesses probably are fully integrated, are we there yet? And then, what's the opportunity when you think about just deposit growth from your wealth management clients that you can bring onboard? Sharon Yeshaya : We're definitely not there yet. We still have a lot of -- to do when we think about the bank. I've always, both internally and for those -- for many externally have felt that the bank itself is an incredible growth engine across the institution. If you look at our bank, we obviously started our bank much later than many of the peers that we now compete with from a commercial bank perspective. We have a very different deposit mix than others. And what's so interesting our deposit mix is that over 70% of our deposits come from our wealth management clients. Now there is -- that's currently, as you know, is largely coming from sweeps and for savings accounts. There is much more that we can do when we think about the deposit franchise itself, and then we can talk a little bit also about the other side of the balance sheet. But we're investing in those deposit opportunities. Remember, we didn't really have bank rails until we bought E TRADE. That was part of the value proposition of acquiring E TRADE and working with those bank rails to offer real checking accounts and continue to have a savings account offering. Moreover, as you think about the work we're doing to invest the banking products within Workplace, you now have different ways to manage cash and cash alternatives for the actual underlying employees, as Ted talked about from an integrated firm perspective. So there is much more that we can do with servicing and growing that deposit base over time. As you think about the lending side and you think about where we are, we continue to see opportunities to help our wealth clients as they expand their lending needs and we better understand their portfolios. Moreover, just holistically, as Ted mentioned in the slide, there are places where we are still working to move eligible ISG assets onto the bank. That should help institutional securities as you think about the actual funding profile associated with those assets. So there are many places that when you look overall at the integrated firm, the bank plays an important role in making sure we have the ability to see that grow. Ted Pick : Yeah, Ebrahim. I'll tag on to that. Deposit side, we're going to service clients across all three channels in wealth, the FA channel, the everyday transaction offering of cash plus type of offering in E TRADE. We're going to continue to focus on checking accounts with competitive rates, integrating products into the client journey as they move along with E TRADE to potentially a classic FA. And then as you know, we've been really banging the drum on workplace where we can partner with companies to reach employees. And on the loan side, as Sharon said, we've been growing loans steadily. The loans number in wealth, as you know, was about $80 million in the fourth quarter of '18, that's doubled to $160 million. We grew that every quarter in '24. We're a bank. We lend and we have to do that in the context of deepening relationships. We lend to about 16% of our households and the best-in-class peers are higher. They're 50% higher, mid-20s. So there's -- as Sharon has said, there is real opportunity. And then in ISG, where we've been growing the lending capability there too, up about 15% year-over-year. So there is real focus on this and upside. But there is also been, I think back to the concept of owning Morgan Stanley as a durable instrument that we are growing both deposits and loans in a smart way over the next five years, 10 years, you can expect these numbers to continue to move higher. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Ted Pick : Good morning, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Hey, Ted. Good morning. How are you? Ted Pick : Good. Brennan Hawken : Would love to follow up on that -- some of that last discussion and talk about the loan growth because it seems like loan growth was -- the trends were better than certainly many were expecting last year. And it feels like given the expectation for capital markets reopening, improving risk appetites, we should continue to see that building momentum. Could you talk a little bit below the surface around what you're seeing on the loan side? You spoke to it at a really high level before, but I'd just love to drill down and hear what you're seeing more recently. And then where do you stand from a capability perspective, do you guys need to continue to build that out or do you feel like you're fully ramped from a competitive perspective? Sharon Yeshaya : Thanks, Brennan. I'll take that. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, as you alluded to, what we saw, if you remember over the last -- since really interest rates when they began to rise, we saw a decline in the use of the SBL product. And we often actually saw an increase in paydowns. What's changed over the last \u2013 particularly, we noted it this quarter is, we've seen that pace of paydowns decline and then, we've actually seen an increased use of the lines. The important part there is, as you know probably better than anyone else is that, that product is one that is often generally used in periods of time by our clients when you actually see markets rise. And I wouldn't be surprised if we also begin to see it from a tax perspective as we enter the second part of the quarter. In terms of capabilities, excuse me, -- in terms of capabilities, I think we have the capabilities, there is clearly places you can still look from a tailored perspective. There is still capabilities when you think about the assets that we can move from an eligible perspective from the ISG side onto the bank. So it's a different portion of the question in terms of what we're doing from a legal entity perspective. But overall, I think we're very happy with what we have from the wealth management perspective and it's really about seeing the change in environment that should help the dynamics as we move forward to see that increase in loan growth. Ted Pick : And I think integrated firm matters here because there is the ability for us now in our risk committee sessions to look at tailored lending as a form of sophisticated structured product that has some institutional qualities to it. So it's not so much the classic bifurcation of division-by-division, but more of a firm lens across what the commitments are at a time when we should see acceleration in both of the major sides of the house. Brennan Hawken : That's interesting when thinking about utilizing the balance sheet. Thanks for that. I'm really sort of happy to ask this next question because of the focus on cash in the past year or so, and now I don't have to worry about drawing Sharon's ire when I ask about that. It seems like we're likely to have a pivot like, around cash trends. Like, we've got stability and even a little growth in the sweep. And when you think about prior easing cycles, what has -- how long has it taken before we see some of the recycling out of those yield oriented cash equivalents like CDs and money funds, which tend to be thinner margin into more market-oriented products that are higher margin? How should we be thinking about that timeline? Thanks. Sharon Yeshaya : Brennan, it might be the first time in two years that I'm excited to answer a sweeps question. I am really encouraged by the signs that we see on the underlying sweep dynamic. It often actually plays to the fact that there is a lot that our clients can do and a lot that our clients are interested in right now. You see that in the transactional level of activity and all of the underlying trends as it relates to sweeps are actually playing out in that increase in transactional. So if I can just break it down, what we see, right, we look at sweeps and we look at the underlying sweeps in multiple different layers. So how do you think about where the sweeps are going to products that are under one year? How do you look at sweeps in terms of products over one year in terms of fixed income and how do you look at sweeps going in and out of market? What you saw this particular quarter, which I found to be quite encouraging and fascinating in terms of the sentiment of the retail investor actually changing is that we saw a really strong increase of the flows moving from sweeps into market. So it's not as though they aren't using that cash to invest. They're just using that cash to look at it more transactionally to go into market and asset level products. That's point number one. Point number two is, you begin to see the fixed income products that were over one year mature and just sit there. So it's as though when you think about what is the retail client doing, they're waiting, they're getting those assets, they're letting it mature and it's just sitting in some sort of sweep product until they want to deploy those assets into the market. The final point is, you're just seeing less activity go into various types of cash alternatives. And in my mind, that just means that this cash, now that rates has come down, markets are going up, it feels to be somewhat more normalized. It's acting transactional, which is what we had always assumed there would be some level of transactional cash. And to your point, as that rate differential goes down and it's no longer -- you can earn 5% from a cash product. There are places and decisions of what individuals want to do with that cash, they're letting it sit and they're using it to eventually invest in markets. And what you're seeing is that, that is actually taking place in the transactional line item. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Ted Pick : Good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. Well, Ted, last quarter you were pretty built-up on the markets and some of that's playing out. But to how much are your backlogs up? Is our backlog a record? I'm not hearing record backlogs anymore here, up, but not record. I'm just wondering, how much you can monetize the backlogs that were in place in some cases, I guess, one, two, or three years ago? Ted Pick : Yeah. Depending on how you measure it, whether volume or unit, number of units or sort of add value, you see pipelines in the M&A product that are the highest in seven years. So that is really encouraging. Now, some of this will be dependent on how things roll out in the first couple of months of the incoming administration and how things feel on a cross-border basis. But the pent-up activity that we're seeing is starting to release. You had saw some announcements going into the end of the year. You saw some very large capital raises that took place where enormous capacity was filled for great names over a weekend or over a 24 hour period. And that -- we haven't seen that since really 2020 and that was a totally different interest rate and backdrop context. So there is clearly demand even discussions for IPO potential, not just as an option versus selling to another sponsor or selling to a corporate, but in fact, a real option. So I am -- you're right, I've been bullish on this. It has taken some time and I think we will have some unpredictability around regulation in one jurisdiction versus another. But I think the demand to -- for some corporates to get bigger, to purify their businesses, given the deglobalization effect, given climate, given interest rate transition, they have things to do. And then again, the sponsors, they are looking to harvest some of these assets given where prices are and that sort of mismatch of expectations versus the reality of what the market is willing to pay for good companies, I think that's really starting to come together. And I would also say that the -- within the investment banking cylinder, i.e., M&A versus ECM versus DCM, that sub -- those sublines, as you know, have rotated over the last four, six quarters. A couple of quarters ago, it was a great ECM quarter. This past quarter was a DCM quarter, that also is healthy. It suggests the people in the treasury or CFO's office of large corporate clients are looking at all the toggles. So it is an activity-based business and I think '25 as we move through the year, if we continue to have reasonably constructive markets and reasonably predictable interest rates and reasonable sort of geopolitical backdrop, I think we are going to see increasing activity as the year goes on. Mike Mayo : So you said the best backlog in seven years was that for mergers or all investment bank? Ted Pick : Largely the M&A number, Mike. Globally. Mike Mayo : Okay. So yeah, that's a -- I guess, that would be a lagging driver to the whole capital markets theme. And for you guys, when you think of a multiplier... Ted Pick : Yes. By the way, yes. Yes, on that, Mike. Exactly as you've been saying all along, that is the last piece. And there have been periods where it's sort of frustrating, stuff gets discussed at a sort of free Board approval level and then there's some unpredictability and it gets tabled. But the sort of the inventory around stuff that is idea flow that is a near announcement, that piece of it is increasing and it may not result ultimately in a merger ticket. It may actually turn into the company being carved out and taken public. But I think what we are increasingly confident about, again if the market and the economy holds up and those are -- those are ifs, but if they do, then you're going to see the entire corporate finance cylinder really kick into something that maybe looks like mid-90s activity classic corporate finance. Sharon Yeshaya : Operator, can you hear us? We can move on to the next question. Operator : Steven, your line is now open. We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Ted Pick : Good morning, Steven. Thanks, and good morning. Steven Chubak : Good morning, Ted. Good morning, Sharon. Sharon Yeshaya : Good morning. Steven Chubak : So, one is that -- wanted to ask on the 30% wealth management margin target. Just taking a step back, you're already running at 29% on a core basis. Sharon, you cited a number of headwinds in the coming year, whether it's just NII inflecting AUM growth, capital markets fee tailwinds. I'm just trying to understand what would preclude you from getting to that goal this year. And why isn't the longer-term aspiration something north of 30 just given significant operating leverage in this model at scale? Sharon Yeshaya : So I'll take that, Steve. I just juxtaposed this call to where we were a year ago and a lot of the conversations, obviously, as you think about the change in the rate environment, but then also very importantly, the change in the asset management fee revenues. That has been a very large contributor to the point that you're making where we've seen the fee-based increase, we've seen the AUM and then we've seen the revenues. But I don't want to lose sight of the fact that we're investing in this business and that investment is very important. We've always said over the course of the last five years, we can get to 30%, but we don't want to starve the business. We want to do it in a durable manner. And we want to make sure that we are able to invest specifically in the places that might be margin dilutive. Those are workplace. There are different parts of marketing and investment in the sales cycle as you think about self-directed. Putting money towards the top of the funnel, putting money towards technology that actually helps match places where you have the top of the funnel into the advisor-led channel. All of that's working. So the last thing one would want to do is, put a target out there, see a change in dynamics associated with all of a sudden markets go down or there is some shock that we're unaware of, you're unable to meet those targets and you pull back investments, that's not how we want to run this. As Ted said in his prepared remarks, the word across this entire -- these scripts is durable. We're looking for durable margins. We're looking for durable growth. We're looking for durable returns. All of that comes into play as we think about the actual investment in the business over time. Ted Pick : Yeah. And what I would add to that is, the extraordinary performance of -- well, you just look at the fact that revenues grew by 8% year-over-year, but PBT grew by 19%. So that is -- that's the kind of progress against larger numbers that we are excited to see and a full contribution to the firm outcome. Steven Chubak : No. That's great to hear. Just one quick follow-up, Sharon. You referenced the recently announced partnership with Carta. And I was hoping to double-click into some of the tangible financial benefits from leveraging that partnership. Just given the number of planned participants, it's been pretty stagnant over the last few quarters, but certainly feels as though this could be a potential accelerant, maybe help reinvigorate growth within that channel. Sharon Yeshaya : Yeah. So let me just first -- I'll take the second part of your question first because there is some stuff to unpack when you actually look at the underlying participants. We have talked about and we've seen -- we will see a transition from some of the stock sale plants that we have sold and announced both in Europe and in Asia, that are associated with the actual participants. So I just want to be clear that -- there are other underlying factors in there. The other point that I would mention is, we have not been in a cycle in which -- especially over the last two years that you've seen a lot of monetization events. And so you have changes really in the workforce dynamics for many of these companies where you might have seen headcount reductions, you might have seen acquisitions in which some of those stock plan participants decline. I don't want you to read into that as though there is not investment or it's not growing because we continue to meet win mandates and we continue to have expanded corporate relationships. So that's important as we talk about where are we investing. We are investing and we're seeing progress as we continue to have greater breadth of corporates that we service within the United States in particular. Now as it relates to Carta and I'm glad you mentioned and asked the question is that's a really exciting partnership, especially, as the capital market cycle turns. So as you're likely aware, Carta does service the private companies in particular. And what we have now done and the relationship that we announced at the end of last year was that we have an exclusive partnership with Carta, which means that they will refer those private -- different stock plans or different corporate companies to Morgan Stanley as they move into going public. It's really exciting for many reasons, not just the opportunities on the wealth side, but also as Ted talked a lot about is the integrated firm. So there is a lot of places to build out those relationships as those companies are going through that transition. Moreover, what we are committed to doing as we go through that transition is to make sure that it's a seamless experience for those clients. As you know, we already do service individually some of those private companies. As they move public, they'll have that seamless experience both from a Carta referral perspective and even what we see that's currently on the books. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Ted Pick : Good morning, Christian. Christian Bolu : Good morning, Ted and Sharon. Maybe on Wealth Management organic growth, first of all. So if I look at flows over the last three years, total flows have been somewhat short of that sort of $1 trillion target and have been at the lower end of your 5% to 7% organic growth target. So maybe just talk through how you think about the ability to accelerate organic growth going forward and then maybe confidence level in that $1 trillion target? Sharon Yeshaya : So what I would like to note here is, this is a really I think in the environment that we've been in the last two years, I think, this is a remarkable outcome. Especially, if you look and you compare it to our peer set and anyone who's been able to actually aggregate assets were best-in-class. And a lot of that best-in-class has to do with the fact that -- and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, the vast majority of the assets, the new assets that we're seeing over the course of this last year has been on the advisor-led channel. And we've talked about some of the headwinds that are going from a cyclical perspective that I think are beginning to abate. And those have been spending of money, you're necessarily -- not necessarily seeing as much money in motion and you aren't seeing monetization events from workplace corporates. So you add the self-directed channel, you're not necessarily seeing as much money coming in. From the workplace side, you're not necessarily seeing monetization events. So people aren't getting that cash, you're not seeing companies going public. Those things are beginning to turn. And so this -- these results were really led from the advisor-led channel from new clients and existing clients, new clients being really important. And so, I think that there is a lot of opportunity there in terms of the 5% to 7%. Ted Pick : Yeah. What I'd add to that, Christian, is sort of a big picture answer and a little picture answer. My little picture answer would be just taking a look again at Slide 9, fee-based flows. That is the -- that's sort of the core of the funnel. And we've been talking about that every quarter, and Jed Finn running well very much has been focused on that too. And you see that the number just continues to move. $109 billion last year or two years ago, $123 billion in 2024. So fee-based flows, that's kind of the ultimate outcome. And you see that we are seeing this incremental activity now in the self-directed product from clients who they kind of -- have the kind of experience that we talk about when they make their way to a financial advisor, it could prove very sticky. My big picture observation though would be, one, and I know you know this, but by way of sort of a reminder, just given what's happened in the market over the last year of when we did this call a year ago, the combined assets for wealth and investment management stood at $6.6 trillion. And as you know, we said we're going to get to $10 trillion and we're going to keep going. And in a year, we've gone from $6.6 trillion to $7.9 trillion. So that is a $1.3 trillion in a year. Now, of course, we've had the kind of markets that are -- take asset prices higher, but that I think speaks for itself in terms of our ability to continue to stay on what really is what I would have folks paying attention to, which is just this commitment to get to $10 trillion. And whether that takes X years or X plus one year or X plus two years, we want to get the kind of assets that ultimately work their way through the funnel and you say, well, what's the KPI there? And I'd say, the KPI there is going back to Slide 9, which is are we increasing the TAM of relationships and are we doing that across the financial advisory of lever through workplace and through self-directed? Are we doing it all three? The answer is, yes. Are we seeing enough net new assets that it's actually material and clearly at $250 per annum, that is a material number? And then how are we doing on that which you can model on a multiple -- a nice multiple on, which is fee-based flows, and there it is on the right. So I'm less wrapped around the axle on whether we are at 700 or 800 versus $1.23 trillion in a given three year period and more focused on sort of the composition of the funnel and that the assets are growing materially, but that ultimately we are translating that across a broader number of clients, again, $19 million plus and that ultimately, at least for some of them translates into financial advisory fee-based flows and that's the right side. So that's kind of the way we're thinking about it, Christian, in the context now of the integrated firm. Christian Bolu : Okay. Very fair. Thanks for the full answer. Maybe another quick one here on just comp leverage, very strong expense, especially in ISG comp. And I'm sorry if I missed this in the prepared remarks, but is the 2024 full year ISG comp ratio of 31% kind of a good place to run going forward, obviously, as you mean, revenue continues to grow? Sharon Yeshaya : Yeah. Obviously, Christian, as you can tell, we look at comp on a full year basis and you did have the outperformance as it relates to the revenue in the fourth quarter on a relative basis. And so you do see changes within that comp. We don't give full year guidance specifically on one expense line. We manage the company holistically. When we think about our expenses, we're looking at our overall efficiency of the firm. And what I would pay attention to is on the last page of the targets, the 70% efficiency ratio goal that we've stated over the long-term. Ted Pick : And what I'd add to that is, listen, we're running a talent business. And so we pay for performance and performance comes in sort of the upside for our partners comes in two forms. One is through compensation over many years, which is why tenure matters. And of course, total return in stock ownership, which is, as you know, a critical part of our partner compensation, so that is the thinking. Of course, when you have good years, you experience some operating leverage in comp of which then flows to the bottom line. In tougher years, as you know, the comp ratio moves higher. What we did do in 2023 in the second half was some of the tough work around calling and doing some lateral work and that obviously has the -- if it's done right, both enhances the efficiency of the income statement, but also allows for some incremental productivity on the top line of those bankers and traders and salespeople and structures and risk management folks as they begin to kind of gestate over the two, three years after that. So we feel like we came out at a good place there. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll move to Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP. Ted Pick : Hey, Devin. Devin Ryan : Thanks so much. Hey, Ted. Hey, Sharon. I just have one on Investment Management. Slide 12, you lay out, your parametric has been a great success story in the alternatives bucket. In investment management, overall, it's still less than 10% of firmwide revenue. And I know the Alts (ph) bucket specifically is an area of focus, but I'm curious areas like private equity, private credit, there is a lot of secular growth there. I know you have ambitions to grow private credit, but how do you think about that becoming a larger strategic piece of Morgan Stanley? And what's the appetite there to maybe do acquisitions to step function or accelerate that? Sharon Yeshaya : So when we look at -- what I would focus you on as we think about investment management more broadly is the fact that, as you know, we are looking to create a diversified platform and we obviously were able to do that, as you mentioned, through acquisitions. And specifically through the acquisition of Eaton Vance when we think about both Parametric and a lot of the fixed income products. We're beginning to see a lot of reaping of those synergies across the more -- the wealth management business, across MSIM, and across all of the initiatives that we laid out at the beginning. So remember, what we said is, we thought we -- there was more to do on Parametric, specifically on the retail side, that's working. We're seeing increased participation from our FAs, retail clients, and even asset managers to leverage that parametric product. We have also noted that we plan to think about things like fixed-income and use fixed-income and see international distribution, that was evidenced this quarter. A lot of the flows that we saw there have to do with international distribution. So the synergies themselves are working already. I think there is much more to do just on bringing the two franchises together. And as we see continued investment with different parts of private credit, different parts of private equity, different parts of infrastructure, we will take part in those secular growth trends as they move forward. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Ted Pick : Good morning, Dan. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. One more question just on wealth. Can you talk about advisor retention, kind of recruitment, and backlogs here? And then you used to talk about the companion accounts within wealth and workplace. So curious if there is any update on where that sits and some of the progress you're seeing within that initiative. Sharon Yeshaya : Yeah, I'll take that. So in terms of the workplace in general and how we're beginning to see the transitions in the companion accounts. What I would focus you on is companion accounts were something that we were looking at the beginning of time when we had put together the E TRADE and the Morgan Stanley platforms, that integration is largely complete. What we're more focused now is actually better understanding the channel migration. And those are the numbers and statistics that we've been giving over the last couple of calls more specifically. So what I mean by channel migration is, we have workplace assets that began at some point in workplace and we're seeing them move into the advisor-led concept. Over the last five years or so, since 2020, we've seen $300 billion coming and initiating at some point from workplace and moving into that advisor-led channel, that has been a big part of the move towards first transactional and then that movement from transactional flows into fee-based. So those are more of the metrics that I'd point you to on the forward when we think about being able to mark ourselves to market from a funnel perspective. Operator : We'll take our last question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Ted Pick : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hi, Ted. Thank you. Can you guys share with us -- we share -- many investors -- many of us share your optimism on the outlook for Morgan Stanley in the business? Can you share with us the risk aside from the obvious geopolitical risks globally, what risks or curveballs are you guys trying to keep your eyes on for this year? Because again things do look very good for yourselves and others. But what are some of the risks you guys talk about on a regular basis? Sharon Yeshaya : So needless to say, we're constantly running a number of stress tests as you think about the risks, geopolitical macro in nature, counterparty risks and that's been a lot of the focus when you think about the velocity of the balance sheet and all of the capital metrics that we have is making sure that we're in a position to constantly refresh. And look, when we think about -- if you look back at any of the episodes that we've talked about and then a lot of the risks that we've learned, we are constantly thinking about where are there tall trees. How do you see the velocity of different positions that you have? So it's very hard to pin down and say, well, what match risk have you not necessarily solved for because generally speaking, there is something brand new that one -- I don't know that anyone knew that there would be a global pandemic, right? But the underlying risk of what does the global pandemic mean, you think about even the risk that you might have seen over the course of this quarter. You have an election, we don't know what's going to happen with the election. None of us knew what would necessarily happen with the election. You look at the risks, you look at tall trees, you think about being able to bring down, what can you bring down quickly and how do you think about velocity? And then how do you run scenarios? What does it mean for higher rates? What does it mean for lower rates? And we look at different geographical exposures as well to try and better understand how we can manage all of that dynamism as you move forward. Ted Pick : I guess, what I'd add to that, Gerard, is most of the risks that we have been looking at in this period are -- and Sharon kind of went through a whole panoply of them, they are largely in the buckets of either the implications or the reality of regime change around interest rates that the period of zero interest rates and zero inflation is now passed and that this hot coal that we feel are now tilted more towards inflation. And if there was a downside risk, it would be something that felt more stagflationary that we are running risk scenarios around that, then there might be periods when it feels a little colder again. And that is all sort of imputed in the language of interest rate policy around the world. So that's sort of bucket one, the end of financial repression. And then bucket two is the geopolitical uncertainty and tension that we're seeing that has built over the last number of years and will continue. And that's important to us because, of course, we're running a global business. So there may be places where there are re-equitization opportunities. There may be places where there is outsized risk in behalf of clients and we have to navigate that as well. So those are the two major buckets, I think, of our time. And that is why it's so important that we were able to put up a quarter that concluded a year where we had the kind of consistency we had on the top line, on the bottom line. We can't undertake that, that will be the case in every market context. But if you think about the year we just had, there were multiple years within that year. And the fact that the enterprise through the businesses we're in was able to generate that kind of consistency on the top and bottom line, I think augurs well for a period where we think all things being equal, the denominator of opportunities should improve. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you everyone for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",
