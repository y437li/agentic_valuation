During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Friday, May 02, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference over to Nancy Christal, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Ma\u2019am Nancy Christal : Thanks Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I am here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO, who will provide a business update and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review our first quarter results as well as guidance for the second quarter and year. Jon Roberts, President of PBM and Helena Foulkes, President of the Retail Business, are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up, so we can provide more callers with the chance to ask a question. Please note that just before this call, we posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information you will hear today as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Additionally, please note that our quarterly report on Form 10-Q will be filed by the close of business today and it will be available on our website at that time. During today\u2019s presentation, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings including the risk factors section and cautionary statement disclosure in our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K. During this call, we\u2019ll also use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company\u2019s performance including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of these non-GAAP items as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today\u2019s call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year. And now, I will turn this over to Larry Merlo. Larry Merlo : Well thanks, Nancy. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We posted solid results in the first quarter with adjusted earnings per share growing 22.5% to a $1.02 per share. Both our PBM and retail segments delivered solid operating profit growth despite the impact of a fair amount of unforeseen weather related issues. And when combining the weather issues with the higher than anticipated tax rate, the estimated impact to our adjusted earnings per share versus our expectations was at least, $0.03 per share. Now, let me just say that it\u2019s unusual to hear us talk about the impact of weather on our business, historically it\u2019s been our practice to not blame the weather when we explain our results. But this quarter, the amount of severe weather was so abnormal that quite frankly it\u2019s hard not to talk about it. I want to emphasize that our underlying trends were very strong and given the weather issues noted, retail operating profit increased a very healthy 14.2% just below the low end of our expectations. PBM operating profit growth was slightly above the high-end of our expectations increasing a very strong 28.5%, also of note is the $1.8 billion of free cash generated in the quarter, which puts us well on our way to achieving this year\u2019s free cash flow goal. So while disappointed that the severe weather put a damper on an otherwise excellent quarter we remain very confident in our outlook for the full year and Dave will discuss our financial results and guidance in greater detail during his financial review. So with that let me turn to a brief business update and I\u2019ll start with Health Reform. As I am sure everyone is aware the latest available data suggests that 8 million individuals have enrolled in the public exchanges. Now it\u2019s still too early to estimate the impact this might have on utilization trends, acknowledging that the mix of those lives is unclear, so obviously more to come on this issue. With regard to Medicaid expansion available data indicates that 3 million individuals have gained coverage and it\u2019s forecasted that this number will continue to increase in the coming months. And as expected we have seen a slight positive impact on our results from this growth in the Medicaid segment and we continue to believe that CVS Caremark is well-positioned to serve these new customers across our enterprise assets. I also want to touch briefly on our 10 year agreement with Cardinal Health that agreement forms the largest generic sourcing entity here in the U.S. Both CVS Caremark and Cardinal continue to work closely together on all aspects of the launch, deepening our long standing working relationship and building on our combined sourcing expertise. Initial reactions from suppliers have been positive and we remain on track for go live data as soon as July 1st of this year. The company will be staffed with individuals from both Cardinal and CVS Caremark. The entity will be located in Foxborough, Massachusetts and operate under the name Red Oak Sourcing. So progress continues and we\u2019re looking forward to this exciting new venture. Moving to our PBM business and I\u2019ll start with an update on the 2014 selling season. And since our last earnings call, we did add some second half wins and we warn that the transition of some business loss through acquisition primarily the Amerigroup business would be delayed from 2014 until 2015. And as a result of these changes, our client net new business for \u201814 increased to $3 billion and that\u2019s up from $2.4 billion at our last update. I should also note that Amerigroup would have been require to pay in early termination fee has the business transition this year. So improvement in the 14 net new businesses expected to be immaterial for this year\u2019s financial results. I also want to remind everyone that the 2014 net new business excludes the impact from attrition in our Med-D PDP business. As we discussed during our Analyst Day, we lost approximately $1.3 billion in 14 revenues related to last year\u2019s CMS sanction. And with the sanction listed we are now able to enroll newly eligible Medicare lives as they age into the program throughout the year. However, we miss the opportunity to gain lives through open enrollment last fall. In our SilverScript plan as just mentioned we began to enroll new choosers for February as they aged into Medicare and we expect to begin receiving low-income subsidy auto assignees this month. And we currently have roughly 3 million lives in our individual PDP and we continue to see significant opportunity to grow the business over the long term. I am pleased to report that we have had a very successful 2014 welcome season. We have affectively handled 100s of implementations with very high levels of service and this success is been driven by investments that we have made in our people, our processes and our technology. As for the 15th selling season, it\u2019s still too early to provide a substantive update but I would just say that the marketplace is active, and we are seeing a significantly higher level of RFPs relative to the 14th selling season and would also say that our RFP activity is generally consistent with the levels experienced two years ago. In mid April PBMI released its annual pharmacy benefit manager customer satisfaction report, its broad survey it includes the opinions of nearly 400 plans sponsors who represent almost 65 million members. And we are pleased that CVS Caremark ranked first among large publically traded PBMs on overall satisfaction. And we think these results underscore our commitment to excellent service and we believe that we are very well positioned in the marketplace to both retain business and gain share with our strong service record along with our unique sweet of capabilities. We recently announced the renewal of a three year contract to provide integrated pharmacy benefit services for the federal employee health benefit program or FEP as it is commonly called, and we continue to provide mail, retail and specialty PBM services along with highly customized clinical programs to FEP\u2019s more than 5 million federal employees, retirees, and dependents. And we are certainly very pleased that FEP continues to recognize the value and service that we provide to their plan and to their members. Moving on to specialty, our business remains strong in the first quarter, revenues were up approximately 34% year-over-year. Today about 60% of specialty revenues in our PBM book of business are dispensed through CVS Caremark specialty pharmacies. And our service model is resonating with our PBM customers as well as in the specialty stand-alone market impacting those specialty clients for which we are currently not the PBM. At our recent client forum last month, conversations confirmed that finding solutions that will stem the specialty cost trend is our client\u2019s top priority. And we believe that tools used in the PBM market to manage the traditional pharmacy spend could be effectively applied in the specialty sector. And we are well positioned to help clients through a variety of unique programs that improve cost quality and access, whether the drugs are paid for under the medical benefit or the pharmacy benefit. We recently released our annual trend management report, we call that report insights. And while spending for traditional medications was up just 0.8% in 2013, overall trend was 3.8% and that was largely driven by a 15.6% increase in specialty medications. Among our clients specialty now represents about 22.5% of total drug spend and projections have that growing to as much as 50% by 2018. So, let me highlight two offerings that utilize our unique assets to help our customers manage specialty costs, our medical pharmacy management and site of care management. First, we believe our suite of offerings in medical pharmacy management or let\u2019s call it MPM is a significant differentiator in our strategy to manage all aspects of the specialty patients. According to our recent Milliman report, the transition of that portion of specialty flowing through the medical benefit moving it to the pharmacy benefit can save payers and average of 19% across 14 classes of specialty injectables. For those classes, the payers choose to pay under the medical benefit our NovoLogix claims platform allows plans to manage these drugs with the same level of precision that is routinely expected from PBMs and again that leads to significant cost savings. So, the opportunity here for payers is large. And we continue to have meaningful discussions regarding how CVS Caremark can best help them. Secondly, we can offer patients more convenient, lower cost alternatives to hospital outpatient infusion. And this could be the physician\u2019s office; it could be retail infusion site or even the patient\u2019s home. All of these create opportunities to reduce costs. And our recent our acquisition of Coram will enable us to execute and do just that. Coram is a market leader in specialty infusion services and enteral nutrition. The integration to-date is going well; our sales forces are being aligned; and we are beginning to develop integrated products for both hospitals and health plans. Now in addition to those two opportunities, the roll out of our new Specialty Connect offerings is expected to be completed at the end of this quarter and Specialty Connect integrates our mail and retail capabilities, providing choice and convenience for members while preserving the central clinical expertise that leads to better health outcomes. And as of late April, more than 15,000 specialty patients have been served by this new model, and adherence and satisfaction rates are already meeting or exceeding those we see in traditional specialty. So, we continue to be excited by the prospects for our Specialty Connect offering as clients see this is another tool to achieve their objectives. So I think I\u2019ve given you some examples, so I think you can see how we\u2019re positioned to continue to gain share in the fast growing specialty marketplace as we develop innovative offerings to capitalize on our unique ability to optimize cost, quality and access. Moving on to the retail business, again we had solid operating profit growth in the quarter despite the tough comparisons with last year\u2019s strong flu season along with the extreme weather we experienced throughout the quarter. Total same-store sales increased 1.4% while pharmacy same-store sales increased 3.8%. Pharmacy sales comps were negatively impacted by about 120 basis points due to recent generic introductions and by approximately 90 to a 100 basis points from the impact of weather along with the comparison to last year\u2019s flu season. Pharmacy script comps increased 2.1% on a 30 day equivalent basis and we estimate that the impact of weather and flu resulted in a negative impact to script comps of a 180 to 200 basis points. As for the front store business, comps decreased 3.8% and we estimate that the combined effects of weather and the flu resulted in a negative impact of a 140 to 160 basis points. Comps were also negatively impacted by about 80 basis points due to shift of the Easter holiday from Q1 last year into the second quarter this year. Now I\u2019ll note that excluding any impact from our exit of the tobacco category, we do expect our front store comps to improve in the remaining quarters of the year. We plan to break out the impact to comps upon exiting the tobacco category, so you will be to easily see this underlying performance. Also worth noting, the response to our exit from the tobacco category continues to be extremely positive. And we remain confident that this strategic decision will lead to enhanced enterprise wide opportunities for growth as CVS Caremark plays and expanding role in our evolving healthcare delivery system. In the first quarter, we continued to see an increase in both the breadth and depth of promotional activity of the marketplace. And as we stated many times in the past, we continue to reduce our dependency on the weekly circular and to begin to shift promotional investments to more personalized offers through our ExtraCare program, all with the goal of driving profitable sales rather than chasing those empty sales. And as competitor promotional activity grew higher, we actually reduce dour circular add blocks year-over-year, we reduced them by about 6%. And as a result of staying true to our targeted promotional strategy, I\u2019m pleased to say that we saw growth in our average basket size along with notable growth in our front store margin in the quarter. Now of course, we would like to see better front store comps, but it\u2019s important that we have a sustainable front end strategy. And we\u2019re doing a number of things that we believe will drive our front store business long-term. And while we\u2019re at an early stage for some of these efforts, we are beginning to see what could become meaningful change as we go forward, again with the goal of delivering the right value to customers while driving profitable sales. And let me give you a couple of examples. Through insights from ExtraCare in our predictive modeling for personalized emails, we have experienced email open rates that are two times the industry average with response rates that are five times the industry norm. And the importance of that lies in our ability to increase share of wallet of our best customers. Beauty Club is another example where we see the impact of personalization as we engage 13 million of our best beauty customers, These Beauty Club members are shopping our stores more and they are spending 2.5 times the average beauty customer. Driving higher margin store brand sales, it\u2019s another area focus for us and our store brands as a percent of front store sales increased about 25 basis points to 17.6% in the quarter and our goal remains to drive store brands to more than 20% of front store sales over the next few years. So I hope you can see that we are not sitting still at retail and we will continue to explore innovative personalization strategies through ExtraCare insights to drive results. Turning to our real estate program, we opened 22 new stores, relocated 9, closed 7 resulting in 15 net new stores in the quarter, and we are on track to achieve square footage growth of 2% to 3% for the year. Before turning it over to Dave, let me briefly touch on MinuteClinic which continues to post strong results. In the quarter, revenues increased 11.4% versus a year ago. We opened 28 net new clinics in the quarter and we currently operate 828 clinics in 28 states plus the District of Columbia and we plan to open at least 150 new clinics this year, about a third which will be in new markets. MinuteClinic added two new health system alliances during the quarter, bringing our total number of affiliations with major U.S. health systems to 32. We also recently announced our move to the Epic Electronic Medical Record, which we believe will allow us to better integrate records with other hospital and provider groups. It will also enable MinuteClinic to respond more quickly to the needs of our patients by accelerating our ability to offer new services. And these enablers will allow us to achieve our goal of creating a national platform that supports primary care by providing integrated, high quality care that is convenient, accessible, and affordable. So, with that let me turn it to Dave to go through the financial review. Dave Denton : Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. As always our plan to provide a detailed review of our first quarter results, followed by a review of our guidance. But before I get to that, I want to highlight how we continue to enhance shareholder value through our disciplined capital allocation program. During the quarter, we paid approximately $325 million in dividends and given our continued strong earnings outlook for the year; we remain on track to surpass our targeted payout ratio of 25% at some point during this year, more than a year ahead of our original schedule. Additionally, we repurchased 11 million shares for approximately $801 million, at an average price of $72.69 per share. And we still expect to complete at least $4 billion of share repurchases for the full year \u201814. So between dividends and share repurchases, we\u2019ve returned more than $1.1 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter alone and we continue to expect return more than $5 billion for the full year. And as Larry mentioned, we generated approximately $1.8 billion of free cash in the first quarter. Strong growth in earnings and working capital improvements were the key drivers of this large year-over-year increase. And we continue to expect to produce free cash flow of between $5.5 billion and $5.8 billion this year. Now turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $1.02 per share up 22.5%, reflecting very solid growth across all of our segments, despite be in one sample of our EPS guidance range and as Larry stated earlier, the estimated impact to adjusted earnings per share from the combined effect of the unforeseen bad weather and the higher than anticipated tax rate was at least $0.03 per share. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.95 for the quarter, while the retail segments produced excellent growth in operating profit, it performed just below the low end of our expectations. Now in contrast the PBM came-in just above the high-end of our expectations. Now let me quickly walk you through our results. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the first quarter increased 6.3% or approximately $1.9 billion to $32.7 billion, PBM net revenues increased a healthy 10.3% or approximately $1.9 billion to $20.2 billion. The strong performance was driven by specialty, inflation and net new business. Offsetting this to some degree was lower mail choice claims, as well as the negative impact on the claims from bad weather. The PBM\u2019s generic dispensing rate increased approximately 190 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 82%. Revenues in the retail business increased 2.7% in the quarter, or approximately $441 million, to $16.5 billion. Sales in the retail segment were a little light due to unforeseen extreme weather, as well as our decision to remain true to our strategy of not responding to aggressive promotions by others in the marketplace. Retail GDR increased by approximately a 170 basis points versus the first quarter of \u201813, to 83%. Turning to gross margin, we reported 18.2% for the consolidated company in the quarter, an increase of approximately 5 basis points compared to Q1 of \u201813. Within the PBM segment, gross margin increased approximately 45 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 4.6%, while gross profit dollars increased approximately 21.8% year-over-year. The increase year-over-year was driven by growth in our specialty business, better acquisition cost and rebate economics, and the increase in GDR. These positive margin drivers were partially offset by typical client price compression. Gross margin in the retail segment was 31.5% up about 60 basis points over LY. This improvement was driven by the increase in GDR as well as a notable increase in front store margins. Additionally gross profit dollars increased 4.8% year-over-year within the retail business. Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues improved by approximately 65 basis points from Q1 of \u201813 to 12%, while total SG&A dollars grew by only 0.9%. The PBM segment expense growth kept pace with revenues as the SG&A rate was flat to LY at 1.5%. In the retail segment, SG&A as a percent of sales improved approximately 45 basis points to 20.8%, while expenses grew just 0.5%. Keep in mind that our SG&A dollar growth in retail was minimal largely due to the comparison with last year, as we are lapping the highest SG&A growth rate quarter of 2013. Now this was partially offset by weather related costs incurred during the first quarter. Within corporate segment expenses were down approximately $9 million to $190 million. And adding it all up operating margin for the total enterprise improved approximately 70 basis points to 6.2%. Operating margin in the PBM improved approximately 45 basis points to 3.2%, while operating margin at retail improved about 105 basis points to 10.6%. For the quarter, PBM operating profit was strong growing at 28.5%, this was again just above the high-end of our expectations for operating profit growth in the PBM segment. Retail operating profit increased a very healthy 14.2% and while retail sales were negatively affected by weather retail operating margin was in line with our estimate at 10.6%. And going below the line on a consolidated income statement. Net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $33 million from LY to $158 million. The debt we issued in the fourth quarter was a primary driver of the increased. Our weighted share count was 1.19 billion shares and finally our effective tax rate was 39.5% slightly higher than we anticipated. Now let me update you on our guidance and our focus on the highlights, you can find the additional details of our guidance in the slide presentation that we posted earlier this morning on our website. As we stated in our press release we are maintaining our 2014 EPS ranges given our confidence and the outlook for the rest of this year. We currently expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in \u201814 in the range of $4.36 to $4.50 reflecting strong year-over-year growth of 10.25% to 13.75%, and that\u2019s after removing a gain of approximately $0.04 associated with the legal settlement in the third quarter of \u201813. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.09 to $4.23 per share. We have increased our top line outlook in the PBM and now expect revenue growth of eight in three quarter percent to 10% about a 150 basis point higher than our prior guidance. This revised guidance reflects our expectations for better than expected growth within specialty pharmacy, few by combination of both inflation and new product mix as well as the impact of the change in net new business. And as the result of this improved expectation, we are raising our guidance for consolidated net revenue grows to 5.25% to 6.5% are 100 basis points higher than our previous guidance. Guidance for operating profit growth in our segments remains the same, we continue to expect retail operating profit to increase 7% to 8.75% year-over-year and PBM operating profit to increase 6.75% to 10.75%. We are increasing our expectations for amortization for the year slightly by approximately $5 million to account for additional expense related Coram. And we now expect amortization to up approximately $520 million for the year. And as I have said before, our free cash flow guidance for the year remains in the range of $5.5 billion to $5.8 billion. Now in the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.11 per share, reflecting growth of 11% to 14.75% versus Q2 of 2013. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of a $1.01 to $1.04 per share during the second quarter. Now within the retail segment, we expect revenues to increase 2.5% to 4% versus the second quarter of LY, this revenue increase will be driven by solid prescription growth as well as the positive impact of the Easter shift on front store sales. Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 2.75% to 3.75%, while we expect total same store sales in the range of 1.25% to 2.75% In the PBM, we expect revenue growth of between 10.75% and 12%, driven by continued strong growth in specialty and inflation. We expect retail operating profit growth of 4.5% 6.5% in the second quarter. We expect PBM operating profit growth of 18.25% to 23.25% in the second quarter. Now just a couple of notes on second quarter margins. During the second quarter, we expect that our large state will finalize its reduction in Medicaid reimbursement rate. Given our historical rate estimate this finalization will likely have a positive impact on pharmacy margins in the second quarter as we reconcile to the confirmed rate structure. On the flip side, we expect front stores margins to decline in the second quarter due to the anticipated discounting of some inventory related to our exit of the tobacco category as well as tough comparisons with the second quarter of LY the highest rate quarter of \u201813. And I know that we expect front store margins to turn positive again in the back half of the year. All things considerably expect another very solid quarter in Q2. So in closing I will leave you with three key thoughts first, we posted solid growth this quarter and we\u2019re off to a very good start for the year. Second our outlook for 2014 for both businesses and both at the enterprise level is unchanged and very strong. And finally we expect to continue to generate very strong free cash and we will use a disciplined approach to capital allocation to ensure that we maximize the value will return to our shareholders. And with that I will turn it back to Larry. Larry Merlo : Okay. Thank you Dave. And let me just wrap-up with a reminder that all the ongoing changes that we are seeing in the healthcare environment are certainly creating unique opportunities for CVS Caremark and our unmatched model in innovative solutions make us well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities and we believe create a sustainable competitive advantage. And our management team remains laser focused on driving enterprise growth while enhancing shareholder value. So with that let\u2019s go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yes, thanks guys for taking the question here. Larry, Dave I wanted to talk about on the PBM side here lot of decisions over the last few months particularly around all the new drugs and HepC and just want to talk about what your experience has been so far on the PBM side and then also particularly on our specialty pharmacy but also on your Part D lines. I think you talked about 3 million members in individual Part D plans, do you have a sense on your exposure there as the more of the risk bearing entity? And can you kind of talk about per patient what your exposure would be in Part D? Thanks. Larry Merlo : Yes, Charles this is Larry. Let me just start and then I\u2019ll ask Jon to jump in here. But I think as we have alluded to in our prepared remarks specialty patients are dealing with complex issues and again as we heard last month at our client forum, our clients are more focused than they have ever been on managing this trend without compromising care. And the private market has solutions that have proven to be successful and there is an acceptance and a growing interest in terms of bringing some of those tools to that they\u2019ve been successful on the traditional side of pharmacy to specialty. And in addition to that we talked about some examples this morning where we believe we have unique integrated products that even take that one step further. So our goal is to bring these tools to the entire specialty market HepC just becomes one of those categories. So Jon why don\u2019t you\u2026. Jon Roberts : Yes, okay. And Charles, Sovaldi is about $80,000 per 12 weeks of therapy. We do have prior authorization programs in place today to ensure appropriate utilization. And I think the most important thing is we\u2019re expecting new drugs and to the marketplace in the fourth quarter that will create competition and allow us to leverage our formulary capabilities that we introduced three years ago very successfully. So it is getting a lot of attention, I agree with Larry that the tools that we have can appropriately manage this and we\u2019re expecting to be able to leverage those as new drugs come to the marketplace. As far as our Part D plan, there is usage in there and we expect that to continue but we do have protection in the risk quarters. So we expect the impact to be minimal for this year. Charles Rhyee : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And maybe just Jon, just a follow-up there, talk about your formulary tools. Can you talk about some examples in specialty where your formulary tools have been able to leverage the pricing, I guess an example would be maybe you experienced in multiple sclerosis because if you look at the list price for some of these drugs like even and Avonex which is an older therapy relative to some of the other one. The price has still increased over the years, but is that an issue that we\u2019re looking at the list price versus maybe what the prices that your clients are actually paying? Thanks. Jon Roberts : Well, Charles, how we leverage our formulary strategy is, formulary placement access to the drugs for our clients and their members and we negotiate with pharma rebates that those past back to our clients and reduced the cost of that drug, the gross cost that you see they get a rebate on top of that and reduces the ultimate price of that they pay. So that\u2019s how it works, we have done it, with specialty growth homeowners is a good example and we have been very successful and that will expand to other categories and HepC is a very good example of how we will expand that moving forward. Larry Merlo : And Charles, the only thing I would add is that among clients there has been a growing interest formulary management. And I think as you are aware we have seen that competitors introduce very similar strategies and we introduced our formulary programs some three years ago, so we think it\u2019s a real opportunity to drive down cost. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Jones : Thanks for the question. Just looking at the pharmacy same store sales results, pretty impressive in considering the weather impact, factoring the impacts from generic and it would appear that pricing was up about 300 basis points, obviously it is still very healthy but a pretty significant step down from the pricing impacts from the previous quarter. We have heard some comments around inflation moderating, just wondering what you guys are seeing on the pricing front and have trends in pricing on both generic and branded changed at all in your views since you gave guidance back in December? Larry Merlo : Bob I will start and Dave May want to jump in here as well. But we haven\u2019t seen anything out of the ordinary that we have been anticipated or comprehended in our outlook. And on the branded side I think that the trends there have been very similar to what we have seen in prior years. And in the generic market, there has been -- we\u2019ve seen some price increases, but it\u2019s relatively off of -- it\u2019s a small number off our entire book of business and really not material in our results. Dave Denton : Yes. I\u2019ll just add just a bit to that more around the generic side. As we look at it from a generic marketplace, there is a lot of generic capacity in the marketplace today and there is a lot of generic competition. So, as we think about it long-term, we think there is a lot of opportunity remaining in our book of business to continue to drive down our cost of goods sold and we\u2019re doing that both on our own, but importantly here in the next several periods beginning to do that through our joint venture with Cardinal Health. Robert Jones : Got it. And I guess just a follow-up around pharmacy moving over to scripts; obviously I appreciate all the detail on the impact from the weather. Scripts looked like they still grew 2% on a same store basis; I think you said 180 basis points to 200 basis points was the negative impact from weather. So really would have been pretty impressive growth on the script front. I think I saw on the slide, Dave you might have mentioned that the outlook for 2Q is 2.75% to 3.75%. I think this is clearly a step forward from what we\u2019ve been seeing as far as prescription growth really over the last few years. Can you guys just maybe talk about or breakout what the drivers are from the underlying growth in both the quarter and behind your expectations for script growth going forward? Dave Denton : Yes, maybe I\u2019ll start and maybe I\u2019ll ask Larry and Helena, if they want to add to this. We as you know, we continue to take share in the marketplace. And I think importantly as you look at our business over the past couple of years, we\u2019ve continued to take more share of the Caremark clients dispensing volume into the CBS channel and/or into the Caremark mail channel. And that has enabled us to, I\u2019ll say outpace in the marketplace in general. And if you look at our script trends, you look at how we performed in Q1 and in our expectations for the next several periods, we\u2019re continuing that process and we have not really fundamentally changed our strong underlying trajectory there. Next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question. Ross Muken : Good morning guys. Dave Denton : Good morning Ross. Larry Merlo : Good morning Ross. Ross Muken : On the PBM selling season, if you had to sort of break it down into the key drivers of why you think you are sort of seeing more interest in the platform and why you sound, I would say incrementally more enthusiastic on sort of your potential capture rate this year; do you think you are getting some positive tailwind from the tobacco announcement, do you feel like it\u2019s maintenance choice driving it, do you think some of your home strategy and specialty strategy is resonating? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for where you think you are kind of -- the key points where you\u2019re getting momentum. Larry Merlo : Yes Ross, its Larry. Let me start and then I think others will jump in here as well. I think that the ticket to the game is you still got to be right on price and you got to have demonstrated high levels of service performance. And I think that once you get the ticket to entry from that, I do think many of the elements that you mentioned and some that we alluded to in our prepared remarks, become differentiators where the client can check the box there and in some cases, there is not a competing offering. And I think tobacco is another one of those items that you check the box on, recognizing that there is more and more and growing evidence in terms of the cost of tobacco in overall healthcare costs and the desire of health plans and employer sponsor coverage to begin to curve the costs associated with that. And I think in many cases, they see us as leading the way to bring solutions to that. Jon Roberts : Yes Ross, this is Jon. Let me just add that we feel very good about our positioning in the marketplace. So, our service levels are strong, Larry talked about that in his opening remarks. Our differentiated capabilities are resonating in the marketplace, like maintenance choice, what we\u2019re able to do with MinuteClinic, what we\u2019re able to with specialty. Specialty is clearly our client\u2019s top priority. And we talk about our capabilities with Specialty Connect, NovoLogix and Accordant as an example. I will tell you that as I sit in front of clients, tobacco always comes up, and they applaud our move. And I think it\u2019s just another intangible that as they\u2019re making decisions around which provider they want to go with, they feel really good about a company that\u2019s made a move like that. And then the last question you asked about was platform; that does not come up in our client meetings. They\u2019re on a platform, they\u2019re on one platform; it\u2019s really a non-issue for them, it\u2019s an internal opportunity for us around efficiency and productivity. Ross Muken : Great. And maybe just one question on capital deployment. I mean Dave you\u2019ve done a fantastic job, you talked about where the payout ratio\u2019s gone and you guys have obviously been buying the stock. Do you still have room on the M&A front? There has been some more chatter in the public markets about you may be doing more down in Latin America and Brazil. I mean how has that venture gone so far? How are you -- updated thinking about that market, and is that still your sort of preference in terms of some of these higher growth markets for kind of expansion versus maybe other more developed markets that have lower growth? Dave Denton : Ross, this is Dave. I\u2019ll kick it off and then I\u2019ll ask Larry to chime in here. As you pointed out, we\u2019re fortunate, the fact that we have a very robust cash flow generation organization in a sense that we\u2019ll throw awful lot of cash, both this year but more importantly over the next several years. As you said, we\u2019ve been very focused on the fact of using that cash to put it to use in the most effective manner to drive shareholder value. And we have -- we still have opportunities, importantly to increase our dividends to do meaningful share buybacks. But importantly we can also add to and invest in to our business when it makes sense. And there is opportunities, both here in the states, but also opportunities elsewhere around the globe. And I\u2019ll ask Larry to transition into maybe a conversation around what we\u2019re seeing in Brazil at this point in time. Larry Merlo : Yes. Ross, we\u2019ve been -- I guess it\u2019s been just under a year since we\u2019ve been operating and operated results have been in line with our expectations. And we remain focused on learning from our international operations. We\u2019ve got several pilots that are underway that are allowing us to bring expertise to the market and at the same time understand which of our capabilities can work in Brazil, we\u2019ve seen good results from those tests. And today, we\u2019ve got I think it\u2019s 47 stores. We want to take accelerate that growth in future years, both organically as well as inorganic. And as we\u2019ve stated in the past and as Dave alluded to, we will take a disciplined approach to our international expansion plans. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question. John Heinbockel : So Larry, two things, one on specialty. If you take Coram out, the impact of Coram, would the growth rate have been similar to the last few quarters? And then\u2026 Larry Merlo : Yes. John Heinbockel : Would have been? Larry Merlo : Yes, it would have been. John Heinbockel : Okay. And then, do you think as you build out your capabilities in specialty, so for the last four quarters roughly 20% or so, is there a scope for that to accelerate much, say over the next couple of years? Larry Merlo : John, I think there is and I think that the significance around the Coram acquisition was our ability to not just manage the specialty drug but to manage the specialty patient holistically. And the infusion component was kind of that missing piece of the puzzle that would allow us to do that. So we are very excited about the capabilities that we have. And we touched on some of the unique offerings that we can bring to market. And that combined with just the anticipated growth in the specialty market, I think that we are in a very good place. Jon Roberts : And John, this is Jon. So, with the Coram acquisition, with the NovoLogix acquisition, when you think about specialty pharmacy, half of the spend is on the pharmacy side which PBMs have traditionally managed. We have essentially doubled the size of the pie. With those assets we can now participate in specialty pharmacy across both pharmacy and medical. And we\u2019ve built out our specialty strategy really across three pillars, cost; quality; and access. And we have solutions; the marketplace is looking for solutions. This is our top priority. And we believe that our assets will allow us to disproportionately grow in this area. Dave Denton : And maybe I\u2019ll just close on the statement that as you look at the specialty market, we\u2019re plugging ourselves into payers and to capturing more share of the payer spend, but we\u2019re also importantly plugging ourselves into the patients and using our Specially Connect, our retail and MinuteClinic assets to capture more wealth in market and all of that from an environment perspective is being fueled yet again by new products over the next several years coming in the marketplace, as that will further drive utilization in this category. Jon Roberts : So, John obviously you can tell that we are excited about it. John Heinbockel : So, just transitioning to retail for a second, you guys have done an incredibly good job of improving retail profitability. So the question becomes and I guess the moving target, but how close do you think we are to getting to peak margins in that business do you know? And then let\u2019s assume that there are things with personalization that kind of are game changers. How much more upside is there to retail EBIT margin? And is personalization what you do with the circulars, that\u2019s the single biggest driver? Larry Merlo : Yes, John. Let me take the first part of that and then I\u2019ll flip it over to Helena to talk more about the personalization strategy. John when you think about the opportunities at a very high level of retail, our ability to from an operating margin point of view okay. Our ability to pump more volume through our box is what the key driver is there, and especially when you think about the pharmacy opportunities acknowledging the fixed costs that exist, not just with the bricks and mortar, but the cost of the pharmacies. So I think that many of our strategies and our thought processes with that in mind. And then I\u2019ll ask Helena to talk a little more about the personalization strategies as it relates to the front end business. Helena Foulkes : Sure. So, overall you can see that we continue to focus on driving the long-term profitable growth in this front and while front store sale are small part of our overall business, we see a growing role of both digital and personalization. So our personalization efforts are really at the key and some of what we hear from our suppliers is given that we\u2019ve been added for 16 years with extra care, they are definitely noticing our unique ability to use the data to drive profitable growth. So in particular if you look at areas like health beauty and personal care, these are areas where we continue to grow share in the market place and we are essentially staying out of the promotional fray and growing our margins and our profits in these businesses. So this continues to be a very important part of our overall growth strategy. Larry Merlo : And John as we alluded to in our comments, I mean obviously we would like our front store comps to be better and I think as I have talked about on past calls, there is a balance there, it\u2019s a little bit of art and science and we\u2019ll continue to work to innovate to find that sweet spot there, but I think that again as you heard from my earlier remarks, our goal is to create a sustainable front end strategy and quite frankly we think there are elements of the current promotional market place that are sustainable for the long-term. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Mushkin : Hey guys and I actually wanted to follow-on with John was kind of talking about, Larry what you were talking about, just basically as you look at your kind of a strategic question, as you look at your asset base, whether it be the clinics, the stores, specialty to push the backend of the stores, how interconnected do you believe the businesses are? Larry Merlo : Well, Scott, I\u2019ll start and other may want to jump in here. Okay I actually thing that, if I can use a baseball analogy that we\u2019re I actually think that we\u2019re probably in the second inning in the nine inning game. I mean I think that we\u2019re doing some things that you don\u2019t see in the marketplace largely driven by plan design for our PBM clients and their members, but I think there is so much more that we can do, and that\u2019s what our team and I\u2019d say teams because it\u2019s not just the retail focus it\u2019s an enterprise focus when you think about our retail offerings and how that intersects with our PBM offerings and plan design as well as MinuteClinic. Jon Roberts : Hey Scott, this is Jon. I mean let me bring what Larry talked about for life. So there is, we have a client that\u2019s health plan that has a focus on the primary care medical homes. And so we\u2019re connecting into their technology platform, our PBM services, our stores, our MinuteClinics and Coram and we\u2019re able to work with the primary care doctor and message patients message the providers message the pharmacy message the MinuteClinics with the goal of being all align to influencing that number in a way that ultimately reduces overall costs. So we positioned ourselves as an integral part of the healthcare network, leveraging our assets and our technology capabilities. So I think that\u2019s a very good example of how the assets all come together in interplay. Helena Foulkes : Yes. And just building on Jon\u2019s point I think if you look at and Larry alluded to just before, but we have spent a great deal of time Jon\u2019s team and my team working together on the rollout of specialty connect. We\u2019re really excited about where that\u2019s going. The great example of how we\u2019re working together to bring a solution for the marketplace that is truly unique and holistic and thinking more from an enterprise perspective than our individual business units. Scott Mushkin : So if you guys think and it sounds like that you do that you would agree with this idea that the stores can be kind of become a center for health and wellness. And looking at that asset base, where do you think the biggest lever is in that store to increased return on invested capital, return on assets? Larry Merlo : Well, Scott, I think it goes back to the question John asks. So I think ultimately it\u2019s generating more volume through the box. Okay, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll see the biggest ROI. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Lisa Gill : Hi, thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Larry Merlo : Good morning, Lisa. Lisa Gill : Larry, I noted that when you talk about the 2015 selling season you said more RFPs than we\u2019ve seen historically. Is there any way for you or for Jon to size the potential pipeline or opportunities for 2015? Larry Merlo : Well, Lisa, I think that\u2019s hard, I mean, we look at the I guess, the season opportunities more based in terms of the RFPs that are out in market and as you will know RFPs are not all April as you look at volume. Lisa Gill : Right. Larry Merlo : I mean, I think that one other questions that we always get as how much business to we have up for renewal, and we see it has kind of normal renewal season less FEP. And I think we\u2019ve said on past calls, we had $16 billion to $17 billion up for renewal and again that excludes FEP. But I think that again as people compare this year to last year recognizing the last year was down year from RFP activity, the marketplace is very active at this point in time. Jon Roberts : Lisa this is Jon. Obviously it\u2019s just still very early, so we have more to say on our next call. Lisa Gill : Jon, could you characterize that you see more manage care business is up renewal this year more employer business any color around how we should think about this year selling season? Jon Roberts : I think, it\u2019s hard to say. Clearly you see the manage care business come out early in the season, so we have seen that and we are just now beginning to see the employer business come to the markets. So and activity is tracking essentially to what we saw couple of years ago, so I\u2019d probably think about it in those terms. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. Dane Leone : Hi, thank you for taking the questions. On mail choice penetration it dipped down to a low 19 in many years this point, I was just curious to get some inside into the cause of that, whether it has to do with PTP volume loss from the CMS sanction or something more fundamental in the market, so anything there would really help us. Larry Merlo : Okay, let me start and again others may jump in, but the as we have said in the past that we did not, we don\u2019t see traditional mail as a growth driver, we saw that slowing okay, and one of the drivers behind that is payer mix shifts as more business migrates into the Medicare and Medicaid segments. The traditional drivers of mail just don\u2019t exist within those government programs, and I think we are beginning to see that. Jon Roberts : And Dane, Jon again. But we are seeing our mail, the Maintenance Choice volume grow at retail, while not enough to offset what we\u2019re seeing at mail. So, we do think as we look at, we\u2019ve about $17 million lives on our Maintenance Storage program, we have talked about the opportunity to grow that to $34 million lives. So, we still think it is an opportunity to grow. Larry talked about the mix shift difference and specifically about our PDP plans, Part D plans have very low mail penetration. So, it\u2019s really not a factor here. Dane Leone : And so as we think about your unique model versus some of our competitors from the outsider view generally we hope that mail volumes carry a much higher margin for the business than retail volume. Does that still whole true or is that really changed overtime as you\u2019ve developed your integrated model? Dave Denton : Dane, this is Dave. That\u2019s a little different for us. You think about the economics of let\u2019s say a 90 day maintenance prescription be that at mail or at retail. They carry the same economics for us. So, we\u2019re truly financially agnostic to that. And what\u2019s nice about our models as we plug into payers and as we work with patients, we can give them that opportunity at the same economics as a I\u2019ll say mandatory program pushing them into a channel that they may not chose to utilize. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Peter Costa : Thank you for squeezing me in here. Regarding your assumptions on weather, do you assume the basket size increase had to do to some extent with the severe weather or do you think that that\u2019s sustainable going forward? And then how do you know that some of the impacts weren\u2019t from the competitors advertising programs or perhaps from the greater seasonality that you should probably expecting relative to higher deductible plans being sold, so many changes going on this year with healthcare reform? How were you able to parse away some of the weather impacts from some of those other impacts? Helena Foulkes : This is Helena, Peter. I would just say that our basket size growth continues on its normal trend, we haven\u2019t seen anything out of the ordinary and for us as I said before, it\u2019s a continued focus on personalization, we have as Larry mentioned before, as others have increased their promotional activity, we have actually reduced ours and instead or spending this on our top customers. That is our particular focus, these are the top customers, we are typically looking at the top 20% or 30% of our customers who are driving the lion share of our volume and profits and we have a continued focus on increasing the number of personalize outreaches we have to those folks. Larry Merlo : And Peter keep in mind that when we are talking about basket size, it is just the front end basket and does not encompass, anything in, excuse me, in the pharmacy. Peter Costa : I understand. My question is more of the how were you able to parse away the weather impacts from all the other things going on, because the weather erratically is impacting not just the front end but back end as well? Dave Denton : Yes. This is Dave. I think the team does a pretty good job of annualizing kind of by market and understanding where we quite frankly have stores that are on limited hours or stores that are closed and/or whether a severe weather, whether we can see the traffic patterns. And so I think we can do it kind of by day, by store. And so it\u2019s not we can\u2019t 100% lock that down but I think the team does a pretty good job of kind of analyzing that and that\u2019s why we give you a little bit of the range in the commentary we\u2019ve provided today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Edward Kelly : Yes, hi good morning guys. Larry Merlo : Good morning. Edward Kelly : Couple of quick questions for you, first I don\u2019t know if you can I know you don\u2019t usually do this, but since we have the impact of weather in Q1 could you help us at all in terms of how things sort of shaped up in April, couple things within that. One it seems like underlying script growth for the industry to accelerate and I was wondering if you saw any of that and what you thought might be the drivers? And then second how the front end business looked through Easter with better weather or anything better there? Larry Merlo : Ed those are great questions unfortunately we can\u2019t comment on that at this point in time. Edward Kelly : Okay. Question on tobacco, any thoughts on what you might do with the space behind the store and whether there is an opportunity to maybe offset some of that sales loss in the back half of this year? Dave Denton : Hey this is Dave. I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll ask Helena to chine in. Just I want to be clear on the tobacco category and as we exited while we will come up with ways to use that space. There is unlike, that product line. As you know the tobacco category at least from a financial metrics perspective is very productive. So with that maybe I\u2019ll turn it to Helena. Helena Foulkes : Yes, that\u2019s totally right. So we\u2019re still working on our plans. We\u2019ve been testing a number of things. But as Dave said we certainly don\u2019t expect that what we put a high in that space we\u2019ll make up for the lost tobacco sale. What we have really been looking at is as a question before alluded to we\u2019re increasingly positioning ourselves as a health care company and making sure that our store more and more represents ourselves as the healthcare company. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Steven Valiquette : Hi, thanks, good morning. Larry Merlo : Good morning, Steve. Steven Valiquette : So I guess maybe just a quick question on the JV with Cardinal. Aside from the $100 million in annual payment that you\u2019ll get from them I guess the question is do you expect a fairly quick turnaround time after July and improving your overall costs by pulling the purchasing with Cardinal or will that happen slowly overtime. And the reason why I asked is that before about some letters being send out by the various parties in the other procurement collaborations in the supply channel to the generic suppliers with (inaudible) capital as on the script. So I\u2019m just kind of curious of your thoughts on what\u2019s going to happened after July whether there will be quick improvement or is it gradual, just any color that would help? Thanks. Dave Denton : This is Dave. Maybe I\u2019ll start here. Clearly we\u2019re working a pretty aggressively right now with both folks from CVS as well as folks from Cardinal to get the joint venture up and running. We still have a little bit of work to make that happened. So I think the teams are working very collaboratively to make it happen productively. I do think that it is probably just a little too early to provide too much color on that. I will think it\u2019s important that, we\u2019re going to figure out ways and which we get the joint venture up and running that we\u2019re going to partner with generic manufactures that working to create win-win scenarios for them. And you could imagine that some of that would happened quickly I think some of that could happened overtime. So the cadence of an improvement I think it\u2019s probably too early to give us much color to at this point. Steven Valiquette : Okay. Great, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Mark Wiltamuth : Hi. On the specialty, what\u2019s the primary lever on getting some of that specialty spend out of the medical benefit and into the pharmacy benefit, is it just the changes in benefit design? Jon Roberts : Yeah, Mark this is Jon. So that\u2019s essentially it. So if a payer allows it to be paid under the medical benefit and its build that way it goes through. They do have the ability to say we are not going to allow that to be paid under the medical benefit, it has to be moved over the pharmacy benefit and the value proposition there is lowering cost of goods. So we think it\u2019s an opportunity for the marketplace and again we feel like our assets position us to help our clients find ways to save money in this rapidly growing area. Mark Wiltamuth : And the Coram fits into that as well? Jon Roberts : I am sorry. Mark Wiltamuth : The Coram fits in that as well, so you can aim people towards your Coram business on infusion rather than going to a medical facility? Jon Roberts : Yes, it\u2019s interesting when you look at Coram, they have people out in 1,200 hospitals across the country and they essentially recruit patients one at a time. We believe the opportunity is very fragmented market working with payers to reduce the infusion network on a more volume through Coram. And there is a value proposition there for the payer. And it\u2019s not just in drug cost but it\u2019s we can help get patients out of the hospital faster, because of our capabilities to do many of the procedures at home versus in the hospital and we could also help to reduce readmission rates. And so as we have been out in the market place, payers are very interested in these capabilities. And I think very open to skinning down those infusion networks which means more volume through Coram. Larry Merlo : Mark, the only other point I want to emphasize is back to the first part of your question is that I think the data is powerful here and showing clients whether it\u2019s a health plan and employer, the cost savings opportunities is an important part of the story. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Hi, good morning. I couple of broad questions. First of all, on the specialty and especially on Sovaldi. I mean we are hearing that the payers are looking to narrow the network they are using in order to save cost, i.e. just gearing their patient population toward pharmacy, their own specialty pharmacies. So, when you think about your specialty scripts or maybe Sovaldi as an example, what percent of that script is coming from the Caremark population and your other health plan partners? Dave Denton : Ricky, this is Dave. We don\u2019t provide that level of detail at this point of time. I would say that, just as Jon maybe indicated earlier today in his remarks around how we manage specialty, one lever that is available to specialty is I\u2019ll say narrowing the network and pushing those and centralizing those fills into a centralized provider. And we do that in some cases where it makes sense or in some cases we have an open network. But that\u2019s an opportunity. Jon Roberts : Yes. And Ricky, so we have not heard a lot of activity in Sovaldi from payers around narrowing the network, most of the activity is around making sure which patient should be placed on the medication. And really, the biggest opportunity to lower the cost for Sovaldi is going to be around formulary management. And that will happen in the fourth quarter, when these new drugs come to the market, and there is more competition in the Hep-C class. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And then secondly just on generic Nexium obviously there is some uncertainty around the drugs so do you a Nexium benefit into \u201814 guidance? Dave Denton : Ricky this is Dave, we Nexium like many other products there is always some level of uncertainty in our guidance range is comprehend, I guess a series of different scenarios around both that product and another products. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question. David Larsen : Hi, can you comment on how you would enhance the level or number of services that a retail store could provide to become more primary care physician like, in particular around lab is that something you are contemplating bringing to the stores? Thanks. Larry Merlo : Yes, David I mean we are doing a number of point of sales lab testing today, whether in A1C, we\u2019ve piloted some testing for some other disease baits, we\u2019re, there is a lot of technology out there, the technology in that space is moving very quickly and we\u2019re evaluating what is in the marketplace, and I think it\u2019s not a question of if that\u2019s more question of when and finding the technology that we believe is right for MinuteClinic. David Larsen : Okay. And just in your view in a perfect world I mean would these be lab tested are done in the store or would be drawn on the central lab and then brought back in or a combination of both? Larry Merlo : No, I think we are thinking about it as, lab testing that\u2019s done in the store that really satisfies the goal of increasing the services that we can provide around the management of chronic disease. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. John Ransom : Hi, I know this is getting late in the call. I just had a quick follow-up to make sure I understand something, when you\u2019re talking to clients now about their specialty trend. What do you think the market specialty trend is now and what can you bring that number to using the most aggressive tools that you have? Thanks. Larry Merlo : Well John, it\u2019s Larry, I mean I think as I mentioned, in 2013 we saw the specialty trend at approach I think it was just a tick under 16%. And we have a variety of models that we share with clients that if left unmanaged that trend is going to be in the high teens and I\u2019ll flip it over to Jon because he has got a very nice presentation for our clients to show by adopting all of these various programs, what the trend could ultimately come down to. Jon Roberts : Yes and John so we think we can actually get a double-digit trend like that down to almost flat. And there are programs that we have such as advantaged control specialty formulary that we can reduce trend by 1.5%. Medical claims averaging and repricing that can bring it down 2.5%, side of care medical carve out that can bring it down 3.6%. I will go to all of them, but there is numerous programs that we have that we\u2019ve been building over the last several years that can take these high trend rates in specialty and really make a huge impact on them, I mean get them down to almost zero if they adopted everything. John Ransom : Right. And as you look in your crystal ball say out 2016-2017 what do you see the overall drug trend being including specialty let diminish? Jon Roberts : That\u2019s a good question and at our client forum I spend some time to actually talking to our clients about how they should begin to think about their pharmacy benefit because if you look at utilization being somewhere in the 2% to 3% range moving forward you see inflation overall across their book being somewhere in the 7.5% range. You see the generic pipeline subsiding as an example. So we think that trend overall can be somewhere in the 6% to 10% range of unmanaged, and obviously we\u2019re encouraging them to adopt strategy such as more aggressive formularies, narrower networks to bring those, to bring that trend down. And it\u2019s interesting, the marketplace, I think is very open to these types of solutions that have been developed. Larry Merlo : John, I think in Jon\u2019s presentation at the client forum I think there was one of those aha moments for our client that recognizing that over the last several years, the influx of generics has been a key driver to bringing the cost trend pretty flat. And a reality that is we migrate post \u201815 and generic centering the marketplace while they\u2019re still there it is slower rate than historical averages that they\u2019re going to have to do some things differently and think about things differently. And they appreciate the fact that we\u2019re thinking about those things for them and bringing them solutions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Meredith Adler : Thanks. A lot of questions have been asked. Maybe I will ask something that hasn\u2019t been asked at all, you did mentioned that the strong free cash flow in the first quarter was tied to working capital and could you just talk a little bit about sort of what you\u2019ve accomplished in managing working capital and what you think the opportunities are? Jon Roberts : Yeah, sure, Meredith. There is really two things, one is we also posted very aggressive growth rates from an earnings perspective so that obviously helps free cash flow yield. But secondly, as we continue to push on our working capital, I would say Meredith there is not kind of one program that we have there, that\u2019s driving all that. We continue to push on AR and AP. I think as we have talked about in the past probably our biggest opportunity continues to be to enhance our inventory position, from a supply chain perspective within the retail stores. If you look and you try to compare our performance with kind of the, I will our top performance in the marketplace, we still have anywhere from the $1.5 billion to $2 billion of inventory that I think we can get out of the pipeline overtime. And the team is working on that today. There is not one silver bullet to that. It\u2019s going to be a lot of little changes that we need to do to really enhance I would say our safety stock as opposed to really dramatically changing our SKU count in the stores, if you look at it from that perspective. Meredith Adler : Great, and then I have a question probably for Helena. Based on everything you are saying it doesn\u2019t sound like there is a point in time in which you will cycle reduced page count or anything like that, is that the right way to think about it that this is an ongoing process of using your marketing funds more wisely or will we see less impact at some point? Helena Foulkes : Yes. No I think that your first assumption is right Meredith. If you look at on overall household penetration of the Sunday circular in the last five years and projections for go forward, it continues to decline. We see that, discontinuing I have turned page. And so to be ahead of that curve, we have really been investing outside of the circular. So there is no one silver moment where we are going to cycle something, I think this will continue. Larry Merlo : Okay. We will take two more questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. George Hill : Hey, good morning guys and thanks for taking my questions. Larry Merlo : Good morning George. George Hill : How are you guys? Larry Merlo : Good. George Hill : I guess, first thing I wanted to talk a little bit more about the PBM, results were pretty impressive. And if I kind of boil it down to profitability per adjusted script, really strong growth year-over-year. I guess, can you talk about what\u2019s driving that there? How much should we think about that as to contribution of mix more for acquisitions versus just continued improvements in the business or kind of what else is the key there? Dave Denton : This is Dave, George. I\u2019ll touch upon that. We don\u2019t really use that metric that much, we think it can give you a false -- that metric can give you a false positive or false negative depending upon the applied mix where you are in the profitability cadence of Medicare Part D as if the risk order is to through all the cycles and the benefit levels. I would say though, having said that there is a couple of things that are driving our profitability we talked about. We continue to push on specialty and specialty is becoming a bigger portion of our business and we continue to enhance our performance from a specialty perspective. We further more have worked aggressively to improve our cost structure from a cost of goods sold perspective. And you have seen us continue to [wretch] it down and improve our buy side economics. And then finally from the PBM perspective driven somewhat by our formulary strategy have improved our rebate yield overtime. So, all three of those continue to enhanced our profitability. And then I will just say sliding on top of that is we made some investments over the past several years, from a streamlining perspective and our cost structure is in a much better position today than probably what it was three or four years ago. So, all those components are contributing to that growth and profitability. George Hill : Yes, I remember that you guys didn\u2019t see that as a core metric, but even as it\u2019s a metric that I continue to look at because other companies in space use it, very strong improvement even on the tough comp year-over-year. And then I\u2019d follow with one more quick one and I don\u2019t know, do you guys have any data and are you able to break them kind of what is the capture rate, or what is the cross sale as the MinuteClinic business continues to grow pretty strongly, you guys are posting very strong script volume like kind of what the script capture from people who shop at a MinuteClinic and how should we think about the tie between the growth in the MinuteClinic business to the tie in the pharmacy sales? Larry Merlo : Yes. There is a tie between patients who utilize the MinuteClinic typically when a prescription is written at MinuteClinic is 95% plus of the time filled at CVS pharmacy something like that. I would say that MinuteClinic is still relatively small in the grand scheme of as it relates to CVS pharmacy, so it is not a major contribution of script comp growth, but it is a nice compliment to our business. And quite honestly we don\u2019t really think about MinuteClinic as it relates to the front although there is probably some hallow into the front of our business as well. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Robert Willoughby : Larry, given vision adding oxygen therapy or durable medical equipment to your stable businesses there on top of the infusion business and then just secondarily, your primary competitor on the PBM world was graced with three subpoena do you anticipate same similar disclosure of in your queue this evening? Larry Merlo : Yes, Bob good morning, in terms of I think you will see in our queue later today that we did receive subpoena from the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the district of Rhode Island, request to documents concerning some drugs very similar to one of our competitors as it relates to feeds and rebates and obviously we\u2019re cooperating fully on that matter. We have not received the subpoena from the Department of Labor. And then on your first question we do not have any plans to get into the oxygen space. We have that opportunity when you look at the Coram acquisition it was part of Apria and we purchased the infusion and the investor kept the oxygen business. Durable medical, I think we continue to explore what options we may have. We do a little bit of that today and I think it\u2019s something that continues to be on our radar screen that can we do it in an effective fashion, when I say effective I am thinking of convenience of the patient in mind as well as obviously the economics as it relates to the business. Robert Willoughby : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Larry Merlo : Okay, thanks Bob. Well, so appreciate everyone\u2019s time this morning. It was a long call, but we want us to get to everyone\u2019s questions and if there is any follow-up Nancy and her team will be available and again thanks for your ongoing interest in CVS Caremark. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, August 5, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference over to Nancy Christal, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Nancy R. Christal: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I\u2019m here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO, who will provide a business update; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review our second quarter results as well as guidance for the third quarter and year. Jon Roberts, President of PBM; and Helena Foulkes, President of the Retail Business, are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up, so we can provide more callers with the chance to ask their question. Now I have one key date to announce this morning. We plan to host our annual Analyst Day on the morning of Tuesday, December 16 in New York City. At that time, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to hear from several members of our senior management team who will provide 2015 guidance as well as a comprehensive update on our growth strategy. We plan to send invitations with more specific details via email sometime in August, so please save the date. Again, that\u2019s Tuesday, December 16. If you don\u2019t receive an invitation and would like to attend, please contact me at your earliest convenience. Please note that just before this call, we posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information you will hear today as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Additionally, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q will be filed by the close of business today and it will be available on our website at that time. During today\u2019s presentation, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings including the Risk Factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings. During this call, we\u2019ll also use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company\u2019s performance including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of these non-GAAP items as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. As always, today\u2019s call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year. Now, let me turn this over to Larry Merlo. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to hear more about the strong results we posted for the second quarter. I\u2019m pleased to say that we met or exceeded our expectations on every key major performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 16.5% to $1.13 per share. That\u2019s $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. Both the PMB and Retail segments exceeded our revenue expectations and delivered strong gross margins. And as a result, operating profit in the Retail business grew 6.5% and profit in the PBM grew 30% exceeding our expectations. Additionally, we generated nearly 400 million of free cash keeping us on track to achieve our full year free cash flow goal. Now given our strong performance year-to-date, we are raising and narrowing our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the year to a range of $4.43 to $4.51 and that\u2019s up from our previous range of $4.36 to $4.50, and Dave will provide the details behind our financial results and guidance during his review. But before I move on, I do want to say that I\u2019m extremely proud of the work our colleagues are doing to drive continued strong results across the enterprise. So let me turn to a brief business update and I\u2019ll start by level-setting how we see the current state of health reform. I think as everybody knows, there are reported to be about 8 million individuals who have enrolled in the public exchanges and we saw the biggest increase occur toward the end of open enrollment. The mix of individuals who were newly insured as opposed to those who previously had coverage, it still remains unclear with various sources quoting anywhere from a low of 27% of individuals newly insured up to a high of 85% with multiple data points suggesting it might be somewhere in between. With regard to Medicaid, available data indicates that 6.7 million individuals have gained coverage, which is up from 3 million at the time of our last earnings call. Now while the net number of newly insured remains somewhat of a mystery, we can be confident that several million Americans have gained coverage in recent months and this should provide a positive secular trend in pharmacy volume growth for the next several years. Our experience to-date with respect for the combined impact of both public exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid is consistent overall with our expectations and is expected to yield a modest benefit in '14. We continue to expand our focus on building strategic enterprise relationships with health plans whether or not we\u2019re the PBM. We support more than 25 commercial health plans, co-ops and Medicaid managed care organizations across 26 states as their PBM and we expect this number to grow. We have also implemented preferred pharmacy networks or Maintenance Choice in more than 20 states, and as we emphasized at our December Analyst Day we are well positioned across the enterprise to partner with health plans in a variety of ways and we\u2019re actively helping them advance their strategies in their respective markets while growing our enterprise share. Now let me update you on our 10-year agreement with Cardinal Health that\u2019s built upon our combined sourcing expertise. As you\u2019re aware, last month we completed the formation of Red Oak Sourcing, the largest generic sourcing entity here in the U.S. and located in Foxborough, Massachusetts. And at that time, the employees and functional responsibilities were transitioned from CVS Caremark and Cardinal to Red Oak Sourcing. As we worked together to get the venture up and running, we further refined certain aspects of our agreement and the structure of the final agreement is slightly different than what we\u2019ve talked about previously, so Dave will walk through how the venture works during his financial review highlighting the three ways in which the venture is expected to deliver value. So we remain excited about Red Oak and we look forward to its future contributions. Moving to our PBM business, I\u2019ll start with an update on the 2015 selling season. And as we noted on our last call, the marketplace has been active. Pricing remains competitive, yet rationale and I\u2019m pleased to report that to-date we have been very successful in this selling season. Gross wins for '15 currently stand at 5.4 billion and span across all client segments while net new business stands at 2.6 billion, and this net new number includes business lost through acquisition, which makes up more than 60% of the lost business. These net new business numbers do not account for any impact from our individual Med-D prescription drug plan, which I\u2019ll touch on a little later. As for renewals, we\u2019ve completed nearly 70% of the 26 billion in business up for renewal with the retention rate of nearly 97%. And I think our selling season success reflects our track record of generating savings for our clients through our unique suite of capabilities, top of mind for clients this selling season is achieving better control of their specialty spend. Among our clients, specialty represents about 22.5% of total drug spend under the pharmacy benefit and projections have this continuing to grow at a mid-teens rate. Now all specialty spend including that paid under the medical benefit will likely to grow to as much as 50% of total drug spend by 2018. So I think you can see it\u2019s critical that we bring meaningful solutions to the challenges. Our specialty business remains strong in the second quarter as revenues were up about 53% year-over-year. In addition to benefits from new business and the addition of Coram, another driver of specialty revenue growth was Sovaldi, the new hep C drug. There are estimated to be roughly 3 million people in the U.S. requiring treatment and as everyone knows, the potential costs of treatment is very high. As you might imagine, the growing costs in this category are of significant concern to our clients and we have a number of programs in place to ensure appropriate utilization and cost management. And as competing products become available late this year and next, we will look for opportunities to introduce formulary management to further drive down costs. At CVS Caremark, we continued to differentiate our specialty offerings in the marketplace with a goal of providing a high level of clinical support to patients, while managing trend for our clients and driving continued share gains. As an example, our Specialty Connect offering has been rolled out. It has been well received by both clients and patients and you\u2019ll recall that Specialty Connect integrates our mail and retail capabilities providing choice and convenience for patients while preserving the central clinical expertise that leads to better health outcomes. No other PBM can offer this today. As of late July, more than 60,000 specialty patients have been transitioned to this specialty service model, which again offers enhanced clinical and benefit support. The program is generating high satisfaction scores with patients, it resonates with clients as a differentiated approach to simplifying the specialty process for members and physicians appreciate the ease of use in getting patients started on therapy. Our medical pharmacy management program also continues to enjoy strong interest and uptake in the marketplace with several new implementations underway and our site of care offering through our Coram infusion business enables us to provide patients more convenient, low cost alternatives to hospital infusions whether at the physician\u2019s office, a retail infusion site or even the patient\u2019s home. The Coram organization has been fully integrated into the specialty group and our new capabilities have been a topic of discussion in the current selling season for specialty business on a carve-in or standalone basis. So we remain optimistic that we can continue to gain specialty pharmacy share, as we work to develop innovative offerings that capitalize on our unique ability to optimize cost, quality and access. Another important way that we manage trend for clients is through our highly proactive approach to formulary management, which is you\u2019ll recall we introduced to the marketplace back in 2011 for the 2012 planned year. Since then we have updated our formulary on an annual basis with a mission of being able to manage trend for our clients while providing comprehensive, cost effective and clinically appropriate options for their plan members. Now building on our formulary success of the last three years, we recently notified our clients that we will be removing 22 products in addition to select diabetes test strips for the 2015 formulary. And from 2012 through 2015, our rigorous approach to formulary management is expected to result in total savings to our clients of more than $3.5 billion. Before turning to Retail, let me touch briefly on our Med-D PDP SilverScript. As expected, we currently have approximately 3 million lives in our individual PDP. And for the first half of 2014, our normal monthly attrition has been only partially offset by choosers and auto-assignees. And as we came out of sanction earlier this year, we began to enroll choosers in February and received dual auto assignees in May. Additionally, as the dual demonstration projects continue to progress in certain states, we do expect to see some transition of dual eligible lives through the second half of this year. And while we may recapture some of these lives through our health planned partners, it is likely we will lose a modest number of lives as a result. So we expect to end the year with about 2.9 million lives in our individual PDP and we continue to see significant opportunity to grow the individual PDP business over the long term. As a matter of fact, last Thursday, we received the preliminary benchmark results from CMS for 2015 and I\u2019m pleased to report that SilverScript was below the benchmark and therefore qualified in 32 of the 34 regions. The only regions we didn\u2019t qualify were Alaska and Nevada, consistent with prior years. So the strong benchmark results should enable us to retain the vast majority of the auto-assignees we currently serve, so we\u2019re very pleased with the outcome. Moving on to the Retail business, following the effects of the difficult weather and flu season that we experienced in Q1, total same-store sales reaccelerated sequentially in Q2 increasing 3.3%. Pharmacy same-store sales increased 5% versus the year ago and were negatively impacted by about 160 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Pharmacy comps were also negatively impacted by approximately 130 basis points due to the transfer of specialty scripts from our Retail segment to our PBM segment as a result of the new Specialty Connect offering and Dave will talk more about that later. Pharmacy script comps increased 3.9% on a 30-day equivalent basis and we continued to gain pharmacy share. I want to touch on a topic that has received a lot of attention lately based on some competitor commentary, that being generic inflation and pharmacy reimbursement pressures. You\u2019ll recall that when we gave our 2014 guidance last December, we told you that we expected continued pressure on pharmacy reimbursement, and the market is generally consistent with what we anticipated. As to generic inflation, while the cost of goods inflation does exist on some generic items, it is not material in the context of our overall purchasing volume and again was generally within our expectations. On balance, the deflationary nature of the generic pharmaceutical market remains intact and overall, our pharmacy margins increased this quarter for multiple reasons were in line with our expectations, and again Dave will talk more about this in the financial review. As for the front store business, comps decreased 0.4%. Our front store comps were positively impacted by approximately 80 basis points from the shift of the Easter holiday. And as plan for exiting the tobacco category this fall, we have begun to see a sales impact. Our front store comps would have been approximately 110 basis points higher if you exclude tobacco in the estimated associated basket sales. Now adjusting for this tobacco impact and the Easter shift, front store comps were roughly flat in the quarter, sequentially improving from Q1. Front store traffic declined, as customers continued to aggregate their trips and at the same time, our average basket size continued to increase reflecting the strength of our loyalty program and the personalization it enables us to offer. And consistent with our prior statements, we are making responsible investments in profitable promotions and remain committed to not chasing empty sales. Driving higher margin store brand sales continues to be another area of focus. We saw notable growth in share gains and store brands this quarter with store brands as a percent of front store sales increasing about 80 basis points to 18%. And we see significant opportunities to continue to expand our share of strong brand products by building on our core equities and health and beauty while also seeking opportunistic growth in other areas. Additionally, in order to drive better results, we continued to explore innovative personalization strategies through insights from ExtraCare. As an example, during the second quarter, we expanded our send to card digital coupon option for all ExtraCare personalized offers that were historically only available either at the ExtraCare coupon center or on the bottom of a customer\u2019s register receipt. Adoption has been very strong with over half of our registered users already trying this new feature and we also continue to turbocharge our personalized email promotions with our active email subscriber list growing 21% versus the same quarter last year. Turning to our retail drugstore program, we opened 34 new stores, relocated eight and closed four, resulting in 30 net new stores in the quarter and we\u2019re on track to achieve square footage growth of 2% to 3% for the year. In the quarter, we recently announced that we have a definitive agreement to purchase Navarro Discount Pharmacy. Navarro is the largest Hispanic-owned drug store chain in the U.S. with 33 retail drugstore locations in the Miami-Dade county area in addition to Navarro Health Services, a specialty pharmacy serving patients with complex or chronic diseases. We expect to maintain the current product mix and we\u2019ll learn from our Navarro colleagues about Hispanic marketing and merchandizing, and we expect these lessons to be transferable to certain other CVS markets. The Navarro brand is one of the most recognizable in the Hispanic marketplace. We plan to retain it. If you recall, we adopted a similar strategy in maintaining the Longs Drugs name for our acquired locations in Hawaii. That has been successful. And we expect to complete the Navarro transaction later this year. Let me touch briefly on MinuteClinic, which continues on its healthy growth trajectory. In the second quarter, revenues increased 24% versus a year ago. We opened 32 net new clinics in the quarter bringing our total to 60 year-to-date and keeping us on track to open at least 150 new clinics this year. We currently operate 860 clinics in 28 states plus the District of Columbia and in recent news, a new partnership with USA Football named MinuteClinic, their official retail medical clinic and sports physical provider and we will offer a special discount for sports physicals to more than 1 million young athletes and their coaches. CVS Caremark and MinuteClinic also added four new health system alliances during the quarter and another four in July bringing our total number of affiliations with major U.S. health systems to 40. So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review. David M. Denton: Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. As I typically do, I\u2019ll begin this morning by highlighting how our disciplined approach to capital allocations continues to enhance shareholder value. I\u2019ll follow that discussion with a detailed review of our strong second quarter followed by an update on our guidance. So let\u2019s begin. During the second quarter, we continued our long track record of paying quarterly dividends to our shareholders with payments totaling $322 million. With a strong earnings outlook for the remainder of this year, we expect our dividend payout ratio to surpass 25% at some point during 2014. We\u2019re making continued good progress towards achieving our 35% payout target by 2018. Additionally, we repurchased 16 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion at an average price of $74.91 per share. Year-to-date, we repurchased more than 27 million shares or $2 billion and we still expect to complete at least $4 billion of share repurchases with the full year of 2014. So between dividends and share repurchases, we\u2019ve returned more than $1.5 billion to our shareholders in the second quarter alone and have returned more than $2.6 billion during the first half of this year. Our goal has been to return more than $5 billion in 2014 and we remain on track to meet that goal. As Larry said, we generated nearly $400 million of free cash in the second quarter bringing our total for the first six months of the year to approximately $2.2 billion. The key driver continues to be our healthy growth in earnings coupled with improvements in our working capital performance fueled mainly by the PBM\u2019s growth. All-in, we continue to expect to generate free cash between $5.5 billion and $5.8 billion in 2014. Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $1.13 per share, up 16.5% versus LY and $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. The strong performance reflects solid growth across all of our operating segments. The retail segment produced results at the high-end of our expectations while the enterprise\u2019s outperformance was driven primarily by better-than-expected results from the PBM. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.06 per share, and now let me quickly walk you through our results. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the second quarter increased 10.7% or approximately $3.4 billion to $34.6 billion. PBM net revenues increased 16.2% or approximately $3 billion to $21.8 billion. The strong performance was driven by net new business, specialty pharmacy growth, drug inflation and product mix. Offsetting this to some degree were lower mail choice claims reflecting the decline in traditional mail order volumes and an increase in generic dispensing. The PBM\u2019s generic dispensing rate increased approximately 180 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 82%. Now revenues in the retail business increased 4.5% in the quarter or approximately $730 million to $16.9 billion. Sales in the retail segment were better-than-expected driven primarily by branded drug inflation as well as volumes. Retail GDR increased by approximately 160 basis points versus the second quarter of '13 to 84%. Let me point out that with the second quarter results, we have begun to experience the type of shift between segments that are highlighted at past Analyst Days. As you know, our focus isn\u2019t limited to just one channel, mail or retail, as it is for many of our competitors. Our channel and business segment agnostic offerings will enhance the performance of the enterprise and sometimes at the expense of one individual segment. For that reason, recall that we have been suggesting that you focus on the growth of the enterprise rather than the individual segments to best gauge our success. And with the implementation of Specialty Connect this past quarter, we essentially transferred revenues out of the retail pharmacy segment and into the PBM segment as the PBM took over the dispensing of nearly all specialty prescriptions filled by CVS Caremark. As anticipated, the transition had a larger impact on sales dollars than scripts given the high cost of specialty drugs. The impact on sales dollars in the second quarter was approximately $145 million and this impact will grow larger as we ramp up in the third and fourth quarters. Obviously, this shift dampened year-over-year top line growth at retail while enhancing revenue growth in the PBM. And as Larry said, it had an approximately 130 basis point negative impact on retail pharmacy comps but it had an insignificant impact on retail script volume. Now turning to gross margin. The consolidated company posted an 18.3% margin in the quarter, a decline of approximately 40 basis points compared to Q2 of '13. This margin decline was the result of a mix shift as the lower margin PBM segment grew faster than the retail segment. Both operating segments saw their margins improve. Additionally, margins benefitted from the finalization of California\u2019s Medicaid reimbursement rates, which I referenced on our last earnings call. This finalization benefitted retail gross margin by $53 million in the quarter and PBM gross margin by $16 million. This impact was consistent with the guidance we provided earlier this year. Within the PBM segment, gross margins increased approximately 35 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 5.5% while gross profit dollars increased approximately 24% year-over-year. The increase year-over-year was primarily driven by growth in our specialty business, favorable purchasing economics and the increase in GDR. We continue to see these positive margin drivers partially offset by typical client price compression. Now gross margin in the retail segment was 31.4%, up 40 basis points over LY. Gross profit dollars increased 5.9% year-over-year. Pharmacy margins improved in the quarter as we benefitted from the increase in GDR and the finalization of the reduction in California\u2019s Medicaid reimbursement rates that I noted earlier. Our pharmacy margins notably improved even without the impact of this rate finalization. At the same time, we saw front store margins decline as anticipated in the quarter, driven mainly by the markdown of some tobacco products as well as the unexpected bankruptcy of one of our vendors. Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues improved by approximately 50 basis points from Q2 of '13 to 11.9% while total SG&A dollars grew by 6.4%. The PBM segment\u2019s expenses grew by 10% and its SG&A rate was 1.5%, an improvement of approximately 10 basis points versus LY. In the retail segment, SG&A as a percent of sales declined approximately 20 basis points to 21.3% while expenses grew by 5.6%. This reflects the deleveraging effect of generics as well as the impact of Specialty Connect as the retail segment transitions sales to the PBM segment without a corresponding expense reduction. Within the corporate segment, expenses were up $29 million to $205 million. This increase is primarily related to benefit costs as well as strategic initiatives. Now adding it all up, operating margin for the total enterprise improved approximately five basis points to 6.4%. Operating margin in the PBM improved approximately 45 basis points to 4%. Now operating margin at retail improved about 20 basis points to 10.1%. For the quarter, PBM operating profit was strong growing 30.1%, which is higher than expected. Retail operating profit increased a very healthy 6.5% at the high end of our expectations. Now going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $32 million from last year to $158 million. The debt we issued in the fourth quarter of LY was the primary driver of this increase. Our weighted average share count was 1.17 billion shares and finally our effective tax rate was 39.2%. Now let me update you on our guidance. As always, I\u2019ll focus on the highlights. You can find the additional details of our guidance in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning. As we stated in the press release, we are both raising and narrowing our full year 2014 EPS ranges given our strong results to-date. We currently expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in 2014 in the range of $4.43 to $4.51 reflecting strong year-over-year growth of 11.75% to 14% and that\u2019s excluding the gain of approximately $0.04 associated with the legal settlement in the third quarter of '13. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.16 to $4.24. While we beat the high end of our guidance in the second quarter by $0.02, we increased the top of the range for the year by $0.01. This delta reflects a few moving pieces among them the minor shift in timing associated with the fixed payment we will receive from Cardinal as well as a slightly higher tax rate. As Larry said, the structure of the final agreement is a bit different from what we have previously described. So let me explain how the venture works. There are three ways in which the arrangement can provide value to us. First, as we previously stated, we will receive a fixed quarterly payment from Cardinal that recognizes the greater relative purchasing volume that CVS Caremark has today. Under the final agreement, we will receive 39 quarterly payments of $25.6 million beginning in the fourth quarter of this year rather than 40 quarterly payments of 25 million, which would have begun in the third quarter of this year. There is no change in the overall value of fixed payments. It\u2019s simply a timing shift that more accurately reflects the operational ramp up associated with this venture. Second, there is a new component to our arrangement providing the potential for additional predetermined quarterly payments from Cardinal to CVS Caremark beginning in the third quarter of 2015. These payments will only occur to the extent that certain milestones are achieved. And finally, as we have explained previously, we believe there will be incremental value to our current generic procurement created through the combination of our purchasing volumes. So while the fixed payments will now begin a quarter later than originally planned, the overall value of the fixed payments remains the same and the potential for incremental value resulting from the venture remains high. So we continue to be excited about this venture and we look forward to its future contributions. With that, turning back to 2014 full year guidance, we now expect consolidated net revenue growth to be in the range of 8% to 9% raising the midpoint by approximately 260 basis points over our prior guidance. We\u2019ve increased our top line outlook in the PBM and now expect revenue growth of 13.75% to 14.75%, approximately 5 percentage points higher than our prior guidance. This revised guidance reflects our expectations for better-than-expected growth within specialty pharmacy, fueled by a combination of both inflation and new product mix. Additionally, taken into account our performance in the second quarter, we are narrowing the top line outlook at retail, raising the bottom and the range and we now expect growth of 1.25% to 2%. And consistent with that outlook, we are also revising our guidance for total same-store sales and now expect growth between 0.25% and 1%. Keep in mind that these anticipated revenue growth rates reflect our expectations around the impact from our decision to exit the tobacco category. Larry mentioned the impact to Q2 comps as we approach our target date to be out of the category in the fall, we expect the impact to grow. For the full year of 2014, the impact will be as high as 400 basis points from front store comps. And given what we\u2019ve seen to-date, we expect front store comps could be negatively impacted by 400 to 500 basis points in Q3 and roughly double that in Q4. So when you lay out your models, please keep this in mind. Guidance for operating profit growth in our segments has also been revised. We are narrowing retail operating profit by 25 basis points on both ends. We now expect retail operating profit to increase 7.25% to 8.5% year-over-year. And in the PBM, given the outperformance in Q2 and increased confidence in the back half of the year, we now expect operating profit to increase 12.5% to 14.5%. As for our tax rate this year, we now expect it to be approximately 39.4% with the narrowing and raising of our EPS guidance range, operating cash flow guidance also changes. We now expect between 7.2 billion and 7.5 billion of operating cash flow, an increase of $200 million. And as I said before, our free cash flow guidance for the year remains in the range of $5.5 billion to $5.8 billion as we expect capital expenditures to be slightly higher than we originally planned. Now in the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.11 to $1.14 per share, reflecting growth of 5.25% to 8.25% versus Q3 of '13, again after removing the gain associated with the legal settlement from last year\u2019s results. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.07 in the third quarter. Within the retail segment, we expect revenues to grow $0.25 to 1.75% versus the third quarter of last year. Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 3.75% to 4.75% while we expect total same-store sales in the range of down 1% to up 0.5%. As I noted before, if sales of tobacco and the associated baskets are excluded, our expectations for front store comps in the quarter would be 400 to 500 basis points higher. In the PBM, we expect revenue growth of 14.25% and 15.25% driven by continued strong growth in specialty mix and inflation. We expect retail operating profit growth of 7% to 9% in the third quarter. We expect PBM operating profit growth of 1.5% to 4.5% in the third quarter. So in closing, this was a great quarter with strong financial results across the board. And as a result, we both raised and narrowed our guidance for the full year and we continued to expect strong free cash flow and to deploy it in a way that maximizes value to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back over to Larry. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thanks, Dave. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the work of our colleagues, they work that they\u2019re doing to provide good service to our clients and help people on their path to better health while delivering strong results for our shareholders. I think as we\u2019ve talked this morning and in prior meetings, our unmatched enterprise assets are enabling us to provide innovative integrated solutions in breakthrough products and as the healthcare environment evolves, we are uniquely positioned to address the quality, affordability and accessibility challenges in the healthcare system today. So we\u2019re highly focused on the unique opportunities we see for growth and we\u2019ll continue to take an active and growing role in shaping the future of healthcare. So with that, let\u2019s go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. John Heinbockel : Hi, Larry. So a strategic question. When you think about Specialty Connect, how is that starting to impact your dialogue with potential customers? And with that in mind, how do you think that will impact your ability to reduce drug spend, and does it become a game-changer in terms of market share on the PBM side with new accounts? Larry J. Merlo: Good morning, John. I\u2019ll start and then I think Jon will probably jump in as well. And I think that we really have a surround sound specialty program, okay. I mean we highlighted Specialty Connect this morning and I think that\u2019s one important component, but I think our ability to not just manage the specialty drug but manage the specialty patient I think is what is the real differentiator in the marketplace. And I\u2019ll let Jon pick up from there and talk about the various ways we\u2019re doing that. Jonathan C. Roberts: Yes, so John as I talk to clients about Specialty Connect, what they really like is opening up the access because specialty has historically been a mail order only access for their members with some retail outlets but not really that accessible. And as clients become more focused on it, they\u2019re really excited about this capability and they think of it like Maintenance Choice that as you know has been very successful in the marketplace. And one of our customers is also a physician, so as we talk to physicians they like the fact that we\u2019re opening up convenience for their patients. And specialty today has its business with our PBM clients but there\u2019s also a big open market in Medicare and fee-for-service Medicaid that again physicians have the ability to influence where those members go. So we expect to grow within our PBM base through clients selecting us because of these integrated capabilities but we also believe we\u2019re going to get a disproportionate amount of referrals from physicians as well. John Heinbockel : Okay. How much of an issue is compliance in that business and therefore is that a significant opportunity on the broader cost side? Jonathan C. Roberts: As you look at it adherence \u2013 when you say compliance, I\u2019m thinking adherence to the medication. John Heinbockel : Yes. Jonathan C. Roberts: Historically, retail has performed very much under what traditional specialty pharmacies have been able to perform at. And with Specialty Connect we have achieved the same levels of adherence with our Specialty Connect patients that we have with our specialty pharmacies because we\u2019re able to connect all the clinical capabilities and back-ins of specialty. I know that is a concern that pharma had when we talked to them, but we\u2019ve showed them results and have actually demonstrated an even higher level of adherence because now patients can select which channel they go to. So, we think we\u2019ve solved that and that\u2019s a real benefit. John Heinbockel : Okay, thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Jones : Thanks for the questions. Larry, I want to go back to your comments on prescription utilization. You touched on a little bit of what you were seeing from ACA and Medicaid expansion. As I look at the script growth in the quarter 3.9% exceeding the guidance, it looks like the guide for the next quarter is 3.75% to 4.75%, so a little bit of acceleration. Could you maybe just parse out a little bit what you\u2019re seeing from ACA but also from the broader market utilization? Larry J. Merlo: Bob, I think the broader market I think we\u2019re seeing utilization pretty flat I think from the exchanges I think as had previously talked, I think we\u2019re seeing more of a benefit coming out of the Medicaid expansion. I think there\u2019s still some uncertainty as we mentioned in our prepared remarks in terms of when you look at the exchange population, just how many of those are incremental to health insurance coverage. So I think we\u2019ve talked about the fact that we see '14 as a transition year. As we mentioned earlier, we do believe there is a modest benefit more of it coming from Medicaid in '14 but I think that we certainly see this ramping up as we move into '15 and beyond. Robert Jones : That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess just a quick follow up on the formulary changes you commented on I think at the Analyst Day. You mentioned that in 2014 you\u2019d save clients about $1 billion. I believe the update today was from 2012 to 2015 it\u2019s 3.5. I guess just maybe if you could isolate the most recent changes and what kind of savings those would generate? And then I guess more broadly and more importantly, how successful have you been in shifting clients to these more restrictive formularies? Larry J. Merlo: Bob, I mean we\u2019re not going to provide any more granular information in terms of \u2013 to the first part of the your question. I think in terms of the second part, we have been able to manage transition across members as well as physicians in a very seamless fashion, recognize that. The formulary changes that we\u2019re talking about affect a very small percent of our member base. And that has allowed us to do a lot of, I\u2019ll call it seamless transition in terms of making it a nonevent for the patient as well as the physician. Jonathan C. Roberts: This is Jon. The only thing that I would add is that we expect pharmacy trend, year-over-year growth to the pharmacy spend to grow due to continued AWP inflation, increase in utilization that we just spoke about and the growth in specialty sourcing and clients very open and much more receptive than they had been historically about narrowing formularies. We\u2019re about to about 95 exclusions now. I\u2019ll tell you as we\u2019re making these decisions and these decisions are made through a clinical filter that\u2019s reviewed by our P&T Committee, we are still generating tremendous value for our clients each year and we think there continues to be opportunity particularly in specialty. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for the comment. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Please go ahead. Meredith Adler : Good morning. I have one question about the frontend and then Eric Percher will have a question. I know you\u2019ve talked about the weakness in traffic in the frontend as a function of people consolidating trips. I was just wondering if you could talk \u2013 and of course your own initiatives, but if you could talk a little bit about what you think is going on both with the consumer, are they in fact pulling back and whether you\u2019ve seen any changes in the competitive environment; anybody responding to weak traffic? Larry J. Merlo: Meredith, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing any changes in the consumer. I think that the consumer continues to be a cautious purchaser of products. At the same time, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a change in the competitive environment. We still see an awful lot of promotion across competitors. And we mentioned earlier, we\u2019re continuing to be very disciplined about and quite frankly find that sweet spot. Oftentimes we talk about the art and science in terms of investment spending to drive traffic but to be able to do that in such a way that we\u2019re driving profitable sales. Helena B. Foulkes: I would just jump in and agree with that, Meredith. I think it\u2019s fairly consistent with what we\u2019ve been talking about in the last couple of calls. Consumers are still be a cautious. Where we really \u2013 our focus is health, beauty and personal care and we continue to be encouraged by our performance in those categories. Clearly, our decision on tobacco drove changes as you look at our share in the general mechanize business, but overall I would say competitors continue to be promoting more than they were last year and more than we are, so we\u2019re watching that carefully. We\u2019re really trying to make smart choices so that at the end of the day we\u2019re driving profitable growth. Meredith Adler : Great. And Eric, you have a question right. Eric Percher : Yes, quickly on Specialty Connect, are most of the lives that are moving over from the pharmacy to PBM open market today, is that primarily who served at the pharmacy? And then the lives that we see in Specialty Connect beyond the movement over, have you begun to see traction in expanding the program or is that over the next several months? Jonathan C. Roberts: Hi, Eric. So the mix of customers that are moving over is a combination of open and lives that we have. And as we think about growing Specialty Connect, it\u2019s going to be by driving a higher share of open lives which we\u2019ll do through working with physicians and through new client wins as new clients decide to move to us because of all of our integrated capabilities, Specialty Connect which is one of those. Larry J. Merlo: Eric, the other thing that I think you\u2019ll find interesting, Jon touched on or maybe an analogy of Specialty Connect to Maintenance Choice and what we have seen out of the gate is about 50% of the customers choose to pick up the specialty script at retail which ironically is very consistent with what we saw from Maintenance Choice when we first highlighted the program a few years back. Eric Percher : That is interesting. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Hi. Good morning. Can you give us some additional color on the growth at 90-day at retail? And where do you think we are in kind of again that market shift? Larry J. Merlo: Ricky, we have continued to see accelerated growth at 90 days scripts. I would say it\u2019s growing much faster than the 30-day bucket, if you will. Today it represents about \u2013 I think it\u2019s 29% of our retail prescription pie, if you will. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And when we think about the opportunity as the opportunity for that is kind of like 50% to 60% of scripts you\u2019re presenting kind of like the maintenance script. Is that how we should be thinking about it? Larry J. Merlo: Yes, I mean I think you have it right in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about the maintenance bucket of scripts versus the acute side and yes, I think it\u2019s reasonable to expect it to continue its growth trajectory as we\u2019ve seen the last couple of years. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And then the one follow up on generic inflation. Obviously you\u2019ve done a very good job in mitigating the impact. Can you share with us your expectations for generic inflation for the remainder of the year and any thoughts if this is kind of like sustainable trend that will continue just kind of like longer term? David M. Denton: Hi, Ricky. This is Dave. We don\u2019t really provide a forecast for generic inflation. I\u2019ll just make on comment just from the nature of the generic marketplace and we\u2019re encouraged obviously with the joint venture that we\u2019ve created with Cardinal but also encouraged that we believe strongly that the generic marketplace is long term a deflationary market and we believe that we\u2019re well positioned to work hard in that marketplace to lower our cost and also lower the cost for our clients and the patients that we serve. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Ricky. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Mushkin : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So first, wanted some clarity on the PBM operating growth in the third quarter, just remind us what \u2013 it\u2019s quite a bit less than we saw in the second quarter, so I was hoping to just get reminded on why we get some deceleration there? David M. Denton: Hi, Scott, this is Dave. If you recall back to kind of even to Analyst Day, we fully expected that Q3 was going to be our softest quarter from a growth perspective. So this is very much in line with that expectation. Clearly, the cadence to profitability is tied to really two events is the time to break open generics and when they overlapped LY. And secondly the timing of profitability as we cycle through Medicare Part D. So both of those events are impacting Q3 and consistent as we thought they would impact Q3. Scott Mushkin : That\u2019s perfect. And then my second question really goes to I guess thinking about the asset and the asset turns as we move into the future, not next year but as we move out. It seems like CVS Caremark is uniquely positioned to kind of improve their asset turns with the clinics, with Specialty Connect. Can you guys take us out into the future? What will a store, if you really want to call it a store, three to five years look like as we move out? You guys have any thoughts around that. I know it\u2019s kind of a high in the sky question, but I was wondering if you had some thoughts there? Larry J. Merlo: Scott, I think I\u2019ll start and others may jump in here. But I think you hypothesis is correct. It\u2019s going to evolve from what exist today and we\u2019ve talked a lot about the fixed asset base within the store and the fact that that next prescription has a disproportionate flow through to the bottom line, okay. At the same time, we do see opportunities to extend the pharmacy experience into the front store and I think that Helena has begun some work, some exciting work in terms of the opportunities that that creates. So we\u2019re certainly not in a position where we\u2019ve cracked the code on that or we\u2019re ready to talk to about it other than the fact that I do think that you will see something different in the future from what you see today. David M. Denton: Scott, this is Dave. I think the most, at least mid-term opportunity we have to improve asset turns, if you will, first is \u2013 one\u2019s kind of the just the growth of the service model to the degree that we grow services in our outlets. We do that without deploying a bunch of capital from an asset perspective. And then secondly, as we talked about many times is we do have opportunities from an inventory perspective and making sure that we maximize I\u2019d say the supply chain across all of our channels will be important to us over the long term. Scott Mushkin : All right, guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Scott. David M. Denton: Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Great. Thank you. Jon, I was wondering if I could just maybe start with some questions around the selling season, 5.4 billion of gross new wins. Can you just talk about what people are buying this year? Are you seeing Maintenance Choice, specialty? Is there anywhere that you can give us some metrics around who those new clients are and what programs they bought for 2015? Jonathan C. Roberts: Well, Lisa, we\u2019re obviously very happy with this year\u2019s selling season and when you look at the mix of clients, I think it\u2019s very balanced with employer\u2019s health plans and government business. And I can\u2019t really point to really any one program that has moved up in their priority other than specialty, but we now continue to expand our integrated offerings and many of which are unique, such as Maintenance Choice and Specialty Connect, Pharmacy Advisor and MinuteClinic and all those combined resonate. And then when we talk about our ability to be able to touch members and influence their behavior and impact outcomes that results in lower prices to the client, that continues to resonate. And I think \u2013 I\u2019ve probably seen a little more interest in specialty which has become the top priority in the marketplace and I believe our assets are unmatched. We talked about Specialty Connect earlier, but we also have Accordant, which is a rare disease management company that we link to our specialty offering and that treats not just rare specialty disease state, but it treats the comorbidities. And most of these patients have other diseases that they\u2019re dealing with. We\u2019ve talked in the past about NovoLogix have to spend in the medical benefit not really being managed. We have that capability. Home infusion people are very interested in as well, moving people out of expensive hospital settings into their homes or infusion clinics. Lisa Gill : I guess really what I\u2019m trying to get at is more on the upside, Jon, as we think about 2015 and things that they\u2019ve signed up for, how does it impact profitability of those clients? So do the majority sign up for your specialty programs? Did you see people that were electing to do Maintenance Choice, I\u2019m trying to get some more of the finance side of it? Jonathan C. Roberts: I would say it\u2019s pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in prior years. With health plans probably don\u2019t take as many of our programs as employers do. W are seeing more uptake in our formulary strategy than we\u2019ve seen in the past. Maintenance Choice 2.0 we\u2019re beginning to see uptake in the health plans that historically haven\u2019t really emphasized a mail benefit. But I think I would think about it, Lisa, as consistently what we\u2019ve historically say. Lisa Gill : Okay, great. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Lisa. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. David Larsen : Hi. Can you please talk about the joint venture with Cardinal? And I guess there is some new aspects to it, like just on a very high level, what\u2019s sort of the nature of those incremental milestones might be? And I\u2019m assuming that if those milestones are met, it would mean more earnings for all parties involved. Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: David, good morning. I guess I\u2019ll just start by saying that when we formalized the JV agreement, we had established some guiding principles that spoke to the goals of the entity to reduce cost for our clients, our customers while making the supply chain more efficient and to create win-win opportunities such that there\u2019s equity and fairness in the value that gets created. So obviously over the past six months, we\u2019ve had a lot more time to dig into the data. And it simply made sense to modify the agreement with those guiding principles that I outlined in mind. We\u2019re not going to provide any granularity around some of those milestones but I think we have had a terrific relationship with Cardinal for many years. I think that that\u2019s what led to the JV being created and I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with how the teams from CVS Caremark and Cardinal have come together in the spirit of how do we improve efficiency and drive down costs. And I think we\u2019re off to a terrific start. David Larsen : Great. Thanks a lot. Larry J. Merlo: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Good morning, Larry and Dave, and thanks for his my question. I just wanted to quick check, I heard one point that you brought up. Did you say you expected long-term generic drugs to be inflationary or deflationary? Part of that broke up on my end. Larry J. Merlo: I\u2019m sorry, very much deflationary, George. George Hill : Okay. And then maybe delving into the prepared comments a bit more. It sounds like you're seeing inflation in the small book of the business and then deflation, significant deflation in the rest of the book. And I would ask are you seeing that deflation in acquisition costs? And is that deflation finding its way all the way to kind of the list price or the AWP price from your perspective? David M. Denton: George, this is Dave, maybe I\u2019ll start. Clearly, what we\u2019re signed up to do is our purpose in life is to work to reduce cost for the clients that we serve and the members that we serve that either use this via mail order or use this in our retail outlets or use this in various and sundry other matters. And so when we look at generic inflation, our focus is to control that and to push down those cost to goods sold at this point in time. Larry J. Merlo: George, I think as Dave pointed out, overall we see a deflationary nature in the generic environment and we\u2019re really not going to comment on specific products or AWPs. George Hill : Okay, all right. Then maybe just a quick tack on. From what we hear you guys have been active in significant selling success tacking MinuteClinic onto health plans with the zero co-pay option this selling season. I guess can you talk about expected growth in MinuteClinic as we look out to \u201815? Larry J. Merlo: I think as we pointed out this morning, we continue to see significant growth. Some of that is organic in terms of the ongoing growth of the existing clinics and some of that is being driving by our expansion. We said earlier we\u2019ll open up on 150 clinics this year. I think it certainly is a discussion in the selling season. I think that kind of the ticket to the game metrics are being right on price and service, but we\u2019ve got a lot of other elements with which we can offer clients the MinuteClinic option being one and one that it\u2019s getting a lot of attention. George Hill : All right, I appreciate the color. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group. Please go ahead. Ross Muken : Good morning, guys, and congrats. If we look at sort of the pacing of wins in the selling season, one of your competitors was sort of suggesting that as it sort of tailed off and then as we look into the out-year, the sort of momentum of their peers inclusive of you was sort of waning. If we looked at like your hit rate \u2013 your win rate over the course of the selling season, was it fairly consistent? Did you feel like you gained momentum as you put up some of these big wins? It seems like more recently we've seen a number of public names of size. I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of tone and how you feel like the business had momentum through the most recent RPs you been in? Jonathan C. Roberts: Ross, so I would say we\u2019re continuing to win in the marketplace. I think this year has been particularly good and I think it has a lot to do with everything I was talking about to Lisa with our integrated assets, our ability to deliver cost has a lot to do with what we do with generics and our formulary strategy and the fact that we focus on service to both our clients and their members. So, they like our story and we\u2019re very happy with the wins that we\u2019ve had this year. Ross Muken : And maybe Dave, M&A activity has kind of picked up. You guys have obviously been quite selective and strategic the last few years. As you look at sort of the environment, both in assets here and maybe also abroad, how would you kind of characterize the pipeline and your sort of intent to maybe deploy a little bit more of the balance sheet? Obviously, you've done a great job on returning free cash but you've also been historically pretty prudent on the tuck-in side. David M. Denton: Yes, Ross, obviously M&A has been part of our DNA for a long time in our company. We\u2019ve been very clear that as we think about capital deployment, one area to deploy capital is in kind of investing backward in organically in our business and we will continue to do that. I would say that at the same time, we\u2019re going to be to your point very disciplined in how we approach the market. If you look at our asset base today, we don\u2019t have any glaring gaps or holes in capabilities at this point in time. But as we said, to a degree that we can bolt-on assets that make sense that we have line of sight to both synergies and returns, we\u2019ll do that. And I think that the market is still active in that perspective. Ross Muken : Great. And congrats again guys. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Ross. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning. So just one other quick one on the PBM selling season success that you've had, I'm just curious with it now 70% complete, can you draw any sort of conclusion that the decision to stop the retail tobacco sales may have helped you win some PBM business? I'm curious whether this has come up frequently in RFPs and investment (indiscernible) and has anybody cited that they chose you specifically because of that decision, just curious on that? Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: Steve, I think it\u2019s hard to point any one win and attribute to the tobacco decision. I can tell you that it\u2019s had a lot of discussion with our clients. Obviously recognizing our clients and the fact that they\u2019re working hard to get their members or their employees to stop smoking, they have applauded our decision. Listen, I think it\u2019s one of those intangibles that again back to my earlier point about you got to be right on the basics and then once you\u2019re right on the basics there, I think we have a lot of intangibles that collectively I think become something very meaningful in the client\u2019s eyes. Steven Valiquette : Okay. Just one other quick one on the formulary restrictions; pretty topical this week, but it seems a couple years ago this caused a little bit of negative PR for CVS back in 2011, 2012. But now it seems like these changes are helping you or at least the negativity seems almost nonexistent now. So I guess I'm just curious, any thoughts or color you may have on why the psychology may have changed a little bit among your customers on the better receptivity to formulary changes now, let's say, versus a few years ago? Larry J. Merlo: Steve, it\u2019s a great question. I think if we rewind three of four years, I think what we learned with that decision was the strategy was right. And I remember talking \u2013 as we talked to clients back in late 2011 or early '12, the issue that they had that created the negatively was from an execution largely the timing of the communication, that\u2019s where we were out of sync. We weren\u2019t lined up with their benefit cycle. So I think once we made that course correction, which was an easy one to fix, I think that all the noise subsided. Steven Valiquette : Okay, that's great. Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Peter Costa : Hi. Thanks, guys. Appreciate all the discussion about 2015. But moving back to the tobacco decision, is your view that it's still going to be about 2 billion in annualized sales that would be impacted by that decision or has that number changed given the fact you talked about sort of a double the 400 to 500 basis point impact on same-store for the fourth quarter? Helena B. Foulkes: Yes, we\u2019re still tracking very much towards that $2 billion. The results we\u2019re seeing are in line with what we expected and we said early on it would have a $0.06 to $0.09 impact this year and we\u2019re tracking towards that. Peter Costa : And in terms of the impact on the same-store in the fourth quarter? That seems like that would be a bigger number. David M. Denton: If you just look at what we communicated, we said that in the third quarter that the exit of the tobacco category would be somewhere between 400 and 500 basis points to front store comp impact, negatively impact. And that rate would essentially double as we cycle into Q4. And so that\u2019s essentially how you should think about modeling the progression of that. Larry J. Merlo: And keep in mind that the $2 billion reflected tobacco sales, companion items within that basket and that is a full year revenue number. Peter Costa : Okay. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Robert Willoughby : Just one left. Do you have any guess or forecast in terms of what your share of the Caremark accounts could be by year end? Larry J. Merlo: You mean dispensing share within CVS pharmacy? Robert Willoughby : Yes, CVS market share with Caremark plans. It was at 31% at the end of last year. Where does that trend to? Larry J. Merlo: Yes, we don\u2019t forecast that and disclose that. Robert Willoughby : Would it be something you\u2019d give us at the end of the year at the Investor Day? Larry J. Merlo: Typically it\u2019s something that we discuss at Investor Day, yes. Robert Willoughby : Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Actually, I have another question on the exclusion lists. It seems like this time around from what I've read is you've kind of adopted more of also using prior authorization versus outright exclusion. Just curious on how you kind of make that decision? And then secondly, how do you manage for drugs that you exclude where companies \u2013 where the manufacturers then try to work around that? How do you communicate with your clients and how do you stop to make sure that your plans don't really \u2013 that you don't end up actually paying for that or your employers? Jonathan C. Roberts: Yes. So, Charles, as far as manufacturers working around it, I think that\u2019s the beauty of the exclusion program. They used to try to work around our formulary tiering through co-pay coupons. So once the drug is excluded, the member will have to pay 100% so it would be hard for a manufacturer to work around that. Our strategy around excluding has really not changed. We\u2019ve always had prior authorizations. We do have the ability if a physician feels like a particular drug has a medical necessity that they have the ability to get to that drug, but it\u2019s a very, very small percent of patients that have physicians that want to get them on a particular drug. So it\u2019s really a safety outlook for them. Charles Rhyee : Great. And then just a follow up just on that in general. It seems like this is an area that not only yourself but some of your competitors are starting to really adopt more aggressively. Do you see that this is the next big tool for you to use and to really help manage costs down? So how do you see these lists expanding over time? Is this a big opportunity for you? Jonathan C. Roberts: Well, we have the template exclusion that we\u2019ve been talking about but we also have more aggressive formularies that clients can opt into. So the next step up excludes 170 drugs and then there\u2019s another step that excludes 300 drugs which essentially is all generics. So we do see as we move into the out years, we\u2019re going to be moving towards some of the more restrictive formularies that we think clients are going to be very interested in. So there\u2019s a lot more work and a lot more runway here. Charles Rhyee : Great. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. We\u2019ll take two more questions please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Mark Wiltamuth : Hi. Could you give us what the specialty growth was organically excluding acquisitions? Larry J. Merlo: I don\u2019t think we have that, Mark. We can\u2026 David M. Denton: Hi, Mark. This is Dave. I don\u2019t know that we really had any significant acquisitions in that number. Most of that is of [Coram] (ph). Mark Wiltamuth : But Coram is in there, right? David M. Denton: Other than that. Mark Wiltamuth : Okay. David M. Denton: I don\u2019t know that off the top of my head. The growth rate is still organically significant. Mark Wiltamuth : Okay. And then maybe just give us on the generics a little timing on how you look at the break open market for generics here in the next 12 months or so? Maybe by quarter, where you think we\u2019ll get some better opportunities on generic margins? David M. Denton: Yes. This is Dave, maybe I\u2019ll touch that. I just want to say that the generic launch and break open schedules, if you kind of watch the market, those launch dates continue to evolve a bit. Some move out, some move in even since what we talked about at Analyst Day. And if you look at it, many of the '14 launches have been in flux. As we look into '15 I think some of the break open generics will look a little bit lower than we originally planned when we look back at Analyst Day in December of last year. But I would say it\u2019s still very fluid at this point in time. We\u2019ll continue to kind of assess the situation and give you updates as it becomes pertinent. Mark Wiltamuth : And second half of '14 versus the first half of '14, better or worse for generics? David M. Denton: You got to think about how we cycle to LY, so if you look at the cycle of our back half for this year to back half of last year is a little worse. Mark Wiltamuth : Okay. Thank you very much. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Last question. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Frank Morgan : Good morning. I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the PDP (indiscernible) for the balance of the year, is there any chance that there might be conservatism in the assumptions about the auto-assignees or the choosers you're taking? And basically give us a longer term view how you see next year playing out as well? Thanks. David M. Denton: Hi, Frank. This is Dave, maybe I\u2019ll start here. I think if you look just from a PDP perspective the number of lives, the real I guess opportunity to gain lives is early in the year. So I think if you look to the balance of the year, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a material change or opportunity that presents itself in the marketplace. As we cycle into '15, I think we\u2019re encouraged by what we heard from a benchmark perspective. I think that although that\u2019s what we\u2019ve heard, we don\u2019t really know what the opportunities are at this point in time. I think we have a very attractive product as we cycle into '15, but as far as the auto-assignees we\u2019ll need to understand more fully how the market will evolve and we won\u2019t know that for several more months yet. Frank Morgan : Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. And just limping back on Mark\u2019s question on specialty, in our remarks we said specialty growth was 53%. If you back Coram out of that number, the growth was around 40%, so just bringing closure to that. So with that, let me thank everyone. I know this was a bit of a long call, but a lot of information and thanks for your continued interest in CVS Caremark. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, November 4, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference over to Nancy Christal, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Nancy Christal : Thank you, Carlos. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I\u2019m here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO, who will provide a business update; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review our third quarter results as well as guidance for the fourth quarter and year. Jon Roberts, President of PBM; and Helena Foulkes, President of the Retail Business, are also with us today and will participate in a Q&A session following our prepared remarks. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up, so we can provide more callers with the chance to ask their question. Now I want to take a moment to remind you that our annual Analyst Day will take place on the morning of Tuesday, December 16 in New York City. At that time, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to hear from several members of our senior management team who will provide 2015 guidance as well as a comprehensive update on our growth strategy. If you\u2019d like to attend and haven\u2019t already signed up please contact me as soon as possible as remaining space is limited. The meeting will also be simulcast on our website for those of you who are unable to be there in person. Now I have another important item you to note. Please keep in mind that in order to provide a better view of our underlying performance our results and guidance for the full year as well as all of the year-over-year growth rates we discuss today are calculated after excluding two items; these include the gain from the legal settlement in the third quarter of last year and the loss from the early extinguishment of debt in the third quarter of this year. As a reminder, the debt extinguishment and the associated cost in this year\u2019s third quarter were not included in our guidance. Now, just before this call, we posted a slide presentation on our website which will footnote where these adjustments have been made. The slide summarizes the information you will hear today as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Additionally, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q will be filed by the close of business today and it will be available on our website at that time. Please note that during today\u2019s presentation, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons we described in our SEC filings including the Risk Factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings. During this call, we\u2019ll also use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company\u2019s performance including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of these non-GAAP items as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today\u2019s call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year. And now, I\u2019ll turn this over to Larry Merlo. Larry Merlo : Thanks, Nancy. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us to hear more about the terrific third quarter results we posted this morning. Overall, we met or exceeded our expectations on every key measure-performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased from 9% to $1.15 per share, a penny above the high end of our guidance range. Both the PBM and retail segments exceeded our revenue expectations along with the retail business delivering expanded gross margin. Operating profit in the retail business grew 8.8% at the high end of our expectations while operating profit in the PBM grew 8.5% exceeding our expectations. In the PBM, our performance was primarily attributable to stronger than expected claims volume and favorable purchasing economics. Additionally, we generated $1.4 billion free cash in the quarter and given the favorable tax effect of the debt extinguishment we are increasing our guidance range for free cash flow for the full year by approximately $200 million to $5.7 billion to $6 billion. Now given our strong performance, we are also narrowing this year\u2019s adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.47 to $4.50 and that\u2019s from a range of $4.43 to $4.51 and again excludes the cost this quarter associated with the early extinguishment of debt. And Dave will provide the details behind our financial results and guidance during his review. So with that let me turn to the business update and I\u2019ll start with the 2015 CVM selling season which I\u2019m pleased to report has continued its growth trajectory. Gross wins for \u201915 currently stand at 6.4 billion and that\u2019s up 1 billion from our last update with net new business standing at 3.1 billion up 500 million from our previous report. And let me point out that this excludes any impact from our SilverScript PDP. Now pricing this selling season remain competitive yet rational and our business wins reflect growth in the employer, health plan and government sectors and our success again reflects our track record of generating savings for appliance through our suite of unique capabilities. Now, when you look at the 3.3 billion in business we lost, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that about 50% was lost through acquisition and another 25% was attributable to clients moving some of their members, primarily retirees into the open market and through our strategic relationships with health plans along with our competitive SilverScript product offering we believe we are well positioned to capture beneficiaries enrolling in open market plans. So we\u2019re very pleased with the selling season and our team is already ramping up for what we expect to be another successful welcome season for early 2015. Now as per 2015 renewals, we\u2019ve completed more than 80% of the 26 billion in business up for renewal with the retention rate of just over 96%. Our clients continue to be very focused this season on achieving better control of specialty spend and we continue to differentiate our specialty offerings to provide a high level of clinical support to patients while managing trend for our clients and driving continued share gains in the business. Our specialty revenues were up about 53% year-over-year driven by new business, the high cost Hep C drug Sovaldi along with the addition of the Coram infusion business. Now through Q3 numerous clients have signed up for our site-of-service management product that\u2019s enabled by the acquisition of Coram earlier this year. And we also continue to see client interest in adoption of our medical pharmacy management offering enabled by the acquisition of NovoLogix. So we remain optimistic that we can continue to gain specialty pharmacy share and you\u2019ll hear a lot more about our strategy to capitalize on existing opportunities at Analyst Day. Now before turning to retail, let me touch briefly on our Med-D product SilverScript. As expected, we currently have about 3 million lives in our individual PDP and we expect to end the year with about the same amount with monthly add-ins from new chooser enrollments and dual auto assignments expected to offset normal monthly attrition and we\u2019ll update these numbers early next year as we get the result of open enrollment and along with the low income subsidy of signees. But we continue to see significant opportunity to grow the individual PDP business over the long-term and are pleased with our product positioning in the market for 2015. Now moving on to the retail business, which again produce solid results and let\u2019s talk first about pharmacy. Continuing the strong trend that we saw in the second quarter, we once again gain pharmacy share in Q3. Year-over-year our pharmacy market share increased about 40 basis points on a 30 day equivalent basis. Pharmacy same store sales increased 4.8% versus the same quarter last year while pharmacy same store scripts increased 5.1% again on a 30 day equivalent basis. Now, these strong pharmacy same store sales include the negative impact of approximately 190 basis points due to recent generic introduction and another 190 basis points from the implementation of Specialty Connect which transfers specialty scripts from our retail segment to our PBM segment. As expected we\u2019ve seen no discernible impact on our pharmacy business from the decision to exit the tobacco category and I\u2019ll come back to that in a minute. Regarding health reform, not much is new since our last update and we continue to see a modest positive benefit to our script transform reform and that\u2019s largely from the expansion of Medicaid. Our overall pharmacy margins increased again this quarter and we\u2019re in line with our expectations and on our last call I talked about the impacts of generic inflation and pharmacy reimbursement pressure and given all the market commentary I want to reiterate those comments again today which are reflected in our third quarter results. Recall that when we gave our \u201914 guidance last December, we told you that we expected continued pressure on pharmacy reimbursement. And the market is generally consistent with what we anticipated. As to generic inflation, while cost of goods inflation does exist on selected generic items, the deflationary nature of the generic market remains intact and within our expectations. Now there has also been a lot of discussion in the market about Medicare Part D plan designs that impact retail pharmacy network so let me touch on that as well. First, let me remind you that this is an annual process. And in 2014, CVS is preferred provider in five of the top 10 Med D plans and that's based on lives. For 2015, CVS has contracted with 20 regional and national Part D plans where CVS is positioned as a preferred provider. Now we have taken a disciplined approach to participation in these networks ensuring that market impression and share analysis provides the right economics. Now turning to the front store, we saw a continued decrease in traffic that was partially offset by an increase in the average customer ticket. Our front store comps were down 4.5% and adjusting for the tobacco compact costs would have been approximately 480 basis points higher. We are tracking in line with where we expected to be with respect of the front store impact of our decision to exit tobacco. And if you normalize this quarter for the tobacco exit, in the second quarter for the Easter shift, our pro forma front store comp performance reflects a modest sequential improvement from Q2. Additionally, we produced a solid improvement in front store margins in the quarter. It is important to note that less than one-third of our front store margin improvement was driven by the absence of lower margin tobacco sales with the rest of the improvement reflecting our strategy of driving store brand sales in making responsible investments in promotion. And for the past two years now, we have been talking about utilizing extra care in differentiated ways to balance sales and margin growth. We continue on that trajectory and you will hear more about our plans next month. As for store brand sales, we saw notable gains in Q3. Store brands represented 20.1% of front store sales and that's up about 210 basis points from Q3 last year with gains across health, beauty, general merchandise and edibles. Now roughly half of the improvement in store brand penetration relates to the exit from tobacco as there is zero store brand penetration in the category. And we see significant opportunities to continue to expand our share of store brand products by building on our core equities and health and beauty while also seeking opportunistic growth in other categories. Now turning to store growth on September 4, we completed the acquisition of Navarro, the largest Hispanic-owned drugstore chain in the U.S. In addition to acquiring the 33 Navarro stores, we also opened up 45 new CVS pharmacies, relocated 13, closed 4, resulting in 74 net-new stores in the quarter and we are on track to achieve square footage growth of 2% to 3% for the year. As for CVS/MinuteClinic, we opened 76 net new clinics in the quarter, adding two new states, New Mexico and Nebraska in several new markets. We ended the quarter with 936 clinics in 30 states plus the District of Columbia and we expect to open more than 30 additional clinics in Q4. Now CVS/MinuteClinic has steadfastly continued on its strong growth trajectory. In the quarter, revenues and customer visits increased more than 25% and 30% respectively versus the same quarter last year and we also added eight new health system affiliations throughout the quarters bringing the total number of affiliations for CVS Health to 44 across the country. So CVS/MinuteClinic continues to build a platform that supports primary care by providing integrated high-quality care that is convenient, accessible and affordable. Now before turning it over to Dave, I also want to update you on the progress that has been made by the very talented team we've assembled at Red Oak Sourcing, our venture with Cardinal that formed the largest generic sourcing entity in the U.S. With its combined volume and capabilities, this new relationship will help spur innovative purchasing strategies with generic manufacturers along with enhancing supply chain efficiencies. To date, Red Oak has met with above 40 suppliers covering more than 90% of the cumulative generic spend. Manufacturers continued to be transitioned from the legacy purchasing programs of both CVS and Cardinal to the new Red Oak purchasing platform. And we are extremely pleased with our progress to date and we look forward to Red Oak's future contributions. So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review. Dave Denton : Thank you Larry and good morning everyone. This morning I will provide a detailed review of our solid third quarter results followed by an update on our guidance including the first look at our fourth quarter guidance. But before I do that though let me begin as I typically do and highlight how our disciplined approach the capital allocation continues to enhance shareholder value. During the third quarter, we paid $324 million in dividends to our shareholders. We have already surpassed the 25% dividend payout level and we are making continued good progress towards achieving our 35% payout target by 2018. Additionally, we will purchase more than 10 million shares for approximately $800 million at an average price of $78.51 per share. Year-to-date we've repurchased more than 37 million shares for $2.8 billion and we still expect to complete at least $4 billion of share repurchases for the full year of '14. So between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned more than 1.1 billion to our shareholders in the third quarter alone and return more than 3.7 billion during the first three quarters of the year. Our goal has been to return more than 5 billion in 2014 and we remain on track to meet that goal. As Larry said, we generated more than $1.4 billion of free cash in the third quarter bringing our total for the first nine months of the year to approximately $3.6 billion. The key driver continues to be our healthy growth in earnings coupled with continued improvements in our retail cash cycle fueled mainly by performance and payables. All in, we now expect to generate free cash flow between $5.7 billion and $6 billion in 2014 up from our prior guidance of $5.5 billion to $5.8 billion driven in large part by the tax benefit associated with loss on the early extinguishment of debt. I want to note that there is a chance that our cash flow delivery for the year may come in even stronger than our new guidance that I said today, as we may receive some late year repayments a few days early. However, anything we generate for 2014 above our new guidance is likely to be simply a pull forward from 2015. We will keep you posted of our progress and update you with any new information on Analyst Day. Now turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share from continued operations came in at $1.15 per share up 9% year-over-year and a penny above the high end of our guidance range. As we anticipated in our guidance this includes a $0.03 negative impact to earnings per share from our decision to exit the tobacco category. As Larry said our earnings reflects strong growth across both of our operating segments. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.81 per share. Now as you know in September we retired some long term debt replacing that with debt at lower interest rates. We bought back $2 billion in an average rate of 6% and replace it with five and 10 year notes totaling $1.5 billion at an average rate of 2.74%. By replacing this portion of our debt at lower rates we\u2019re likely to see a $0.01 benefit this year from a reduction of interest expense and should see an incremental improvement in our annual interest expense for about $0.03 next year using today\u2019s share count. There was a cost of $521 million in the third quarter associated with the retirement of these outstanding notes or approximately $0.27 per share and as Nancy said this debt extinguishment and the associated cost were not included in our prior guidance. So with that let me quickly walk you through our underlying results. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the third quarter increased 9.7% or approximately $3.1 billion to $35 billion. PBM net revenues increased 15.7% to $22.5 billion. The strong performance was driven by net new business, specialty pharmacy growth, branded drug inflation and product mix. Offsetting this to some degree were lower mail choice claims reflecting the continued decline in traditional mail order volumes and an increase in generic dispensing. The PBM\u2019s generic dispensing rate increased to approximately 180 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 82.5%. Compared with our guidance PBM revenues were slightly favorable to the high end due to stronger network volume and the delay the couple of generic launches that were expected to occur during the third quarter. As we noted last quarter with the implementation of Specialty Connect we have transferred revenues out of the retail pharmacy segment and into the PBM segment as the PBM took over the dispensing of nearly all specialty prescriptions filled by CVS Health. Given the high cost of specialty drugs, this transition had a larger impact on sales dollars than script volumes as expected. The impact on sales dollars in the third quarter was approximately $210 million and we expect a similar impact in the fourth quarter. As expected, the shift enhanced year-over-year top line growth in the PBM by approximately 115 basis points while dampening revenue growth at retail. As Larry said it had a 190 basis point negative impact on retail pharmacy comps but keep in mind that it had an insignificant impact on retail script volumes. Overall revenues in the retail business increased 3.1% in the quarter to $16.7 billion. Sales in the retail segment were better than expected driven primarily by product mix, volumes and the delay of the generic launches that I just mentioned. Compared to the third quarter of last year, retail GDR partially offset these positive factors increasing by approximately 180 basis points to 83.3%. Retail revenue growth was also dampened by the exit from the tobacco category that was fully complete at the beginning of September. As anticipated, front store cost would have been approximately 480 basis points higher if tobacco and the estimated basket sales were excluded from both this year and last year. In fact, looking at the retail segment, total revenues and adjusting for both the impact from tobacco as well as the impact from Specialty Connect pro forma growth would have been 6.5% a pretty solid performance. Turning to gross margin the consolidated company posted an 18.5% margin for the quarter, a decline of approximately 40 basis points compared to Q3 of '13. This margin decline was the result of a mix shift as the lower margin PBM segment grew faster than the retail segment. Furthermore, this trend was accelerated as we experienced a modest decline in the PBM\u2019s gross margin. And within the PBM segment, gross margin declined approximately 40 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 6.2% while gross profit dollars increased approximately 8.4% year-over-year. The decline in margin year-over-year was primarily driven by typical client price compression and mix, which is only partially offset by the increase in GDR and better purchasing economics. Now gross margin in the retail segment was 31.3% up 125 basis points over LY. Gross profit dollars increased 7.4% year-over-year, the margin improvement was largely driven by an increase in pharmacy margins which benefited from the increase in GDR and better purchasing economics partially offset by continued reimbursement pressures. At the same time, we saw front store margins expand in the quarter driven mainly by change in product mix including higher store rent sales and our strategy of making responsible investments and promotions. As Larry stated, less than one third of our front store margin improvement was driven by the absence of tobacco. Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues improved by approximately 30 basis points from Q3 of \u201913 to 12.1%, while total SG&A dollars grew by 7%. The PBM segment expenses grew by 7.9% and its SG&A rate was 1.4% an improvement of approximately 10 basis points from LY. Now in the retail segment, SG&A as a percent of sales increased by approximately 75 basis points to 22.1% while expenses grew by 6.8%. This growth in expense primarily reflects higher legal and operating cost. And within the corporate segment expenses were up $17 million to $196 million, the increase was primarily related to our strategic initiatives as well as IT investments. So adding it all up, operating margin for the total enterprise declined approximately 10 basis points to 6.4%. Operating margin in the PBM declined approximately 30 basis points to 4.8% while operating margin at retail improved about 40 basis points to 9.1%. For the quarter, PBM operating profit was strong growing 8.5% which was higher than we expected. Retail operating profit increased a very healthy 8.8% at the high end of our expectations. So going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $32 million from LY to $153 million. The debt we issued in the fourth quarter of last year was the primary driver of the increase. Although, we did see some benefit from the debt extinguishment at the end of this quarter. Our weighted average share count was 1.16 billion shares and finally our effective tax rate was 39.7%. So with that, let me shift and turn to our 2014 guidance. I\u2019m going to concentrate on the highlights here but you can find the details of our guidance in the slides that we posted on our website earlier this morning. For the year we expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $4.47 to $4.50 per share, reflecting strong year-over-year growth of approximately 12.75% and 13.5%. And to be clear, as Nancy noted at the start of the call, our guidance and the year-over-year growth comparisons remove the impact of a loss of the early debt extinguishment in the third quarter of this year as well as the impact of the gain from the legal settlement we recorded in the third quarter of last year. This makes the numbers more comparable and better demonstrates our underlying performance. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operation is expected to be in the range of $3.93 to $3.96 per share. In effect, we\u2019ve narrowed our adjusted earnings per share guidance range taking the bottom end up $0.04 and the top end down by about a penny thereby increasing the midpoint about penny and a half. Our revised guidance reflects our solid performance through the first nine months for this year as well as our confidence in our outlook. As expected this guidance also assumes share repurchases totaling at least $4 billion for the year and $0.01 benefit from our debt transaction. In the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be the range of $1.18 to $1.21 up 6% to 8.75% from Q4 \u201913. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations\u2019 is expected to be in the range of $1.12 to $1.15 per share. This fourth quarter guidance includes a negative impact from tobacco exit for approximately $0.03 to $0.04 per share consistent with our initial expectations and bringing the impact for the year to approximately $0.07 to $0.08 per share. As you all know, sequentially, Q4 profit growth is expected to be somewhat lower than what we've experienced year-to-date. So before I walk you through the details, I would like to point out a few factors influencing the quarterly profit cadence across our business. First, the timing of the impact of break-open generics presents the tough comparison versus Q4 of LY. Second, Q4 is the first quarter that we will see the full financial effect from our decision to exit the tobacco category. And finally, due to the success of 15 selling season, we are investing incrementally in our welcome season to ensure a successful migration of new customers. Now I will go through the details of our fourth quarter guidance. Within the retail segment, we expect revenues to be up 0.25% to 1.75% versus the fourth quarter of LY. Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 3.5% to 4.5% while we expect total same store sales in the range of down 1% to up 0.5%. We expect front store same store sales to reflect a negative impact relative to the tobacco exit of approximately 900 basis points in the fourth quarter. We expect to see another significant improvement year-over-year in retail gross margins in the fourth quarter. This is expected to be driven by a number of factors such as better purchasing economics which includes the quarterly payment from Cardinal as well as the exit from tobacco. As we noted, the tobacco exit drove only a small portion of the margin expansion we saw in the third quarter. The impact is expected to ramp in the Q4 once we see a full quarter's impact. We expect the retail segment's operating profit to increase 4.5% to 6.25% in the fourth quarter. And now for the PBM segment, we expect revenues to increase 16.75% to 18.25% for the fourth quarter and adjusted claims to be between 270 million and 275 million claims and we expect to see a notable decline in PBM gross margins during the fourth quarter again due to price compression and drug mix. In addition, the expected margin decline reflects the additional investment in our people processes and technologies; we are making to ensure another successful welcome season given the share number of new clients we are taking on for 2015. As a result of our success, we made solid investments during the third quarter and expect to continue to invest through the first quarter of next year. Combined with the strong revenue expectations, we expect the PBM segment operating profit to be flat to up 2% over last year in the fourth quarter. As a result, for the total enterprise in the quarter, we expect revenues to meet up approximately 9% to 10.5% from the fourth quarter of '13. This is after intercompany eliminations which are projected to equal about 10.8% of combined segment revenues. This elimination ratio has been trending higher due to the tobacco exit which obviously does not affect pharmacy revenues. With the total company, gross profit margins are expected to be down significantly from last year's fourth quarter driven largely by mix. Operating expenses as a percent of revenues are expected to notably improve in the fourth quarter. PBM operating expenses as a percent of revenue should show modest improvement driven in part by the growth of high cost specialty drugs year-over-year. Retail expense leverage should moderately decline given the loss of tobacco related sales with only a small amount of associated reductions in expenses and we expected operating expenses in the corporate segment to be between $200 million and $205 million. We expect operating margin for the total company in the quarter to be down 30 basis points to 40 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. We expect net interest expense of between a $125 million and a $135 million and a tax rate of approximately 40% in the fourth quarter. We anticipate that we will have approximately 1.15 billion weighted average shares for the quarter, which would imply approximately 1.17 billion for the year. And as I said, we now expect to generate free cash flow in the range of between $5.7 billion to $6 billion for the year. So in summary, this was a very solid high quality quarter with strong financial performance across the enterprise. And importantly, our outlook remains strong. We continue to remain focused on using our strong free cash flow to ride value for all our stakeholders both now as well as into the future. And so with that, I will turn it back over to Larry Merlo Larry Merlo : Okay, thank you Dave. And I just want to say again that I am very pleased with our performance year-to-date and I do want to take a moment to thank our colleagues across the CVS Health Enterprise for everything that they are doing day in and day out to serve our many customers and stakeholders while driving results. And as a pharmacy innovation company, we are focused on our growing role in shaping the future of healthcare, and with our unmatched enterprise assets we are very well positioned for today and at the same time we\u2019re still hard at work on the next innovation that will prepare us for tomorrow and drive value well into the future as we look forward to sharing those with you next month at our Analyst Day. So with that let\u2019s open it up for your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. John Heinbockel : So guys, I wanted to drill down a little bit on the Retail gross margin performance. Is there any more color front end versus pharmacy on a relative basis one versus the other, because either pharmacy was up a decent amount or X tobacco front end was up a very considerable amount. And so I'm thinking about the two of those. And then what impact would Specialty Connect transfer have on your pharmacy margins? Larry Merlo : Good morning John its Larry and I\u2019ll take the first part and then I think Dave will go ahead and jumped in. John, as we described in our prepared remarks I think we talked about some of the variables in play that impacted both front store and pharmacy margins. We saw growth in both of those areas but I think as you know we have not historically broken those out, other than qualitatively or directionally talking about the factors that are impacting. And obviously in the front store there is going to be some adjustment because of eliminating the lower margin tobacco products and we talked about the fact that, that represented about a third of the improvement that we saw. And as we\u2019ve been talking out for quite some time I think our retail team has done a very effective job in terms of walking that fine lines we\u2019ve described it as the balance between art and fines in terms of how do you drive traffic and sales in a responsible way so that it has a flow through to the P&L and part of that is also reflected in the growth in store brands as well. And I think in the pharmacy segment again there has been a lot of cross turns in the market but similar to what we talked about in the front we\u2019ve brought that same level of discipline as we\u2019re thinking about participation and preferred restricted networks. And at the same time some of the factors that are in play in terms of driving generic utilization and formulary management et cetera, et cetera. John Heinbockel : And Specialty Connect on pharmacy? David Denton : Just in general specialty drugs are typically branded drugs almost exclusively branded drugs -- lower gross margin rate so it would have a slightly positive effect on retail pharmacy as you script those drugs out and move them to PBM but very modest. John Heinbockel : And then lastly on -- with regard to what you're doing promotionally, are you -- what are you learning about promotional elasticity? Because it seems like you're promoting a little less, you're not seeing a traffic drop off, so is promotional elasticity in a lot of cases not as great as we thought it was? Helena Foulkes : I think we spent a lot of time over the last year so really using our extra care data to look at promotional effectiveness so what we\u2019re doing there is understanding; you promote which product who you\u2019re inviting into your stores eventually. So we\u2019ve been using that just to balance ourselves and make sure we\u2019re making the right promotional investments. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Larry, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about moving some of the specialty business outside of the medical benefits and into the pharmacy benefit. And I don't know if you are able to quantify either the types -- modified the success you're having their or can you talk about which types of clients do you think are most likely to want to rethink how they manage debt Specialty Benefits that's executed under the medical side and maybe think about it on the pharmacy side. Larry Merlo : Good morning George its Larry I\u2019ll start and ask Jon to jump in here. Again this is something we spend a fair amount of time talking about at Analyst Day last December and the capabilities that the NovoLogix technology that really serves as the driver to be able to do things on the medical side of pharmacy that we think have been largely unmanaged I think we\u2019re in a point now where we can sit down with a respective client and look at their claims that if you will and actually show them the opportunities that we can bring the savings that are derived as a result of that. Jon Roberts : Yes and George this is Jon. So I would think about this in two ways. One is the ability to move some of the specialty drugs out of the medical benefit and into the pharmacy benefit rheumatoid arthritis is a good example so that we can use our existing capabilities tools utilization programs to effectively manage those for our clients and we do have clients that have an interest in doing that and something we continue to recommend. For the balance of the specialty drugs are managed under the medical benefit we have what Larry talked about the NovoLogix capability to essentially do everything we\u2019re doing on the pharmacy side today, prior authorizations, reprising, utilization programs and manage those programs under the medical benefit. We\u2019re primarily seeing interest from our health plans with the NovoLogix tool and we have got a lot of success there in growing that business. George Hill : Okay. That's interesting color and it's helpful to hear that you're seeing success on the plans I. I've made have thought it would have been more with the employee sponsors may be a real quick follow-up for Dave and Larry I am sorry for dispensing with the pleasantries to start the Q&A but Dave how about -- is there any number you can kind of give us to kind of characterize where we are coming up the curve on Red Oak and try to quantify success there? Thanks and I'll hop back in. Dave Denton : Well, George as you think about Red Oak as we mentioned in our prepared remarks I think the team has gotten off to a terrific start and I do want to emphasize that we essentially airlifted if you will very talented individuals from CVS and from Cardinal that were performing those functions within each company respectively. So, we don\u2019t have a brand new team that is doing this work so I can tell you it\u2019s a very talented team if you sat with these individuals you would know which individuals came over from CVS and which ones came over from Cardinal so I think the management team there has done a terrific job in terms of blending the culture and so on. I think as we talked about value being created, George, there is really three ways that value gets created. One is from the fixed payments that Dave alluded to in his prepared remarks and the fact that we\u2019ll see the first of those payments flowing through the P&L in the fourth quarter of this year. The second is based on a set of predetermined milestones that if they\u2019re achieved there is the opportunity for additional payments to CVS and again I want to emphasize that those are milestones derivatives, if those milestones are not achieved there aren\u2019t additional payments but if they\u2019re there will be and then the third is, this is where scale and expertise and knowledge comes into play that we believe that there will be opportunities to further lower our acquisition cost from what exist today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research, please go ahead. Scott Mushkin : I had a housekeeping item and then I wanted a strategic question. And Dave, was the debt retirement part of the guidance originally or no? I think you said it and I just missed it and I apologize. David Denton : No, Scott it was not part of our guidance originally. Scott Mushkin : Okay, perfect. And this isn't much more of a strategic question maybe we'll hear more about it when we get to Analyst Day, but it seems to me taking a step back that the Retail business is a little bit at a crossroads. And I'm specifically talking on the front end. You've obviously taken tobacco category out, but photos diminished a lot, the cards are not what they once used to be. You guys are adding a lot of clinics in which means not only for pharmacy but people are coming in for health reasons. And then we got the change in the healthcare business where more consumers are going to be making their choices. And then I overlay that with lots of assets tied up in Retail and wondering where you think the business is going on the Retail side and how do you manage all this dynamic? Larry Merlo : Got it, I will ask Helena to talk a little more about that. Helena Foulkes : Okay, good. Yes, I mean I think we\u2019re thinking very holistically from the customers perspective just in terms of the experience and how we want to use our asset and certainly we mentioned before we are focusing on driving profitable growth we think when the customers think that CVS she is thinking first and foremost about pharmacy and health and beauty is a really important part of that CVS and continue to invest in health and beauty and elevate our presence there we are also spending a lot more time talking about digital and thinking about the connection between stores and digital and really enhancing the experience of our customers around digital. So, I\u2019m excited about the work with that going on there. It\u2019s again particularly focused in the pharmacy but the front stores are an important part of that as well. Jon Roberts : Hey Scott, this is Jon. From a client perspective, they use a retail locations just really synergistic to their goals of being able to reach the consumer, influence that consumer, change that consumer\u2019s behavior and lower overall healthcare cost. So, I think you have to think about really as an integrated model not just as a standalone retail pharmacy bolted on to a pharmacy to integrate all these channels. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners, please go ahead. David Larsen : Can you please talk about these relationships that you've developed with these larger health systems? What value is CVS bringing to these health systems that's unique to the Retail channel? And then can you touch on the goal of the in-store clinics and how you see that expanding overtime potentially with more specialty services and potentially lab and is that helping you win on the PBM side? Thanks. Larry Merlo : Yes, Dave it\u2019s a great question. And I think as I mentioned, we now have 44 of those affiliations and I think we've got a number of pilots underway with several of those health systems where we are actually transmitting the patient CMR back and forth. I think that it is a synergistic opportunity where both parties see the opportunity as a referral source. There are patients that we are seeing that have to be referred to for more comprehensive work up and further diagnosis. And at the same time, recognizing our focus on acute care, there are services that we can provide, high quality at a much lower positive care and as we've talked many times getting the visit out of the emergency. So I think it starts there I think with we are in the early innings of the capabilities that we have. I think as the second part of your question we are doing point of care testing in our clinics today and we are evaluating the various technologies that exist in terms of playing a deeper and vigor role and we are excited about a pilot that we now have underway in one of our Texas markets where we are actually performing infusion services in one of our clinics. So I think you will hear us talk a little more about that at Analyst Day but I think there are a number of opportunities that we have there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. I just had a couple of follow questions on the PBM selling season. Larry or Jon can you talk about plan design changes for 2015. And then secondly just there are several amount of question in the marketplace of, is CVS winning because of its combined offering Jon that you talked about today as being fully integrated or have you been winning because of merger related activity and some other things in the marketplace? So if you can give us some of the comment around that as well as your thoughts on plan design changes for 2015? Larry Merlo : Let me take the second question and I will put the first question back to Jon but Lisa I think is again as you've heard us talk in the past, you've got to be right on and competitive on pricing, you've got to deliver service, so I think those are ticket for the games. But beyond that I think we have an off a lot of differentiators and it's a clich\u00e9 to say that when you see one client you see one client but they all have different priorities and I think that we have a growing list of services and products that meet the needs of very diverse clients, whether it's maintenance, choice, Specialty Connect Pharmacy advisor we just talked about MinuteClinic, our leadership and growing position that exists in specialty and as well as the consultant services and that exist within our Medicare Part D assets whether it's providing that service for health plan or our standalone SilverScript products. So we can go on and on with that, okay but I think that we are all very confident and bullish on the fact that our integrated assets are making a meaningful difference in the marketplace in terms of reducing the cost of care and at the same time improving the quality of that care. So I will flip it over to Jon if he wants to add anything to that and then talk more about plan designs. Jon Roberts : Yes. So Lisa I am out in front of a lot of new perspective clients have been over the last year obviously very pleased with the results of the selling season. I would say service issues that they may be experiencing kind of get them to look at what else is available in the marketplace but it's clear once we sit down and talk about everything that Larry covered they see our value proposition and I think it's led to a lot of our success. I think as far as plan design changes we're obviously see more movement consumer driven health plans. We're the member there's more financial responsibility particularly upfront. So we are seeing providers, a high interest of providers in fact most of 50% providing coverage of generics so that there isn\u2019t a negative impact on adherence which we are very pleased to see. I think other things around plan design are I think you are going to see more interest in narrow networks as we are kind of, as we are returning to higher trend I think plans are going to be looking to at the lower cost and ways like that. And I think when you think of narrow networks you really got to just aggregate the different segments. If you look at Medicare Part D, clearly we are seeing a lot of preferred networks there, managed Medicaid, we see them narrow networks employers have been great adopters of maintenance choice but we are also seeing movements into narrow preferred networks. And commercial health plans really have been I would say the slowest to adopt these plan designs, but I think with the growth of exchanges I think you\u2019re going to see movement there. So when you look at the new business wins that we brought on this year we have about a third of our new wins adopting different plan designs and moving into narrow networks as an example. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Jones : To follow-up on the PBM and the net wins you mentioned over $1 billion better relative to this update this time last year. Can you talk a little bit more about where you're winning and any sense you can give us on mix around profitability of where you're winning? I know you mentioned some shifts in where people are looking to go with narrow networks, just curious on how that all impacts the profitability of the pretty successful season you've had this year. Larry Merlo : Bob, again I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks that we\u2019re very pleased in that the wins that come across all sectors of the business, we\u2019ve seen it on the important side on the health plan side as well as the government sponsor side. So we\u2019re pleased with that. The dynamic in terms of the profitability I don\u2019t think that dynamic we have seen materially changed that typically over the life of the contract you see profitability of those contracts improve and typically it is at its low point in that first year of the new contract. Jon Roberts : Bob this is Jon. As trend continues to grow and there has been a lot of discussion about that the slowing down of the generic pipeline, the growth in specialty I think the good news is that we are seeing this in the new business wins, these clients are going to be adopting our programs which help them lower our cost but are also good for us and improve our profitability. So we think it\u2019s a win-win and there is good alignment there. Robert Jones : That's helpful. And if I could sneak one in on the preferred networks, a big focus around part D this year. As somebody with a fairly unique vantage point on both as a part D provider, plan provider and then also has obviously a retail network, can you talk about what you're seeing as far as the rise in the appetite for preferred networks? And any notable change in the economics in participating in these preferred networks? Larry Merlo : Bob, I think that obviously we have seen an accelerated growth in Med-D. I think from our retail provider side as I mentioned earlier there is going to be a step down in margin associated with participating in those networks as one of the preferred providers and once again I think our retail team has done a very effective job in terms of evaluating the step down in margin against the anticipated share shift and as a result of that there are plans that make sense to participate in a preferred way. There are other plans where it doesn\u2019t make sense. Keeping in mind that all Med-D plans are not equal when you look at the co-pay delta that exist for the beneficiary, the consumer in terms of preferred, not preferred as well as the make-up of that Med-D plan in terms of, if it has a high percentage of low income subsidies they are not subject to the co-pay differentials. I\u2019ll refer to them as the chooser beneficiaries. So I used those as just two examples as well as geographic strength and presence that go into that evaluation. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Barclays. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. Eric Percher, and Meredith Adler here for Barclays. So question on Specialty Connect now that you have couple of months under your belt as you focused on providing access to the open market, the market where you don\u2019t have captive pair lines, have you focused on actually investing in market to the physician or the patient or is this more in manner just being able to capture scripts that walk in to the doors of the store and I imagine you would have an advantage in that marketing effort given your name brands? Jon Roberts : Great question, we\u2019re very happy with how Specialty Connect is performing. We\u2019re seeing a very high level of patient satisfaction and it\u2019s been deployed across our retail stores in specialty pharmacies. Let me say it\u2019s start because there is client component to this also when our clients value this capability and they see this is another differentiated service that we offer and somewhere the maintenance choice has been very successful where we see about 50% of the people want to keep their specialty script up with the local CVS and other half want it sent home. And so realizing most of our important clients are exclusive with us. This is a big benefit that they can give their members. Now when you go to the open market and these are physicians and patients that get to choose our specialty pharmacy. They value service and convenience of Specialty Connect offers. And we have, and have had for years well north of 100 people out working with physicians and talking about the services that we provide and getting their patients started on specialty medications and so this is just we think this just gives us an added advantage in the marketplace because it\u2019s going to be more convenient for their patients and it provides a high level of service for their physicians. So, we\u2019re very bullish on this in both the open market and also the market for our clients we think it gives us an advantage. What\u2019s interesting is that our pharmacy teams love it, because it\u2019s leveraging our integrated assets that no one in the marketplace can and allows them to serve their patients in their local pharmacy and pharma is also very happy with it the inherent results they see in this program because it's equal to or better than what they see traditional specialty pharmacy and better than adherence that they see and normally see in Retail Pharmacy so overall very happy. Eric Percher : It sounds like the value of your commercial basis is quite strong and you\u2019re feeling on the open market is not that this is so much something new but it captures and allows you to capture incremental lives I guess where I\u2019m going is that some of the big players without captive lives have seen a lot of growth in the open market, it doesn\u2019t sound like you think that you\u2019ve left a lot there on the table? Jon Roberts : No, we\u2019ve seen a lot of growth in the open market as well. So, we\u2019re growing both segments so very happy, this gives us we think an advantage over the traditional open specialty pharmacy players. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies & Company, please go ahead. Mark Wiltamuth : Hi, good morning. On the specialty story, you said 53% growth here in the specialty business, what\u2019s the organic growth excluding the Coram acquisition and maybe give us a little more color on the drivers behind that growth because that\u2019s a very large number relative to the 20% growth is kind of expected in the broader marketplace? David Denton : Hey Mark, it\u2019s Dave. Exclude Coram I think our growth in specialty is about 44% for the quarter so while Coram did contribute to the growth it was not an overwhelming driver of that performance. I\u2019ll flip it to Jon. Jon Roberts : And\u2026 Mark Wiltamuth : So is it mostly Sovaldi? David Denton : No, that is one product but that\u2019s certainly that was not the lion share of the growth. Jon Roberts : But yes we\u2019ve added new business we\u2019re seeing existing clients primarily health plans narrow their networks they normally have several preferred pharmacy so we\u2019re seeing more interest and pushing more share into our channels and we\u2019re rolling the open business as well as I talked about so we\u2019re very happy with the performance of specialty. Mark Wiltamuth : And what's your sense on the awareness out there in the marketplace? Because we did a survey earlier this year and some of the employers still weren't completely tuned into the coming wave of specialty spending. Jon Roberts : Clients that I speak to are very aware of it and they\u2019re seeing it in their trend growth so it was something we talked about at our client forum this year. Specialty is their number one priority, they\u2019re looking for ways to control those cost as an example, very high interest and formula strategies but four years ago there wasn\u2019t a real strong interest in, very interested in some of our capabilities around side of care that we can do with NovoLogix. So, yes I think they\u2019re very aware of specialty. Larry Merlo : And Mark, I think that has been a step change over the last let\u2019s say 12 months and I think for the reasons that Jon mentioned, they heard it was coming and now that they\u2019re seeing the impact of drugs like Sovaldi they\u2019re very anxious about ways in which we can bend that cost curve if you will. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS, please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : So seeing the topic of exchanges had thankfully moved to the back burner, but with your disclosure that's roughly $800 million or so of business that was lost to exchanges for 2015. And I guess, at first blush, it seems like a big number but then the fact that it equates to just under 1% of your total annual PBM business, it seems pretty manageable when you put it in that context. So I know it's hard to predict this, but I'm curious do you think that roughly 1% attrition is a reasonable run rate for exchange risk over the next few years? Or could that change higher or lower for any specific reason that you foresee right now? Thanks. Larry Merlo : Well, Steve I think it\u2019s important to put this in context I mean I think the Red Oak around people migrate, active employees migrating over to the exchanges but Red Oak around that has quite a down tremendously and other than perhaps small employee organizations we\u2019re not hearing any of that in mid and large size companies. I think as we alluded into in our prepared remarks I think that and it\u2019s not in consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about in the past. I do think that if there is any trend emerging it is employers getting out of the retiree business and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing back to our earlier comments and it\u2019s kind of hard to put a number on that but I don\u2019t see anything migrating beyond that at this point in time. Jon Roberts : And Steve, this is Jon. And just remember we have an opportunity to recapture those lives through our health plan relationships and also for retirees or Silver Script product that as you can see it is very competitive this year. So we think we will do well and some people move into that exchange. Dave Denton : Yes. Steve this is Dave, maybe just one other comment. We could maybe harken back a little bit to the some of the comments we made several quarters ago. If you look at the exchange market and you look at the assets that we have in place across our enterprise, we are very well positioned from the exchange perspective in a sense that one, you obviously can plug in from a PBM perspective. I think about plugging in from a specialty perspective, from a retail perspective, from a clinic perspective, there is a host of assets that we have here that really we can plug and play and really meet the needs of the exchange population and really with our touch points with consumers across the marketplace really allow us to kind of utilize those assets in meaningful ways to drive value for both consumers also plan sponsors in the exchange markets. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Thanks. A question here. Just got a couple of follow ups. On the MinuteClinic side, can you talk about any sort of metrics in terms of what sort of your same store visits are looking like for stores that have been opened longer than a year? And also maybe any sort of metrics around one of the referral benefits from your earlier health lines partner has been looking like. Larry Merlo : Yeah, Charles we have not broken out your second question in terms of referral visits. I think in our prepared remarks, we've talked about the fact that year-over-year visits were up 30%. Now that is not a comp number we have not broken that out, okay. But I can tell you that, that growth did not come just from new clinics. We are continuing to see healthy growth in clinics that have been open for a couple of years now. Charles Rhyee : Okay, that's helpful. And secondly just a follow up on sort of the preferred networks in Medicare Part D, it seems like the issue with the contracting here is where you set sort of this overall effective rate on the pricing. It seems like from your comments that you guys have not had as much of an issue in Medicare Part D as you negotiated your way into these preferred networks or chose not to be in them. My question is really around the overall effective rate. I mean it seems like this is a negotiated rate, whether it sort of puts and takes on when you go to health plans to negotiate this, in particular is this, do you give up something for a higher overall effective rate and what you've gained for negotiated more aggressive on? Thanks. Dave Denton : Hey, Charles. This is Dave; maybe I will take that, just one comment. I think we\u2019ve been very disciplined and I think applied somewhat of a sophisticated lens to this activity. As you can imagine, as Larry stated earlier it\u2019s not all Medicare Part D products and benefit designs are created equal. And I think we look at the each one of those designs, we analyze the utilization impact and the share movement impact based on the design and the co-pay differentials and we understand what makes sense for us and what makes sense for our plan sponsor. And we also compare and look at the makeup of that membership base and understand whether it's a low income subsidy base or a chooser base and that creates different dynamics in the marketplace. So we've factored all that in and essentially underwrite our performance there and make choices that we think are economically in the best interest of CVS Health, but also the best interest of our health plans and best interest of the consumers that we serve and I think we have been very disciplined around our approach to that. Larry Merlo : Okay. Carlos we will go ahead and take two more questions please. Operator : Very well. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Robert Willoughby : All right just a quick one. Dave how much of the cash flow benefit for the year might be, might you consider one time in nature i.e. tobacco inventory reduction. And then secondary what's driving the higher accounts receivable days. Is there any opportunity to bring that down? Larry Merlo : Yes, a couple of things. One is I don't think there is anything that is necessarily one time in nature per se if any material nature absolutely normal cadence of recoveries for Medicare Part D which is kind of baked into kind of our run rate. So I don't see anything abnormal from a cash flow delivery perspective. And I think both from a receivables and payables perspective I think if we continue to work on a payable side and probably still some opportunities. On the accounts receivable side is really, we are probably constrained a little bit as it relates to Medicare Part D and a performance and requirements around CMS which is probably not a lot that we can do to influence that specifically other than just make sure that we are fully on top of it managing it effectively. Robert Willoughby : And that's on the retail side. Larry Merlo : It\u2019s most on the PBM side frankly. Robert Willoughby : Fair enough. Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James. Please go ahead. John Ransom : Two questions, what you are guys saying it is too early in terms of the specialty trend for 2015 and how much of that will affected by the lapping of Sovaldi and I have one follow-up. Dave Denton : I think it\u2019s probably little too early to chat about specialty trend in specifics as it relates to 2015. I would say that Jon and his team have been working with client to kind of outline that if you don\u2019t manage specialty trend over the long-term, that you can see trend in kind of the mid-teens level over the next several years but I think that what we have been working with our clients to do is go back and outline a series of steps and activity that they can implement with us that can actually help them manage that trend down to very reasonable levels they chose to do so. And we\u2019ve been very explicit with our clients and working very diligently with them to make sure they understand those tradeoffs. Jon Roberts : John the only thing I\u2019d add what Dave said is that, when you look at the 2014 specialty trend I mean it is going to be double digits and so all these going to play a big role in that. And there is, we actually saw on the back half of this year that the utilization in the Hep C market primarily driven by Sovaldi plateau. We\u2019ve seen Harvoni launched already and we\u2019re actually seeing an uptake in utilization and most of that uptake is coming at the expense of Sovaldi. But also there is a new MV product coming out in December that will compete with Harmony. And so our plan is to leverage our formulary strategy and bring cost down and we\u2019ll determine which products one or more actually are on our \u201815 formulary so I think we are going to have a little different dynamic as we move into \u201815 because we\u2019re now seeing competition in the Hepatitis C category. John Ransom : Right. And my other question was the pushback of Nexium a needle mover in terms of your original guidance for this year and what you're now thinking about for fourth quarter? Jon Roberts : It is the push back and it is change to our expectations but I think that shift in that change is fully contemplated our guidance for this year I think the actual launch date of that is recycle into \u201815 is still up in the air quite frankly we are not certain. So we keep posted on that we\u2019ll keep watchful eye on that. We may know more by Analyst Day I think we may not. But we\u2019ll see where we are. Larry Merlo : Okay. So with that, once again let me thank everyone for your time today and for your ongoing interest in our company and we look forward to seeing hopefully all of you next month in New York. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask you to please disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, February 10, 2015. I would now like to turn this conference over to Nancy Christal, Senior VP of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Nancy Christal : Thanks, Julian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO, who will provide a business update; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review our fourth quarter results as well as guidance for the first quarter and year. Jon Roberts, President of the PBM; and Helena Foulkes, President of Retail business, are also with us today and they'll participate in the question and answer session following our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Just before this call, we posted a slide presentation on our website. The slides summarized the information you'll hear today, as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Additionally, note that our Form 10-K will be filed later this afternoon, and it will be available on our website at that time. Please note that during today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings. During this call, we'll also use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance, including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of these non-GAAP items, as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for 1 year. And now, I'll turn this over to our CEO, Larry Merlo. Larry Merlo : Well, thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. This call wraps up 2014, and it was a great year for our company by any measure. We delivered approximately 10% growth in consolidated revenues, 14% growth in PBM operating profit, 8% growth in retail operating profit and 13.5% growth in adjusted earnings per share on a comparable basis. On a quarterly basis, we have consistently posted solid financial results and the fourth quarter was no exception. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8.4% to $1.21 per share at the high end of our guidance range. And both the PBM and Retail segments exceeded our revenue expectations. Operating profit in the Retail business grew 6.5%, just above the high end of our expectations, while operating profit in the PBM increased about 1%, right in line with expectations. Additionally, we generated $2.9 billion of free cash in the quarter and $6.5 billion for the full year, exceeding our expectations. Also today, we are reconfirming the 2015 earnings guidance we provided back in December, and Dave will provide the details behind our fourth quarter results and 2015 guidance during his review. So let me turn to the business update, and I'll start with the 2015 PBM selling season. Gross client wins for '15 currently stand at $7 billion with net new business at $3.6 billion, both up approximately $400 million from our update back in December. And this excludes any impact from our SilverScript PDP, which I'll address shortly. Now like the past several years, our success in the '15 selling season reflects our high levels of service and execution, competitive pricing, along with our unique integrated model. And our model allows us to provide differentiated products and services that generate savings for our clients, while providing better health outcomes and convenience for their members. Now with $7 billion in new business, encompassing about 150 new clients serving millions of new members, 2015 was the largest and most complex welcome season in our history. And as we stated previously, we invested to ensure a successful welcome season, and that took months of rigorous planning. The investments we made were well worth it and I want to take a minute to express how pleased we are with the extraordinary and successful welcome season we've had. The feedback we've received from clients and consultants has been extremely positive, and I'm very proud of the collective efforts of our colleagues. Now we expect our track record of success in winning and retaining business to continue in the 2016 selling season, which is now underway. Now many of you have asked what our clients are focused on. And the #1 priority centers on controlling their rapidly rising specialty costs. And we're bringing them an array of differentiated solutions. Our Specialty Connect offering, which was rolled out by May of '14, is gaining client interest and traction in the marketplace. The program provides a choice to receive a member specialty script at CVS retail or mail, while preserving the central clinical expertise that leads to better health outcomes. And physicians appreciate the ease of getting their patients started on therapy, no other PBM can offer this today. Clients are also interested in ways to manage specialty costs that fall under the medical benefit, and our NovoLogix solution continues to resonate in the market. Overall, our specialty capabilities enable us to provide strong clinical support to patients, while managing trend for our clients in this strategy is producing results. In fact, specialty revenues were up a very healthy 56% versus the same quarter last year, that was driven by new business, the high-cost Hep C drugs and the addition of the Coram Infusion business. Combined, our innovative offerings enable us to optimize cost, quality and access, and should continue to drive share gains in this fast-growing specialty sector. Now as you know, another way we manage trend for clients is through our highly proactive approach to formulary management. We led the market with our formulary strategy for the 2012 plan year. And since then, we've updated our template formulary on an annual basis, and increasingly, specialty drugs are part of that strategy. Our formulary process enables our clients to provide excellent access to care, while meeting their members' needs in the most clinical and cost-effective manner. Now in January, Gilead's Hep C drugs, Harvoni and Sovaldi, became exclusive on the CVS Caremark standard commercial, exchange, Medicare Part D and Medicaid formularies. Harvoni is the preferred agents for genotype 1. Sovaldi is the preferred agent for the treatment of other genotypes. And our goal was to create the lowest net cost solution for the entire population of patients with all Hep C genotypes. We recognize the cost challenges, and we remain committed to providing solutions for clients that choose to treat all their patients, as well as those who feel it makes more sense to prioritize patients with the more advanced stages of liver fibrosis. We believe that our strategy meets patient needs, while delivering excellent value and clinical options for clients and their members. At the same time, our formulary strategy positions us well in the 2016 selling season. Now before turning to Retail, let me touch briefly on our SilverScript product. We ended 2014 with about 2.9 million individual PDP lives, that was right on plan, and very consistent with what we forecasted and communicated at our Analyst Day. We now have about 3.4 million individual PDP members, reflecting a successful annual enrollment period. And we continue to be pleased with our progress in this growing area of the business. Moving on to retail, which produced solid results across the business even with the tobacco headwind. Now we've been tobacco-free since September, and here's what we've learned over the past 4 months. The negative impact to our front store sales has been slightly less than anticipated. We know that the most heavily impacted categories are consistent with our expectations, but the magnitude of that impact on those categories has been a bit less than expected. Beyond the categories we expected to see impacted, other front store categories have not been negatively affected. And based on external data, it appears that our former tobacco sales have migrated largely to convenience stores and gas stations. There has been no discernible impact on our pharmacy business. And since we launched our new CVS Health brand, customer awareness and response to the new branding campaign has been very positive, and we've seen a notable increase in customer perception of CVS as a leader. So let's review the fourth quarter retail results. Pharmacy same-store prescription unit volumes increased 5.3% on a 30-day equivalent basis, and we continue to gain pharmacy share. Our Retail Pharmacy market share was 21.1% in Q4, and that's up about 55 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago. Pharmacy same-store sales increased 5.5% versus the same quarter last year. The incidence of flu did pick up a bit in the quarter, adding about 40 basis points to pharmacy comps. Pharmacy same-store sales also include the negative impacts of about 150 basis points due to recent generic introductions and another 190 basis points from the implementation of Specialty Connect. And you'll recall, Specialty Connect transfers specialty scripts from our Retail segment into our PBM segment. Pharmacy margins increased again this quarter and were in line with our expectations. Now as we discussed previously, CVS has contracted with 20 regional and national Part D plans for 2015 where CVS is positioned as a preferred provider. And we've taken a disciplined approach to our participation in these networks, ensuring that margin compression and share analysis provide the right economics. Turning to the front store. We saw a continued decrease in traffic that was partially offset by an increase in the average customer basket. Front store comps were down 7.2%, and adjusting for the tobacco impact, front store comps would have been up 0.7%. The impact of the tobacco exit was about 800 basis points, and that's about 100 basis points less than we anticipated. So again, 4 months into it, it's still early, but we're very pleased with these results. Front store margins benefited in the quarter from the tobacco exit. On a comparable basis to last year, including adjusting for the tobacco elimination, front store margins improved modestly. And this underlying improvement in front store margin reflects our discipline in making responsible investments and promotion, along with the continued growth of store brands sales. In fact, we made great progress in store brand penetration in the quarter, with store brands increasing to 22% of front store sales. And that's up about 310 basis points from Q4 last year and about 190 basis points of that improvement reflects the removal of tobacco from our mix. The other 120 basis point reflects underlying progress in our store brand penetration. And we saw gains across health, beauty, general merchandise and edibles, and we see great opportunities to continue to garner store brand share. Turning to our store growth for the quarter. We opened 50 new stores, relocated 30, closed 7, resulting in 43 net new stores in the quarter. And for the full year, we opened 151 new stores, acquired 33, relocated 60, closed 22, resulting in 162 net new stores, and we continue to enter some new markets including Little Rock, Arkansas and Seattle, Washington. So overall, our 2014 store growth equated to an increase in retail square footage of 2.4% and that was right in line with our plan. As for MinuteClinic, we opened 35 net new clinics in the quarter, 171 for the year, ending the year with 971 clinics in 31 states, plus the District of Columbia. And continuing on its very strong growth trajectory, MinuteClinic's revenues and customer visits increased 36% and 33%, respectively, versus the same quarter last year. At year-end, we had 49 affiliations with major health systems across the country. We've recently added 2 new affiliations, further expanding our platform that supports primary care, both conveniently and cost-effectively. Let me update you on the progress that has been made at Red Oak Sourcing, our venture with Cardinal Health. And we are extremely pleased with the rapid progress Red Oak has made to date. The combined expertise of the Red Oak team, along with the simplicity of the business structure, has enabled them to hit the ground running. They have been actively working with suppliers on strategies that create value for all parties and have now transitioned suppliers, representing more than 95% of the combined generic spend. And as expected, we received the first fixed quarterly payment from Cardinal in the fourth quarter, and we look forward to Red Oak's future contributions. Now before I turn it over to Dave, let me comment on the news surrounding Nexium. As you know, Teva recently received FDA approval for the generic, and we've received some questions on how that might impact our results. And I just want to note that there are still many questions regarding the launch of generic Nexium, including potential legal maneuvers, the timing of launches, as well as the number of other manufacturers who could potentially launch. So we need clarity and answers for those questions before we can provide any more specifics. So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review. David Denton : Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide a detailed review of our 2014 fourth quarter financial results and briefly touch upon our 2015 guidance, which remains unchanged from what we outlined back in December. First, I'll start with a wrap up of last year's capital allocation program, which would clearly demonstrate how we've been using our strong free cash flow to return value to our shareholders through both dividends as well as share repurchases. I'm pleased to say that we have continued on our steady march of improving our dividend payout ratio. Recall that back in 2010, that our payout ratio was approximately 14%. We finished 2014 with a payout ratio of 27.7%, almost double 2010's level and 4 percentage points higher than 2013. We paid approximately $1.3 billion in dividends in '14 and $317 million in the fourth quarter alone. Our strong earnings outlook for this year, combined with a 27% increase to dividend that we announced at Analyst Day, puts us well on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 35% by 2018. Now along with these significant increases in our dividends, we have also continued to do value-enhancing share repurchases. For all of 2014, we repurchased approximately 51 million shares for $4 billion, averaging $77.91 per share. In the fourth quarter alone, we repurchased 14.1 million shares for $1.2 billion. So between dividends and share repurchases, we've returned approximately $5.3 billion to our shareholders in 2014. And looking forward, we have $12.7 billion in authorization to repurchase shares, and we continue to expect to repurchase $6 billion this year. Our expectation is that we will return more than $7 billion to our shareholders in 2015 through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases, which is up more than 30% over last year. We generated $2.9 billion of free cash in the fourth quarter. In all of 2014, free cash flow increased $2.1 billion year-over-year to approximately $6.5 billion. The increase in cash generation was driven primarily by improvements in collections and payables management. These were partially offset by growth in inventory and current assets, as well as increased investments and capital associated with technology and other corporate efforts. We had mentioned on our last earnings call that the 2014 free cash flow might exceed our guidance at the expense of 2015 guidance. And in fact, we did end the year $500 million above the high end of our goal. That was driven by the receipt of some late year payments a few days early. Despite the higher-than-anticipated receivable collections in '14, the underlying strength of our cash flow allows us to maintain our free cash flow guidance for this year of $5.9 billion to $6.2 billion. Aside from these timing items within receivables, we continue to make strides in improving our cash cycle through better management of payables, and we remain committed to further improvements in working capital as we look forward. For the year, our net capital expenditures were $1.6 billion. This included $2.1 billion of gross CapEx, offset by $515 million in sale-leaseback proceeds. And as for the income statement, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $1.21 per share at the high end of our guidance. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.14 per share. We saw strong results across our operating segments with Retail posting results above the high end of our expectations. So with that, let me quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the fourth quarter increased 12.9% to $37.1 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 21.7% to $23.9 billion. This year-over-year growth was attributable to specialty pharmacy, including the impact of Coram and Specialty Connect, as well as increased volumes in pharmacy network claims. Partially offsetting this growth was an increase in our generic dispensing rate, which grew approximately 125 basis points versus the same quarter of last year to 82.1%. We saw strength on the top line versus our guidance due primarily to higher volumes than expected, particularly in Medicaid, drug price inflation and mix, including the new Hep C drugs. In our Retail business, revenues increased 2.9% in the quarter to $17.7 billion, driven primarily by strong pharmacy same-store sales growth, despite the transition of specialty revenues into the PBM segment due to Specialty Connect. Like the PBM, retail exceeded guidance due to higher volumes in pharmacy. Turning to gross margin. We reported 17.9% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 140 basis points compared to Q4 '13 and consistent with our expectations. Within the PBM segment, gross margins declined 100 basis points versus Q4 of '13 to 5.2%, while gross profit dollars increased 2.2% year-over-year. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the increase in volumes, the improvement in GDR and favorable rebate economics. Partially offsetting these drivers was the impact of client and drug mix, as well as continuing client pricing pressures. Gross margins in the Retail segment was 31.4%, up approximately 65 basis points over LY. This improvement was driven by the 140 basis point increase in retail GDR to 82.4%, the benefit to front store margins from the tobacco exit, increased store brand penetration, as well as the first quarterly payment we received from Cardinal as part of the Red Oak Sourcing venture. Partially offsetting these drivers was the continued pressure on reimbursement rates. Gross profit dollars increased 5.2% in the quarter. Total operating expense as a percent of revenues notably improved from Q4 '13 to 11.6%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved by 20 basis points to 1.4%. We spent more on 1/1 readiness for the PBMs' welcome season than we expected. But with the over delivery of revenues in the quarter, we were able to deliver the modest improvement we had planned. As reported, SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail segment deteriorated by approximately 35 basis points to 21.3%. However, this was driven by the reduction in retail sales related to our decision to exit the tobacco category, as well as the impact of Specialty Connect, shifting again sales from our segment into the PBM. On an underlying basis, SG&A as a percent of sales at Retail actually improved by approximately 50 basis points. Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $7 million to $205 million, again, within expectations. Operating margin for the total enterprise declined approximately 50 basis points in the quarter to 6.3%. Operating margin in the PBM declined approximately 80 basis points to 3.8%, while operating margin at retail improved by approximately 35 basis points to 10.1%. For the quarter, we exceeded our estimates for operating profit growth in the Retail segment. Retail operating profit increased a solid 6.5%, exceeding expectations by approximately 25 basis points. PBM operating profit increased 0.9% in the middle of our guidance range. And now going below the line on the consolidated income statement. Net interest expense in the quarter decreased approximately $4 million from last year to $131 million. This was due primarily to lower average interest rates. Additionally, our effective tax rate was 39.6%. Our weighted average share count was 1.2 billion shares, only slightly higher than anticipated. So with that, now let me touch on our 2015 guidance, which remains unchanged from Analyst Day. You can find the details in the slide presentation we posted on our website, but I'll focus on the highlights here. We continue to expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in '15 in the range of $5.05 to $5.19 per share, reflecting very healthy year-over-year growth, even after removing the impact in '14 related to the loss on the early extinguishment of debt. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.77 to $4.91 a share. We expect consolidated net revenue growth of 7% to 8.25%, which reflect solid underlying growth across the enterprise. Retail revenues are expected to increase by 1.25% to 2.5%, despite the negative impact of the tobacco exit. Recall that we expect the tobacco exit to have a negative impact on total same-store sales of approximately 175 basis points for the year. And it's expected to have a negative impact of approximately 575 basis points on front store comps for the year as well. While the impact last quarter was a bit better than we expected, it's only been a few months since we became tobacco-free. So we're maintaining our initial guidance on the impact to our comps. We expect growth in PBM revenues of between 11% and 12.25%. We expect retail operating profit to increase 4.75% to 6.5% year-over-year and PBM operating profit to increase 6.75% to 10.75%. The first quarter guidance also remains unchanged from what we talked about in December. As you may recall, we highlighted several timing factors back at Analyst Day that affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout this year. And while 2015 is expected to be a strong year, the cadence of profit growth is expected to be significantly back-half weighted. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.06 to $1.09 a share, reflecting growth of 4% to 7.25% versus the same period of LY. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.02 in the first quarter. Within the Retail segment, we continue to expect revenues to increase 1.5% to 3% and operating profit growth of between negative 1.5% to a positive 0.5% year-over-year. Recall that we expect the tobacco exit to have an approximately 900 basis point negative impact on front store comps in the first quarter. Now revenues in the PBM segment still are expected to grow between 14.5% to 15.75%, while operating profit growth is expected to be flat to down 5%. Additionally, our free cash flow guidance for the year remains in the range of between $5.9 billion to $6.2 billion. And I'll remind you that we are maintaining that range despite the pull forward of some receivables into 2014. So in closing, I'd like to reinforce with everyone 2 important thoughts : First, I continue to be very pleased with the company's significant cash flow generation capabilities. I believe these capabilities should continue to play an important role in driving shareholder value over the longer term. Second, and to that point, 2015 will be another year in which we demonstrate our ongoing commitment to returning value to our shareholders, increasing the dividend and share buyback programs by more than 30% over last year. And so with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry. Larry Merlo : Okay. Thanks, Dave. And let me just reiterate how pleased we are with the progress that we've made this past year in advancing our innovative health care strategies, along with rebranding our company. And I'd like to take a minute to thank our more than 200,000 colleagues who continue to work hard each and every day, executing those strategies. So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : On the PBM side, I noticed EBITDA per claim was a little bit light in the quarter and you're down year-over-year. I know you cited increased spending. I'm wondering if you could comment on whether or not that spending was more of a pull forward for Jan. 1 starts or something more incremental? David Denton : I think that increased spending was really related to the 1/1 readiness efforts. So we spent, as you know, incremental money through Q4 and we talked about the incremental money that we're going to spend, actually, in Q1 as we ramp-up those new clients for the welcome season. Robert Jones : And then the other thing you guys cited was price compression around the EBITDA per claim. I know you mentioned that last quarter as well. I'm just wondering if you could shed any more light on what exactly that was. Is this something from previous PBM contracts? Or is it something more related to the new starts again? Larry Merlo : Bob, I think this is just the ongoing margin compression that we're continuing to see and expect to see as we move forward on both the PBM as well as the retail side. So there's nothing that is new beyond what we've been talking about probably for the last couple of years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So for Larry or Jon, if you guys dissect or try to dissect the upcoming '16 selling season in terms of size and then composition, how do you think that compares to 2015? And do you think -- are you better positioned for '16 given what we saw in '15 or about the same? Larry Merlo : Look, John, it's Larry, I'll start and then, Jon will -- I'm sure will jump in as well. But -- I mean, the latter part of your question, we think we're extremely well positioned for all the reasons that we touched on earlier and that we talked about in greater detail at Analyst Day. I think that if you go back and look at the '15 selling season over '14, there was a lot more RFP activity recognizing that we thought '14 was an anomaly as people were preparing for the impact of the Affordable Care Act. So we think that '15 was kind of a return to a normal selling season, and we don't see '16 any different. It's early, but we think it will mirror what we saw this past year. Jonathan Roberts : And John, this is Jon. I think the size and composition is going to be similar to what we've seen. Health plans, which we're seeing now, large employers that we're seeing now, you'll see the midsize and smaller employers later in the year, and we expect to see a fair amount of state government opportunities as well. John Heinbockel : Okay. And then just one other thing. How do you guys think about capital allocation and buyback as it relates to share price valuation? Does that discussion come into effect at all where you might think, let's do more on the dividend side, let's consider a special dividend? Or is it really kind of a long-term view that, over the long term, buying back $5 billion or $6 billion a year is really the right thing to do? David Denton : Yes. John, this is Dave. We've been pretty consistent in our capital allocation program for several years, and we've outlined it and all the different components of it. I will tell you though, we do look forward to the growth of our business. We look at kind of where we think we're going to be in several years in the future. And then we make sure that we're performing what we would consider value-enhancing share repurchases based on where the growth of our business and the cash-generation capability of our business over the next several years compared to the valuation. So we will continue to monitor that, and we will continue to flex our capital allocation program to drive value for shareholders in the short term as well as in the long term, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler from Barclays. Meredith Adler : So Eric's going to -- Eric Percher is going to ask a question as well. I have a question just about expenses at retail. You did a good job of managing them. I'm just wondering if you actually had to make meaningful changes in labor hours or the way you had work done at the stores because you gave up tobacco and Specialty Connect. Or was that not actually something that you had to deal with? Larry Merlo : No. Meredith, it's Larry. I'll start and -- we have not been doing anything out of the norm that we haven't -- that hasn't been part of our program for the last couple of years. We have always looked for ways in which we can become a more efficient operator at retail. And that's where our focus has been this past year, and will continue to be as we go forward. Meredith Adler : So the improvement is impressive. I'll turn it over to Eric now, he has a question. Eric Percher : Sure. A question of formulary. As you look at the 2016 selling season, do you think your formulary decision around Hep C can stand as an advantage? I know you feel there's advantages to your formulary focus, but do you think that specifically can? And if so, does it beg the question, will we ever see PBMs move to a point where there's such a delta in what is offered by each PBM that a sponsor would choose their PBM based on product availability? Larry Merlo : Well, Eric, it's Larry. I'll start, and I'm sure Jon will jump in as well. I mean, as you think about Hep C specifically, our goal was to create the lowest net cost solution for the entire population of patients, recognizing that our clients have a lot of flexibility in terms of the programs that we have that meets their priorities. And in addition to achieving the lowest net cost solution, we also evaluated a variety of factors including the current and future projected distribution of the population across the several genotypes, the average duration of therapy, of the various agents, factors that contribute to medication adherence, along with our ability to further control costs through utilization management programs. And I go back to some of the things that we talked about at Analyst Day where, through our formulary management program since it started back in 2012, we've saved clients over $3.5 billion. There is a growing opportunity in the specialty class recognizing that, I think, we ended '14 with 31 specialty exclusions. And there's a lot more that we can do to bend the cost curve in specialty beyond just managing the formulary. And maybe I'll ask Jon to talk a little more about that, that respective piece. Jonathan Roberts : Yes. So Eric, clearly, specialty is our clients' biggest concerns. Formulary is a piece of that, but there's also a lot of other things that you can do to help manage that trend and they're also interested in managing it under the medical side, which we have a unique solution. So I think formulary is one piece of the strategy. Your question around the differences in formularies between the different PBM's and the impact on that as clients make decisions, we really haven't seen that as a factor in the selling season. We've been very effective at transitioning members off of non-formulary drugs. We've been very effective at transitioning members from competitors' formularies to our formularies, and we're seeing that this selling season. So I don't -- I'm not seeing formulary as a differentiator as clients are making decisions. I think they're really looking at what we're able to deliver there, and we're very competitive there, but they're also looking at all the other capabilities, differentiated capabilities that we have. Then at the end of the day, that's what makes the difference. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen from Leerink Partners. David Larsen : Was there an impact to gross margins in the Retail division and Pharmacy Services division due to Specialty Connect? Was there a benefit to Retail and a bit of a headwind to Pharmacy Services? And can you size that, if so? David Denton : Yes. I can't really size that. I will say that from a rate perspective, it's slightly beneficial to -- from a rate perspective to retail because think about those specialty prescriptions, they're largely branded prescriptions and branded prescriptions carry a lower gross margin than a generic prescription would. So that would serve to lift retail gross margins when you transfer those scripts out of retail into the PBM. But it would be immaterial though in totality. David Larsen : Okay. So you had like 67 bps of gross margin expansion in Retail. We've been hearing about generic inflation. One of your competitors has obviously been talking about rate pressures. It's not like the Specialty Connect had a huge impact on it, you're just performing well [indiscernible]. David Denton : No. That is certainly not the driver of rate improvement at Retail. If you go back, you look at what's driving the performance in Retail, it continues to be gains in prescription volume, along with the improvements at GDR and our improvements in economics as we drive down the cost from procurement standpoint. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen Group. Charles Rhyee : I have a question on the -- I think you talked about earlier the outperformance in Retail Pharmacy and that it was all the more surprising because of the Specialty Connect transition. At this point, is all specialty drugs that someone comes into the retail outlet, into a retail store, is that all being recorded in PBM? Or are there any certain categories that you'll still end up getting dispensed out of Retail? David Denton : Almost all. Charles Rhyee : Then can you talk about what is -- then what was driving the outperformance at the Retail Pharmacy side then? David Denton : Again, if you go back, if you look at what's really driving it is our continued share gains from a pharmacy perspective. If you look at the volumes of prescriptions running through our dispensing channel at retail, continues to enhance our performance from that perspective. Larry Merlo : And Charles, we mentioned in -- I'll go back to our prepared remarks where we saw a 55 basis point increase in pharmacy market share in the fourth quarter. We also acknowledge that there was a bit of an uptick from the flu season that we began to see in the business in the later weeks in the quarter. Charles Rhyee : Okay. Great. Is there anything on the mix though? Was it more on Medicare or versus commercial? Anything -- any kind of color that you can provide there? David Denton : No. I don't think there was anything that was materially different than what we've seen in past quarters from that perspective. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Biosimilar seems to be an area of focus in recent weeks, and they may be on the market sooner than we previously expected. How should we think about the potential contribution of a biosimilar from coming off of PBM and a retail perspective? And maybe you can help us rank order as we think about where it falls compared to contribution of specialty drugs with kind of like nice rebates like Hep C versus kind of like generics that are on the marketplace today? Jonathan Roberts : Ricky, this is Jon. Still early in this whole arena. But as I -- what I know today, I would think about biosimilars as being more like branded competition. And so the majority of the value will come in the form of rebates. And obviously, most of that value passes along to our clients. Now to the extent that they're able to make them interchangeable and that function more like generics in the non-specialty world, then I think you would see them act more like generics. But I think it's early to see how that plays out. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And then just one follow-up on the specialty. I mean, obviously, you raised a very interesting point about the fact that the contribution that you're seeing in the way you can help manage specialty is not just tied to formulary and that the medical side represents a very nice opportunity. So when we think about kind of like your customers buying specialty through you, and we think about the kind of like the NovoLogix offering in -- what do you think is -- or what is the -- what percent of your clients who buy specialty from you today ask you also to manage it on the medical side? And how do you think that ramp can progress over time? Jonathan Roberts : Yes. I mean, that's a good question. I would say on the specialty, on the medical side, most of that activity is concentrated with our health plan clients. So we're seeing a lot of interest in that space. Obviously, as we begin to manage that, we believe it increases our dispensing opportunities as well because some of those drugs can't be dispensed through us. And we think of our Coram platform as even being an enabler to penetrate the dispensing space to even greater extent than what we do today. Larry Merlo : And Ricky, I think to that point, the value proposition here centers around the ability to manage the specialty patient, not simply the administration of a particular drug, okay? Recognizing that with the various assets that we have now, Jon mentioned Coram and our infusion capabilities, along with what exists in NovoLogix, we can demonstrate for the client cost-savings opportunities by simply migrating the patient to a lower-cost, high-quality site of service. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : So more of a conceptual question. I was kind of sitting back, listening to the call, listening to you guys talk and remembering the Analyst Day. It seems to me if I like kind of look out over the next 12 to 24 months, there seems to be an upward bias to business performance, and I wanted to see if you guys agree with that. I look at like kind of SilverScript, I look at Medicaid expansion -- I know Ohio did it, I look at the front end and the potential to upsell there with all the clinics that are coming in and just the volumes that are going into your pharmacies. So I'm wondering if you agree with that, that there does seem to be some upward momentum to your business if you look over to the next 12 to 24 months. David Denton : Yes. This is Dave, maybe I'll start. I think as we -- you heard at Analyst Day, despite the fact that we come from a very large base in the sense of the size of the company, we have a lot of growth outlooks and opportunities in our business. We outlined over the next 5 years of how we're going to grow the top line fairly significantly, gaining share across both the PBM market space, as well as the Retail market space and be able -- through that share gain, be able to drive performance and operating profit. And with the cash that we generate, be able to further enhance that through the capital allocation program. So I do think, as we look at the marketplace, there's always challenges in every marketplace, but there's really a lot of opportunities for our differentiated model to plug-in to payers and providers and consumers in ways that add value for them, and quite frankly, add value for us. Larry Merlo : And Scott, I mean, it's a great question, and I think Dave answered it well. The only thing that I would add is, there's still so much flux in the marketplace. And back to Dave's point about we've got a multitude of assets that allows us, we can be pretty nimble and I think we described it, we can pivot to additional changes that we see in the marketplace in a pretty quick and innovative fashion. Scott Mushkin : So I appreciate that. This is a follow-up on the same line of thinking. It also seems that as productivity is important to you guys and it does seem, even though there's margin pressure, that the outflow of money into asset doesn't have to be huge, and so we could get some continued increase in ROIC, do you agree with that as well? David Denton : I do, I do. I think if you look at what we're trying to do here is, as we gain dispensing share, that dispensing share can be -- we can essentially leverage the fixed asset infrastructure of our business, both at the Retail segment as well as in the PBM space. And that really allows us to accelerate our returns profile. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. George Hill : I have a question about what I'm going to call your clairvoyance. Because one of the things that I would -- I guess, you guys -- in this case, you guys seem to be able to see the future. Because when we went to your Analyst Day in mid-December -- I'm intrigued that the PBM guidance doesn't move a basis point, despite all the gyrations in the Hep C market. So I guess my question is, as we think about that, in early December, did you guys know this was coming? Did you guys -- did this all play out exactly how you guys thought? Other angles are, does it not move the needle? Does it not impact enough scripts? Are the rebates not big enough? Is the amount of money that you make at Hep C not big enough to move the needle? I mean, not even at the revenue line, it doesn't move the needle. So I guess, maybe this is a planning question, maybe this is a process question, maybe this is a market question. But I guess, can you just give us some color on the background of Hep C and how it all kind of -- it all, obviously, played out exactly according to your expectations. Larry Merlo : Well, George, it's Larry. I'll start and then, I'm sure Dave will jump in. But I mean, we appreciate your comments, okay? I would say that as we're doing our planning, our outlook and our guidance range implies a range of assumptions. And I think I would say it, at the end of the day, it's that's simple, okay? That we've -- as we talk about our outlook for '15, we've got, within that guidance range of $0.14, it comprehends where the market could go. And as we've talked about this morning, we're comfortable with where we're at today and that outlook remains intact. David Denton : And I would think also, George, just from that perspective that it relates to, let's say, specialty and Hep C, we've been planning for this event for a while. This wasn't like a shock to us. We had a lot experience in this category. We were working hard from -- with clients and within our organization to better manage specialty for them. We see the pipeline and have a good view of the pipeline. And with that, constructed a series of programs that allowed us to work to improve our performance in this area on behalf of our clients. And so this was something that was very planned from our perspective, and we kind of saw it coming to some degree. George Hill : Okay. And then maybe this could -- the quick follow-up then would be, is this kind of how the Hep C market evolved in late December, early January -- is there anything different from that playbook that's different from the playbook with how we thought about the statin class or how should we should think about drugs going forward? We got a lot of questions about -- I guess we've gotten a lot of questions about this space. To us, it's just a regular PBM playbook. I guess, from your perspective in Hep C, was there anything different in the way this kind of all unfolded? David Denton : No. I don't think there's much different there. Larry Merlo : No. And George, I think, this all goes back to when we started this in 2011 for the 2000 plan year. I think that we demonstrated in that first year that this can be a cost -- a very effective cost-savings opportunity for clients. And it can be executed with a high degree of service to the members, okay? And certainly, this whole process starts with ensuring appropriate clinical outcomes. And I think we continue to see those opportunities going forward. Jonathan Roberts : George, the only thing that I would say is different as we move into the specialty realm is there will be more complexity around managing it. So as an example, Harvoni is for genotype 1. And so that's what's on the formulary for those patients that have Hep C with genotype 1. And then you have other options for the other genotypes. And so I think you will see a combination of formulary and utilization management programs. So that will -- just adds a little bit of complexity, but I agree with Dave and Larry, it's very similar to what we've seen in the past and our capabilities are playing out in the space as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Jon, I was wondering if maybe you could just talk about planned design for 2015. As we've talked to some of your clients in our annual surveys in December, people talked about MinuteClinic, they also talked about Maintenance Choice. Obviously, we talked a lot about specialty today and that was clearly one of the things that came out when we talked the clients as well. But can you maybe just talk about some of the other things that are changing for 1/1/15. And you talked about spending a lot of dollars and time around implementation. What were some of the changes that came about from a plan design perspective? Jonathan Roberts : Lisa, I think it was just more the same, more penetration and high deductible plans and just higher penetration of all the things that you just talked about. So we really haven't seen anything different than that. Although I will think -- I do think you'll see much more aggressive management in the specialty space around plan designs. So much higher adoption of formulary strategies. And I think as you recall, at Analyst Day, we did talk about, of the new business we brought onboard, 35% of that did some narrow networks. So I think you're just going to see more aggressive programs like this with plan designs as clients began to see these higher trends year-over-year growth of their drug spend. Lisa Gill : Okay. Great. And then my follow-up question, Dave, was around Red Oak. On the generics [indiscernible] side, you talked about the payment from Cardinal. But did you see any incremental savings in addition to the payment that you saw from Cardinal? David Denton : Yes, we did. As we said, we're kind of in the early stages of that effort. As we indicated back at Analyst Day, there's several different ways in which we drive economics here, part of that is lowering our cost of goods sold from Red Oak. And we did see some improvement based on the program. Lisa Gill : Is there a way to quantify that? Or you're not quantifying it? David Denton : We're not -- there is a way to quantify it. But unfortunately, we're not going to quantify it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan from RBC. Frank Morgan : I was curious when you gave your guidance back in December at Analyst Day, what did you contemplate at that point in time regarding discounts related to Hep C? David Denton : Frank, that's also a great question that, unfortunately, we can't get into that level of specificity. But we -- as we talked about earlier, our guidance as we thought about 2015 had a range of -- kind of has a range of scenarios built within it. And at that point in time, we had some clarity around kind of how the market was going to shape up for us there. Frank Morgan : Okay. And as you think -- a lot of the discussion today about the specialty and different strategies, are there any pieces that you're missing strategically that you feel like you need on the specialty side in terms of -- as new drugs come to market? David Denton : So Frank, that's a great question. I don't know that there's any -- we don't really have any gaps from an asset perspective. I will tell you though that we've been working hard to increase our business within the medical benefit management sector, if you will. With NovoLogix as a good example. There's probably other opportunities for us to continue to penetrate that market, so there's probably more to come there. It will probably be really early stages from that perspective. Jonathan Roberts : I mean, Frank, this is Jon. The one place that we don't play much in today is the oncology space. Most of that is administered in physician offices. We do think as the marketplace moves to more risk-based reimbursement arrangements that, that business will view the administration of drugs -- they view it as a profit center today. And as it becomes more risk-based, it will become an expense center for them. So they'll be looking for solutions and people that can operate in that space more effectively. So we're working hard to understand how to extend into that space. And we think our capabilities give us a great, great platform to do that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alvin Concepcion from Citi. Alvin Concepcion : Just a couple of quick ones. Just a follow-up on the Red Oak question. How would you characterize the savings that you talked about versus what you would have expected at this point in time? And then just a follow-up is on generic inflation. What are you seeing there and what is your outlook for the year? David Denton : Yes. Maybe we'll take generic inflation first. We -- as we have said, there has been limited pockets of inflation within the generic universe. I will say that in totality, the generic market still maintains a very deflationary nature. And we believe that, that will continue both in the short term as well as the long term. I think as it relates to Red Oak, I think the team has done a terrific job in standing up that operation. They've met with the lion's share of manufacturers, and we continue to be pleased with the progress. I think that they're tracking consistent as we plan for them at this point in time. Larry Merlo : And Alvin, I think I'll just reiterate the 3 ways in which value is created with Red Oak. Obviously, one is the fixed payment schedule, which started in Q4. The second one is, there are some additional milestones that have been created that will allow for additional payments. And then the third is what Dave alluded to on an earlier question in terms of just the opportunity to create additional reductions in the cost of goods by creating a more efficient supply chain. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from UBS. Steven Valiquette : So I don't know if I missed this, but was there any general color on the mix of the $0.4 billion in additional PBM selling season, wins that you had between health plans and employers or government contracts? Larry Merlo : No. Steve, it was more just general mix probably, maybe it skews a little more to the health plan side recognizing some of the true-ups that take place from their enrollment season. Steven Valiquette : Okay. And then separately, just quickly, the 0.5 million additional PDP lives that you mentioned for early '15, is that net of any Medicare retiree business that you talked about at the Analyst Day that you might have lost to public exchanges? Or do those particular member losses show up in a separate bucket somewhere else? Larry Merlo : Yes. Steve, that's a great question. And that is a net number inclusive of the variables that you talked about. And by the way, you can go back to one of Jon's slides at Analyst Day that kind of did the mapping from where we were to what we were projecting, including the shift in retirees, what we were projecting open enrollment at that point in time. And it came -- the final net number was pretty close to that forecast. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Eric Bosshard : Two things. First of all, just a follow-on with Red Oak. Curious on what inning you would say you're in, in terms of realizing the purchasing benefits from that effort? Larry Merlo : Eric, I would say we're probably in the fourth or fifth inning in terms of the work and the opportunities. David Denton : Yes. Eric, this is Dave. The one thing I wouldn't -- just one word of caution there is that this isn't a game where I think there's a beginning and an end. This is process that is ongoing continuously. So while we might have gotten to the fourth inning as Larry just spoke about, we're going to start a new game soon enough. And we continually need to work to improve our cost structure and that's one way we'll do that. Eric Bosshard : Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, there's some conversation earlier about that 2016 selling season and the composition. And it sounded like you suggested that the opportunity was similar to that which you enjoyed in '15. I'm just wondering if you could talk a bit further about -- '15 was obviously a great success, if that is -- obviously, you aspire to repeat that in '16, but is that reasonable to think that you could achieve a similar level of success in '16 relative to what you did for '15? Larry Merlo : Well, Eric, I think there's 2 comments around that. And first is the fact that as we've been talking a lot about over the last couple of years, the differentiation that the integrated model brings out into the marketplace and how we think that we can meet clients' needs for their business and obviously, their members in a very differentiated way and in terms of satisfying their goals. And I think, as we're talking -- as we're thinking about the '16 selling season, I think it's based on where we sit today. It really has more to do with we expect the RFP activity to be at a similar level to what we experienced last year. So obviously, it's very early, and we'll talk more about it as we go through the year. But we're optimistic as a result of our integrated model. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby from Bank of America. Robert Willoughby : Larry, have you assumed any change in strategy at your #1 retail competitor? What might you do differently this year to take advantage of any disruption or how might you be disadvantaged? Larry Merlo : Yes. Bob, it's Larry. Maybe I'll start and just ask Helena to jump in as well. And Bob, listen, I think our focus continues to be on our business and what we can manage and control within the 4 walls of what we do well every day and the opportunities that we continue to see there. And maybe I'll ask Helena just to talk more about how she's thinking about the Retail business and the opportunities that exist there within CVS. Helena Foulkes : Yes. I think it's a good time for us, an opportunity for us just given what's going on. I mean, the one thing we haven't talked about yet this morning is just the successful launch of this new CVS Health brand, which is definitely resonating with consumers. So we're seeing about 1,100 basis point increase in their awareness of CVS Health, and consumers are really seeing our company as a leader in health care. And so that's exactly what we're hoping for, and we're using that momentum to focus on health and beauty as we talked about at Analyst Day. And just keeping our eye on the ball and running the business and hoping that all of that will come to a good outcome for this year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Ransom from Raymond James. John Ransom : Just a couple of quick ones. First of all, assuming Nexium goes nonexclusive as a multisource, David, is there any reason to assume, as you've said in the past that, that's kind of the best of all worlds for you if it blows right through exclusivity. David Denton : Well, I mean it's hard to say specifically. But my expectation, as we always said, is that we're most advantaged at the point in which there's many manufacturers in the market for a generic drug. And if that were to occur, I assume that, that would be best for us, yes. John Ransom : Great. And secondly, I'm curious about, I mean, everybody defines specialty differently, but I'm curious about what you're telling your clients? And maybe just a question for Jon, once we lap the Sovaldi spike, what does specialty trend looks like from there? Jonathan Roberts : Great question. We have the PCSK9 inhibitors coming out this summer. That could be as big, could potentially be even bigger than Hep C. So pharma is really focused on the space. So I think this is going to be on ongoing challenge for our clients and opportunity for us to step in and really help them manage this area. David Denton : We've been communicating with clients that, left unabated, you can expect to see specialty trends in the high-teens. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Edward Kelly : Larry, you mentioned that you've taken a disciplined approach to preferred Part D networks. I was just hoping that maybe you could give us a little bit more color on that angle given the market place does seem to be competitive. And how important is it for you to have a material presence in that business long term? Larry Merlo : Well, Ed, it's a great question. And it is important for us to have a presence in that business, which we believe we have today, recognizing all the different ways in which we can engage and touch the Medicare consumer. And you go back to some of the things that we've talked about, we coined it the \"silver tsunami,\" the fact that you've got 10,000 baby boomers turning 65 every day. Back to your first question, the competitive environment recognizes that participation in a preferred network comes with associated margin compression. And I think our retail organization has done a terrific job in terms of building an economic model that evaluates margin compression against forecasted share shift. And there are times when the economics make sense and we proceed, and there are other times where the economics don't make sense. Recognizing that all Part D plans are not equal in terms of their design, whether it's copays or the makeup of that Part D plan in terms of the balance between choosers and low income subsidies. I think, at the same time, we also have a unique opportunity recognizing that -- you saw the announcements coming out of HHS last week and the focus in terms of moving more to outcomes management. We participate today in terms of supporting our health plan clients through stars ratings. And we know that in a PDP plan, we can effect over 50% of that stars ratings with the ways in which we engage and touch that patient. So we think that there's tremendous opportunities across our book of business to work with patients, as well as health plan clients in terms of achieving their goals. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Ross Muken : So I'm curious, building a little off of what Helena said, and then also just kind of going back to tobacco. I mean, what would have been sort of the key things that both the tobacco decision, as well as the rebranding have kind of given you from an enterprise perspective that maybe you weren't looking for originally? And has there been anything sort of unsuspecting that has been something that's been more challenging to sort of offset the headwind. I'm just trying to see what was assumed and how it sort of developed either positively or negatively. Helena Foulkes : I mean, as Dave and Larry have said, we're pleased with where we are now. There was certainly a lot of moving parts and it's hard for us to really identify what was driving what. But I'd say in terms of surprises, probably things like the extent which our 200,000 colleagues feel incredibly proud about this decision. We thought they would, but it's really driven a very -- a sense of excitement, I would say, among the organization, a sense of pride to work for a company that would make a decision like this. The branding, I think, has been -- as I said before, it's been successful and it's making people think differently about the company. And what we're trying to do is say to consumers, we're not just like any drugstore on any corner, we're part of a big health care company. And when they see all of the assets that we have and understand all that we do, they start to think about us very differently. So that's been a really exciting part of this decision as well. And I also think that internally for our merchants, it's given them a sense of sort of where do we go from here. I mentioned at Analyst Day, all that we're doing around healthy food and health and beauty, and it's given them an even stronger sense of purpose to drive those businesses. So that's really what we're focused on. Jonathan Roberts : And then Ross, this is Jon. To add to that, as I'm out talking, and I'll focus on new prospective clients that maybe don't know us as well as our existing clients. It's something that we talk about, our repositioning in the marketplace as a health care provider; the discontinuation of tobacco. And yes, there is clearly a halo effect that I see from our clients that makes them feel good about potentially doing business with a company that has taken a stand like that in the marketplace. Larry Merlo : And Ross, I'll just wrap it up by talking about the provider, the physician community. And I think that we've seen this come into play as we think about some of the health system affiliations that we alluded to in the call. And this certainly aligns us with their goals as well. And I think it's opening up some doors to some saw potential unique opportunities as we go forward. Well, listen, again, let me just take a minute and thank everybody for their time this morning and your ongoing interest in CVS Health. And if you have any follow-up questions, you know how to reach Nancy or Mike. Thanks, again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Friday, May 1, 2015.  And now it gives me pleasure to turn the conference over to Nancy Christal, Senior VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Nancy Christal : Thank you, Milan. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO, who will provide a business update; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review our first quarter results as well as guidance for the second quarter and year. Jon Roberts, President of PBM; and Helena Foulkes, President of the Retail Business, are also with us today and will -- they'll participate in the Q&A session following our prepared remarks.  [Operator Instructions] Just before this call, we posted a slide presentation on our website. The slides summarize the information you'll hear today as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Additionally, our Form 10-Q will be filed later this afternoon, and it will be available on our website at that time.  Please note that, during today's presentation, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings.  During this call, we'll also use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance, including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of these non-GAAP items, as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, on the investor relations portion of our website.  And as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website, and it will be archived there, following the call, for 1 year.  And now I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo. Larry Merlo : Okay, thanks, Nancy. And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to hear more about the strong first quarter results we posted this morning. Adjusted earnings per share increased 12.2% to $1.14 per share, and that's $0.05 above the high end of our guidance range. Operating profit in the retail business declined 1.3%, in line with expectations, reflecting the tougher comparison due to the tobacco exit. Operating profit in the PBM increased 14.6%, well ahead of our expectations.  We generated approximately $1.6 billion of free cash during the quarter. And we continued to return significant value to our shareholders through our disciplined capital allocation practices. Now it's still early in the year, but given our outperformance in the first quarter, we are narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range for 2015 to $5.08 to $5.19, and Dave will provide the details of our guidance during his financial review.  So let me turn to the business update, and I'll start with the 2015 PBM selling season. Now the expected revenue impact for '15 has grown since our last update. Our gross new business currently stands at $7.5 billion, with net new business of $4.1 billion, and that's up about $0.5 billion on both the gross and net lines from our last update. The increase was driven primarily by the growth in membership within some health plan clients, as well as some additional wins. Now turning to the 2016 selling season. I would describe pricing in the industry as competitive yet rational. And to date, we've completed about 1/3 of our client renewals, which is typical at this time of the year. And while it's too early to give you specific data points for '16, I will note that the selling season is off to a good start. Our integrated model allows us to provide differentiated products and services that continue to provide savings for our clients while providing better health outcomes and convenience for our members. These unique products and services continued to resonate strongly in the market. And as we typically do, we'll provide a more quantitative update on our 2Q call in August when we have a more complete picture.  Now our recently released Insights report highlights our efforts to manage trends for our clients. In 2014, gross trend was 12.7%, and that's up from 3.8% in 2013. Importantly, the report demonstrates that there are solutions to bend the cost curve. With brand price increases, the accelerating growth in specialty, we are finding more clients receptive to these types of solutions. Our report identifies high-performing clients, what we call our trendsetters, and the solutions that they are using to improve the cost trend. Now we shared these results with our clients at our recent Client Forum last month, and let me take a minute and give you just a couple of examples.  Now first, formulary management solutions, our trendsetter solution. We call it the Value Formulary, and it promotes lower-cost generics and provides limited access to brands. We employ category-specific management using drug exclusions, step therapies, prior authorization and quantity limits. And with a 12.7% gross trend for our overall book of business, our clients using the Value Formulary achieved a gross trend of only 0.5%, more than 1,200 basis points better than the overall book.  A second example is in managing specialty. Our book of business trend in specialty was 32.4%, nearly half of which can be attributed to the surge in prescribing for the new Hep C therapies. Our underlying principles for our management solutions include condition-level management, a broader approach to clinical care and a breakthrough specialty patient experience. Our trendsetter solutions for specialty include our advanced specialty formulary, Specialty Connect and Specialty Guideline Management. And you'll recall that Specialty Connect provides choice to receive a member's specialty script at CVS/pharmacy or through our mail channel while preserving the central clinical expertise that leads to better health outcomes. The trendsetter result? 23.9% specialty trend, nearly 1,000 basis points better than the overall book.  So as I said, there are solutions, and we expect more clients to adopt these cost-management tools.  Now speaking of specialty, our specialty revenues continued on a very strong growth trajectory in the quarter, increasing 46%, and that was driven by volume, new products, inflation and the impact of Specialty Connect. Our infusion capabilities through Coram are another significant differentiator with clients, and we're experiencing healthy growth in the business. In fact, the number of infusion patients we serviced in the quarter jumped 15.7% from the prior year, and that's after adjusting for the timing of the Coram deal close. Site-of-care management, another important component of managing costs for specialty patients, and we offer clients solutions to effectively manage these costs.  As we previously discussed, we've been using our leading formulary strategies to effectively manage the high-cost Hep C category. And we envision employing similar tools to manage the anticipated new PCSK9 inhibitors, which are expected to enter the market later this summer. However, given the significant number of people being treated for high cholesterol that can be treated quite successfully with lower-cost statins, we envision robust prior authorization guidelines to help control costs while ensuring that the appropriate population gets access to these newer therapies.  Before turning to retail, let me touch a minute on biosimilars. With the first biosimilar approved, this is just the beginning of a pipeline that could unlock additional savings and provide options to our clients. We expect discounts to be available, but they will likely vary by product. And for the foreseeable future, we expect biosimilars will behave more like brands than the traditional generics, and as a result, we expect to employ our formulary strategies to generate savings for our clients. Our retail business, it produced results that were in line with our expectations, but pharmacy same-store prescription unit volumes increased 5.1%, and that's on a 30-day equivalent basis. And we continued to gain pharmacy share. Our Retail Pharmacy market share was 21.5% in the quarter, and that's up about 50 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago.  Pharmacy same-store sales increased 4.2% and reflect a positive impact of about 70 basis points related to the incidence of flu. Pharmacy same-store sales also include the negative impacts of about 280 basis points due to recent generic introductions; and another 190 basis points from the implementation of Specialty Connect, which as I mentioned earlier, transfers specialty scripts from our retail to our PBM segment. Our initiative to unlock adherence continues to make good progress. And we anticipate launching some new products later this year that will be available to both patients and their caregivers in order to help patients stay adherent to their medication.  Turning to the front store. Our performance in the quarter was very solid, and while front store comps were down 6.1%, if you adjust for the tobacco impact, front store comps would have been up about 2%. The impact of the tobacco exit was around 800 basis points, and that's about 100 basis points less than originally anticipated. We saw solid growth in our core health and beauty categories, including the strong cough-cold season. And we gained share in health and beauty in both the drug and multi-outlet markets.  And while we experienced a decrease in front store traffic, that decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average customer basket.  Our front store journey to position ourselves as a leading health and beauty destination continues. This year, we are launching phase 1 of our healthy foods rollout, offering customers more healthy choices in a select group of stores. Our beauty elevation program is also launching in several thousand stores. And we continue to test a multitude of changes to further enhance our front-store clustering efforts, including a number of store resets that leverage the knowledge that we're gaining from the Navarro acquisition.  ExtraCare continues to be an important driver of profitable front store growth, as about 80% of our sales now goes through our loyalty program, providing us a longitudinal view of the customer. And we've developed new internal tools to ensure that promotional investments are driving the right economics while delivering value for our customers. And these tools have allowed us to further develop our personalization efforts. Digital and specifically mobile are also important tools in powering up our personalization reach. And just as one example, today, we know that customers using our mobile app with ExtraCare are spending 4x more than our average customer. So we're encouraged by these results and believe that there's more opportunity for further innovation.  Our front store margins in the quarter continued to benefit from these efforts, as well as the tobacco exit. On a comparable basis to last year, including adjusting for the tobacco elimination, front store margins improved notably. And this underlying improvement in the front reflects our highly personalized promotional strategies, along with the continued growth in store brands sales. In fact, we made good progress in store brand penetration in the quarter, with store brands increasing to 20.9% of front store sales. And that's up about 330 basis points from last year, 2/3 of the improvement reflecting the removal of tobacco from our mix and 1/3 of the improvement reflecting underlying progress in our store brand penetration as we continue to make progress toward our 25% goal.  Turning to store growth in the quarter. We opened 38 new stores, relocated 12, closed 10, resulting in 28 net new stores. And we plan to add about 150 net new stores for the full year, equating to an anticipated increase in retail square footage growth of around 2%. As for MinuteClinic, we opened 15 net new clinics in the quarter. And we ended the quarter with 986 clinics across 31 states, plus the District of Columbia. And continuing on its very strong growth trajectory, MinuteClinic's revenues increased about 21% versus the same quarter last year. And 84% of MinuteClinic visits were paid for by third parties, with MinuteClinic included in most payer networks as an accessible and cost-effective provider. The rollout of the Epic electronic medical record system remains on schedule. We're expected to be complete with that by mid-year. Additionally, we've now seen more than 13,000 patients, since the initiation of our TeleHealth pilots in California and Texas, with very high levels of customer satisfaction. And we're continuing to test various uses for TeleHealth and believe it can be part of a care model that improves access and lowers overall health care costs.  Just a quick note on Red Oak Sourcing, our venture with Cardinal Health. We continue to be extremely pleased with the progress the team is making. They continue to execute very well. The expertise that Red Oak provides, along with the simplicity of the business structure, has enabled Red Oak to make great strides. They've been working with suppliers on strategies that create value for all parties and have now transitioned nearly all suppliers to Red Oak within a relatively short time frame. So we couldn't be more pleased with their performance and results. And with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review. David Denton : Thank you, Larry. Good morning to everyone.  Today, I'll provide a detailed review of our first quarter results, followed by an update on our guidance. However, before I do that and as I often do, I want to highlight the ways in which we are using our strong free cash flow to enhance shareholder value through our disciplined capital allocation program. During the first quarter, we paid $399 million in dividends. Our dividend payout ratio now stands at 28.7%, and we remain well on track to achieve our target of 35% by 2018. Additionally, in January, we entered into a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program. At that time, in exchange for $2 billion, we received approximately 16.8 million shares at a price of $94.49 per share, which represented 80% of the notional amount of the ASR. The program concluded yesterday, and we expect to receive approximately 3 million shares today, making the average share price of the ASR $100.64 per share. For the full year, we still expect to complete $6 billion of share repurchases. So between dividends and share repurchases, we've returned more than $2 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter alone. And we continue to expect to return more than $7 billion for the full year, more than a 30% increase over last year's levels.  As Larry mentioned, we generated approximately $1.6 billion of free cash in the first quarter. And we continue to expect to produce free cash of between $5.9 billion and $6.2 billion this year. Now turning to the income statement.  Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $1.14 per share, $0.05 above our guidance range and up a solid 12.2% over LY. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.07 per share. The retail segment performed within expectations, while we saw strong results from the PBM segment, which posted profit growth above the high end. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily driven by stronger-than-expected prescription volumes as well as favorable purchasing and rebate economics in the PBM segment. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the first quarter increased 11.1% to $36.3 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenue growth surpassed expectations as revenues increased 18.2% to $23.9 billion. This growth was driven by specialty pharmacy, as well as increased volumes in pharmacy network claims largely from the addition of new clients. Partially offsetting this growth was an increase in our generic dispensing rates, which grew approximately 150 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 83.5%. We saw strength in the top line versus our guidance due primarily to higher-than-expected volumes, drug price inflation and mix, including the new Hep C drugs. In our retail business, revenues increased 2.9% in the quarter to $17 billion, at the high end of our guidance. This growth was driven primarily by solid pharmacy same-store sales growth despite the transition of specialty revenues into the PBM segment due to Specialty Connect. Higher volumes in the pharmacy were fueled by a strong flu season and an uptick in 90-day prescriptions.  Now turning to gross margins. We reported 17% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 120 basis points compared to Q1 of '14 and again consistent with our expectations. The decline is due, in part, to a mix shift in our business, as our lower-margin PBM business is growing faster than our retail business. Within the PBM segment, gross margins declined approximately 35 basis points from Q1 of '14 to 4.3%. This was primarily driven by price compression, which was partially offset by the improvement in GDR as well as favorable purchasing and rebate economics. Despite the decline in gross margin rate, gross profit dollars were up 9.8% year-over-year given volume increases and mix.  Gross margin in the retail segment was 31.2%, down approximately 20 basis points from LY. The continued pressure on reimbursement rates as well as the continuing mix shift towards pharmacy were partially offset by a number of positive factors. These positive factors include a 150 basis point increase in retail GDR to 84.4%, the benefit to front store margins from the tobacco exit and the increased store band -- store brand penetration. And while gross margin rates were down, gross profit dollars increased 2.1% in the quarter.  Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues notably improved from Q1 of '14 to 11.1%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved by approximately 25 basis points to 1.2%, with operating expense dollars coming in a little lower than expected despite the overdelivery of revenues. As reported, SG&A as a percent of sales in the retail segment increased by approximately 20 basis points to 21%. However, the increase continues to be driven by the reduction in retail sales, which is directly related to our decision to exit the tobacco category; as well as the impact of Specialty Connect, again, shifting sales from our retail segment to the PBM. It's important to note that on a comparable basis, SG&A as a percentage of sales at retail actually improved approximately 50 basis points.  Within the Corporate segment, expenses were essentially flat to LY at $189 million and lower than expected.  Operating margin for the total enterprise declined approximately 35 basis points in the quarter to 5.9%. Operating margin in the PBM declined approximately 10 basis points to 3.1%, while operating margin at retail declined by approximately 45 basis points to 10.2%. As Larry noted, retail operating profit decreased 1.3% in the quarter and was within our expectations. On a comparable basis, excluding tobacco, retail operating profit increased approximately 1.7%. PBM operating profit increased 14%, greatly exceeding our expectations.  So now going below the line of the consolidated income statement. Net interest expense in the quarter decreased approximately $24 million from LY to $134 million due primarily to lower average interest rates on our debt. Additionally, our effective tax rate was 38.9%, slightly lower than expected. The tax rate drove less than $0.01 of the EPS beat. Our weighted average share count was 1.1 billion shares, again in line with our expectations.  So with that, now let me update you on our guidance. I'll focus on the highlights here. You can find the additional details of our guidance in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning.  As Larry said, given our outperformance in the first quarter, we are narrowing our 2015 EPS range by raising the bottom of the range by $0.03. While we are pleased with where we are year-to-date, it is still very early in the year. Our core business is performing well. We now expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in '15 in the range of $5.08 to $5.19 per share, reflecting strong year-over-year growth of 13% to 15.5%, after we remove the impact in 2014 related to the loss on the early extinguishment of debt. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.91 per share.  Consolidated net revenue growth is still expected to be 7% to 8.25%. However, we narrowed our top line outlook in the PBM. We now expect PBM revenue growth of 11.25% to 12.25%, 25 basis points higher than our prior guidance on the low end. This revised guidance reflects our expectations for stronger growth within specialty fueled by a combination of inflation and new product mix, as well as the impact of the higher net new business. We continue to expect retail revenue growth of 1.25% to 2.5% year-over-year.  And intercompany revenue eliminations are now expected to be approximately 10.8% of segment revenues.  Given the narrowing of the PBM's top line, as well as the favorable purchasing and rebate economics that we've seen, we are also narrowing guidance for operating profit growth in the PBM segment. We now expect PBM operating profit to increase 7.75% to 10.75% year-over-year, an increase of 100 basis points on the low end. Retail operating profit growth expectations remain in the range of 4.75% to 6.5%.  And now as I said before, our free cash flow guidance for the year remains in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.2 billion.  So with that, now let me provide guidance for the second quarter. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.20 per share in the second quarter, reflecting growth of 3.25% to 6% versus Q2 of '14. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $1.10 per share to $1.13 per share in the second quarter. Within the retail segment, we expect revenues to increase 0.5% to 2% versus the second quarter of LY. Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 4.25% to 5.25%, while we expect total same-store sales to be down 1.25% to up 0.25%.  The impact of the move of specialty scripts to the PBM via Specialty Connect will be very muted this quarter given that we began this shift in May of last year. Additionally, recall that we expect the tobacco exit to have approximately 800 basis points negative impact on front store comps in the second quarter.  In the PBM, we expect second quarter revenue growth of between 11.25% and 12.5%, driven by continued strong growth in specialty and volumes. We expect retail operating profit to decrease 2% to 4% and PBM operating profit to increase 5% to 9% in the second quarter. Keep in mind that margins in last year's second quarter benefited from the finalization of California's Medicaid reimbursement rates. Recall that this finalization of the benefits benefited retail gross margins by $53 million in the quarter and PBM gross margins by $16 million in the quarter. After removing the impact of that from last year's results, operating profit growth in the PBM would be approximately 200 basis points higher. And on a comparable basis, excluding the California Medicaid impact from last year's results, as well as tobacco, retail operating profit growth will be approximately 490 basis points higher. And again, starting with Analyst Day, over the past several months, we've been highlighting several timing factors that affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout this year. The timing of break-open generics, our tobacco exits and the investments that we've made in the PBM's welcome seasons were the factors expected to impact our cadence the most. And while we delivered a very strong first quarter, the cadence of profit growth is still expected to be back-half weighted. All things considered, we expect a strong back half of the year. So in closing, let me leave you with 3 key thoughts. First, we posted solid comparable growth this quarter, and we're off to a very good start for the year. Second, our 2015 outlook for both businesses, as well as the enterprise overall, is strong, and we continue to benefit from the unique solutions we are delivering to the marketplace. And finally, we expect to continue to generate significant free cash, and we are committed to use this capability to maximize the value we return to our shareholders through a disciplined capital allocation program.  And so with that, let me turn it back over to Larry. Larry Merlo : Okay, thanks, Dave. And again, we are very pleased with our solid start to the year; and our strong, competitive position. And our distinctive channel-agnostic solutions are resonating strongly in the marketplace.  Before we open it up for your questions, just a couple comments that we've all witnessed the unfortunate events unfold in Baltimore over the past several days. And I think, as you know, we operate countless stores in major cities and urban centers all across the country, and despite these acts of violence, we remain committed to these markets. We look forward to working together with community and business leaders in the rebuilding process. And I want to take a minute and pay a special thanks to our colleagues who have worked tirelessly this past week to ensure that Baltimore residents continue to have access, in need of medications and prescriptions. I think we're -- all of us are very proud of the job that they've been doing in a very difficult environment.  So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of George Hill, Deutsche Bank. George Hill : I guess where I would start off first is that the cost-containment in SG&A in PBM has been pretty impressive, and the cost cuts are pretty good. How much room should we think is left there to do considering the growth in the higher-touch specialty medications? And I guess, how should we think about how much lower SG&A can go? Larry Merlo : Look, George, I'll start, and I think Jon will jump in as well. But keep in mind that we had embarked upon a pretty sizable initiative as part of our platform consolidation that was targeted to deliver well over $200 million in annual SG&A savings. And we have largely completed that initiative, and obviously, we're always looking to be more efficient and identify opportunities. And I'll let Jon pick up from there. Jonathan Roberts : Yes, George. So the way we're thinking about our cost structure in the PBM is continuous improvement. So how can we leverage automation, technology; streamline processes to make those processes more predictable and deliver them faster and at a lower cost. I think specialty is an opportunity as we look forward. PCSK9s are coming to the market. They're going to be lower cost than typical for the average specialty drugs in the market today. So we're actually looking at a delivery in a more efficient way than generally specialty, which is higher touch, higher cost than what we see in mail. So it's we're continuing to focus on it and we make progress every year. George Hill : Okay, that's helpful. And maybe a couple quick housekeeping items. Larry, did you say -- that $4.1 billion, that was net wins for 1/1/16 starts? Larry Merlo : No, that was for '15, George. That was a true-up of the '15 selling season. And as I mentioned, it's up about $0.5 billion from our update on our Fourth Quarter Call. And there were some late new wins that got added to '15 and probably, for the most part, mid-year introductions. George Hill : Okay, I wrote that down wrong. And then the adjustment for the California Medicaid comp, that was combined retail-PBM, or just the retail side? David Denton : On the retail side, between California and tobacco is about 490 basis points just in retail. There's about 200 basis points as it relates specifically to the PBM in the quarter of operating profit. Jonathan Roberts : Yes. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Edward Kelly : I wanted to ask a question actually about the PBM and EBIT growth. I mean you actually -- you meaningfully exceeded your guidance this quarter. Could you maybe just talk a little bit more about the drivers outside there relative to your expectation? And then just a question on the outlook because you only raised the low end of the outlook in the PBM, as well as for the company, in terms of EPS. Is that just conservatism? Is there something else that we should think -- be thinking about there? David Denton : Yes, Ed, this is Dave. Maybe I'll touch upon that. As you know, we obviously had a very solid -- we're off to a very solid start to the year, quite frankly, in both businesses and certainly within the PBM versus our expectations. Just a couple things : Obviously, volumes in the PBM continued to be strong, and we continue to be pleased with that. Secondly, we've worked hard both from a cost of goods sold perspective and some of the buy-side economics, as well as the rebate yield has been productive for us. And as you know, a vast majority go back to our clients in the form of lower cost into their pharmacy benefit. And we see -- and so that's really produced the over-delivery in the first quarter. As we look through the balance of the year, it is very early. We've gone through a quarter. We've had a great quarter. I think our core businesses are performing well and nicely. I think there's -- as you know, we have a philosophy of looking through the full year. We're still focused on delivering a very solid year. Continually, there tends to be shifts in the marketplace as it relates to timing of certain aspects of our business, primarily the introduction of generics, and so we'll continue to monitor that as time goes on. Edward Kelly : Okay, great. And just one quick, one follow-up. You did mention reimbursement rate pressure in the release this quarter. I don't think you typically put it in there. Is there something new or different or more intensive about that? Or is it we're just reading too much into that? David Denton : Ed, this is Dave. We continually talk about that, so there's nothing new or unique about that at this point in time. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel, Guggenheim Investments. John Heinbockel : So Larry, a strategic question. Obviously, you have the financial wherewithal to do a lot of things, but when you think about footprint in the U.S. versus where you are globally, is there a priority of you'd like to fill in? And I'm thinking different kinds of businesses but fill in, in the U.S., as opposed to accelerate the global footprint. Or are they of equal priority? Larry Merlo : Look, John, I think, as you know, we've talked a lot about we feel very good about the opportunities that we still have here domestically. And we've been talking about that for the last couple of years, and we continue to feel good about it. And as you think about international, as -- again as we've alluded to in the past, we wanted to understand and build some, I'd describe it as, muscle in terms of what it takes in terms of being successful as a global operator. And that's what led to the Brazil decision. And we've been at it about 2 years now. We've gotten some very good learnings. And I think it's --  any next step there would be pursued with the same financial discipline that I think we've demonstrated in the past. John Heinbockel : And just going back to the PBM EBIT issue. Most of the time, right, in the last 2.5 years, you have exceeded expectations. There's been the rare quarter where you haven't. You've been in-line but have exceeded pretty significantly, and that sort of dovetailed with volume. Is it really sort of that simple that, if you can beat on the volume side, you'll handily beat on the bottom line? And does that speak to, I guess, the -- right, the incremental flow-through margin is simply that high? David Denton : John, this is Dave. I don't know that, that's exactly true. But within -- as you know, within the PBM business, obviously, volume certainly helps, but there's a lot of factors that drive profitability in that business. And I'll just take a good example : Medicare Part D within our insurance company, additional volumes in some categories there actually hurt the profitability from an insurance perspective. So there's a lot of different levers there. I'll just conclude with saying that we've had a great first quarter, and I think our outlook for the year remains extremely strong within the PBM and, quite frankly, within retail. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen, Leerink. David Larsen : Can you just talk about the 2016 and 2017 selling seasons? Where are you? Is -- the 2016 selling season, are you largely through it? Have most health plans made most of their decisions? And what are they looking for this year that's maybe new relative to last year? Larry Merlo : Well, Dave, it's Larry. I'll go ahead and start, and then I'm sure others will jump in. But Dave, I think we've mentioned this in the past that, if I start with our renewals, we've said that this '16 renewal season was typical, recognizing we didn't have a -- the big FEP contract. We said it was around $14 billion to $16 billion and that, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're about 1/3 of the way through the renewal process, which is typical at this time of the year. I would say the selling season again has gotten off to a solid start. We're seeing RFP activity pretty similar to what it was last year, which was a big increase over the prior year, recognizing the -- 2 years ago, there was -- I think there was kind of a lockdown as people were preparing for all the administrative responsibilities of the Affordable Care Act. So we certainly have a long way to go in the '16 selling season. And we'll have a lot more to talk about on the Second Quarter Call. Jonathan Roberts : And David, just to build on what Larry has said. This is Jon. We're through most of the health plan, large health plan, opportunities, probably halfway through the large employer opportunities, and then you move into the balance of the market. And as far as what people are looking for, they're obviously looking for us to be competitive on price. And we have to be delivering good service to our members and clients. So the fact that we've had 2 very successful welcome seasons has helped us from a service reputational standpoint, and obviously we continue to be competitive yet rational on price. And then you add to that all the things that we can do that are unique to our model that, quite frankly, is -- supports our clients with where health care is going : the fact that we've integrated assets and can deliver capabilities like Maintenance Choice, Specialty Connect, MinuteClinic; our leadership position in specialty, so our ability to manage specialty spend not only under the pharmacy benefit and the medical benefit, and this is, as we've talked about, a very fast-growing part of the overall spend; and then third, our leadership in consultative services and Medicare Part D. So yes, as I'm out talking to clients, they're looking for somebody that they know can deliver great service, deliver savings. And then all these unique offerings we bring, I think, has really had a lot to do with our success. 2017, we're beginning to see some activity in 2017, again, large health plans, but I'd say we're very, very early with any '17 opportunities. Larry Merlo : And David, it's --  I'll just emphasize one other point. We had our Client Forum back in April. We had record attendance. There was an extremely high level of engagement, recognizing, as I mentioned, clients have seen cost trend go from around 4% to double digits. So we have -- to Jon's point, we have solutions for them. And there was an awful lot of engagement and education and understanding in terms of what that can specifically mean for their respective business. So there's certainly a lot of follow-up work from the Client Forum, but I think we feel very good about the tools and products and services that can be an important part of the solution for our clients. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler, Barclays. Meredith Adler : I was wondering if there's any update you can give us on whether -- Specialty Connect has led to an increase in volume. Are people responding? I know you're talking about everybody -- that customers liking everything you're doing, but can you identify anything specific from Specialty Connect? Larry Merlo : Well, Meredith, if you look at our specialty revenues, we are growing faster than the market even after adjusting for Coram. So we believe Specialty Connect is delivering additional share, and it is outperforming our initial expectations. And we already have more than 50,000 patients that -- new patients that are utilizing the Specialty Connect product. Meredith Adler : Great. And then I was just wondering if you could talk about what benefits, so far, if you've seen anything, from eliminating tobacco. Have you seen a meaningful change in either the partnerships or the dialogue you're having with physician and hospital groups? Larry Merlo : Well, Meredith, the answer to that is yes. I mean it's I've sat in some of those meetings where we're talking about things that we can do. And then historically, the question would come up about, \"But you guys sell tobacco products, don't you?\" and it literally deflects all the energy out of the room. So I think it's reflected in the fact that, since the announcement just over a year ago now, we've been able to accelerate the partnerships that have been established with leading health systems across the country. And I think we're approaching 60 of those affiliations. And while it's a category of one at this point and it did get some publicity, we've talked about pharmacy networks migrating to more performance-based networks. And we had one particular client, City of Philadelphia, that decided to, as a nucleus of that performance network, tie it around pharmacy providers that do not sell tobacco products. So I think we see some tangible benefits that they're probably more qualitative than quantitative at this point in time, but I think we all believe that it will lead to further differentiation of our business model as we go forward. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Priya Ohri-Gupta: Dave, you guys have been pretty clear about your lease-adjusted leverage target. And you continue to have some capacity in the balance sheet to manage towards that, but can you just remind us about sort of how much flexibility you might have around moderating some of your future share repurchase activity; were you to engage in some sort of strategic activity, that might temporarily take you above that leverage target in order to maintain your current rating? David Denton : Yes, that's a great question. We, as you know, have been very focused on our leverage target at 2.7x adjusted debt-to-EBITDA. We currently have been cycling a bit below that target, but we have additional capacity as we sit here today. We, as you know, have -- continue to have many dialogues with the rating agencies. We're very focused on maintaining our BBB rating status. We do think we have flexibility over time to move our leverage target if strategically it made sense to be a tad over that, as long as we commit to get ourselves back down to that level. We've been very focused over time to make sure that our balance sheet maintained its leverage target at 2.7x, and we work aggressively to get there. We think it's important that we've maintain that rating. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill, JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things. First, you had talked about -- earlier, Larry, about the formulary management and the trend there. Can you or Jon just give us any indication as to the penetration that you have currently with your client base around these kinds of programs just to get an idea of how much future opportunity there is? Larry Merlo : Yes, Lisa, it's a great question. And today, we've got about -- probably about half of our book that is in our formulary program. Now at the same time, there are -- and by the way, that's largely in the employer space. There are health plans that adopt components of the formulary program. So I think there is certainly white space for that to grow. And I think -- as our program continues to evolve and further develop and drive additional savings, I think that there will -- there is already additional dialogue on those programs. Jonathan Roberts : And then Lisa, this is Jon. Larry talked about our trends for 2014 at 12.7%. About 60% of that trend is really driven by branded inflation. And the best way for our clients to manage overall trend of branded inflation is through formulary. So we believe the marketplace is going to get much more aggressive. Our clients are going to get much more aggressive in adopting even more aggressive formulary strategies beyond what they already have. And so it's probably the best way to manage their benefits. Lisa Gill : And so would you expect that uptick as we go into '16? I know I saw Jon recently. We talked about your Client Forum and people really focused on where costs are going and what we're seeing as far as price increases go from the manufacturers. So should we see some kind of inflection in '16 if you're having the conversations today? Or is it you think it's going to be a several-year playout around increase in penetration? Jonathan Roberts : Yes, I mean, Lisa, that's a good question. Yes, as Larry said, our employers, which is half our book of business, the vast majority of those, 80% of those, have adopted our template formulary strategy that we introduced back in 2012. So we -- they've actually taken a big step forward. And then there are other opportunities for them to even get more aggressive. With health plans, the majority of our health plans have adopted our Med D formulary strategies, which again are very tightly controlled. So the market, I think, is primed. And I think, coming off this double-digit trend year of 2014, I have never seen people more open to understanding what opportunities they have to manage this. And as I said, formulary is going to be a big part of that. So we're talking to people now. I think we'll see -- I do think it's going to take a few years to play out, just like everything in our space, so I don't know that there's going to be a single inflection point. But I do very strongly believe that this is going to be a significant lever for our clients to manage this trend.. Lisa Gill : And if I can just understand, Dave, on the -- if you think about you held out rebates in the first quarter, if I remember correctly, it's usually on a lag. So should we expect rebates to get better as we move throughout the year based on the programs that Jon is talking about? Just trying to figure out the timing. So the rebates that we found in the first quarter, was that primarily from things you initiated in the back half of '15? And is that part of the driver for the back half results? And then I'll stop there. David Denton : Yes, Lisa, it's a great question. I'm not going to get into too much detail there. I would just tell you that, as we think about the long-term view of our business, we've been very focused on, from a buy-side economics perspective, what can we do to further reduce the cost to our clients and think about that as our procurement efforts around generics; and then secondly, how do we reduce costs and continue to control costs in the branded category. And that continues to be a focus from a rebates perspective in the formulary management. Now I expect those to be continued, to be drivers for this business at some level in the longer term. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Robert Jones, Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : I guess, maybe just move over to the retail side, Dave. And I know you walked through the retail gross margin pushes and pulls in your prepared remarks, so I wanted to make sure I understood the dynamics in the quarter, especially relative to your full year guidance for this margin to be flat. So I know tobacco would have been a good guy year-over-year for the margin, so I was hoping you could maybe just walk through again what weighed on the margin in the quarter. Was there anything abnormal with pharmacy reimbursement, promotional activity? Just looking for a little more insight there. David Denton : No, I don't think there's anything that's really unique in the quarter from that perspective. I -- as we've said many times, it's that the cadence of profit delivery will be back-half weighted versus front-half weighted. And most of that ties to obviously the tobacco exit and how we overlap that; the California Medicaid comparison in Q2 of '14; but probably more importantly, the delivery of break-open generics and the timing of that driven really more back-half weighted versus front-half weighted. Robert Jones : Okay. And then just one more on the timing technical side. I was wondering if there was anything between 1Q and 2Q that may be pulled 1Q up, as far as the timing around EPS. I mean I know the foreset [ph] headwind from the California Medicaid reimbursement benefit a year ago will make 2Q a little bit worse off, but anything else that we should be aware of, as far as just timing between 1Q and 2Q? David Denton : No. I don't think there's anything that's really of material nature there. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin, Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : So I wanted to follow up a little bit on John Heinbockel's question on but a little bit different take on it, not necessarily acquisitions but kind of looking internally. Larry, when you look at opportunities in front of you with your current assets, where do you think there is the biggest potential to kind of improve what you're already doing? I mean, obviously, the business is humming along, but where do you see some of the levers to get things even better? Larry Merlo : Well, Scott, we're always looking to do better, whether it's to be more efficient with our business and in terms of attempting to deliver high levels of service at the lowest possible cost. And we're always focused on opportunities there. And we continue to be focused on share growth opportunities. We've -- and I think we've gotten some tractions in terms of some of the things that we've been able to do through our partnerships, whether it's with health plans or other providers. Obviously, there's a lot that we can do when we happen to be the PBM, but those opportunities are not limited to employers or health plans where we have to be the PBM. And we've gotten some traction there. David Denton : Scott, this is Dave. What -- we've talked and we've been talking a lot on the call about the PBM and some of the growth engines and around pharmacy. Maybe we'll just spend a minute and ask Helena to talk a bit about what we're doing to drive growth in the front of our business, the retail business. Helena Foulkes : Yes. I think that one of the things that I'm encouraged by, and it goes back to Meredith's question as well, is since we announced our exit of tobacco, I think the marketplace is seeing a real focus that we have around driving health and beauty. And we talked about this at Analyst Day in December, about the journey that we're on to really reposition ourselves as a leading health and beauty destination. So when we met in December, we talked about 5 key themes as part of that growth. One was better health made easy; elevating beauty; our customer-driven personalization; myCVS store; and digital innovation. And I'm really pleased we're making a lot of progress on each of these areas. Just a couple examples : This year, we're launching phase 1 of our healthy food rollout. We've got expanded fresh offerings and healthy snacks. We've -- also have a beauty elevation program, which is launching across several thousand stores this year. And really, there we're in the process of repositioning CVS as the leader in beauty. We've always had a leading market share, but we are really sort of doubling down on the in-store experience and differentiating for our customers. We talk a lot about personalization. Larry mentioned it in his speech, but I think there's even more opportunity there to grow share and be more relevant for consumers and ultimately drive traffic and profitable sales. And then we have a focus this year. We're resetting 500 stores with something we call, take high higher, and these take several of these elements together. We have expanded beauty. We've got this healthy food set. And so this really starts to take the old photo department out and put in healthy food and give customers a very different feel. Those stores are performing well. We've also, within this myCVS store piece, really been looking at different clusters. And I think the thing that we're very excited about is the Hispanic-dominant cluster. We're starting to learn from our Navarro experience. And we've actually started to reset some CVS stores to take up learnings into place. And then we continue to invest in digital and in innovation; see a lot of opportunities, as Larry mentioned, there to drive adoption and have people using both our stores and digital assets. So a lot of things happening that we really haven't talked about so much since December Analyst Day, but I think I'm really proud of the team. I think both the merchants and the operators have a every strong focus on how we want to be unique and different and really own health and beauty. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette, UBS. Steven Valiquette : So I guess, just for me, the -- obviously, the 46% revenue growth in 1Q in specialty is pretty impressive. How do you think that stacks up versus your estimation of industry growth in specialty pharmacy in early 2015? And also, beyond Hep C, are there any other therapeutic categories worth mentioning that were growth drivers? Larry Merlo : Well, Steve, we actually see it outperforming the market growth and, I think, as I mentioned earlier with one of the questions, even after adjusting for Coram, acknowledging that Coram was not comparable for the full quarter. I think we closed towards the end of January. So we're pleased with the results that we're seeing. And some of it is coming from new customer growth. Some of it is coming from our unique products. And I'll ask Jon to comment on therapeutic classes. Jonathan Roberts : Yes. What we have seen over the last 3 years is over 100 new indications for existing specialty drugs, so we're seeing growth really across all categories. Obviously, Hep C is the poster child for growth, but we're seeing growth in RA and oncology, as an example. And the other factor is, as the populations gets older, the older population uses 6x as many specialty drugs as the balance of the population. So we're just seeing really tremendous growth across the entire spectrum of specialty. And that's going to be fueled even further by new drug introductions, 88 new drugs over the last 3 years. We're going to see the PCSK9s be introduced later this year. While we think that's going to be a slow ramp, we think 1 in 4 people that are on statins today could be candidates for these new therapies that are, quite frankly, more expensive than the generic statins that are available today. So we really view specialty as a growth driver as we look forward. David Denton : And Steve, I'll just conclude this question a bit with just maybe just a data point. As you said, specialty in the first quarter grew by about 40%, 46%. It's not just Hep C. If you back, if you take away Hep C and you look at our underlying growth in specialty, it's in the mid-30s. So we continue to perform well at the core in this business. Steven Valiquette : Okay, that's helpful. The one quick tie-in to this : I forgot if you disclosed this at the Analyst Day or not, but the -- within the PBM, I forgot, are you disclosing just a rough range of what percent of the total PBM sales that you'd categorize as specialty? I'm guessing it's somewhere maybe in the 20% to 25% range, but is that just a good approximation? David Denton : So there is a chart in Jon Roberts' presentation or -- and/or Alan Lotvin's presentation that shows that number, last year's number, which I believe is around... Jonathan Roberts : $31 billion, Dave. David Denton : $31 billion and will be moving to $37 billion, was our expectations for this year. Larry Merlo : And just to add on to that because those are a couple of important slides. We talked about the addressable specialty market. We described it as excluding infused oncology. And I think, in '14, we estimated that market at $86 billion growing to more than $150 billion by 2018, so we see a lot of opportunity for growth even without including the oncology space. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : I have 2 follow-up questions here. First of all, about the membership growth, the script growth, obviously, very strong claim growth. What percent of the growth is coming from your PBM members? Larry Merlo : Ricky, are you talking about on the retail side? Ricky Goldwasser : No. I'm talking about pharmacy network claims. Larry Merlo : Yes, Ricky, maybe we're not following the question because we would -- that's why we're not seeing... Ricky Goldwasser : I think that, in the past, you -- kind of like you gave some details on Caremark membership accounting for 34%, 35% of your pharmacy scripts. Unknown Executive : Yes. Ricky Goldwasser : So when you think about kind of like the growth that you've seen year-over-year, obviously, it's pretty impressive. What percent of it is coming from kind of like your PBM client? Just trying to assess kind of like the share gain that was in Caremark versus the rest of the market. David Denton : Yes, we kind of report that on an annual basis because we monitor and we report on the annual basis. Because when we win a client, typically we then -- the work begins in the sense of understanding how to help that client become more productive and manage their costs better. And part of that might be narrowing -- or introducing a product and/or narrowing that network into one of our channels. And so that kind of grows over time. So we've chosen to do that on an annual basis because of that. I will say, just from a Caremark perspective, one thing that we do disclose, and you can see it in the press release and you'll also see it in the Q later day today, is that we do talk about the -- just the network claims volumes that we process on a quarterly basis. And so you can see that kind of within those releases. Larry Merlo : And Ricky, we had shown in the past that if you looked at on the retail side of the business, if you looked at the script growth and the share growth, about half of it was coming from the Caremark book of business, and the balance from the rest of the marketplace. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay, that's very helpful. And then one follow-up on the specialty side. When you think about kind of like your membership, what percent of your PBM clients manage their specialty spend through you, and what percent carving out? Just to kind of like understand the opportunity there in terms of penetration. Larry Merlo : Yes, Ricky, it's about -- today, it's about 60%. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And that's 60% of the employers, or 60% of the total? Unknown Executive : Total... Larry Merlo : Of the total. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies. Mark Wiltamuth : I wanted to dig in a little bit on the generic drug margin swings factors you see over the next couple years. And maybe if you could let us know how you feel relative to your December analyst pronouncements. Because it seems like Nexium launched earlier than you expected, and I'm curious where you stand on ABILIFY and just in general how you're feeling about the break-open pipeline. David Denton : Mark, it's Dave. I think, obviously, as we discussed a little bit earlier, as you know, the generic launch dates continue to obviously move around a little bit. I'll just characterize this. It's not a matter of if these drugs are going to be productive for us from a break-open status. It's just more an issue of when they become productive for us from a generic -- a break-open status. Our main thesis -- as we talked about kind of the 3 categories of drugs, be it branded drugs, limited-supply generics and break-open generics, our thesis for over the long term continues to hold as you increase both savings to customers and clients when you move down that spectrum but also increase profitably to us as you move down that spectrum. Mark Wiltamuth : Okay. And just on generics, maybe give us an update on Red Oak. You said you transferred the sourcing over to Red Oak. And where do you stand on, I guess, achieving cost savings there? David Denton : That's a great question. We have transitioned all of that into Red Oak. They -- we now have virtually all of our generic manufacturers on our program. And we continue to be very excited about where we are but also the opportunity over time to continue to derive value from that program. And kind of beyond that, we don't disclose much more than that from a buy-side's perspective. Larry Merlo : And Mark, I'll just reiterate. We've talked about this, the 3 ways in which value is extracted from Red Oak. One is the fixed payment schedule from Cardinal, which began in Q4 last year. The second ability is through some established achievement of milestones that have been established between the 2 parents. And then the third is just further reductions in our overall cost of products. So -- and as Dave mentioned, we've kind of -- we've framed it up under that umbrella, but we haven't gotten more granular. Mark Wiltamuth : And on that third point on the achieving of the actual cost savings, is that something that ramps over, like, a 2- to 3-year period? Or does it happen pretty quickly? Larry Merlo : Well, Mark, you're never done, okay, in terms of how to make the supply chain more efficient. So I think it's something that will be ongoing. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Ross Muken, Evercore. Ross Muken : So I'm going to ask a big picture question, to close. So Larry, lots going on in your industry. So one of your competitors is attempting to mimic your model at a smaller scale. Another one of your competitors is moving more in the direction of retail and beauty. One of your PBM competitors was acquired. Another is declaring its independence. As you think about CVS' positioning and strategy and how you continue to evolve the model, what are the things you're kind of looking for as the industry changes to kind of give you further confirmation that the share gains you've enjoyed are sort of sustainable and that you have all the assets and the pieces you need to kind of continue to do what you've done, which is put up tremendous results for many years here? Larry Merlo : Ross, you did a really good job of summarizing the marketplace, but I mean, so we have always believed that the integrated PBM retail model, we think, is the optimal model. And I think that gets further highlighted by the fact that we're entering an era of, we've been describing as, the retail-ization of health care. Others are talking about it in terms of an era of consumer-directed health care. And you think about our model. It's really the only one that has deep connections and expertise in dealing with both payers of health care as well as consumers of health care. And we've talked about, and we've reiterated it on the call today, all the different ways in which we can help solve this cost-quality-access conundrum that our health care system faces, so -- and I think, as I mentioned earlier, we believe that we're in a great place. And at the same time, we're always looking for ways that we can be more efficient and speak to payers and customers in a more surround-sound fashion. And I think we see opportunities domestically to continue to do that.  Okay, thanks, everyone, for your ongoing interest in CVS. And as always, if you have any follow-up questions, you can reach Nancy. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference for today. We thank you for your participation. Have a great rest of the day, everyone.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the CVS Health Second Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Ms. Nancy Christal, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Nancy Christal : Thank you, LaTonya. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO, who'll provide a business update; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review our second quarter results as well as guidance for the third quarter and year. Jon Roberts, President of the PBM; and Helena Foulkes, President of the retail businesses are also with us today and they'll participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Now I have one key date to announce this morning. We plan to host our annual Analyst Day in New York City on the morning of Wednesday, December 16. At that time, you'll have the opportunity to hear from several members of our senior management team, who'll provide 2016 guidance as well as a comprehensive update on our strategies for growth. We plan to email invitations with more specific details later this month, so please save the date. Again, that's Wednesday, December 16, and if you don't receive an invitation by early September and would like to attend, please contact me. Also, please note that we posted a slide presentation on our website just prior to the start of this call. The slides summarize the information you'll hear today as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Additionally, our Form 10-Q will be filed later this afternoon, and it will be available on our website at that time. Please note that during today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings. During this call, we'll also use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance, including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of these non-GAAP items as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for 1 year. And now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo. Larry Merlo : Well, thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us, and I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the strong second quarter results we posted today. Adjusted earnings per share increased 7.7% to $1.22. That excludes $0.03 of acquisition-related transaction and financing costs, and it's $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. Operating profit in the retail business declined 1.4%, coming in better than expectations while reflecting the tougher comparison to last year. And operating profit in the PBM increased 7.1%, in line with expectations. We generated $523 million of free cash during the quarter and more than $2.1 billion year-to-date, keeping us on track to achieve our full year free cash flow goal and to continue to return significant value to our shareholders. Now given our outperformance this quarter, along with the previously announced acquisition-related decision to reduce this year's share repurchases by $1 billion, we are, once again, narrowing our guidance range. Excluding acquisition-related transaction and financing costs, we currently expect to achieve adjusted EPS for 2015 of $5.11 to $5.18, and that compares to our previous range of $5.08 to $5.19. And Dave will discuss this guidance in more detail during his financial review. Now let me provide a brief update on the status of our pending acquisitions before reviewing the performance of our business. In May, we announced we entered into an agreement to acquire Omnicare, the leading provider of pharmacy services to long-term care facilities. The Omnicare acquisition provides a new pharmacy dispensing channel for us, enhancing our ability to provide the continuity of care for patients as they transition through the health care system, and we remain very excited to assume leadership in this adjacent space. Omnicare also has a complementary specialty business that will augment our capabilities. Now as you know, the transaction is subject to approval by Omnicare shareholders as well as other customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval. Now we currently expect the deal to close prior to the end of this year, perhaps as early as the third quarter. However, for financial modeling purposes, we are still assuming the transaction closes near the end of 2015. In June, we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire Target's more than 1,660 pharmacies and approximately 80 clinics. This transaction enables us to reach more patients. It adds a new retail channel for our unique offerings, and it expands convenient options for consumers. The acquisition will expand our retail presence in new markets and enhance the health care experience for Target guests. So we're very excited to be partnering with Target, another iconic brand with complementary strengths and culture. And like the Omnicare deal, this transaction is also subject to customary closing conditions, including necessary regulatory clearance. And the timing of the close of the Target transaction is uncertain as it could fall into 2015 or '16. Now turning to the business update, and I'll start with the 2016 PBM selling season. The marketplace has been active. Overall RFP volume is consistent with last year, and I'm pleased to report that we are having a very successful selling season. Gross wins currently stand at approximately $12 billion, with net new business standing at approximately $11 billion. Now these new business numbers include estimated revenues based on current enrollment from the previously disclosed transition of the Coventry Med D business. These net new numbers do not include any impact from our individual Medicare Part D PDP, which I'll touch on in a few minutes. Now while our win span across client segments, a significant portion is in the health plan segment, demonstrating that our model is resonating strongly in that space. It's also important to note that the gross win revenue estimates for the health plans we've been awarded may be updated as a result of their Med D bid in open enrollment. So the revenue numbers I cited could change a bit based on those results. To date, we have completed nearly 60% of our client renewals for '16, that's pretty typical for this time of the year, and we have seen strong retention. Our specialty pharmacy suite of services continues to gain share. Our differentiated specialty offerings provide a high level of clinical support to patients, while allowing us to effectively manage trend for our clients. And with brand price increases and the accelerating growth in specialty, we are finding more clients receptive to our solutions that bend that cost curve. In the second quarter, we continue to grow faster than the market with specialty revenues increasing a healthy 28.4%. Now this growth is very robust. It more than doubled the market growth rate, but less than recent quarters as we have cycled the addition of Coram and have seen a flattening in the utilization trend of the new Hep C drugs. Our unique Specialty Connect offering continues to experience strong increases and prescription volumes, along with high satisfaction scores with patients, payers and providers. And you'll recall that Specialty Connect provides our patients with the choice to receive their specialty scripts either at a CVS pharmacy or from our mail center, while receiving the central clinical expertise that leads to better health outcomes no matter which channel they choose. And as a reminder, regardless of the delivery channel patients choose, all specialty revenues now flow through the PBM segment since that is where the actual fulfillment occurs. As you're aware, we've developed a comprehensive set of programs to effectively manage specialty trend. One important component is our leading formulary exclusions strategy, and we expect to employ similar strategies to manage the new class of cholesterol-lowering agents, the PCSK9 inhibitors. The potential size of the PCSK9 market is larger than any specialty product available today, and it's our job to deliver the lowest possible price and to help ensure that the right patients are receiving these medications. So we've developed a comprehensive approach to the management of this product class to ensure appropriate utilization and cost management for our clients and their members. And with our unmatched suite of assets, we can provide a completely integrated specialty patient experience in the most cost-effective way possible. Now let me also touch on our formulary strategy more broadly as our approach for traditional drug therapies also continues to be enhanced. Yesterday, we notified our clients that we will be removing 26 additional products from the 2016 standard formulary. Our guiding principles around formulary management include maintaining clinical integrity, reducing pharmacy costs for plan sponsors and effectively transitioning members onto the formulary. And our rigorous approach to formulary management has resulted in billions of dollars in savings for our clients. Our medical claims management capability through Novologix is also receiving notable interest. To date, we have about 18 million lives installed for editing or repricing with a significant amount of others being implemented or in discussion. Our infusion capabilities through Coram remain a significant differentiator with clients. Site of care management is a key component of managing costs for specialty patients, and we offer clients various solutions to help successfully manage those costs. Before turning to retail, let me touch briefly on our Med D PDP, SilverScript. We currently have about 3.4 million captive lives in our individual PDP, about 1.1 million captive EGWP lives, and we serve another 3.4 million lives through our health plan clients. So in total, we currently serve about 7.9 million Medicare Part D lives. Late last week, we received the preliminary benchmark results from CMS for 2016, and I'm pleased to report that SilverScript, once again, qualified in 32 of the 34 regions. And these strong benchmark results should enable us to retain the vast majority of the auto assignees we currently serve and it positions us well for future growth. So obviously, we're very pleased with these results. Now moving on to the retail business. Pharmacy same-store prescription volumes increased 4.8%, and that's on a 30-day equivalent basis, and we continue to gain pharmacy share. Our Retail Pharmacy market share was 21.6% in the quarter, and that's up about 60 basis points versus the same quarter the year ago. Pharmacy same-store sales increased 4.1% and were negatively impacted by about 370 basis points due to recent generic introductions and another 80 basis points from the implementation of Specialty Connect, which, again, transfers specialty scripts from our retail to our PBM segment. In the front store, comps were down 7.8% and on a comparable basis, front store sales would have been essentially flat after adjusting for the tobacco impact. And while we experienced a decrease in front store traffic, that was partially offset by an increase in the average customer basket. And once again, we gained share in our core health and beauty categories in both the drug and multi-outlet markets. We continue to focus on positioning ourselves as a leading health and beauty destination to drive profitable growth. And to date, we've expanded healthy snack food options in about 275 stores and our plan is to complete the healthy food rollout in about 450 stores by year-end. Now we are also upgrading the beauty departments in several thousand stores this year with the goal of positioning CVS as the leader in beauty. Early results in these stores have been very positive and we plan to expand our healthy food and elevated beauty programs in 2016. We've talked a lot about ExtraCare and ExtraCare continues to be an important driver of profitable front store growth. On a rolling 12-month basis through Q2, customers redeemed savings and ExtraBucks totaling more than $4 billion. Now we've been focused on delivering the right offer to the right customer at the right time and in the right channel. And digital and specifically mobile, are important tools in powering up our personalization efforts. We have an industry-leading, highly rated mobile app with the new and improved ExtraCare experience. And to date, more than 10 million customers have downloaded that app. Our front store margins in the quarter continued to benefit from the tobacco exit, along with an improved product mix. And on a comparable basis to last year, even after adjusting for the tobacco elimination, front store margins, once again, improved notably. Our store brand penetration continues to increase in the quarter, reaching 20.9% of front store sales, and that's up about 265 basis points from last year with about 120 basis points of that growth resulting from tobacco being excluded from the denominator. And we continue to see broad-based opportunities for further store brand penetration as we continue to make progress toward our 25% goal. Turning to our store growth for the quarter. We opened 25 new stores, relocated 16, closed 5, resulting in 20 net new stores, and we plan to add about 150 net new stores for the full year, equating to an anticipated increase in retail square footage growth of around 2%. As for MinuteClinic, we opened 11 net new clinics in the quarter, ending the quarter with 997 clinics across 31 states, plus the District of Columbia. Our revenues increased about 21% versus the same quarter last year, and we successfully completed our Epic electronic health record rollout to all MinuteClinics. And I think as you know, Epic enables us to interact with major health systems across the U.S. and it also supports the expansion of services as we can broadly expand access to patients with both minor and chronic conditions. And then just last month, we completed the first anniversary of our Red Oak Sourcing venture with Cardinal Health. Since its launch, Red Oak has established a best-in-class sourcing program. With its unparalleled expertise, the simplicity of its business structure and combined purchasing volume, the venture has enhanced supply chain efficiencies and helped spur innovative purchasing strategies with generic manufacturers. Folks at Red Oak are focused on the continuity of relationships with suppliers, which should serve as a strong foundation for the future. Now you may have heard on Cardinal's earnings call last week, due to the achievement of certain milestones, the quarterly payment from Cardinal to CVS Health will increase by $10 million in the third quarter of this year. This was contemplated in our guidance range, and we remain extremely pleased with the results. So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review. David Denton : Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. As I typically do, I'll begin today by highlighting how our disciplined approach to capital allocation continues to enhance shareholder value. I'll then follow that with a detailed review of our strong second quarter results as well as an update on our 2015 guidance. As you know, we announced 2 acquisitions and issued $15 billion in long-term debt just since our last earnings call. And as a result, there are many different numbers circulating in the marketplace. It's my goal this morning to provide you with some additional clarity with regard to the pending acquisitions in order to help you with your modeling in both the short and the medium term. So as it relates to our capital allocation program, let's begin with our dividend payout. We paid $395 million in dividends in the second quarter and $794 million year-to-date. Our dividend payout ratio stands at 28.1% over the trailing 4 quarters after excluding the impact of nonrecurring items in both years. We remain well on track to achieve our target of 35% by 2018. The $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we entered into during the first quarter concluded during Q2. In addition to the 16.8 million shares we've received in January, we received 3.1 million shares in May to conclude the agreement. In total for the first half of the year, we repurchased approximately 28.9 million shares for approximately $2.9 billion or $101.33 per share. For the full year, as we have noted, we expect to complete $5 billion of share repurchases. This reflects an increase of approximately 25% versus 2014 despite the $1 billion acquisition-related reduction to our share repurchase plans for this year. So between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned more than $3.7 billion to our shareholders in the first half of 2015 alone. And we currently expect to return more than $6 billion for the full year. As I said, we recently issued a series of senior notes totaling $15 billion. The tranches are well laddered. The terms range from 3 years to 30 years, and there is no 1 year in which the maturities are especially large. And despite rising interest rates over the past couple of months, we're able to secure the debt at a favorable blended rate of approximately 3.75%. So obviously, we're very pleased with the placement, and as we said previously, the net proceeds will be used to fund both our acquisitions and any remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. This new debt increases our leverage ratio to approximately 3.2x adjusted debt to EBITDA, and we are committed to getting back to our target of 2.7x. While we have not set a specific time line for achieving that level, our strong cash generation should enable us to do so in a reasonable amount of time. Moving on, as Larry said, we have generated more than $2.1 billion of free cash in the first 6 months of the year. We continue to expect -- to produce free cash of between $5.9 billion and $6.2 billion this year, excluding the impact of acquisition-related costs. Now turning to the income statement. Let me again -- let me note again that we did incur some acquisition-related costs throughout the quarter. In the few areas where these costs were incurred, I will quantify their impact on EPS. They are mainly within the Corporate segment and the interest expense line. So adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding acquisition-related costs, came in at $1.22 per share, $0.02 above our guidance range and up 7.7% over LY. We incurred approximately $0.03 of deal-related transaction and financing costs within the quarter. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.12 per share. The retail segment posted profit above the high end of expectations. The Corporate segment's expenses came in better than expected and the PBM segment posted solid numbers within our expectations. Much of the outperformance throughout the quarter was driven by lower-than-expected intercompany profit eliminations due to the mix of our business as well as a favorable tax rate. So with that, let me quickly walk you down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the second quarter increased 7.4% to $37.2 billion. In the PBM segment, revenues increased 11.9% to $24.4 billion. This increase was driven largely by growth in specialty pharmacy as well as an increase in pharmacy network claims. In addition to inflation, the growth in specialty was driven by increased claims due to new products, new clients and the impact of Specialty Connect. Partially offsetting this growth was an increase in our generic dispensing rate, which grew approximately 150 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 83.9%. In our retail business, revenues increased 2.2% in the quarter to $17.2 billion, just above the high end of our guidance. This growth was driven primarily by solid pharmacy same-store sales and healthy script growth despite the transition of specialty revenues into the PBM. Retail's generic dispensing rate also increased by approximately 150 basis points to 85%, which, as you know, dampens revenue growth. We saw strength on the top line at retail versus our guidance due primarily to the mix of pharmacy scripts. Turning to gross margin. We reported 17.2% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 105 basis points compared to Q2 of '14, but also in line with our expectations. In addition to each segment's performance, the decline is due in part to a mix shift in our business as our lower-margin PBM business continues to grow faster than our retail business. Keep in mind that margins in last year's second quarter benefited from the finalization of California's Medicaid reimbursement rates, and this intensifies the year-over-year decline. Recall that the finalization of these rates benefited retail gross margin by $53 million and PBM gross margins by $16 million in the second quarter of LY. Within the PBM segment, gross margin declined 40 basis points from Q2 of '14 to 5.1%. This is driven by the tough comparison with last year's second quarter due to the finalization of California's Medicaid rates as well as ongoing price compression. Those factors were partially offset by the improvement in GDR as well as favorable purchasing and rebate economics. Despite the decline in gross margin rate, gross profit dollars were up 3.8%. Gross margin in the retail segment was 30.9%, down approximately 55 basis points from LY. This was driven by the tough comparison with last year's second quarter, due, again, to the finalization of California's Medicaid rates, the continued pressure on pharmacy reimbursement rates and the continuing mix shift towards pharmacy. This margin pressure was partially offset by a number of positive factors, including the increase in GDR, favorable pharmacy purchasing economics, the benefit from front store margin rate from the tobacco exit and changes in the mix of front-end sales. And while gross margin rate was down, profit dollars did increase slightly in the quarter despite the impact from the tobacco exit. Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues improved by approximately 75 basis points from Q2 of '14 to 11.1%. The PBM segment SG&A rate improved by approximately 20 basis points to 1.2%, with growth in operating expense dollars in line with our expectations. As reported, operating expenses as a percent of sales in the retail segment improved by approximately 20 basis points to 21.1%. This improvement occurred despite the reduction in retail sales related to our decision to exit the tobacco category as well as the impact of Specialty Connect, which, as you know, shifts sales from our retail segment into the PBM segment. On a comparable basis, our sales leverage at retail actually improved approximately 60 basis points. Within the Corporate segment, expenses grew 4.6% to $215 million, driven by the acquisition-related transaction costs that were incurred throughout the quarter. These acquisition-related costs were approximately $0.01 dilutive to earnings per share. Excluding these costs, corporate expenses were better than expected, improving year-over-year. So with that, adding it all up, operating margin for the total enterprise declined approximately 30 basis points in the quarter to 6.1%. Operating margin in PBM declined approximately 15 basis points to 3.8%, while operating margin at retail declined approximately 35 basis points to 9.7%. As Larry noted, retail operating profit decreased 1.4% in the quarter and was better than our expectations. On a comparable basis, excluding the California Medicaid impact from last year's results as well as tobacco, retail operating profit growth would have been approximately 490 basis points higher, increasing approximately 3.5%. PBM operating profit increased 7.1%, in line with expectations. On a comparable basis, again, excluding the California Medicaid impact from last year's results, operating profit in the PBM would have been approximately 200 basis points higher, increasing more than 9%. Now going below the line on the consolidated income statement. Net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $8 million from LY to $166 million, again due primarily to the acquisition-related financing costs that were incurred throughout the quarter. These costs were associated with the bridge loan facility that we entered into in connection with the Omnicare transaction. In total, we paid approximately $52 million in fees, which were capitalized and amortized as interest expense over the period the bridge facility was outstanding. The facility expired in July when we issued $15 billion of senior notes. As a result, we reported amortization of the bridge loan fees of $36 million during the second quarter and the remaining amount will be recorded in the third quarter. Our effective tax rate was 39.3%, slightly lower than expected. The tax rate drove less than $0.01 of the EPS beat. Our weighted average share count was 1.1 billion shares, again in line with expectations. So with that, now let me update you on our guidance. I'll provide the highlights as well as some additional clarity on the impact of the pending acquisitions. You can find the additional details of our guidance in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning. Given our outperformance in the second quarter and the reduction in the share repurchases planned for this year, we are narrowing our range for 2015 adjusted earnings per share by raising the bottom of the range by $0.03 and bringing the top end down by $0.01. So we now expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in '15 in the range of $5.11 to $5.18 per share, excluding any acquisition-related transaction and financing costs. This guidance reflects strong year-over-year growth of 13.75% to 15.25%, again, after removing the impact in 2014 related to the loss on the early extinguishment of debt. As Larry said, for modeling purposes, we assume that the Omnicare acquisition closes near the end of 2015. The timing of the close of the Target transaction is a bit more uncertain as it could fall into 2015 or into 2016. With that as context, there are a couple of things to keep in mind regarding this guidance : First, it includes the impact of the $1 billion reduction in share buybacks this year. Second, it excludes any operating results generated by Omnicare or the Target asset as well as any integration costs that may be incurred. And finally, it also excludes any deal-related transaction and financing costs. Obviously, there are several moving parts that I want to quickly walk you through, so it might be helpful to review Slide #29 from the slide deck that we posted on our website early this morning, which provides a helpful summary of all the puts and takes. Currently, we have recorded approximately $0.01 in transaction costs, and we expect to incur another $0.03 to $0.05 this year, depending on whether -- on which year the Target acquisition falls into. We've also incurred about $0.02 in financing costs associated with the bridge facility. And we are forecasting another $0.13 of net interest expense related to the bridge as well as the placement of the senior notes last month. So in total, this guidance excludes $0.19 to $0.21 in deal-related transaction and financing cost. My intention with the pending acquisitions is to provide guidance that includes those businesses at some point after each deal closes, once we've had the opportunity to better forecast their underlying business performance. So our core business is performing well and this revised guidance reflects just that. All-in GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.64 to $4.71 a share. Net revenue growth is expected to be a bit stronger in both the PBM and retail segments. As a result, consolidated net revenue growth is now expected to be 7.5% to 8.5%. We expect PBM revenue growth of 11.5% to 12.5%, 25 basis points higher than our prior guidance. This revised guidance reflects our expectation for stronger network volumes, so we are also increasing our adjusted claims expectation to a range of 1.15 billion claims to 1.16 billion claims. Additionally, we have increased our expectations in the retail segment and now expect revenue growth of 2.5% to 3.25% year-over-year. This guidance mainly reflects our revised expectations for a slightly lower generic dispensing rate for the full year due to some timing shifts in the generic marketplace. Given PBM performance to date and higher volumes, we are also narrowing and increasing guidance for operating profit growth in our PBM segment. We now expect PBM operating profit to increase 10% to 12% year-over-year, an increase of 225 basis points on the low end and 125 basis points on the top. And given that the increase in retail revenue outlook is due largely to fewer generics than expected, we're trending our operating profit growth expectations to a range of 4.25% to 5.5%. And as I said before, we continue to expect to produce free cash of between $5.9 billion to $6.2 billion this year, excluding the impact of acquisition-related costs. So with that, let me provide guidance for the third quarter. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.27 to $1.30 per share in the third quarter, reflecting year-over-year growth of 10.5% to 13.5%, after removing the impact in Q3 of '14 related to the loss on early extinguishment of debt. As with the full year, this excludes all deal-related costs. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing ops is expected to be in the range of $1.13 per share to $1.16 per share within the third quarter. Within the retail segment, we expect revenues to increase 2.75% to 4.25% versus the third quarter of LY. Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 4.75% to 5.75%, while we expect total same-store sales to be up 1% to 2.5%. On September 3, we'll mark the anniversary of our exit from tobacco, so we'll see a negative impact on front store comps during the first 2 months of the quarter. So sequentially, revenue growth is expected to improve. We expect the negative impact on front store comps in the third quarter to be approximately 500 basis points. In the PBM, we expect third quarter revenue growth of between 9% and 10.25%, driven by continued strong growth in specialty and network volumes. We expect retail operating profit to increase 4% to 6% and PBM operating profit to increase 2% to 6% within the third quarter. During the course of the year, we have been highlighting several timing factors that affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout this year. Factors that are expected to impact the cadence the most include the timing of break-open generics, our tobacco exit and the investments we made in the PBM's welcome season. And while we delivered a very strong first half, quite frankly above our own expectations, the cadence of profit growth is still expected to be back-half weighted. So all things considered, we continue to expect a strong back half of the year and especially the fourth quarter. So in closing, I'll leave you with 4 key thoughts : First, we posted very strong growth year-to-date. Second, our 2015 outlook for each business and the enterprise overall is strong, and we continue to benefit from the unique solutions we're delivering in the marketplace. Third is our pending acquisitions supplement our base businesses and set us up nicely for continued strong growth well beyond 2015. And finally, we expect to continue to generate significant free cash, and we are committed to using these assets to maximize the value we return to our shareholders through a disciplined approach to capital allocation. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry. Larry Merlo : Okay, thanks, Dave. Well, I think you can hear that we're certainly pleased with our continued strong performance in the second quarter, the outlook that we have for the rest of the year and certainly, the opportunities the announced acquisitions will present for future growth. And with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Obviously, another great PBM selling season. Larry, if you or Jon can maybe just talk about 2 things around that, the selling season. One, Larry, I think you characterized it as being fairly typical from what you've seen over the last few years, but you continue to win a lot of business. Can you talk about maybe what's helped you to win this year? And then secondly, just help us to understand how do we think about the setup going into 2016 as it pertains to plan design. Are we seeing more people adopt your formulary? Are we seeing more people adopt specialty? Like, how do we think about it as we're thinking about how that sets up for 2016? Larry Merlo : Yes, Lisa, I'll take the first question and I'll ask Jon to comment in more specifics around your second question. But yes, Lisa, I think the success that we're continuing to see, it really reflects our integrated model. And I think as we've talked in the past, you got to be right on price, you got to be right on service, but once we get past that, we've got an awful lot of differentiation that is resonating for clients across all the sectors. And I mentioned in our prepared remarks that the success this particular selling season has been more skewed with the health plan segment, those -- the health plans probably represent around 80% of the gross business wins of the $12 billion. And obviously, we're pleased with those results. And I'll ask Jon to take a deeper dive in terms of more specifics. Jonathan Roberts : Yes. So Lisa, if -- let me focus and start with health plans. They have multiple lines of business : They have commercial. They have Medicare. They have Managed Medicaid and exchanges. And we see different priorities based on the health plans business makeup of those 4 lines of business. And if you start with -- health plans want to be competitive in the marketplace. They want competitive pricing and high levels of service. And clearly, these are areas that we've consistently delivered in over last several years. We've been predictable, consistent and stable, and this is an important area as health plan clients evaluate their options in the market. Most health plans' biggest challenge is in the government space, and we bring a lot of expertise in both Medicaid and Medicare. And we provide advisory and consultative services that help them manage and build competitive government programs. So as an example, we provide programs to support their Star measures and we also help them design their formularies and benefit designs for Medicare. The other top priority for health plans is specialty, and we have the most comprehensive suite of solutions to help manage their spend and their specialty members across both the pharmacy and medical benefit. And we've talked in the past about Specialty Connect, Coram, Novologix, Accordant and MinuteClinic. And then we also offer many robust clinical programs that integrate into their clinical strategies and help overall medical costs. So we're able to provide value beyond just pharmacy cost management. We've also been very successful in the employer and state government space and these clients have embraced our integrated model and all the value we're able to bring them and their members. So we continue to be successful in the market and win new business because of the value and support we're able to bring clients and their members. If we talk about what are we seeing from a plan design, maybe I'll focus on the new business wins that we're bringing on this year. And if we start with the employers that are coming onboard 116 [ph], we're seeing very high adoption of our programs, such as Maintenance Choice, exclusive specialty with Specialty Connect, formulary program with exclusions. And we're also seeing very strong adoption of our integrated offerings as well as our cost management solutions. Health plans, which Larry mentioned, is about 80% of our gross wins. We see a very different dynamic across those 4 lines of business that I mentioned. For Medicare, we see very strong alignment with our Med D formulary and preferred network options. For Managed Medicaid, we see adoption of narrow networks. For commercial plans, they pretty much bring them over as is because they need to work with their downstream clients or state insurance commission, so there's more of a lag, but we do see interest in Maintenance Choice, formulary, narrowing of their specialty providers and in some cases, narrowing their networks. But it usually takes a year or 2 to implement. And for exchanges, we see adoption of our formulary and strong interest in network solutions. So with double-digit trend combined with the need to be competitive in the B2C lines of business for health plans, we expect to see high levels of interest and adoption for our programs across our book of business. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : Lisa has -- kind of took the one I was going to ask. But I wanted to talk about Target, and this is really for Jon. When you think of bringing those pharmacies in and how it works with the PBM side of the business, can you talk us through kind of your thought process? And what that does for you as maybe you enter the '17 selling season? Larry Merlo : Well, Scott, it's Larry. I think as we talked when we announced the Target acquisition, obviously, it expands our reach in new geographies : largely west of the Mississippi, certainly the Pacific Northwest. So I think from a PBM point of view, where we did not have good geographic representation, I think that certainly goes a long way to fill that void. And at the same time, it opens up another channel for consumers, and it opens up the different ways, in which we can offer our unique and integrated clinical programs, whether it's Pharmacy Advisor or -- Scott, you've heard us talk about the things that we've done that we've been able to demonstrate in improving access. We're also able to reduce overall costs. So we think it becomes an important solution to some of the challenges that our health care system faces today around access, quality and cost. Scott Mushkin : And then as -- maybe as a follow-up. The intercompany eliminations, I think, Dave, you talked about as being one of the reasons that drove the outperformance. It seemed like the revenue was really strong on that line, but the profitability isn't. And obviously, one of the successes of CVS is the integrated model. How are we supposed to think about the intercompany eliminations on the profit side being maybe a little bit less help profits? Is this a problem? Or is this just kind of the cadence of the business? David Denton : Scott, this is Dave. This is just the cadence of the business. This is just a -- we forecast that on a quarterly basis and quite frankly, just the mix of scripts and how they flow through the PBM and how they flow through retail, which is off just a tick. So there's no underlying concern there. No worries. Scott Mushkin : Should we key more in the revenue line given the changes that are taking place, especially with the specialty going over to the PBM? David Denton : Yes. I think you kind of -- actually, you have to look at both because just with inflation, you can get a false positive or negative based on -- we could have share capture that's disproportionate. But with the generic influx or generic cadence, it could affect that line a bit, so I'd look at both, quite frankly. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : I guess, sticking with that theme, just going back to the net new number. Obviously, pretty big season even if we account for the Coventry contribution. I was just curious, Larry or Dave, any more insight you can share with where the business is coming from? I guess if we think about -- are these clients -- it sounds like more on the health plan side. Are they clients switching from other PBMs? Or are you seeing any other change in behavior, maybe more folks carving out the pharmacy benefit? Just trying to get a sense of where all the net new is coming from for you guys. Larry Merlo : Bob, it's Larry. I mean, you're right. We said about 80% of the gross wins is coming out of the health plan segment. The vast majority of that is clients switching PBM. I think Jon touched on some of the key elements earlier, that when you look at the makeup of the health plan business, and you think about commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, exchange products, we can bring solutions in a very differentiated way for each of those segments within the health plan. And I think that's -- I think once again, it's the model resonating with those clients in terms of we can satisfy differentiated needs within that particular health plan's book of business. Robert Jones : I guess, as my quick follow-up then on the PBM. If I look at the profit from this quarter, up 9%, Dave, you mentioned in your remarks that you guys are guiding for gross profit growth in the 2% to 6% range, I believe, for 3Q. Just curious, what's driving that slowdown? Anything that was already kind of thought of in guidance as far as the cadence of profit growth from quarter-to-quarter? David Denton : Yes, really, there's a couple of things that happened. As you know, that our profits in the PBM has typically been a little lumpy quarter-over-quarter based on how we performed in Medicare. So you see the timing shift a bit based on where we hit the reinsurance levels, number one. And that's kind of common and it's hard to predict, number one. Number two, as we ramp into the back half of this year, we're overlapping the introduction of Hep C and overlapping the rebate performance in that category and other categories within specialty. Operator : Our next question comes from Edward Kelly with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Edward Kelly : So Larry, your success in the selling season obviously doesn't go unnoticed. I mean, have you seen any behavioral changes this season from competition that might be worth mentioning at all? Larry Merlo : Ed, there's nothing that is top of mind when you ask that question. I mean, as we've talked for the last couple of years, the marketplace remains competitive. And as I just mentioned in response to Lisa's question, you got to be right on pricing services, the ticket to the game. And then, I think our differentiated model comes into play in a very healthy way after that. Edward Kelly : All right. Then maybe just as a quick follow-up here. You've been fairly active on the M&A front recently. Larry, could you just maybe take a step back and kind of assess sort of like where you are today post the Omnicare and Target relative to -- really think relative to where you want to be, I guess, longer term in the evolving landscape? Are there still gaps or opportunities to sort of think about? Larry Merlo : Well, Ed, I think that as we've talked about the strategy -- and again, Nancy touched on Analyst Day and we'll talk more about this in December. But we think that we have a unique opportunity with health care becoming more consumer directed. And you think about the fact that we've got broad capabilities today, whether you're talking about retail, PBM, specialty, infusion, medical claims management, MinuteClinic and soon, long-term care that we can manage the consumer, the patient through the continuum of their health care life cycle, if you will. So Ed, I think we feel pretty good about where we are today. And obviously, we'll look to continue to add to that list of ways in which we can serve the patient and connect the dots, so to speak. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Eric Bosshard : Curious on the reimbursement rate environment on the pharmacy side of the business, what trends you're seeing there. And as we look forward, what your outlook is on gross margin on the retail side. David Denton : Eric, this is Dave. Maybe I'll just talk about it a bit. I think that there's a couple of things that are occurring. I think not so much if you look at gross margin. As I said, in my prepared remarks, there's been a little bit of shift in the, I'll say, the availability of generic drugs into the marketplace that are in a break-open status, and so that has influenced a bit our gross margin and the gross margin performance, both the first half of the year and more importantly, the back half of the year. I do think if you look at the reimbursement trends in the marketplace, as we have said many times, there continues to be reimbursement pressure in the marketplace. We don't see that abating, and it continues to occur, and I think we expect that to continue to occur, not only this year, but as we look out into the future. And if you look at our -- if you step back a second and you look at our 5-year targets that we've established, we've always talked about the fact that revenue is going to grow faster than operating profit, implying margin compression. And part of that is due to the reimbursement intensity in the marketplace, and we think that's going to continue. Eric Bosshard : Great. And if I could have just one follow-up. You worked through the exit from tobacco pretty effectively to continue to do what you're doing with profits in that business with less sales. Curious if there's any plans as we move forward incrementally for what to do with that space? Or if there's anything else in the front end that you're aspiring to move towards as you move away from that or as you've moved away from that? Helena Foulkes : Sure, this is Helena. I think -- and you'll hear us talk more about it at Analyst Day, but we've been really focused on becoming the leading health and beauty destination. I think when we made that tobacco announcement, it really forced us to step back and say, \"What do we want to be for the consumer? Where do we want to win?\" And so we've developed a 5-part strategy. The first is around better health made easy and this relates to the healthy food section that Larry talked about. The second is around elevating beauty, and Larry mentioned that as well. The third is around customer-driven personalization. We have a leading head start, obviously, with ExtraCare, but we see a tremendous opportunity to be even more relevant and targeted in our go-forward strategy. The fourth of these is around what we call myCVS Health, and it's really tailoring our offering for the marketplace we're serving on a local basis. And so, for example, if you look at the acquisition of Navarro a year ago, we have done a lot to learn from that acquisition. We've, in fact, reset 12 stores -- CVS stores in Miami around that acquisition, and we're very encouraged. It's certainly too early to share results, but very encouraged by what we see as an opportunity with the Hispanic customer. And then the fifth component of it is all around digital innovation. So I think that the good news is the team really did a great job stepping back and thinking forward to where we want to be, how we want to win. And if you are able to get into these 275 stores where we've reset them with healthy foods, they're really a good example, I think, of what the future path is for us. You get a very different feeling in the front of our store around healthy food and the beauty experience is quite elevated. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS. Steven Valiquette : So one other question here just on the PBM selling season. Obviously, $12 billion gross wins' a pretty monster number. The WellCare group at their analyst meeting back in February, they disclosed their PBM spend was exceeding $6 billion and approaching $7 billion. And then the PBM on the other end of the Coventry book has suggested that Medicare piece is worth about $3 billion. So just curious whether you share those views or if you have different numbers. And then also, with your comment about the health plans being roughly 80%, or maybe over 80% of the total, just curious if you isolate just your results in the commercial market, just want to confirm whether or not your wins were net positive for 2016. David Denton : Steve, maybe I'll start here. We're not at liberty to talk about revenue per client, so I can't really confirm that at this point in time. But obviously, the bulk of our wins, as we cycle into '16, are within the health plan segment and our products and services continue to resonate there. On the commercial side, I guess, you're asking from a commercial standpoint if we have net wins versus net losses. Is that's the question? Steven Valiquette : Correct. Jonathan Roberts : Is that in the employer segment, Steve, you're talking about? Steven Valiquette : Yes, just employer. You're correct, yes. Jonathan Roberts : It's still early because we still are 60% through the renewal season, so we'll talk about that in December Analyst Day and talk about the makeup of our wins and losses. And then you'll be able to net it out at that point, yes. David Denton : But as we stand here today, just to be clear, as we stand here doing today, we are in a net win position within the employer/commercial market. Steven Valiquette : Okay. One other real quick one. Just the 2016 formulary was obviously just only announced. And I'm curious though, if you do go back several years ago, it did seem that formulary changes used to be viewed maybe with some mixed emotions by clients, maybe even a bit of negativity. But I'm just curious now, do you think clients are more receptive to these formulary exclusions today versus historically because perhaps, client are more conscious of the savings potential. Just kind of curious to get your thoughts on that. Now it seems like these are viewed more positively than negatively versus history. Larry Merlo : And Steve, I think you're absolutely right, and keep in mind that we were first to market with the formulary strategy. And you're right, it was met with the mixed beliefs that you acknowledged. I think that over the past 4 years, we've demonstrated to clients and their members that not only is it a cost-savings opportunity, but at the same time, equally if not more important, we can manage their members in a seamless fashion. And none of this is disruptive to the continuity of care. So I think it is becoming -- it is getting more focused. And as there becomes more opportunities in the specialty space, that just adds to the dialogue. Operator : Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : And Larry, I wanted to talk a little bit more about Retail Pharmacy consolidation. You've seen managed care consolidate up around the industry pretty quick, and the PBM industry has consolidated up now basically into 3 large vendors. You guys made an interesting move with the Target transaction. I just -- I wanted to ask what you think is the capacity for further retail pharmacy consolidation. Can the market consolidate to a point where you get some type of competitive balance for the retailers versus the payers? Larry Merlo : Well, George, when you look at the retail pharmacy landscape, keep in mind, there continues to be more than 60,000 pharmacies operating across the country. And that number has not changed in a significant way over the last couple of years to include the role that the independents play and the independents continue to grow. So I don't -- I think for us, the Target acquisition, as we talked earlier on the question, it became an exciting opportunity to increase our geographic presence in a very, very capital-efficient way. And we've got -- we're excited about the opportunities. George Hill : Okay, I guess, maybe then a quick follow-up would just be, do you expect more opportunities like Target to present themselves? And then, given what you guys know, if you look at the companies that compete in the pharmacy space outside of the big retail pharmacies, given that Target was losing money, can you imagine that any of these guys are making much money in pharmacy? David Denton : George, this is Dave. It's kind of hard to speculate on that. I would just say that our focus, first and foremost, is to execute against the pending acquisition, roll out our products and services in a way that puts our clinical programs into the hands of more members as they shop this new and exciting channel. And to work, as Larry said before, to reduce cost, to improve access and to improve the health outcomes of the patients that we serve. And that continues to be our focus right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America. Robert Willoughby : A specific one for Jon. We heard from a competitor last night who pointed to continuing opportunities in open specialty pharmacy networks. But with your $12 billion of gross PBM wins, have you noticed any interest in narrowing the specialty pharmacy networks, in particular? Jonathan Roberts : Well, when you look at the employer wins, most of the employers actually come with us exclusively for specialty. And with health plans, they typically have multiple vendors, but we are seeing a move, even for health plans, to narrow it from say, 3 or 4 or 5 vendors down to somewhat less, and they get better pricing and better clinical program execution. And so we do have -- we do business with many health plans, where we're not the PBM, and stand-alone specialty. And that business for us continues to grow so -- and we'll continue to pursue it. Robert Willoughby : Okay. And just as it relates to the Cardinal relationship, what opportunities do you see to expand the areas in which you're working? Larry Merlo : Well, Bob, it's Larry. As I've mentioned, I think the team has done an awful lot of work in a pretty short period of time in the first year. And certainly, we're always looking to work in terms of how we can create additional value for the business and our customers. And I don't know that there is anything on the horizon that we can talk about right now. But certainly, I think the Red Oak team will have an ongoing focus in terms of how they can create additional value. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles Rhyee : Just maybe one just quick clarification from Dave. Just in the guidance, just to be clear, you're excluding the financing cost. But we are including just the incremental fixed expense from the new issuance on the debt, right? David Denton : No, I'm excluding both. I'm excluding both the bridge facility cost as well as the incremental debt that we took on in relation to financing the acquisitions. In effect, Slide 29 gives that nice little, I'll say, walk forward of all those components. Operator : Our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Priya Ohri-Gupta: Dave, I think this is a question that I continue to get and it would be helpful if you could maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of how we should be thinking about a reasonable amount of time for you to get back to 2.7x. Should we be thinking about a sort of 2- to 3-year time frame? Or should we potentially be thinking about 3 to 5 years? David Denton : Great. That's a great question. I have not specified that time line specifically. And unfortunately, I'm not going to do that today. I do expect that -- obviously, we're at 3.2x. Our objective, obviously, is to get to 2.7x, and we're going to do that in a reasonable, modest fashion to get us back down into that zip code. And I -- but I haven't set a specific time line, and I don't really expect to do so. I will update the market as we continue to progress on this and make sure that there's clarity from that perspective on where we stand. Operator : Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. John Heinbockel : So 2 things on the selling season. Number one, can you tell how much the ongoing consolidation in the PBM space may have helped you this selling season with the health plans? And if not, does that lie in front of us for next year? And then secondly, if you look at the first year margin right on the $11 billion and how that would compare to prior years, is it very similar? Or just because of the magnitude of some of these plans, maybe it's a bit lower than prior years. Larry Merlo : Yes, John, it's Larry. Let me take the first part, then I'll ask Dave to comment on the second question in there a bit. John, I think as you look at the timing of the selling season, I think this particular '16 selling season was really unaffected by some of the M&A activities that occurred. So I think that, that opportunity is in front of us as we soon -- well, in some respects, we've already begun on '17 when you think about some of the health plan clients out there. David Denton : And then as it relates to, I guess, the profitability or the margin of those new clients, John, as typical, new clients when they come on as a new PBM book of business, they come on a very thin margin. And the objective that we have is, over time, is really twofold : is to sell in our programs and products that drive additional performance within the PBM; but probably as importantly, work to drive adherence programs into one of our dispensing channels to ultimately improve the outcomes of the patients and members that we serve. And so you'll see them come on thin. You'll see them grow over time, and that -- we expect that trend to continue as we cycle into this selling season, as we implement that into 2016. John Heinbockel : All right. And then secondly, right, if you look at pharmacy traffic versus front end, right, so pharmacy, obviously, growing a bit faster. And I know you're doing things on the merchandising and marketing side. But when you think about conversion of pharmacy customers to front end and maybe even on that same trip, is there opportunity there, whether it's -- I don't know if it's operational or something else on that trip convert some more of that pharmacy traffic to front-end business? Or not really, right, because of drive-through and other factors. Helena Foulkes : Yes, I think there always is. I mean, look, when I said before that we're really focused on health and beauty, health is critical because when the consumer thinks about us, she's really thinking about all her health care needs. And so, in particular, we look at people who are chronic customers and think about all the ways that we can serve them in our stores. For example, the work that we're doing on store brands is really important to people who have a lot of health issues and are worried about how to maintain good health and save money with high-quality products. So I think a big part of our focus and effort is on how to make the front store an extension of the pharmacy experience. And obviously, the outcome of that is driving higher sales as it relates to serving those patients. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Mark Wiltamuth : Just want to get a little update on your thoughts on the generic wave into 2016. We've now had some of the wildcards on multi-source break opens resolved. And also, if you could give a little update on what you're seeing on generic cost inflation? David Denton : Well, maybe I'll talk a bit about the availability of generics. It's been a little lighter than we thought, and we're forecasting them to be a little lighter going forward over the next several periods. And that's really driven by the availability of break-open generics where there's multiple suppliers in the marketplace, which as you know, where there's multiple suppliers in the marketplace, that allows us to reduce our cost of goods sold. And we see that cycling both the back half of this year and potentially to 2016. We'll update you a lot more on Analyst Day as we'll have a better picture of what 2016 looks like. As far as generic inflation, I think it's -- the overall marketplace continues from a generic perspective to be deflationary in totality, and we -- that has been true throughout the year and we expect that to be true as we forecast out the balance of this year. I think just in general, generic inflation has been modest this year as we -- as it compared to, I'll say, last year at this point in time. Mark Wiltamuth : So you're saying on the availability break up is that it's a little softer now, and you're going to cycle out of that and a better outlook into 2016. David Denton : Yes, I don't know about 2016. I just -- it's unclear at this point in time how 2016 shapes up in the sense of how those new generics come to marketplace -- come into the market. So we'll have more to say about that when we get to Analyst Day, because we'll have a better view of the cadence of that. Operator : The next question comes from David Larson with Leerink Partners. David Larsen : Can you please talk about your relationship with Aetna and a potential Humana transaction, and sort of the incremental value you might be able to bring to the combined enterprise? And then just any thoughts on Humana's relationship with Walmart and their low-priced PDP plan. Larry Merlo : David, it's Larry. Well, we certainly can't talk about Humana's relationship with Walmart, okay? That would be a question for them. But to your first question, I think as everyone's aware, we have a 12-year strategic agreement with Aetna. It runs through December 2022, and Aetna has termination rights beginning in January 2020, as has been disclosed. And we've got a very strong working relationship with Aetna. We work closely. We'll continue to work closely and I think we brought value to their business and their clients in a very differentiated way. And I think that the fact that we have a singular focus on pharmacy and for many of the reasons that we've been talking about on the call : the innovation that we bring, the scale that we have, we're the largest purchaser of generics, the integrated model that brings solutions to access quality and outcomes and the broad capabilities that we have, I think that it puts us in a very, very good position. I think there could -- there's the possibility that folks could be thinking about insourcing their PBM. But I think when you consider all of those factors, I think it creates a suboptimal situation for them. David Larsen : Would you be able to create or maintain a unique network in -- the Walmart PDP remains in place? Larry Merlo : Well, if you look at the makeup of the PBM network today, Walmart's an important provider in that space. So I wouldn't see any barrier to the role that Walmart plays as an important pharmacy provider. Thanks, everyone. And listen, I know this was a rather lengthy call today. Obviously, we had a lot to talk about. There are, as Dave outlined, there are a lot of moving parts, and we've done our very best on those slides to show you the variables that are in play. And obviously, if you have any follow-up questions, you can contact Nancy. So thanks, again, everybody. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a great day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Nancy Christal, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Nancy R. Christal: Thanks, Christine. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Jon Roberts, President of CVS/caremark; and Helena Foulkes, President of CVS/pharmacy, are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up so we can provide more people with the chance to ask their questions. I have one important reminder today. Our Annual Analyst and Investor Day is scheduled for the morning of Wednesday, December 16 in New York City. At that time, you'll have the opportunity to hear from several members of our senior management team, who'll provide detailed 2016 guidance, as well as a comprehensive update on our strategies for growth. If anyone has signed up and is no longer planning to attend, we'd greatly appreciate it if you could let us know as soon as possible so that we can include others who would like to attend given our limited seating. Keep in mind that our Analyst Day will be webcast to provide access to anyone who is unable to be there in person. If you have any questions about this event, please contact me. We look forward to seeing many of you there. This morning, we posted a slide presentation on our website, which I think you will find helpful. This slide summarizes the information in our prepared remarks, as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Later this afternoon, we'll be filing our Form 10-Q and it will also be available on our website at that time. Please note that during today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking statements within the meanings of the federal securities laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings, including the risk factor section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings. During this call, we'll use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance, including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of these non-GAAP items, as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year. And now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Well, thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm very pleased with the solid third quarter results we posted today. Revenues increased 10.3%, while adjusted earnings per share increased 12.5% to $1.29, coming in at the higher end of our guidance range. And adjusted EPS excludes any acquisition-related items, consistent with how we provided guidance. And Dave will cover how you should be modeling our adjusted EPS for the rest of the year now that the Omnicare acquisition has closed. For those of you who may not be aware, I'm pleased to announce that Rocky Kraft, previously CFO of Omnicare, is now the President of our Long-Term Care Pharmacy group and you'll have an opportunity to hear from Rocky at our Analyst Day. In the third quarter, excluding transaction and integration costs, operating profit in the Retail Long-Term Care business increased 8.4%, while operating profit in the Pharmacy Services Segment increased 7%. Now those numbers do include Omnicare's operating results as of August 18. On an underlying basis, versus our guidance, excluding the acquisition, Retail operating profit growth was in line with expectations, while the PBM was just above our guidance range. We generated approximately $1.3 billion of free cash during the quarter, $3.4 billion year-to-date, enabling us to continue to return significant value to our shareholders. Now given our solid performance this quarter and the closing of the Omnicare transaction, we are narrowing our guidance range by raising the lower end. We currently expect to achieve adjusted EPS for 2015 of $5.14 to $5.18. And this guidance includes the Omnicare operations and the debt we issued in July. It excludes acquisition-related bridge financing, transaction and integration costs. And Dave will provide more detail during his financial review. Before providing a business update, acknowledging the complexities in modeling our business, as a result of two acquisitions, we want to provide you with some early clarity for 2016. We outlined it in this morning's press release and I'm going to turn it over to Dave to cover the details. David M. Denton: Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. As you know, there are a lot of moving parts in our business, especially with the recent debt financing, the timing of the Omnicare acquisition and the pending acquisition of Target pharmacies. So this morning, I'm going to try to help you model the company and level-set our expectations for next year starting with a wider-than-normal EPS range. We'll provide detailed guidance as usual on Analyst Day once our comprehensive plan is finalized. Back in December of 2013, we provided our five-year financial targets, which included many assumptions. We said that we expect our top-line to grow faster than our operating profit, suggesting continued margin compression. And we said that our growth strategy is to focus on winning lives and gaining share across the enterprise to offset those pressures, and that we assumed that we would continue to gain share in our core business and make value-enhancing acquisitions to accomplish these targets. We also said that we would employ a disciplined approach to capital allocation that would further enhance our EPS growth rate and we reiterated those expectations at our last Analyst Day. And none of that has changed. From our jump-off point of $3.96 in 2013, we said that we would target adjusted EPS to grow 10% to 14% on average from 2013 through 2018. Today, we are providing a preliminary outlook for 2016 in the range of $5.68 to $5.88, reflecting growth in adjusted EPS of approximately 10% to 14% in 2016, again, right in line with our five-year compounded annual growth rate target using the $5.16 midpoint of our 2015 guidance range. Now, if you look at our cumulative performance from our jump-off point in 2013, we are tracking to the higher end of our targets with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 13% to 14% from 2013 through 2016. Our preliminary outlook for 2016 assumes the completion of the Target pharmacy acquisition near the end of 2015 and excludes any integration and transaction costs associated with both the Omnicare and Target acquisitions, again, consistent with our prior comments. Our preliminary outlook also assumes that we complete $4 billion in share repurchases in 2016. We can't provide all the usual guidance details today since we haven't finalized our comprehensive 2016 plan, but let me highlight some of the key factors to keep in mind as you begin to review your models. The Omnicare business, which we acquired in mid-August, is split across our segments. As noted in our press release today, the long-term care operations, commercialization services, supply chain solutions and patient support services within Omnicare are included in our newly-named Retail Long-Term Care Segment. And Omnicare specialty business is included in the Pharmacy Services Segment. While it is early, we remain very optimistic about Omnicare. Consistent with our previously-stated expectations, we expect Omnicare to be approximately $0.20 accretive to our earnings per share in 2016, excluding any transaction and integration costs. Additionally, for modeling purposes, we are assuming the acquisition of Target pharmacies and clinics closes near the end of this year. And again, as previously stated, we expect the acquisition of Target pharmacies and clinics to be approximately $0.06 dilutive to adjusted earnings per share in 2016. Those expectations are included in our preliminary outlook for next year. As laid out in the slides that we posted on our website when we announced the deal, this includes accretion from operating the pharmacies and clinics, which will be more than offset by the impact of the previously-announced reduction in 2015 share repurchases, as well as financing costs. And once again, it excludes any transaction and integration costs. Overall, we expect the total enterprise to deliver operating profit growth in the mid-to-high single digits in 2016. Recall that we are focused on an integrated enterprise strategy to drive long-term growth and we believe our channel-agnostic approach and our enhanced ability with Omnicare to both maintain and grow our share across the entire continuum of care will enable us to continue to drive enterprise growth. We expect the Retail Long-Term Care Segment to deliver growth and operating profit in the mid-single digits in 2016. In Retail, we continue to grow and gain share. At the same time, we continue to be faced with margin compression, which comes from two main sources. One is the mix shift of our business toward lower-margin lines of business, mainly Medicare and Medicaid. And the other is the ongoing reimbursement pressure from payers. Note that while reimbursement pressure continues, it is not accelerated and the typical offsets across our business do ebb and flow over time. As for the PBM segment, we expect to deliver growth in operating profit in the high-single to low-double digits in 2016, including Omnicare specialty business. As you know, in addition to the usual margin compression, we won a significant amount of new business for 2016 and about 80% of our gross new business is in the health plan space. Typically, year one of a contract has fair margins, and health plans typically have lower margins than other lines of business because they typically don't adopt all of our unique programs that help drive cost savings for clients right away. In fact, they're sold in over time. As an example, when an employer client, they can make a decision to offer Maintenance Choice for its membership with a stroke of a pen, the health plan client has to sell these unique offerings throughout their book of business, account-by-account. A good way to think about all this is that reimbursement and pricing pressure is immediate, while share gains occur over time. So overall, the Pharmacy Services Segment will also see margin compression in 2016, but continued share gains and operating profit growth. So you need to keep all these factors in mind as you firm up your models for next year. We have long believed that we would need to offset ongoing margin pressures by winning lives, gaining an increased share of wallet and growing our enterprise share. We are pleased to continue to deliver growth at our targeted rates. We continue to grow and gain share, both organically and through acquisitions, again in line with our long-term financial targets. And so with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry and I'll come back for the rest of my financial review in a few moments. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thanks, Dave. I think you can see that 2016 is shaping up to be a very good year. Our long-term outlook remains strong and we remain confident in the multi-year targets that we provided at previous analyst days. And consistently growing an organization of this size at this very healthy pace is really a testament to the quality of our people, and I want to take a minute to thank everyone in the CVS Health family for their contributions and dedication. So with that, let me update you on current developments in the business. Turning to the PBM, and let me start with the 2016 selling season, which continues on its healthy trajectory. Gross wins currently total approximately $13.3 billion with net new business of $11.4 billion. Now these net new numbers do not include any impact from our individual Med D PDP, which I'll touch on shortly. Today, we've completed 80% of our client renewals for 2016, that's consistent with past years and we continue to have a strong retention rate of about 98%. Our specialty business continues to outpace the market and gain share. In the third quarter, specialty revenues increased 32%. This was driven by claims growth, inflation and the inclusion of Omnicare's complementary specialty business. As you know, we've developed a comprehensive set of programs to effectively manage specialty trend and we'll provide a deep dive on those strategies at our Analyst Day. Before turning to Retail, let me touch briefly on our Med D PDP, SilverScript. As we reported last quarter, SilverScript once again qualified in 32 of the 34 regions, which enables us to retain the vast majority of auto assignees we currently serve. And we're well positioned in the 2016 annual enrollment period that is currently underway. We're offering two plans that have zero dollar deductibles, premiums in many states that are lower than prior-year levels and co-pays \u2013 low co-pays for several frequently-prescribed drugs. I'm also pleased to note that SilverScript recently received for the 2016 plan year a four star rating from CMS for delivering value, clinical outcomes and customer service. Turning to our Retail Long-Term Care Segment, as Dave mentioned, we're excited to now include Omnicare's long-term care business in the segment. The Omnicare acquisition provides a new pharmacy dispensing channel for us, enhancing our ability to provide continuity of care for patients as they transition through the health care system. The business is performing as we expected. Our integration work is well underway, and we're focused on executing to ensure a seamless transition for clients and patients. We will integrate the specialty operations into our existing specialty business and include the long-term care pharmacy operations in Rx Crossroads in the newly named Retail/LTC segment. So overall, we expect to complete the vast majority of the Omnicare integration activities by the end of 2016. As far as the previously announced Target pharmacy acquisition, we remain excited as this transaction enables us to reach more patients. It adds a new retail channel for our unique offerings and it expands convenient options for consumers. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including necessary regulatory clearance, and we expect the closing of the Target transaction to occur near the end of this year. So, we'll certainly keep you posted. Moving on to results in the Retail business, pharmacy same-store prescription volumes increased 4.4%, that's on a 30-day equivalent basis, and we continued to gain pharmacy share. Our retail pharmacy market share was 21.7% in Q3, again, on a 30-day equivalent basis and, that's up about 55 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago. Pharmacy same-store sales increased 4.6% and were negatively impacted by about 450 basis points due to recent generic introductions. During the quarter, we launched ScriptSync. That's a new pharmacy service that aligns eligible maintenance prescriptions to be ready together for pickup at the same time. This makes it easier and more convenient for patients to take their medications as prescribed. And since its launch, more than 400,000 patients have signed up for ScriptSync, greatly surpassing our enrollment projections. We will also be rolling this out to our mail-order customers, and we expect this enterprise program to contribute to significant improvements in medication adherence, while providing strong levels of customer satisfaction. In the front store, comps were down 5.8%. This would have been approximately 490 basis points higher in adjusting for the tobacco impact. Front store sales reflected softer customer traffic, partially offset by an increase in basket size, and we continued to gain share in our core health and beauty business categories. Front store margins increased in the quarter, benefiting from the tobacco exit, the growth in the higher-margin health and beauty businesses, along with increased store brand sales. Store brand penetration continued to increase in the quarter, reaching 21.8% of front end sales. That's up about 150 basis points from last year. And while about two-thirds of that improvement results from tobacco no longer being in the denominator, the rest is driven by new product introductions and increased customer loyalty. Our focus on positioning ourselves as a leading health and beauty destination to drive profitable growth continues to show a great deal of opportunity. Early results from the stores that have been updated have been positive, and we plan to expand our healthy food and elevated beauty programs in 2016, and Helena will provide more detail at Analyst Day. Turning to our store growth for the quarter, we opened 43 new stores, relocated 11, closed two, resulting in 41 net new stores, and we'll add about 150 net new stores for the full year of 2015, equating to an anticipated increase in retail square footage growth of right around 2%. As for MinuteClinic, we opened 23 new clinics in the quarter and we ended the quarter with 1,020 clinics across 32 states, plus the District of Columbia. Revenues increased approximately 13% versus the same quarter a year ago. And then lastly, let me just touch briefly on our Enterprise Digital initiatives. Our vision here is to create a connected health experience that makes it easier for people to save time, save money and stay healthy. And to date, 27 million customers have engaged digitally with CVS Health, and in specialty, we are engaging 36% of all specialty patients, making it the highest penetrated digital program that we have. So we're pleased with the progress that we're making on the digital front. So with that, let me turn it back over to Dave for the financial review. David M. Denton: Thank you, Larry. As you can tell, it's certainly been an eventful quarter with a lot of moving parts in our business. So this morning, I'll try to frame up our results with an eye to making easy comparisons to what we have previously expected. But first, as I typically do, I'd like to begin by highlighting how our disciplined approach to capital allocation continues to enhance shareholder value. I'll follow that with a detailed review of our solid third-quarter results and an update on our 2015 guidance that now includes Omnicare. So as it relates to our capital allocation program, let's begin with our dividend payout. We paid $391 million in dividends in the third quarter and $1.2 billion year-to-date. Our dividend payout ratio stands at 28.9% over the trailing four quarters, after excluding the impact of non-recurring items in both years. We remain well on track to achieve our target of 35% by 2018. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 9 million shares for $937 million. And year-to-date, we've repurchased approximately 37.8 million shares for about $3.9 billion, or $102.47 per share. For the full year, we continue to expect to complete $5 billion of share repurchases, reflecting an increase of approximately 25% versus 2014 levels. So between dividends and share repurchases, we returned more than $5 billion to our shareholders in the first nine months of 2015 alone, and we continue to expect to return more than $6 billion for the full year. And as I noted on our last earnings call, to fund the Omnicare and target acquisitions, we issued a series of senior notes in July totaling $15 billion, which raised our leverage ratio to approximately 3.2 times. We also assumed about $700 million of remaining Omnicare debt, which increased our leverage ratio a bit further. We remain committed to getting back to our 2.7 times target over time. As I stated on the last call, while we have not specified a specific deadline for achieving that, our strong cash generation should enable us to do so in a reasonable amount of time. As Larry mentioned, we have generated nearly $3.4 billion of free cash in the first nine months of the year. We remain on track with our prior guidance for the full year and continue to expect to produce free cash of between $5.9 billion and $6.2 billion in 2015. Turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding acquisition-related activity, came in at $1.29 per share near the high end of our guidance range. That excludes $0.01 of acquisition related dilution from the net effect of the July 15 debt financing, partially offset by the inclusion of Omnicare's operation. We also incurred approximately $0.10 of acquisition-related bridge financing, transaction and integration costs throughout the quarter. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.10 per share. As most of you know, when we provided guidance on the last quarter's earnings call, we specifically excluded the interest from the senior notes, as well as the results of Omnicare's operations, as the timing of the close was uncertain. Now that the deal has closed, we believe that it makes sense that going forward to include both of these items in our guidance. So on that basis, adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter was $1.28. This includes the 2.5 months of senior note financing costs, which was partially offset by 1.5 months of Omnicare's operations throughout the quarter. Combined that resulted in net dilution of approximately $0.01. So with that, let me quickly walk down the P&L, keep in mind that these numbers all reflect the inclusion of Omnicare in our results. Our a consolidated basis, revenues in the third quarter increased 10.3% to $38.6 billion. In the PBM segment, revenues increased 13.3% to $25.5 billion, while the addition of Omnicare specialty business did contribute to growth versus LY, it was not the primary driver. PBM growth in the quarter nicely exceeded expectations, even after removing the impact of Omnicare specialty business. This year-over-year increase was driven largely by growth in specialty pharmacy, as well as an increase in pharmacy network claims. The growth in specialty was driven by inflation, as well as increased claims due to new products and new clients. Partially offsetting this growth was an approximately 130 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate versus the same quarter of LY to 83.8%. In our Retail Long-Term Care business, revenues increased 6.9% in the quarter to $17.9 billion, with approximately half of the increase due to the addition of the long-term care business. Excluding Omnicare's long-term care business, revenue growth was solidly within our guidance range. This growth was driven primarily by strong pharmacy same-store sales and growth in scripts. Retail's Long-Term Care Segments generic dispensing rate also increased approximately 140 basis points to 84.8%. Turning to gross margin, we reported 17.2% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 125 basis points compared to Q3 of 2014. Inside each segment's performance, the decline is due in part to a mix shift in our business, as our lower-margin PBM business continues to grow faster than our Retail Long-Term Care business. Within the PBM segment, gross margin declined approximately 45 basis points from Q3 of 2014 to 5.8%. This was driven by ongoing price compression, as well as business mix, resulting from stronger growth in lower margin areas, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Those factors were partially offset by the improvement in GDR, as well as favorable purchasing and rebate economics. Despite the decline in gross margin rate, gross profit dollars were up 4.7%. Gross margin in the Retail Long-Term Care Segment was 30%, down approximately 125 basis points from last year. This was driven by the continued pressure on pharmacy reimbursement rates, the continued mix shift towards pharmacy, and the addition of the long-term care business, which carries a slightly lower overall margin rate than retail. This pressure was partially offset by a number of positive factors, including the increase in GDR, favorable pharmacy purchasing economics, as well as an increased front-store margin due to changes in the mix of products that we sold. And while gross margin rate was down, gross profit dollars did increase by 2.6% throughout the quarter. Total operating expenses as a percent of revenue improved by approximately 120 basis points compared to Q3 of 2014 to 10.9%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved by 20 basis points to 1.2%, with growth in operating expense dollars in line with expectations. Operating expenses actually declined within the PBM by $10 million, despite the addition of the Omnicare specialty business. Operating expenses as a percent of sales in the Retail Long-Term Care Segment improved by approximately 140 basis points to 20.8%, due to higher legal costs in last year's third quarter. This excludes approximately $20 million of costs related to the Omnicare integration. Within the Corporate Segment, expenses increased to $309 million, driven by the acquisition-related integration and transaction costs associated with Omnicare, as well as the proposed acquisition of Target pharmacies and clinics. These costs totaled $115 million. Excluding these costs, corporate expenses were better than expected and improved year-over-year. So adding it all up and excluding integration and transaction costs, operating margin for the total enterprise declined by 5 basis points in the quarter to 6.4%. On the same basis, operating margin in the PBM declined approximately 25 basis points to 4.6%, while operating margin in the Retail Long-Term Care Segment improved by approximately 10 basis points to 9.2%. So putting aside any acquisition-related items, which is the basis with which we guided, the Retail Long-Term Care Segment posted solid operating profit growth of 4.9% within our 4% to 6% guidance range. The PBM segment posted operating profit growth of 6.2%, slightly exceeding the high end of our 2% to 6% guidance range. Going forward, these lines become more blurred, so we won't be breaking out our results excluding Omnicare. Now going below the line of the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $108 million from last year to $261 million. This was driven by the financing costs associated with the bridge loan facility that we entered into in connection with the Omnicare deal, as well as the senior notes we placed in July in support of the acquisitions. During the third quarter, we recorded amortization of the bridge loan fees for approximately $16 million. Our effective tax rate was 40.2%. The large increase year-over-year was primarily due to the non-deductible transaction costs associated with the Omnicare acquisition. Excluding any acquisition-related items, the tax rate was slightly lower than expected. Out weighted average share count was 1.1 billion shares, again in line with expectations. So with that, let me now turn to our 2015 guidance. I'm going to concentrate on the highlights here, but you can find the details of our guidance on the slides that we posted on our website earlier this morning. To be clear, with the exception of free cash flow and GAAP, all of the figures and growth rates that I'll mention exclude acquisition-related bridge financing, transactions and integration costs in 2015, as well as the loss from the early extinguishment of debt in 2014. Given that the Target transaction is expected to close near year-end, it could actually occur in 2015 or 2016. You will note on slide 38 that if the Target deal closes this year, we have estimated approximately $0.02 of transaction costs, which we have not included in our adjusted EPS guidance range. Of course, Omnicare's operations and any synergies we achieve are included, as is the interest associated with all of the long-term notes. For the year, we raised and narrowed our guidance range and now expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $5.14 to $5.18, reflecting strong year-over-year growth of approximately 14.25% to 15.25%. This layers in the net impact of the Omnicare's operation and the interest on the debt, which combined is expected to be about $0.01 accretive for the year. This increases the midpoint of our guidance by about $0.015 to $5.16. Our revised guidance reflects our solid performance through the first nine months of this year, as well as the continued confidence in our outlook. This guidance also continues to assume share repurchases totaling approximately $5 billion for the full year of 2015. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.69 to $4.73. In the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.51 to $1.55, up 24.75% to 28.25% from Q4 2014. This fourth quarter guidance excludes any dilution from integration and transaction costs. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.45. As you'll note, sequentially, Q4 profit growth is expected to be somewhat higher than what we've experienced year-to-date. I'd like to remind you of a few factors influencing the quarterly profit cadence across our business. First, the benefits from break-open generics in Q4 of 2015; second, Q4 is the first quarter in which we have fully lapped the impact from our decision to exit the tobacco category; and finally, the timing of Med D profits is skewed more towards Q4 this year versus last year. Now I'll go through the details of our fourth quarter guidance. Within the Retail Long-Term Care Segment, we expect revenues to be up 9% to 10.5% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted script comps are expected to increase 3.5% to 4.5%, and total same-store sales are expected to increase 0.75% to 2.25%. Obviously, the primary reason for the large gap between comp and total revenue growth is the addition of the long-term care business. We expect to see a moderate decline year-over-year in Retail Long-Term Care gross margins in the fourth quarter. This is expected to be driven primarily by the continued reimbursement pressures we are experiencing, as well as the impact of adding Omnicare, which carried lower margins, again offset to some degree by the benefit from break-open generics. We expect the Retail Long-Term Care Segment's operating profit to increase 19.25% to 21.25% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the addition of the long-term care business, as well as an improvement in front store margin dollar growth as we cycle the tobacco exit. It also reflects an improvement in operating expenses as a percent of revenue. For the PBM segment, we expect revenue to increase 10.5% to 12% for the fourth quarter, and adjusted claims to be between 295 million and 300 million claims. The PBM is benefiting from the addition of Omnicare's specialty business. We expect to see a moderate improvement in PBM gross margins during the fourth quarter, driven by generic conversions. Combined with the modest improvement in operating expenses as a percent of revenues, due to the growth of the specialty, we expect the PBM segment's operating profit to be up 24% to 27% over last year's fourth quarter. And we expect operating expenses in the Corporate Segment to be between $215 million and $220 million. So as a result, for the total enterprise in the quarter we expect revenues to be up approximately 9.75% to 11.5% from the fourth quarter of LY. This is after intercompany eliminations, which are projected to equal about 10.8% of combined segment revenues. For the total company, gross profit margins are expected to be modestly down from last year's fourth quarter, driven largely by mix. Operating expenses as a percent of revenues are expected to significantly improve in the fourth quarter. We expect operating margin for the total company in the quarter to be up 75 basis points to 85 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. We expect net interest expense of between $275 million and $280 million, and a tax rate of approximately 39.3% in the fourth quarter. We anticipate that we'll have approximately 1.11 billion weighted average shares for the quarter, which would imply approximately 1.13 billion for the year. As I said, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.2 billion. So in summary, this was another strong high-quality quarter with good financial performance across the enterprise, including our new businesses. And importantly, our outlook remains strong, both for the remainder of this year as well as next year. We continue to remain focused on using our robust free cash flow to drive value for all of our stakeholders, both now as well as into the future. And so with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thanks, Dave. And just wrapping up, obviously we're confident, we believe we have the right strategy for long-term growth in this evolving health care marketplace. Our integrated model and unique suite of assets remain unmatched and we remain focused on driving sustainable growth with an enterprise mindset. So again, we're pleased with the quarter we announced today and remain well positioned to continue to grow, gain share, deliver on our targets and return value to our shareholders. Let me just add that we hope you found all of the details that we provided this morning very helpful. I know we covered a lot of ground and I'm sure you have questions, so let's go ahead and open it up for those questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Ross Muken : Good morning, guys. So, getting a lot of questions in the inbox, obviously, with all of the moving parts. Can you just help us understand first, in terms of the fourth quarter on the retail side, and on the pharma services side, what are the key changes on the base business on a sequential basis versus the last time we spoke regarding the second quarter, as we think about the implied fourth quarter from that guide versus where we are today. What are the moving parts, and how is the underlying kind of change, because to us it sort of seems like it's come down from maybe the mid to upper teens to the low to mid-teens, so we are just trying to get some clarity on that. Is that the case, and what's sort of the driving factors? David M. Denton: Hey, Ross. This is Dave. I think if you go back and look at how we guided on Q2 and looked at our Q3 guidance and then therefore our implied Q4 guidance, Q4 has not from a core basis, changed. Essentially what we've done, we've added a couple of pennies into Q4 based on the inclusion of Omnicare's business, but fundamentally Q4 from our expectations has not deteriorated. In fact, it has remained solid and has remained consistent from our projections. Ross Muken : That's helpful, Dave. So I just wanted to get that out of the way. I guess, big picture wise, there's a lot going on, right? So we obviously saw (42:53) your peers earlier in the week getting together. The results on the pharmacy side at least across the spectrum and across the whole supply chain have been pretty mixed. How do you characterize the current environment, I guess, overall, and the pushes and pulls? And then as you think about longer-term, I guess, vis-\u00e0-vis what was implied in the 2016 guide, it still feels like you've got this winning business model that can kind of endure. And so how should we put sort of the competitive noise, some of the near-term noise in perspective, relative to how you feel about kind of the long-term positioning? I don't want to pre-pull ahead to Analyst Day, but as you can just help us here, I think all of us are just trying to put this into context. Larry J. Merlo: Ross, good morning. It's Larry. It's a great question, Ross. And we feel really good about our positioning in the marketplace and our strategy and as you've heard us talk in the past, we've talked about aggregating lives and growing share and recognizing the multitude of ways in which we can manage those lives with access, quality and cost in mind, and our focus around that has been to look at the differentiated ways that we can grow our core business and at the same time broaden our base of services. So, I think many of the variables that we've talked about in the marketplace, I don't think those variables have changed. Whether it's talking about margin compression or the contribution from generics, obviously there're going to be ebbs and flows in terms of the timing of those variables, but we feel that we're very well positioned recognizing that the health care marketplace is evolving and we see ourselves as an important player. Ross Muken : That's helpful. I guess, I don't mean to be a question hog, but I will be very direct, so I guess, just to be clear, your confidence in your business model over the long-term and your ability to deliver the long-term targets, no change whatsoever? David M. Denton: Absolutely. Larry J. Merlo: We remain very confident in those long-term targets, Ross. Ross Muken : Well, if you're confident, I'm confident. Thanks, guys. Larry J. Merlo: All right. Thanks, Ross. David M. Denton: Thanks, Ross. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Patrick Jones : Thanks for the questions. I guess just to put a little more specificity around the 2016 guide, it looks like a lot of moving pieces, and Dave, definitely appreciate all the detail. But even adjusting for Omnicare and Target, it certainly seems like you are below your steady-state range that you've shared before of 7% to 9%. And it does seem like it's actually moderating in both segments. Can you maybe just \u2013 if I'm thinking about that right, first off, and then more importantly, can you maybe just give us a sense of what's changing in your minds for next year, relative to what we have experienced the last few? David M. Denton: Well, I'm not sure that I see much change in our business from that perspective. As we look at our business and we look at how we're performing, we continue to grow and gain share in both segments of our business. Now we have an additional channel to serve from an Omnicare perspective, and obviously we look forward to the addition of the Target pharmacies in our base business. So I think our outlook remains strong from that perspective and we see solid growth across both segments, excluding the acquisitions. Larry J. Merlo: And, Bob, it's Larry. As you know, for some time now, we've messaged our focus around enterprise growth and as we've talked and we've provided some examples, the reality of that is, we could have a segment of our business be sub-optimized for a greater enterprise growth and a good example of that is the high-growth specialty business that as we talked about how Specialty Connect works and the fact that it leverages our retail channel assets, but as a result of fulfillment occurring through the PBM channel, you see that economically flow through the PBM segment. So, we always appreciate the fact that you'd like to have an apples-to-apples comparison to our primary Retail and PBM competitors, but the reality is that's not how we're running the business, and by the way we think that's a good thing because of what we've been able to do when you look at enterprise growth and I think as we bring more innovation into the marketplace, those lines continue to get more and more blurred and it becomes harder and harder to create that apples-to-apples comparison. Robert Patrick Jones : No, I appreciate that. I guess it's more directionally, I think, the concern in the marketplace, if we just look at \u2013 even take the core retail drug business. It does seem like this year the progression on the gross margin has been negative. If I back out some of the moving pieces, it certainly seems the growth you're calling for, for next year, not that it's not healthy, it is just below what we have become accustomed to. So I guess the real question is just are there things changing in the underlying fundamentals, whether it'd be script trends, reimbursement rate pressure, are there any things that are notably different in your mind, as you look into 2016 relative to 2015 or even 2014? David M. Denton: No, I think what is important is as you think about our business, and to your point, there's a lot of moving parts here, but the thesis of our financial performance has not changed. I think the cadence in some cases changes based on when generics come to market, as an example, or when competition enters into one of our formulary classes, all of which can influence the cadence of when profits occur, not that they're going to occur over time. So I think the fundamental thesis of our financial model and our business model remains intact. Robert Patrick Jones : Got it. All right. Thanks, guys. David M. Denton: You're welcome. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Bob. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys. I was hoping that we could maybe unfortunately zero back in on this gross margin issue here, within retail. Because it does seem like within your guidance, you are expecting a more material decline than what you maybe alluded to last quarter, and I don't know if I'm right or wrong about that. You did mention reimbursement rate pressure not accelerating, and maybe there being less offsets than what there's been in the past. So I don't know, maybe you could just pile this together for us, and maybe help us understand if there really is a difference in how you are looking at the gross margin in retail. And then how reimbursement pressure is impacting that, or potentially what offsets are not there, that may have been before. Larry J. Merlo: Well, Ed, it's Larry. And when you \u2013 as we've said \u2013 as we talked about margin compression in the past, we haven't seen that change. As Dave outlined in his remarks, we've got the ongoing pricing pressure, and as you look at the sub-segments within pharmacy, we are seeing higher growth coming out of those segments that carry with it lower margins, so when you look at the Medicare, the Medicaid segments. And as we've have talked and as you just alluded to, there are a lot of things that we've done to offset margin compression, whether you think about purchasing economics, Red Oak Sourcing, as an example, our focus on formulary management becomes an example of that. You think about what we've been able to do in terms of bringing innovative products into the marketplace that create value for clients and at the same time drive share shift into one of our distribution channels, as well as our ongoing focus on technology and process improvements in an effort to become even more efficient and productive. So those things have not changed in terms of where our focus lies. And as we talked earlier, we can have some ebb and flow issues in terms of the timing and the syncing up of those. And a good example of that is the timing of generics, whether it's new introductions or the timing of generics entering their break-open period. And again, we'll talk more about that and provide some additional color around that at Analyst Day. Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) And just one follow up related to next year. I mean this is kind of asked but it does seem like Retail operating profit growth, maybe excluding Omnicare, is not really going to grow next year, is that right, I guess, first of all? David M. Denton: That's not correct. You will see growth in the core. That's not correct. Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Okay. But you did guide to mid-single-digit retail operating profit growth next year; is that right? David M. Denton: I did. I did. Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Great. Thank you, guys. David M. Denton: Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah, hi. Good morning. So not to beat on a dead horse, but maybe a little bit differently. So when we back out kind of like the acquisitions, right, EPS growth for \u2013 excluding Omnicare and Target about 7% to 11%. So is this basically when we think about kind of like industry dynamics and kind of like the fact that kind of like Medicare and Medicaid is a bigger part of the customer mix, is this kind of like the growth profile that we should be thinking about longer-term for a core organic business, i.e. excluding capital deployments? David M. Denton: Ricky, This is Dave. And I'm sure Larry will tag on here. I think \u2013 I don't think that's the correct thesis here. I think what you see is that in some of these businesses, especially I'll use our selling season of next year as a good example, as we won a lot of health plan business. It takes us time to kind of sell in different programs and services that add value to them and add value to us, and that value to us is driving share into one of our dispensing channels. So the reimbursement pressure happens more rapidly and the share gains happen over time, so this is more of a cadence issue or a cadence discussion than it is a long-term financial outlook discussion. Larry J. Merlo: And, Ricky, I think you can \u2013 there's a parallel example with the acquisitions and I think as we may have communicated when we announced Omnicare, we'll see the benefit of cost synergy and purchasing synergy sooner than we will revenue synergy. And we see the opportunities, we've talked about the opportunity to grow share, especially in the assisted and independent living space, but it will take some time to sell in those programs. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay and then on the follow-up, obviously you are seeing some softer customer traffic on the Retail side. Obviously the PBM is growing nicely through share gains. I think the utilization environment continues to be a dynamic. You are in best position to see trends in 2016, because you see what your customers are doing on the plan side. When you think about kind of like the co-pay structures for next year, the cost sharing for next year, what is kind of like your view on next year's kind of like utilization trends? David M. Denton: Ricky, it's Dave. It's probably a little too early to go through that at this point in time. It's certainly something we'll discuss at Analyst Day. I just will step back and remind you that I do think that if you look across the industry, the pharmacy utilization or prescription utilization across the industry is still pretty solid. I think we've experienced a little bit of weakness as we're cycling, quite frankly, the bolus of Medicaid expansion last year and probably a little bit of softness in some seasonality scripts. But for the most part, utilization has been pretty good and we think that long-term secular trend in utilization should be robust as pharmacy is the most economical way to treat many of these chronic disease states, and you see that chronic disease states increase as age increases and the over 65 population continues to expand as a percent of total. So, I think the outlook for utilization is strong over the long-term. Larry J. Merlo: And, Ricky, just to add to Dave's point, you think about the impact of the Affordable Care Act. Dave talked about the bolus that we've seen from the rapid Medicaid expansion. And we're going to continue to see more lives enter into the health care system as the Affordable Care Act further evolves. And I don't want to make a political statement about Medicaid expansion, but we still have approximately 20 states that have not expanded Medicaid and there is a question in terms of is that more a question of when versus if and so there is still opportunity for more lives to enter the health care delivery system. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. Thank you. David M. Denton: Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Lisa Christine Gill : Thanks very much and good morning. Larry, can we take a step back and have a bigger discussion around 2016, as we think about what you've tried to do in putting all these pieces together? I think when you bought Omnicare, we had a discussion around fee-for-value and the way the world is moving in that direction, and your ability to touch a patient beginning of life to end of life. Are you in those discussions? Do you see anything in 2016 that having all the pieces on your enterprise is really coming to fruition, and we'll start to see that impact in 2016, or are those things that are going to come longer-term on this platform? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Lisa, it's a great question. I think it kind of goes back to the conversation we were just having. We definitely see the opportunities there as we've begun to have some discussions. But I do think that maybe we see a little bit in the later part of 2016. I really think it's more a 2017 and beyond opportunity. There is a parallel to how Dave was talking about the health plan business that you garner the business and then you have to sell in those programs. And we're in the process of doing the evaluation and the understanding of exactly what is the optimal value proposition that adds value for the long-term care operators and their residents. So more to come on that. As I mentioned earlier, we will see the benefits of purchasing and cost synergy as we go through our integration activities throughout 2016. Lisa Christine Gill : And then just on the backside of that, as you think about your PBM for 2016, and the guidance that you gave, high single to low double-digit, but again realizing a lot of this is health plan, can you or I don't know if Jon is on the call today, maybe just give us some indication as to what plan design looks like for next year? What about the rest of your book? How about your existing book? Do you have people buying into more programs as we think about 2016? Larry J. Merlo: Lisa, I'll go ahead and start and Jon is here. He'll jump in. We are continuing to see adoption of programs like Maintenance Choice, Pharmacy Advisor. We'll put some \u2013 once we \u2013 once \u2013 as Dave mentioned, once we finalize everything for 2016, we'll provide some additional color and details at Analyst Day. So, those programs are continuing to add value. I'll turn it over to Jon. Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah, I mean, Lisa, this is Jon. As we talk to our clients, we just had advisory council meetings on both the employer and the health plan side. Pharmacy is their highest priority when they look at their overall health care costs and they are \u2013 they will be much more aggressive moving forward in plan designs than they have historically been. So, they're looking for us to show them opportunities to more tightly manage their benefits, which will save them money and at the same time, we believe, in many cases drive more share into our channels. Lisa Christine Gill : And also drive profitability right? That's the correct way to think about this? Larry J. Merlo: That's correct. Jonathan C. Roberts: Yes. Lisa Christine Gill : Okay. Larry J. Merlo: Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. George R. Hill: Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I'm going to go back to the dead horse here and talk about the Retail side a little bit. I guess can you give us any color or quantify the impact of mix and kind of changing script mix on the margin profile of the business? You've talked \u2013 mentioned a couple times on the call about the growth in Medicaid and Medicare. We continue to see the reimbursement compression in Med D. I guess, can you kind of quantify the mix effect, or talk a little about the mix effect of kind of who's walking in the door in the prescription dispensing and regional business? David M. Denton: Yeah, George, that's a great question. We're not going to \u2013 we can't do that today. We're not going to do that today. I will say one thing about that is that you've heard Larry and I speak and others speak about this in the past. As we've been very focused on as we think about our participation in Medicare Part D in preferred situations in the sense that being a preferred provider in some of those networks, we look at the economics, we model the economics and we make decisions that's in the best interest of our company on how we participate in those. And so we have chosen in many cases not to participate but it doesn't make good economic sense and we participate where we can actually drive value for the plan participants in the plans and the payers that we support in that space. And we're very focused, we're very disciplined on that and we make very I think rational decisions there. George R. Hill: Okay and then maybe my quick follow-up would be, so Larry has said that reimbursement pressure has not changed. As I think about the store, is kind of reimbursement pressure in the different silos constant and mix is changing, and that's kind of driving the impact? Or is just the rate of decline across the book of business kind of the same, and then maybe just the tackle, a quick comment on what you're seeing in preferred or restricted network strategies in commercial? Thanks. David M. Denton: Well, what we have said is that the reimbursement, the intensity of the reimbursement pressure has not changed, but we have seen obviously consistent with what we said at last Analyst Day is that Medicare and Medicaid are really the areas of growth in this business at the moment and they carry a lower margin rate and that's the reality. And as we indicated before, we work kind of three ways to kind of offset that reimbursement pressure in our business. First, we work to improve our purchasing economics. And we've been pretty creative in that fashion. Red Oak's a great example, or exclusive formularies are a great example of how we reduce our cost of goods sold. Secondly, we work hard to improve the efficiency across our operation. We put in technologies and processes to make us fill our scripts more efficiently throughout all of our store base and in our mail centers. And finally, and most importantly, we work to put programs in place that drive value for our payers but also drive share into one of our dispensing channels. And those efforts, they take time. They take time to implement. And we're working hard at that. You've seen rapid adoption of Maintenance Choice. There's \u2013 and you see, you are beginning to see some adoption of, I'll say, limited networks in some Medicaid areas. But we continue to push in that area to offset those margin pressures. Larry J. Merlo: And, George, I do \u2013 it's Larry. The second part of your question, I do think we're seeing and we will see a growing appetite for preferred or premium or restricted networks, whatever verbs or words you want to use. And if you look at the Medicaid space, we've seen that. Okay? We've got \u2013 today we've got more than half the Medicaid business that is now no longer fee-for-service. It's managed Medicaid. And I think as Jon mentioned a minute ago, clients are continuing to look for cost saving ways in which they can reduce their overall pharmacy spend. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question. David M. Larsen: Hey. Can you talk about pricing a bit and how that impacts your overall book? So, if we see a deceleration in generic inflation, how will that impact your enterprise? I mean isn't that a tailwind to your retail gross margins? And then also, your specialty products, if the rate of inflation starts to decelerate, what sort of impact could there be on your book? Thanks. David M. Denton: Dave, this is Dave. Just a couple of things. First and foremost, our focus is to lower cost for the payers and clients that we serve. And every day we come to work focused against that. I would say that from a generic standpoint, there has been a lot of chatter around generic inflation in the industry. Keep in mind, generics overall are a deflationary category for us, and they continue to be a deflationary category. We have been effective at managing that, and that has had essentially an immaterial impact on our performance. And we expect that inflation events going forward to have an immaterial effect on our performance as well. On the branded side of the world, we continue to model specifically what's happening from a branded inflation standpoint. We look at that very specifically molecule-by-molecule. Our expectation is that branded inflation will continue to occur. And again, we use many tools across our business to drive costs down in those categories, particularly within our formulary management aspect. We do think that if there's a deceleration or an acceleration of branded inflation, we don't believe it to have a material effect across our line of business, all of our businesses. David M. Larsen: Okay, that's very helpful, thanks. And then in terms of the PBM wins, if I understand you correctly, these are large wins that will roll into 2016, but it can time to basically drive incremental earnings from those. You've got to sell your managed choice program and as you're successful in that, you can drive more store traffic to the CVS channel. And over time, you will realize incremental earnings from those new client starts? David M. Denton: That's correct. I think the challenge, as I said in my prepared remarks, an employer with one decision maker can make the decision for their entire book of business. So at a stroke of a pen, an employer who has 100,000 member group can offer Maintenance Choice. In health plans, that's not how it works. A health plan might really want to adopt Maintenance Choice, as an example, but then they have to go get their sales teams to go out and call upon all of their clients. And they sell that program in client by client by client. And that just takes time. Larry J. Merlo: And, Dave, if you go back to our Analyst Day last December, I think it might have been in Jon's presentation when we looked at the employer segment and the health plan segment. And we showed what percent of pharmacy business went through one of our distribution channels, and in the employer segment, that number was in the high 50%s, in the health plan segment that number was in the high 20%s, recognizing the point that you and Dave were just making, and obviously, it takes a while, but at the same time, there's a lot of white space there and a big opportunity for growth as we go forward David M. Larsen: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question. John Heinbockel : Hey, Larry. A big, big, big picture question, if you look at the pure Retail business, and I know you look at it holistically but that business as it is presently constituted, do you think we are approaching a profit margin ceiling? And if not, what are the one or two kind of big ideas that can change that? Is personalized digital circulars and doing away with print, is that one of those things that can move the needle a lot from where we are today? Larry J. Merlo: Well, John, I'll take the first part, and then ask Helena to comment on our personalization efforts. But John, as you know, we have been one of the leaders in that space and I would turn around and tell you that we have not capped our opportunity in terms of operating margin performance. And if you think about the fact that, again, we continue to be focused on ways in which we can become even more productive and efficient, but it's also about growing the top line and the benefits in growing share, the leverage that that creates for the bottom line as we're able to leverage a lot of those fixed costs across that next sales dollar. So, we certainly see opportunities for more growth there. Helena B. Foulkes: Right. And just building on that, I agree with Larry, the number one way that we think about it is that idea of script growth and leveraging our fixed assets, but we're also really excited about all the opportunity that exists in the front store, and we'll talk more about this at Analyst Day, but you heard me say last year that we've got five key elements of our growth strategy, and they were around better health made easy, elevating beauty, customer-driven personalization, myCVS Store, and digital innovation. And I think the combination of personalization and digital innovation really strikes us as our biggest opportunity. And certainly, we have a 17-year history of using ExtraCare. We have 70 million active members. But I have to say in the last year, the work that the team has done to really identify even further opportunities to continue to pull back on our core mass circular efforts and reinvest that margin in higher-performing opportunities with customers who have lots of upside, that's where we're excited. And I'd be happy to share more of that when we see you in December. John Heinbockel : All right. And then just secondly, where are we with the uptake on Maintenance Choice 2.0? Is there yet an acceleration or is it too early? Starting with 2.0 and moving to sort of core Maintenance Choice; is that likely a couple of years down the road or are we seeing any of that yet? Jonathan C. Roberts: Well, John, we continue \u2013 this is Jon. We continue to see growth in Maintenance Choice. 2.0 made it attractive to a broader suite of clients. So we have 2,400 clients, we're approaching 23 million lives. We saw the ceiling on it is 34 million lives, so we're continuing to grow. And I think as with pharmacy being such front-and-center as payers look for opportunities to manage those costs, I think Maintenance Choice becomes a great opportunity for them to bring their pharmacy costs down. John Heinbockel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Mark Gregory Wiltamuth : Hi. Good morning. I wonder if you could give us the specialty growth number in the quarter, excluding Omnicare? And then digging in a little more on specialty big picture, how would you be impacted if the space does come under a little more regulatory scrutiny and we put some price controls on some of the manufacturers there? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Mark, it's Larry. Our growth without Omnicare in specialty was 27%. I think in our prepared remarks, we said it was 32% with Omnicare included. Mark, our views on all this noise about price controls, it's not the first time we've heard that rhetoric in the market. As Dave mentioned, we get up every day and focus on how we can reduce costs for our clients and we've got a multitude of ways that we have done that across both the traditional pharmacy business, as well as the specialty business, and there are solutions to further reducing costs. And the umbrella centers around introducing more competition within therapeutic classes that would allow us to do an even more effective job with what we do today. And I'm sure you are aware there is a backlog of approvals, awaiting decision in the FDA. That's certainly one way to increase competition and at the same time, there is a huge opportunity to reduce costs by focusing on site of care administration and getting the right reimbursements aligned that promotes that method of delivery versus care being delivered in an outpatient center and we've been able to demonstrate the savings that we can create for clients and their members through Coram with infusions in our retail infusion site or at home. Mark Gregory Wiltamuth : I think what I was trying to get at is what does that do to your profitability outlook, if things come under controls? Larry J. Merlo: Well I think it goes back, Mark, a little bit to what Dave was talking about in terms of, as you look across the enterprise, okay, we could see different effects and different segments, but across our enterprise we believe that it would have a muted and immaterial effect. Mark Gregory Wiltamuth : Okay. Thank you very much. Larry J. Merlo: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta: Thank you for taking the question. Just shifting gears a little bit. Dave, it looks like you still need to undertake the vast majority of your sale leaseback actions for the year. Are you seeing any shifts in market dynamics that might support most of that coming out of the 144A market that you use, or should we think about you guys undertaking a more balanced approach, similar to what you've done across markets in prior years? David M. Denton: Priya, good question. I think what we have \u2013 I think the market is still robust for us from a sale leaseback perspective. I think we have used multiple mechanisms to support our program; I think that has allowed us to ensure that we competitively price all of our programs. We are \u2013 I think it's a great program. I think we've done a good job of making sure that we have a lot of active participants in the program, and that has allowed us to, I think, drive costs out of the program quite frankly. Again, like the pharmacy business, competition especially helps and we work hard to create competition in the space Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta: Okay. Thank you. David M. Denton: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott A. Mushkin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions, and really appreciated all the detail, Dave, in the spreadsheets and the presentation. So what I wanted to get into, and I know people have been talking about it a lot, but I'm just trying to understand, you guys talked about reimbursement pressures, and that there is always offsets, and I think Dave, you outlined three different offsets. So I guess what I'm trying to frame is what's missing in 2016 or maybe is a little less of an offset when compared to 2014 and 2015 of the three buckets that you outlined for us? David M. Denton: Scott, that's a great question. Listen, I think that's probably a topic mostly for Analyst Day, quite frankly at this point in time. I would say as we look forward, our growth rate is still pretty robust. I think that we continue to work to gain share, we are gaining share and growing our business across both segments. And as we indicated a little bit, the opportunity really is probably to grow dispensing share over time. And that just \u2013 unfortunately that just doesn't happen out of the gate. We have to work hard to do that over time, and I think you are seeing some of that. Scott A. Mushkin: Okay. And then this is kind of just \u2013 two little follow-ups. Do you expect any divestitures needed with Target? David M. Denton: The data doesn't support that. Scott A. Mushkin: Okay. David M. Denton: But we'll have to see. Scott A. Mushkin: And then the second thing that kind of caught my attention and you said I believe there is some recent utilization softness, and I was wondering, we have seen indications very recently of some softness out of the consumer. What's your take on that? I think you gave us some explanations, but I don't know what your take on that was. David M. Denton: Yeah, I think, I am sorry, maybe I will clarify my comment. The softness that we've seen a little bit is mainly around the acute seasonal business. Larry J. Merlo: Seasonal business. David M. Denton: And I don't know if that is due to dynamics from a weather perspective, over what have you, but that's really been the softness. And then secondly, we are cycling the expansion of Medicaid, the Medicaid programs from last year. So that kind of I'd say, dilutes the year-over-year growth rate, if you will. Scott A. Mushkin: Okay, so you don't really see it as a consumer issue, don't see anything in the front-end? David M. Denton: No. There's nothing that indicates there's a consumer issue here. No. Scott A. Mushkin: Perfect. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. David M. Denton: Thank you. See you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard : Good morning. Larry J. Merlo: Good morning Eric Bosshard : Wanted to circle back, I don't know if you agreed with the math discussed earlier of the underlying 7% to 11% growth in 2016 excluding the benefit from the acquisitions, but comment on if you think that's in the right range, and what you think that number looks like in 2017? And I appreciate sort of the 10% to 14% long-term, but just curious if the underlying in 2016 you would think would look different in 2017, or is that the right way to think about the underlying ex-acquisitions going forward? David M. Denton: Eric, you're getting way ahead of it here, buddy. 2017. I think let's just focus on 2016 at the moment. Listen, again, I think we're pretty confident in our outlook for next year. We continue to make progress, as I say, gaining and growing share across both of our business segments. I would say that as we talked about our financial plan, we always talked about the fact that we include bolt-on acquisitions in our plan, and that is consistent with our expectation. Eric Bosshard : Okay, and then if I could just \u2013 and I appreciate that year-by-year thought process. David M. Denton: But I will go back. Eric, one thing. As I said earlier, when we made those financial targets, we set those financial targets, we have been, I'd say, trending to the high side of those targets through 2013 through 2016. And those financial targets remain in place. We think they're appropriate for our business and our business model and the environment we compete in. And so we are not \u2013 we stand behind those and none of that has changed. Eric Bosshard : Okay. I guess the follow up, if you could just provide a little bit of clarity, the 2013, 2014, 2015 at the high end of that without acquisition benefit, there's more acquisition benefit in 2016, and you're still in the same range. So what's different ex the acquisition in 2016 relative to the 2013, 2014, 2015? David M. Denton: We also did \u2013 we did Coram and other acquisitions as well. So you can't predict the timing of some of these acquisitions. They happen when they happen when the market's available, so... Eric Bosshard : Okay. Okay. Very good. Thank you. David M. Denton: Thank you. Take care. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Robert McEwen Willoughby : Thanks. You mentioned Omnicare didn't meet your expectations for the quarter, but can you give us any greater detail on the performance so that we could see what kind of disruption, if any, happened in the latest period with the transition? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Eric, it's Larry. There's really, I'm sorry, Bob. Okay. We just hung up with Eric. So, sorry, Bob. Okay. I'm going to pay a dear price for that, I know. Okay. Bob, there's really \u2013 the business has been performing as it had earlier in the year as an independent public company. We haven't seen anything material in terms of client changes or anything of that nature. So, as I mentioned, we feel good with the performance and the integration activities are off to a very good start. Robert McEwen Willoughby : Is there any possibility we get like a one last bed count or script count number for the business before it's consolidated? David M. Denton: Probably not. Good question though. Robert McEwen Willoughby : All right. Thank you. David M. Denton: Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Go ahead. I was going to say we'll take two more questions. But please go ahead. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. James Auh : Hi. I don't know \u2013 this is actually James Auh on for Charles. I don't know if this was asked before, but has OC's generic volume shifted over to Red Oak yet? David M. Denton: It has not yet. Larry J. Merlo: It has not yet. But as we stated when we announced the acquisition that our plan would be and our plan is to migrate the generic sourcing to Red Oak and that activity is being executed as we speak. And we'll be completed early next year. James Auh : Also, recently, the biosimilar Neupogen was launched. Can you maybe talk about the uptake you have seen, and how that's shaping your view of biosimilars going forward? Larry J. Merlo: That particular product is really not a good proxy for us to comment on because it's largely a product that is utilized in a hospital setting. So it really is not largely dispensed within our distribution channel. James Auh : Okay. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Last question please? Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Steven J. Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning. So a lot of the critical questions have been asked at this point. The one I wanted to still touch on a little bit here was just, without giving any specific numbers around Red Oak, just trying to get a sense for how material your overall volume discounts on generic procurement will be by adding Omnicare and eventually Target? And really, just the thought pattern is, is it more about improving the COGS just for those two additional books by leveraging your current pricing and procurement levels, or is there still adequate runway to improve your overall COGS by adding this volume? David M. Denton: This is Dave. I think obviously in the short run the real opportunity \u2013 the immediate-term opportunity is improving the COGS within those businesses, specifically as they transition into our program. As you know, Red Oak is focused on partnering with generic manufacturers to drive, I'll say, win-win scenarios that drive cost improvements for us and also savings for them from a manufacturing perspective. And I think the team has done just a terrific job getting our program up and running and this is a job that's not done, we're constantly working on this and we're constantly figuring out ways to improve our supply chain, reduce cost of generics that we procure. Steven J. Valiquette: Okay. All right. By the way, as far as maybe slightly softer 2016 outlook, are we sure it's not because you're taking Philidor out of the network for next year? Don't answer. I am kidding. Thanks. David M. Denton: Okay. Thanks, Steve. Steven J. Valiquette: Thank you. David M. Denton: See you soon. Larry J. Merlo: Listen, everyone, we know this was a rather lengthy call with an awful lot of information and we certainly appreciate the questions and we will look forward to seeing everyone on December 16 in New York. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, February 9, 2016. I would now like to turn the conference over to Nancy Christal, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Nancy R. Christal: Thank you, Suzy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Jon Roberts, President of CVS/caremark; and Helena Foulkes, President of CVS/pharmacy, are also with us today. And they will participate in the Q&A session following our prepared remarks. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up, so we can provide more people with a chance to ask their questions. Please note that we posted a slide presentation on our website before this call. It summarizes the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Later this afternoon we'll be filing our Form 10-K and it will also be available on our website at that time. In addition, note that during today's presentation we'll make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings including the risk factor section and cautionary statement and disclosures in those filings. During this call, we'll also use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the reconciliations of these non-GAAP items to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year. And now I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo. Larry J. Merlo: Well, thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our fourth quarter results wrapped up a terrific 2015, and during the year, we achieved strong performance across our enterprise and completed key acquisitions that will support our strategy for growth in the evolving healthcare market. We grew our core business with the acquisition of Target's pharmacies and clinics and we expanded our reach with the acquisition of Omnicare, the leader in long-term care pharmacy. And we remain very optimistic that these acquisitions will help drive our long-term growth and I'll update you shortly on our integration progress. Now for the full year 2015, we delivered 10% growth in consolidated revenues, 11% growth in consolidated operating profit, and 15% growth in adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, any acquisition related items, and the legal charge we mentioned in this morning's release. As expected, growth in the fourth quarter was especially strong with revenues increasing 11% and adjusted earnings per share increasing 26.5% to $1.53, right in line with our guidance. We generated approximately $3.1 billion of free cash during the quarter and $6.5 billion for the full year, above the high end of our guidance, and our continued ability to deliver substantial free cash is enabling us to return significant value to our shareholders. Now for 2016, we are confirming the guidance we provided at Analyst Day back in December. As a reminder, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year of $5.73 to $5.88, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11% to 14%. And Dave will review the details for the year and the first quarter in his remarks. So let me turn to the business update and start with our very successful 2016 PBM selling season. Gross client wins for 2016 have increased, and they now stand at $14.8 billion with net new business at $12.7 billion. The increase in net new business of about $1.2 billion from our last update largely reflects incremental growth from our new health plan clients as they closed out their enrollment year. These numbers exclude enrollment results from our SilverScript PDP, and I'll touch on that shortly. And our 2016 retention rate remains at approximately 98%. Now our success is a testament to our unmatched products and services, our strong service and execution along with our competitive pricing. And surveys continue to show that our ability to manage costs is our clients' top priority, and this is followed by a variety of additional factors with each of our client channels having different priorities. Our flexibility and expertise in addressing those varying priorities has certainly been a key to our success. Now with so much new business being transitioned in January, I'm also very pleased to report that we have had an extremely successful welcome season. We effectively added more than 9 million new members, 9 million new members who generated a significant year-over-year increase in January's claims volume, and clients have given us very positive feedback on our diligence and process, and we're pleased with the level of oversight we provided to ensure success. It's also worth noting that in the past two welcome seasons combined, we have successfully added nearly 16 million new Caremark lives. Looking ahead to 2017's selling season is just underway, and we are well positioned competitively for another strong year. Now it's too early to provide a specific update, but our size, scale, service record and unmatched capabilities make us confident that we will continue to be successful in the marketplace. Now as we've been discussing, top of mind for our clients is their rapidly growing specialty costs, and our specialty pharmacy business offers a comprehensive set of programs to help clients effectively manage specialty trend. As a result, we continue to outpace the market and gain share. In the fourth quarter, specialty revenues increased 32% and continued to outpace market growth rates. Our Medicare Part D business has risen to a leadership position. We had a successful 2016 annual enrollment period. Consistent with our expectations we added approximately 0.5 million net lives and began the 2016 plan year with more than 5 million captive PDP lives, and that includes EGWPs. Now when you add in the Med D lives that we manage for our health plan clients, the non-captive lives, our total rises to 11.3 million Med D lives under management, and that's up 41% from the prior year. Furthermore, our enterprise clinical capabilities combined with our strong operational execution enable us to drive Med D Star ratings, not only for our own SilverScript PDP but also for our health plan clients Med D offerings. In fact, SilverScript was the largest PDP to achieve a four-star rating, and 73% of our clients' lives are now enrolled in a high-performing plan for the 2016 year. Now turning to our Retail/Long Term Care Segment, and I'll start with an update on the integrations, Omnicare and Target, which are well underway. In the fourth quarter, Omnicare performed well and in line with our expectations as we began to realize some of the anticipated synergies. As we detailed at Analyst Day, there are multiple opportunities for driving enterprise value from Omnicare in both the near and long term. In the first half of this year, we expect to achieve the benefits of purchasing synergies, and by the end of the year we will phase in technology to support high-quality customer service and leverage best practices across the organization. We are combining operational infrastructures and developing programs to improve work streams and enhance delivery service. And we expect to complete the vast majority of the Omnicare integration activities by year end. Now, opportunities are also being pursued across the continuum of care that will drive long term enterprise value. For example, we are developing an enhanced offering for skilled nursing that's driven by improving coordination during care transitions, which should lead to better outcomes for patients, providers and payers. We are also developing segmented assisted-living offerings to better align with residents' varying needs. And to better target the rapidly growing independent living market, we have a consumer driven effort underway that utilizes existing CVS Pharmacy capabilities, including the on-site delivery of healthcare services. So we expect to generate revenue synergies focused on the transitions of care, market adjacencies and differentiated offerings. And these should begin to be realized in the second half of this year and grow in future periods. And we remain very excited about the opportunities created by this combination along with our enhanced ability to serve seniors across their continuum of care. Now as for the Target pharmacy and clinic acquisition, our highly detailed integration plan is complete. The integration activities are underway, and we have already successfully converted a handful of pilot stores. As a result, the conversions will begin to ramp up throughout this quarter and next, and we expect to complete all store conversions by the end of summer. Now as we complete each store conversion and it's rebranded as CVS Pharmacy, at that point we launch our additional core offerings, core pharmacy offerings, to include Specialty Connect, ExtraCare Pharmacy Rewards, along with our digital tools. And that's in addition to Maintenance Choice that was available upon the transaction close. We'll begin adding marketing elements as geographies convert, all with the goal of converting Target guests who currently don't use the pharmacy. Now moving on to the fourth quarter results in the retail business, pharmacy same-store sales increased 5%. This was negatively impacted by approximately 470 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Pharmacy same-store prescription volumes increased 5% on a 30-day equivalent basis, outperforming overall market growth. And our retail pharmacy market share, again on a 30-day equivalent basis, was 21.8% in Q4, and that's up about 65 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago. For the full year 2015, CVS Pharmacy's Med D share increased 35 basis points versus 2014, and we continue to gain share in this growing market while maintaining a disciplined approach to evaluating participation in preferred Med D networks. And we expect to maintain our market share position in 2016, helped by our preferred positions in a variety of national and regional plans. So overall, our pharmacy business remains quite strong and continues to gain share. Our digital team has been working to create a connected health experience that makes it easier to save time and money and to stay healthy by connecting patients to our unique assets when, where, and how they want. To-date, we've seen 12.7 million downloads of the CVS Pharmacy app, 18 million members enrolled in text messaging, driving adherence, and more than 300 million text messages sent by CVS Pharmacy this past year, enhancing the patient experience. So we continue to focus on driving member adoption of our highly related apps. In the front store business, comps were down slightly, 0.5% in the quarter, and reflected softer customer traffic partially offset by an increase in basket size. However, front store margins increased notably in the quarter, benefiting from efforts to rationalize our promotional strategies along with growth in the higher-margin health and beauty businesses. ExtraCare continues its commitment to reward our loyal customers with savings through weekly ads and personalized offers as well as ExtraBucks Rewards. And in 2015, this generated about $4 billion in savings for our loyal customers. So we continue to see ExtraCare as a source of growth as we leverage customer data to create even more relevant and personalized communications. Our store brand penetration was 22% in the quarter. That was down slightly from the prior year. And for the full year, store brand penetration was 21.3%, and that's up about 75 basis points. In 2015, we gained within the drug channel about 140 basis points of share in overall brand sales and about 60 basis points of share in store brand healthcare. And there remains significant opportunities to expand our share of store brand products by building on core equities in health and beauty and seeking opportunistic growth in other areas where we can link new products to our customers' path to better health. Turning to our store base, we ended the year with about 9,600 retail pharmacies. And for the full year 2015, we opened 130 net new stores, equating to an increase in retail square footage of 2.2%. And when you add in the acquired Target pharmacies, our retail square footage growth for the year comes to 3.1%. In the fourth quarter in addition to the acquired pharmacies, we opened 53 new stores, relocated 19 stores, closed 14 stores, resulting in 39 net new stores. We also continued to grow the number of clinics. MinuteClinic is the largest walk-in clinic operator in the country, and in the fourth quarter, we opened 36 new clinics in addition to the 79 acquired clinics in Target, ending the year with 1,135 clinics across 33 states plus the District of Columbia. Now excluding the Target clinics, MinuteClinic revenues increased 4.4% in the quarter, that's below our usual trend due to the mild cold flu season versus a year ago. However, we achieved our full year 2015 revenue target of about $345 million. And with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review. David M. Denton: Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will provide a detailed review of our 2015 fourth quarter results and briefly touch upon our 2016 guidance, which remains unchanged from what we outlined in December at our Analyst Day. First, I'll start with a summary of last year's capital allocation program, which should clearly demonstrate how we're continuing to use our strong free cash flow to return value to our shareholders through both dividends as well as share repurchases. I'm pleased to say that we continue to drive steady improvement in our dividend payout ratio. Recall that back in 2010 that our payout ratio was approximately 14%. We finished 2015 with a payout ratio of 30.1%, more than double 2010's level and 240 basis points higher than 2014 on a comparable basis. We paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends in 2015 and $391 million in the fourth quarter alone. Our strong earnings outlook this year combined with the 21% increase in the dividend that we announced at our Analyst Day keeps us well on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 35% by 2018. Along with the significant increases in our dividend, we have continued to repurchase our shares. For all of 2015, we repurchased approximately 48 million shares for about $5 billion, averaging $101.23 per share. In the fourth quarter alone, we repurchased approximately 10.2 million shares for $1.1 billion. Now if you look back over the past three years, we've repurchased approximately 166 million shares for about $13 billion at an average price of $78.37 per share. For the year 2015, between dividends and share repurchases, we returned a very significant $6.6 billion to our shareholders. Now looking forward, we have nearly $7.7 billion left in repurchase authorizations and we continue to expect to repurchase $4 billion this year. Our expectation is that we'd return more than $5 billion to our shareholders in 2016 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We generated $3.1 billion of free cash in the fourth quarter. In all of 2015, we generated approximately $6.5 billion of free cash, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by about $200 million, but was essentially flat year-over-year. The outperformance was driven by client collections. At the same time, we improved our cash cycle by approximately two days, thanks to continued improvements in payables management that were partially offset by growth in receivables. We remain committed to further improvements in working capital as we move forward. For the year, our net capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion. This included $2.4 billion of gross CapEx, offset by about $410 million in sale-leaseback proceeds as well as capital spend associated with the acquisitions. As for the income statement, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.53 per share, at the midpoint of our guidance, up 26.5% over LY. As you can see in our press release, in 2015, this excludes amortization, the impact of transaction and integration costs related to the Omnicare and Target acquisitions as well as a $90 million legal charge. The charge is related to a legacy lawsuit challenging the 1999 settlement by MedPartners of various security class actions and a related derivative claim. For those of you who may not be familiar, MedPartners was the former parent company to Caremark. So this issue goes back to long time. The growth rate also excludes the loss on early extinguishment of debt that we recorded in 2014. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.34 per share. Results across our operating segments were strong as expected. And with that, let me quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the fourth quarter increased 11% to $41.1 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 11.1% to $26.5 billion. This growth was attributable to specialty pharmacy as well as increased volume in pharmacy network claims. Overall, PBM adjusted claims grew 6.4% in the quarter. Partially offsetting sales growth was 165 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 83.7%. In our Retail/Long Term Care business, revenues increased 12.5% in the quarter to $19.9 billion, driven primarily by strong pharmacy same-store sales growth as well as the addition of the Omnicare business. Retail/Long Term Care exceeded our revenue guidance primarily due to the addition of the Target assets, a couple of weeks earlier than planned as well as a lower generic dispensing rate than expected. During the quarter, GDR increased by approximately 155 basis points to 84%. Turning to gross margin, we reported 17.7% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 15 basis points compared to Q4 2014, and again, consistent with our expectations. Within the PBM's segment, gross margins improved approximately 45 basis points versus Q4 2014 to 5.6% while gross profit dollars increased 20.5% year-over-year. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increases in volumes, the improvement in GDR, and favorable rebate and purchasing economics. Partially offsetting these drivers was the impact of client and drug mix as well as continued price compression. The improvement in gross margin rate in the PBM was primarily due to the timing of Medicare Part D profits. Now gross margins in the Retail/Long Term Care Segment was 30.2%, down 125 basis points from LY. The decline was primarily driven by continued pressure on reimbursement rates and to a lesser degree the addition of the Omnicare business, which carried a lower margin than retail. Partially offsetting these were the increases in GDR and a strong front store margin improvement, aided by continued rationalization of our promotional strategies and improved product mix. Gross profit dollars increased 8% throughout the quarter. Turning to operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate, the numbers that I'm citing exclude acquisition related costs and the legal charge where applicable. Total operating expenses as a percentage of revenues notably improved from Q4 2014 to 10.7%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved 10 basis points to 1.3% and SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail/Long Term Care Segment improved significantly by 190 basis points to 19.4%. This was driven by lower advertising costs due to last year's rebranding campaign following our tobacco exit, lower legal costs, and the addition of the Omnicare business, which carries lower SG&A relative to sales. Within the corporate segment, SG&As were up approximately $10 million to $215 million within our expectations. Operating margin for the total enterprise improved approximately 75 basis points in the quarter to 7%. Operating margin to PBM improved by approximately 55 basis points to 4.3% while operating margin at Retail/Long Term Care Segment improved approximately 65 basis points to 10.7% on our adjusted basis. For the quarter, operating profit growth in each segment was in line with expectations, with the PBM increasing a very solid 26.8% and the Retail/Long Term Care Segment growing 19.8%, again on our adjusted basis. Going below-the-line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $145 million from LY to $276 million, due primarily to the debt associated with the acquisitions that we took on last year. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 38.9% and our weighted average share count was 1.1 billion shares. For the year, our effective tax rate was 39.1%, just slightly lower than expected. So with that, now let me touch on our 2016 guidance, which again remains essentially unchanged from Analyst Day. You can find the details in the slide presentation that we posted on our website, but I'll focus on the highlights here. In 2016, we continue to expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share which excludes amortization in the range of $5.73 to $5.88, reflecting very healthy year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is still expected to be in the range of $5.28 to $5.43. Keep in mind that we have not included any estimate of integration costs from Omnicare nor Target in either range. We'll of course report those as we progress throughout the year, but they are excluded from our guidance. We expect consolidated net revenue growth of 17% to 18.5%, reflecting solid growth across the enterprise, and we expect consolidated operating profit margin to decline by 40 basis points to 50 basis points. The first quarter guidance also remains unchanged. We expect consolidated net revenue growth of 17% to 18.5%. And as you may recall, we highlighted several timing factors at Analyst Day that affect the cadence of profits delivery throughout the year. And while 2016 is expected to be a strong year, the cadence of profit growth is expected to be significantly back half weighted. We expect adjusted earnings per share which excludes amortization to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.17 while GAAP diluted EPS from continuing ops is expected to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.06 in the first quarter. Additionally, our free cash flow guidance for the year, which includes acquisition related activities, remains in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. In closing, I want to say that I'm very pleased with the company's significant cash flow generation capabilities. I believe these capabilities will continue to play an important role in driving shareholder value over the long term. To that point, 2016 will be another year in which we demonstrate our ongoing commitment to returning value to our shareholders through both share buybacks as well as through the increase in our dividend. And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thanks, Dave, and let me just reiterate how pleased we are with our strong performance across 2015 along with the continued progress that we're making in leveraging our integrated assets at CVS Health that's bringing innovative channel agnostic solutions to the market. I also want to take a minute to thank and recognize the efforts of our more than 240,000 colleagues that are committed to our purpose and working hard each and every day helping people on their path to better health. So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question coming from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Lisa C. Gill: Hi. Great. Thanks very much, and good morning. Thank you very much for all the detail. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things. The first of which is maybe can you talk about the 2016 opportunities for uptake in some of the different programs, whether you talk about specialty on both sides? Larry, you talk about the opportunity at Target to bring people into your specialty program, Maintenance Choice, et cetera. What do you have specifically in the guidance? And then secondly, Jon, can you talk about again as you think about what people are taking on in 2016 whether it's National Preferred Formulary or Specialty or some of the other programs that we see, and as we move throughout the year, what's some of the opportunities are? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Lisa, good morning. I'll take the first part and then flip it over to Jon. As you think about, Lisa, the benefits from the acquisitions, we touched on it at a very high level in the prepared remarks. If you look at Omnicare, we've got a number of pilots that have just begun to kick off that would focus on the revenue synergy side of the equation, acknowledging that we see opportunities across the spectrum in skilled nursing, assisted living and the independent living spaces. And I think as we've been talking for quite a while now, those opportunities will really manifest themselves across our retail business. So I think again, it's early in the process, and the benefits that we'll see from that, we don't expect to begin to come online until the second half of the year. And I think, Lisa, it's a similar story with Target. We've got a lot of heavy lifting to do when you think about the store and system conversions, 1,700 of those. At the same time, we've had a lot of practice with that. And as I mentioned in the remarks, the pilot stores have gone extremely well. So we are now in rollout mode, and it'll take the better part of the next six months, seven months to complete those activities. So that's really when you'll begin to see the marketing efforts ramp up. So the benefits that we'll see from beginning to create customer conversion within the Target stores with the Target guests, again, I think that's going to be more of a second-half impact. Lisa C. Gill: And, Larry, is the right way to think about this is that this will be a multiyear growth opportunity from margin as well as rolling out these programs, so it's not just the back half of this year but to layer on to this over a multi-year period? Is that the right way to think about this? Larry J. Merlo: Lisa, that's exactly the right way to look at it, because again, it's going to take time to market and on both, whether we're talking about Target or Omnicare in terms of the opportunities. So it will phase in over time, and you're right, we see it as a multiyear opportunity. Lisa C. Gill: And that's... Jonathan C. Roberts: And then, Lisa, as far as what we're seeing in 2016, as you recall, back in 2014, we saw double-digit pharmacy trend. That was primarily driven by branded inflation, branded price increases, and we're seeing that same dynamic in 2016 as well. So clients have never been more open to adopting plan designs to control these costs. And I'd really think about that it in three primary buckets. First is channel. So the ability to adopt our Maintenance Choice programs which were now up over 23 million members participating in that program and network solutions, preferred network solutions for Medicare as an example, and narrowing the network in commercial and managed Medicaid. So continue to see lots of interest in those plans designs. And also, lots of interest with formulary plan designs, and we offer options from excluding formulary for our template clients. We introduced that back in 2012, all the way to much more aggressive formularies where we essentially take most of the brands off the formularies that really is the most effective tool we have to managing trend because it gets rid of the branded inflation. And then the third primary bucket is really all the solutions we have in specialty from exclusive specialty to site of care to aggressive formulary solutions and specialty. So we do continue to see a lot of interest. We see employers able to make decisions faster in adopting these plan designs. We do see health plan much more interested than they've ever been in these plan designs, but their adoption rate is slower. They may have to sell these plan designs into their downstream clients. And as you recall, as our clients adopt these plan designs and we lower their costs, we generally see more share move into our channels. So it clearly is a win-win. Lisa C. Gill: Is there any way for you or for Dave to actually quantify some of these numbers. You talked about Maintenance Choice being in 23 million members, but can you give us an idea of how many people have adopted this year to go into more of a narrow formulary or any, your narrow specialty or any of those other things? Just so we can get an idea of what the progression has been like and what we should expect it to look like in 2016? David M. Denton: Lisa, we don't disclose that information at this point in time. So unfortunately we can't do that right now. Lisa C. Gill: Okay. I had to try. Thanks, Dave. David M. Denton: You're welcome. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Lisa. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys. Larry J. Merlo: Good morning, Ed. Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) So I have a question for you on the retail gross margin. Just the headline number itself, the decline was a little bit more I think than what the Street was looking for and obviously the Street number maybe wasn't right. But I guess the question really is how do you think about you mentioned reimbursement rate pressure, how do you think about reimbursement rate pressure look this quarter relative to trend and your expectation? And was the margin this quarter really any different than what you were sort of thinking about going in? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Ed, it's Larry. It's a great question. I mean what we saw in the fourth quarter, Ed, was consistent with our expectations and, quite frankly, consistent with what we saw in the third quarter. And as we've been talking about the reimbursement pressure, the way we think you should be looking at this is we're not seeing really any dynamic change in the cadence of reimbursement pressure. As we look forward into 2016, we've got the ebbs and flows in terms of the offsets that exist in terms of how we can leverage against that reimbursement pressure, and we outlined many of those variables at Analyst Day last month. David M. Denton: Yeah, Ed, this is Dave. I'd begin \u2013 consistent with what Larry said, is that our gross margin was in line with our expectations, but a couple of things to just note is obviously we added the Omnicare business which carries a little bit lower rate. Secondly, our GDR, as we said, was a little light in retail as brand was a little heavy. So therefore that affected the gross margin but still well within our guidance expectations. Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Okay. And just one quick follow-up here for you on the upcoming or current PBM selling season. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about how the opportunity looks from a mix standpoint? So last year, you had a lot of success, right, a lot of it was in the health plan side. How does the mix of the opportunity look like in the current year coming up? Is there potential for more self-insured employer type wins? Any color that you can provide there would be good. Larry J. Merlo: Well, Ed, again, it's early. I mean, as we look at where we stand at this point in time, the RFP activity is probably on par with what we've seen in prior years. If you looked at our renewal business, we've got about $22 billion up for renewal. There is nothing out of the norm in terms of it skews within a segment one way or another. So we kind of view it as just a normal selling season, and I'll flip it over to Jon and see if he has any. Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah, remember, we had just $14 billion selling season with 80% of it health plans but we still had a very successful selling season with employers and with state government. So if our win rate returns to a more normal selling season, I think the mix that you'll see will be more normal than what we saw this past year. So we're expecting a very active selling season. Obviously, the health plans are out now and we expect the large employers and the state plans to be out over the next several months. Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Great. Thanks, guys. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thanks, Ed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Eric Percher with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Eric Percher : Thank you. Eric Percher and Meredith Adler here from Barclays. So maybe staying with the health plan topic, I guess, my first question would be, are there unique challenges in on-boarding this level of or this magnitude of health plan customers or is the primary challenge getting the margin and getting the adoption that you want to occur over the year? And then also, have there been particular tools or studies on adherence on cost over the last year that you've seen really drives the adoption and wins in the health plan segment? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Eric, it's Larry. Maybe I'll start then ask Jon and Dave to jump in. Eric, in following your questions there, in terms of on-boarding, those clients, again, I think the investments that we've made over the last couple of years from a technology and process and organization alignment I think have really paid off the last two welcome seasons. Back to my prepared remarks, you think about the fact, 9 million new members, this past January, 16 million new CVS Caremark lives over the last two years combined with very high levels of service. We are extremely pleased with the work of the organization in terms of on-boarding those clients with no disruptions. So that has been checked the box there. I think if you go back to some of the things we talked about at Analyst Day, I think the challenge different than the employer segment is how we create more alignment with the health plan sales organization to sell in those unique and differentiated products and services, and begin to do some different things there in terms of creating better incentive alignment to allow that to be more of a priority among the many priorities that these health plans have. And I think we're beginning to get some traction around that. Jonathan C. Roberts: And .I think, this is Jon, on the adherence front, I think you just have to look at the Medicare Star plans and what they measure and about half of what they measure for MAPD as an example, was around adherence. And so we've done our own internal studies that say if you have 100,000 seniors, they have about $1.1 billion in overall healthcare costs, and if we could make every one of those members adherent to their medication and we could fill in gaps in therapy that they have then we could reduce the overall medical cost by over $200 million. So CMS gets this. This is why they weight adherence so heavily in their evaluation of plans, and nobody is better positioned than we are with our integrated channels to reach members and talk to them about adherence and improve their adherence, and that's why three out of four of the health plans that are in the Medicare business that we support are either four-star or five-star plans. And we see similar activity in the commercial space as well. Larry J. Merlo: And, Eric, just two other points reinforcing Jon's comments. We just published a study within the last couple of weeks that when you look at Specialty Connect, there is an 11% improvement in adherence for those patients who utilize that service. At the same time, reflecting on Jon's comments, when you think about some of the expectations that have been set for value-based reimbursement or outcomes-based reimbursement, whatever phraseology you want to use, and some of the targets that have been established for 2018 and beyond, I think our differentiated products and services are really in a great sweet spot to be able to deliver on those expectations. Eric Percher : Very good. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Eric. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. George R. Hill: Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Larry, if we come back to reimbursement pressure on the retail side, can you talk about the pockets where you're using the most pressure, either from a product perspective or from a payer perspective? We know the Med D books are competitive. We know pressure on generics is competitive. But I guess any kind of incremental color you give there would be helpful. Larry J. Merlo: Well, George, I would say it probably has more to do with the mix shift. Okay? And when you look at \u2013 as you look at pharmacy growth, we are seeing higher growth rates in government-sponsored care, Medicare and Medicaid. And as we've said, those segments, while very productive from a utilization and a revenue growth perspective, typically carry lower margin rates. George R. Hill: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe a quick follow-up is, Larry, I'd just love your broader thoughts around the growing negative drug industry rhetoric. It just seems to be getting more aggressive at every angle and targeting every participant in the system, whether it's Med D, you had the formation of the health transformation alliance last week, you have CMS taking another look at Med D it seems. I guess just how do you combat that? And how do you quantify the risks of more dramatic government intervention in the space? Larry J. Merlo: Well, George, listen, it's a great question. And when you think about responding to that, you really think about what clients hire us to do. Okay? And they expect us to work hard on their behalf in terms of how do we provide high levels of service for their members at the lowest possible costs. And we've talked about the variety of ways in which we do that, and we're very pleased with what we've been able to do. Okay? And the tools that we've been able to provide for our clients, again, they've got the option of how aggressive they want to be in terms of utilizing those tools. But we think the results of that will be reflected in our trend report that will be coming out within the next several weeks. Okay. And it's our focus. And I think, George, we've got to be careful that private-sector innovation I think has done a lot with which to satisfy the objective, right drug, right patient at the lowest possible cost. And if you look at Med D as an example, it was 2006. It's almost a decade later now, and when you look at the estimates of what CBO had predicted the cost of that would be 10 years ago, and what it's costing today, it's a fraction of that, which I think is one of the key reasons for that is private-sector innovation and the fact that competition ultimately drives down costs. So I think there's going to be a lot of crosscurrents as we go through an election year, and we'll just continue to work hard to tell our story and bring innovation in an effort to do what clients are hiring us to do. And quite frankly, we believe they are satisfied in what we're doing apropos to the new business that we've won the last couple of years. George R. Hill: Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question. John Heinbockel : Hey, Larry. A question about the sort of evolution of new customer acquisition. So when you look at on-boarding the 16 million lives here in the last two years, as they go into your system, you think about the first couple of years they are with you, is the growth rate with those customers, those lives, a lot higher than kind of more mature lives, right, because of all the different products you're selling to them, is that the case? And then in a case where you have 16 million lives over two years, if that's true, is that enough? You think of the growth coming from those 16 million lives, is that enough to move the overall enterprise growth rate in a visible way? Or no, just kind of blends into your historical growth rate? Larry J. Merlo: Well, John, it's Larry. I'll start and I know others will jump in here. John, your answer to that in part lies in terms of the client makeup and the client adoption of those differentiated services. So a client who is adopting Maintenance Choice and it's a new client, obviously we're going to see a rapid uptake of share coming into one of our distribution channels because that's the nature of that plan design. I think if you go back and, again, reflecting on some of the things we talked about at Analyst Day, this past year, a big piece of that new growth is in the health plan segment, and as you look at our enterprise share of those health plan clients, it's in the low 20%s. So obviously that creates a big opportunity, and that's something that will occur at a much slower rate than a client who adopts Maintenance Choice. So obviously a lot of opportunity, and opportunity that we'll see cascade over the life of that contract. John Heinbockel : So I mean this is not only, I don't know if this is the biggest two-year period of customer acquisition that you've had. I think it may be. It's not only that, but also the makeup and where you are with your programs. This actually is probably a more significant driver or could be than what you've seen historically. Right, because of the mix of the plans and where you are with your programs. David M. Denton: John, this is Dave. I think that's right. I would just caution you a little bit. If you look at the sales win, certainly for, as we cycle into 2016 largely health plan. Health plans, as Jon articulated earlier, it just takes a while for them to sell in their program. So obviously the name of the game here has been let's gain the life and then quite frankly make the life more productive as we move some volume into our channel and save the client money. In health plans, that just takes a little longer. I think the uptake, the ramp of that will just \u2013 the slope of that was a little \u2013 it's not as steep as, when compared to the employer clients. John Heinbockel : And then just quickly on Omnicare. When you think about market share evolution in the various sub segments they're in, so how do you think about that? Is most of the share gain I assume will be organic? Do you think M&A plays a role? And then when you look at share, say relative to your share in the retail business, ultimately down the road I would guess the share in long-term care would be substantially greater than what you have in the retail side or could be? David M. Denton: Yeah, John, it's Dave here. I do think that the market is still pretty fragmented, so I do think there is, I'll say, (50:45) type opportunities within the market space and you'll see us continue to probably do that within the long-term care business. And then I think as you look at the long-term care business, you're going to need to look at it in kind of different client categories. I think from a skilled nursing facility perspective, it's all about growing the number of beds, I think, from a assisted living facility it's really designing products and solutions that capture more of those members within the beds that we have while adding beds as well. But there's more of, I'd say, a product development set that needs to happen there for share capture and share gain. Larry J. Merlo: And, John, I think, the only thing I'd add that goes back to Lisa's question earlier, that there we've spent enough time with the long-term care clients to understand their pain points and their needs, and that's what's driving some of the pilots that we have underway. And I do believe that recognizing that to some degree long-term care is episodic, and you got 2 million patients that are being discharged each year back into the home. And being able to provide differentiated services for the client and the facility operator, okay, and then again, be able to follow those patients across their continuum of care is a significant opportunity to grow share, and again, that will continue to evolve over time over a multiyear period. But I think we're excited by the opportunities that we see there. John Heinbockel : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question coming from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question. David M. Larsen: Hi. Can you talk about your expectations for Hep C spend in 2016 and 2017? And as new products come to market from additional manufacturers, how can you help your clients reduce their overall spend while earning incremental profits for yourself? And then what sort of appetite is there from your client base in terms of pushing specialty spend from medical into pharmacy and using restricted networks more aggressively? Thanks. Jonathan C. Roberts: Hey, Dave. This is Jon. So Hep C volume I think has leveled off as we are into 2016, down a little bit from where we were last year. Merck launched their new product, had a list price $54,000, and that is less expensive than the other products on the market like Harvoni. So we'll evaluate these new products and negotiate the best deal for our clients, and we continually evaluate our formulary selections. And we'll do the same as these new products come to market. I think as we look out to 2016 or 2017, we haven't seen a lot of treatment in the Medicaid space. They've had real stringent utilization programs. So I think the question is as these drugs become more affordable, can we begin to see more treatment in that area, and the CMS came out with some guidance actually encouraging the Medicaid providers to do that. So you could potentially see an uptick in treatment if we see that movement from the Medicaid plans. I think as far as specialty, we see clients very interested in doing more to manage specialty under the medical benefit. It's not being well-managed today. So we have a tool if they don't want to move it over to pharmacy benefit, that's NovoLogix. We have over 30 million members that we're managing with that tool today, and it brings all the management that we have on the pharmacy side, but we also have an opportunity to move specialty from the medical side into the pharmacy benefit. Not that you'll ever get the majority of it over there, but there are opportunities to do more. David M. Larsen: Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Mark Gregory Wiltamuth : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the specialty growth of 32%. Was that inclusive of Omnicare? Or Omnicare about 5% of that number? Just if you could give us the organic growth rate, that might help. And then is there any way you can really characterize how much the Specialty Connect is helping you with customer acquisition? Because I would imagine that's helping keep some of those specialty customers from leaking out to other channels as you capture them on the front. Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Mark, the 32% growth does include the ACS, the Specialty component from Omnicare. It was a relatively small piece of the growth. I'll ask Jon to comment in terms of the market reaction to Specialty Connect. Jonathan C. Roberts: Specialty Connect really opened up a pain point in specialty that exists in the marketplace today, and that's access. So now a specialty patient can walk into any one of our 9,600 retail pharmacies and get the same high levels of service, because we've integrated them into our backend specialty platform. You get the same high levels of service. We see similar adherence. So it's been favorably received by specialty patients. And how we know that is it acts very similarly to Maintenance Choice. We see half the patients want to pick up their specialty prescription at their local CVS that are using Specialty Connect, and the other half want to mail to their home. So it really opens up the convenience. So for our clients where we are the exclusive specialty provider, it enhances service. It's enhancing revenue from the open market, where we are competing with other specialty pharmacies. So physicians that are much more active in referring patients in the specialty space than in the non-specialty space like the capabilities and the service that we deliver. So we think it's a real competitive advantage in the marketplace. Mark Gregory Wiltamuth : And any rough volumes you are doing there that are going through the pharmacy itself? I know you said 50%, but what's the volume number coming through there? Jonathan C. Roberts: Well, it was 50% of the members that are coming through Specialty Connect. 50% of them want to pick up their Specialty scripts at CVS Pharmacy. So it's not \u2013 just to be clear, it's not 50% of our overall volume. Mark Gregory Wiltamuth : Okay. Larry J. Merlo: And Mark, the other thing I'd just point out as a reminder, okay, this gets back to our focus on managing the CVS Health Enterprise because from a financial point of view, everything that Jon articulated, whether the point of access is the retail pharmacy, from a financial point of view, it goes through the PBM segment. And we're not worried about \u2013 in this example you could say we're penalizing the retail pharmacy. We don't look at it that way because we believe it's a unique and integrated product that is allowing us to capture incremental share in the market, which is good for the CVS Health Enterprise. David M. Denton: Hey, Mark. This is Dave. I just \u2013 back to your original question about ACS. If you look in specialty for the full year, growth rate was approximately 34%. If you excluded the specialty that came through, ACS through Omnicare, growth would be above 30%. Mark Gregory Wiltamuth : Okay. David M. Denton: So fairly small impact from a growth rate perspective. Most of the growth's coming from the core. Mark Gregory Wiltamuth : Okay. Thank you very much. David M. Denton: Welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah, hi. Good morning. Couple of questions here. First of all, front-end comps are holding really well in December. We're hearing a lot of questions about recession and impact to consumer behavior. Maybe you can share with us what you're seeing kind of like year-to-date into February in the stores from a consumer behavior side? Helena B. Foulkes: Yeah, I would just say overall I'd say things are holding fairly steady. We certainly have seen the consumer \u2013 I wouldn't say any change, really, from what we were seeing in the fourth quarter. I think the big thing we've been focused on and continue to focus on is being smart about where we invest our margin dollars, so you can see us continue to downplay our circulars and really focus on ExtraCare, which is allowing us to find those high-value customers and make sure they're coming into our stores. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And then on the 2016 cadence, obviously, Dave, the year is second half loaded. So can you just remind us what are the drivers that will kick in later in the year, when we're going to see kind of like the accelerated earnings growth? And just to make sure in terms of the cadence, can you maybe kind of like just help us clarify to make sure we get it right on the model, kind of like how we should think about kind of like what percent of earnings is going to be in the first half versus second half? David M. Denton: Yeah, from a cadence perspective, a lot of \u2013 I'll point you back to a couple of slides that I put together at Analyst Day back in December, but it really relates back to, one is the acceleration of growth from a Medicare Part D perspective, and as that growth occurs those profits are back half weighted, so that clearly tilts the cadence delivery, profit delivery, to the back half versus the first half. Secondly, we have several initiatives underway, both as we look at the acquisitions but more importantly as we look at different efforts that we have across our business. Many of those initiatives deliver benefit in the back half versus the first half, and probably most importantly is the timing and cadence of break-open generics. Those are largely back half weighted, so you'll see the impact of that flow through in quarters three and four versus Q1 and Q2. So those are the major elements of how to think about that. We have not broken out specifically the percent of front half versus second half. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. Thank you. David M. Denton: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Larry J. Merlo: Charles? Operator : Mr. Rhyee, we cannot hear you. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Why don't we go on to the next one? Maybe Charles will get back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott A. Mushkin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to get back into a topic that was earlier on the call, just talk about the healthcare plans and up selling your guys' products and services through them. I guess what are the mechanisms that you can use to get the healthcare plans to \u2013 or the incentives you can use to get them to do it? And then also, kind of a corollary, is the pressure on healthcare costs, we talked about the election, does that actually help you? You obviously guys have very good cost-saving tools. And then the final part of that is should we think of any upsells as more impacting 2017, or can that actually help 2016? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Scott, it's Larry. Let me take the last question, and then I'll flip over to Jon, okay, back to the first question. I'm going to go back to a slide that we had at Analyst Day that show that \u2013 and I mentioned this in response to an earlier conversation. The health plan business that came online last month, we have 22% share across our distribution channel. When we look at the overall health plan enterprise share, it's right around 28%, okay, for existing health plan clients. So again, there is an awful lot of white space as we've been talking about in terms of opportunities to grow that, acknowledging that that growth is over time. We talk a lot about the fact that when you look at the employer segment, with the stroke of one's signature, the Head of HR, and the Head of Benefits, can make a decision that several thousand employees are governed by. And as we've been talking this morning, it works a lot differently across the health plan space. So with that context, I'll flip it over to Jon. Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah, so with our health plans, they have their own downstream clients, and their downstream clients are no different than our clients that pharmacy is a bigger part of their healthcare spend than it's ever been and it's the fastest-growing part of their healthcare spend. So they are very interested and motivated to sell our products and services to better manage these costs. What we have been able to do over the last 12 months to 18 months is actually create financial incentives for the health plan sales team to actually create compensation for them as they sell these programs in. So their clients win, they win, and we win. So we think we've got very good alignment with our health plans now, and they are very motivated based on what's happened in the marketplace over the last several years to get these plan designs implemented. Larry J. Merlo: And, Scott, your other question, just does the election have any impact in terms of how clients look at this, I don't think it does. Okay? I mean, I think whether it's a health plan client, an employer client, everyone is focused on \u2013 listen, how do I provide the right level of service for my members at the lowest possible cost. So I think what we're seeing play out every night on TV I think is kind of irrelevant to their goals and objectives. Scott A. Mushkin: And a quick follow-up to that, Larry. Do you think the \u2013 because you guys do save people money, do you think an economy that maybe has a little trouble could actually help you upsell? And would it come through, I guess, it comes through your pharmacy comps where we'd see some of this. Is that correct? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah. Scott, I think it does, because we've got products and services that I know as our Head of Sales talks about. I could remember years ago when I was out selling the dream of what we might be able to do, and today I'm selling the results of what these products do. So they've been proven to when we think about access, quality and cost, we can sit down and quantify those benefits around each. Scott A. Mushkin: All right. Perfect. Thanks very much. Appreciate the answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Steven J. Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning, Larry and Dave. So just a couple of quick ones for me. First, I think the new AMP based FUL reimbursement is finally going into effect on April 1. Any expected impact on your retail labs? I know Medicaid was just a small part of the mix but also maybe just for Omnicare in particular, given that might be a little bit larger part of their mix, curious to get your thoughts on that. Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Steve, it's Larry. I mean, when you look at \u2013 keep in mind this is now probably 10 years in the making that as you look across the states, about half of the states have already implemented some type of acquisition cost based reimbursement or Managed Medicaid. So they are immune to AMP. And I think it's consistent with what we've been talking about that the objective of AMP, we have been seeing for the last several years in the form of reimbursement pressures. I think as you look at the remaining states, they'll be \u2013 it's our understanding that states will have 12 months with which to implement some type of acquisition reimburse \u2013 acquisition cost reimbursement model, and along with corresponding changes in dispensing fees. So I think as we sit here today, we think, we believe that the rollout across the rest of the country with this will be immaterial to our results. But again, I think that's going to play out on a state-by-state basis, acknowledging that states that have implemented that have made adjustments in dispensing fees, and so more to come on that. Steven J. Valiquette: Okay. And then the other quick one, I'm not sure if you heard, but there is a large health plan PBM contract to the marketplace that maybe you guys do a market check with one of your peers. My other question on this is just curious if you have any general thoughts you want to share on the situation from the CVS Caremark perspective. Or do you prefer just to leave that alone? I thought I'd just throw it out just in case you wanted to comment on that. Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, you know what, Steve? I guess I'd answer that question by saying, nice try. Okay? Steven J. Valiquette: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: All right. We've got \u2013 I think we'll go ahead and take two more questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert P. Jones: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess just to go back to the retail gross margin question. If I recall, you guys were calling for a moderate decline in 4Q. And it sounds like the results this quarter were, if I'm hearing you correctly, in line with your expectations. I think we were down about 125 basis points year-over-year. I think if I look out across 2016, this obviously seems to be a metric that obviously can be pretty volatile, move the needle for folks. The guidance for 2016 is down significantly. Not to get too cute (1:10:06) with the words here, but should we take that to mean that you're expecting the core retail gross profit margin to be down more in 2016 than kind of what we saw in 3Q and 4Q of 2015? David M. Denton: Well, this is Dave. We stand by our guidance. We, as we look at the trends going through where we are today, we see nothing that's any different. Again, this continues to be an evolving marketplace driven largely by the mix of our business. Medicare and Medicaid continues to accelerate and grow more rapidly than some other lines of business. Secondly, as we indicated before, is with the large win in the health plan business from a PBM perspective, the adoption of those programs that move share into our channel just take longer. It's longer for those to mature and for that adoption to occur. And so the offsets as we think about 2016 are just not available to us. Robert P. Jones: Okay. And then I guess just a follow-up actually on the last question. I'm not going to ask you specifically to comment on the very public negotiation going on with your large PBM competitor, but what I do think is important is the repercussions it could have on the 2017 selling season. So on that specifically, I'm curious if you guys would have any comments or questions or any early reads on some of the feedback you're getting from the market as far as what clients are asking for as far as pricing, given obviously, I think, this public negotiation has dragged a lot of things so far into the light, and obviously, could drag a lot more things into the light as we progress through the selling season. Jonathan C. Roberts: I mean this is Jon. We made a decision several years ago that health plans were going to be an important growth vehicle for us, particularly when you looked at the growth coming from Medicare and Medicaid. So we work hard to keep our health plans competitive in the marketplace. So we're not really seeing any repercussions or halo to pricing in the marketplace from that event. But I think it continues to be competitive but rational. And I don't expect there to be an impact. Robert P. Jones: Okay. Thanks for the questions. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thanks, Bob. Final question? Operator : Thank you. Our final question coming from the line of Mohan Naidu with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Mohan Naidu : Thank you very much for squeezing me in. Larry, maybe can we talk about the efforts that you guys are applying around the MinuteClinic? Is there an opportunity to expand beyond the basic services that you guys provide right now? And any leverage that it can use from your health system relationships in there? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Mohan, it's a great question. As we've stated previous, this past summer, we completed the rollout of our Epic EHR across all of our clinics. And that does a couple of things for us. One is it does provide an infrastructure that allows us to expand our scope and broaden our scope of practices. And you're beginning to see that now as we're getting into the treatment of some additional conditions. And that does create a tighter interface with the health system affiliations where we can transmit the information around a particular patient in a seamless fashion. So we're beginning to get some traction in terms of triaging patients across the delivery of care. Mohan Naidu : That's great. Maybe just a quick follow-up. You guys are still targeting about 1,500 clinics by 2017? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, we've said that we have that target of 1,500 clinics. I think with the acquisitions, we may not hit that number by 2017. Obviously, we're going to be focusing on the Target integration, which includes about 80 clinics this year. So we may be a year or two behind that original target of 2017, but we continue to be comfortable with the rollout. As a matter of fact, as we sit here today about 50% of the U.S. population actually lives within 10 miles of a MinuteClinic. Mohan Naidu : That's great. Thanks a lot for taking my questions, Larry. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thank you, and let me just take a minute to thank everyone for your continued interest in CVS Health and as always, if anyone has any follow-up questions, you can contact Nancy Christal. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Afterwards, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, the call is being recorded Tuesday, May 3, 2016. And I'd now like to turn the call over to Nancy Christal, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Nancy R. Christal: Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO. John Roberts, President of CVS Caremark; and Helena Foulkes, President of CVS Pharmacy, are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow up so we can provide more people a chance to ask their questions. Please note that we posted a slide presentation on our website before the call. It summarizes the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Later this afternoon, we'll be filing our Form 10-Q and it will also be available on our website at that time. In addition, note that during today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings, including the risk factor section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings. During this call, we'll use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance, including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP items to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year. And now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo Larry J. Merlo: Well, thanks Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to hear about the solid first quarter results we posted today. Adjusted earnings per share increased 4% to $1.18, that's $0.01 above the high end of our guidance. And total company revenues increased a very healthy 19%, also above our high-end guidance number. Excluding acquisition-related integration costs and the true-up of a legal charge, operating profit increased 5% enterprise-wide, with operating profit in the Retail/Long Term Care segment in line with our expectations, and operating profit in the PBM notably exceeding expectations. We generated $1.8 billion of free cash during the quarter and continued to return significant value to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Now it's still early in the year, so we are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance range that we provided to you at our December Analyst Day, and Dave will get into the details of our results and guidance in his remarks. So let me turn to the business update, and I'll start with the PBM selling season. Since our last update, the expected revenue impact for 2016 has grown. With gross new business at $15.2 billion, net new business of $13.1 billion, both up about $400 million from our last update. And the vast majority of this increase relates to a new health plan client, which will increase our revenues in both 2016 and 2017. We also closed out the 16th selling season with the retention rate of 97.3%. Now, turning to the 2017 selling season, it's early, but we are off to a very good start. To-date, we have completed just over a third of our client renewals, which is pretty typical for this time of year. As for new business, our integrated model continues to resonate strongly and we've already had some nice wins. Prospective clients value our strong service and execution, competitive pricing, unmatched products and services, along with our ability to meet their unique needs. Now many of you've asked about the magnitude of the 2017 selling season, and at this point we are seeing more RFPs and potential revenues in the marketplace than we did at the same time last year. But keep in mind that it ebbs and flows throughout the season, and some of that could simply be timing. Now, given that it's still early and consistent with our past practices, we will provide a quantitative update on our next earnings call once we have a more complete picture of the selling season. Now, we held our client forum in late March, which was attended by about 900 people, and clients acknowledged that their top concern is cost management, with service running a close second. And I'm pleased to report that we have been able to deliver on both fronts. Now in this environment of rising healthcare costs, clients are looking to us for proactive cost management solutions that anticipate market changes that impact trend. And they are adopting more aggressive strategies, particularly formulary design and specialty management, to mitigate these trend drivers. Now, we believe we are offering our clients the most comprehensive suite of formulary choices to achieve their savings goals, while addressing member impact and transition to new therapies. In addition, specialty drug management has been emphasized in the plan design elections, and clients are looking for solutions for managing specialty in both the pharmacy and the medical benefits. Among our unique specialty management programs, we are seeing a growing interest in our infusion and site-of-care services as well as our medical claims management services. In addition, innovations in specialty include indication-specific pricing where the cost to the payer is aligned with a drug's effectiveness for a specific indication. In the first quarter, specialty revenues increased 23%, and our volumes continued to outpace the market. So through our unique suite of specialty capabilities, we remain highly focused on helping our clients manage costs and improve outcomes. Now let me turn to the Retail/Long Term Care segment, and I'll start with an update on the integrations of Target and Omnicare. The integration of the acquired Target pharmacies and clinics is proceeding according to plan, and as of the end of April about half of the 1,670 acquired pharmacies have been successfully converted to the CVS Pharmacy brand and systems. As planned, we expect that all store conversions will be completed by the end of this summer. And as the stores are converted and rebranded, we are launching our additional core pharmacy offerings, and these include Specialty Connect, ExtraCare Pharmacy Rewards, and our digital tools, and this is in addition to Maintenance Choice, which has been available since the transaction closed. So we're pleased with our early progress and remain very enthusiastic about this opportunity to drive growth. Turning to Omnicare, the Long-term Care Pharmacy business performed in line with our expectations, as we benefited from some of the anticipated costs and sourcing synergies. Currently, we are working to combine operational infrastructures and further develop programs to improve work-streams and enhance service delivery, and we're on track to complete the vast majority of the Omnicare integration activities by year end. Now, in addition to the integration work, we have several initiatives underway. We piloted and have already rolled out the use of CVS pharmacies as an extension of the Omnicare pharmacies to speed the delivery of first fills or emergency order prescriptions in the skilled nursing facilities. We're also currently piloting an integrated service offering to the assisted and independent-living communities where we can offer residents enhanced medication delivery options based on their preference and acuity level, all supported by our high-touch patient care teams. And with a targeted marketing approach that focuses on when people enter these facilities, along with our name-brand recognition, we are confident that we can increase our penetration in these segments. And pending the pilot results, this program will begin to roll out later this year. So with the combination of CVS and Omnicare, we remain very excited about our enhanced ability to serve seniors along their continuum of care. Now, moving on to first quarter results in the retail business, total same-store sales increased 4.2% and were positively affected by approximately 125 basis points due to the additional day related to leap year. Pharmacy same-store sales increased 5.5%. This was negatively impacted by approximately 360 basis points due to recent generic introductions and about 50 basis points related to the softer flu season. And the flu was pretty soft in the first two months of the quarter, but strong in March, somewhat mitigating the quarterly impact. Pharmacy comps were positively impacted by about 130 basis points related to the extra leap day, and pharmacy same-store prescription volumes increased 5.9% on a 30-day equivalent basis, continuing to outperform overall market growth. And our retail pharmacy market share on a 30-day equivalent basis was 23.9% in Q1, and that's up about 245 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago. And while the primary driver of share growth is the addition of the Target pharmacies, we continued to experience strong organic share growth as well. Now an important driver of script growth has been our clinical outreach programs, which have allowed us to continue to improve adherence and provide patients helpful reminders. Part of the strength of these programs has been the integration of our digital tools. And today, nearly 19 million people receive text alerts from CVS on a variety of topics, all of which help to enhance the service experience. Among other recent pharmacy innovations, ScriptSync at Retail is expected to continue to improve medication adherence and patient satisfaction. Since the launch, more than two-thirds of the patients offered ScriptSync have adopted the service. And with nearly 350,000 patients enrolled in ScriptSync during the first quarter, we now have more than 1 million patients enrolled since its launch in the third quarter of last year. In the front store business, comps increased 0.7%, and this includes the benefit of the extra day from leap year of approximately 105 basis points, as well as the shift of the Easter holiday from April last year to March this year, positively impacting front store comps by about 80 basis points. And the negative impact of a late flu season was immaterial to the front store in the quarter. Now, we've continued to pull back on broad-based promotions, which has resulted in fewer visits from lower-value customers. Front store margins once again increased notably in the quarter, benefiting from these efforts to rationalize our promotional strategies, along with growth in the higher-margin health and beauty businesses. So we continue to test, learn and refine strategies to achieve the optimal balance between traffic and profitable growth. Now, ExtraCare continues to reward our loyal customers with savings and we continue to leverage our ExtraCare data to create even more relevant and personalized communications. And we know that our top customers drive a disproportionate amount of our sales and margin, so while store traffic overall is down, our loyal customers are shopping frequently and driving our front store sales and margins. As for store brands, they represented 21.9% of front store sales in the quarter. That's up 100 basis points from the same quarter last year. And there remain significant opportunities to expand our share of store brand products by building on core equities in health and beauty and seeking opportunistic growth in other areas where we can provide customers a superior value. Among our recent front store innovations, we recently announced the partnership with Curbside to bring a new level of convenience to our customers. CVS Express is the industry's first retail solution that integrates Curbside's market-leading technology right into the CVS Pharmacy app. Customers can make mobile, in-app purchases from their local CVS Pharmacy and have the products directly delivered to them when they pull up to the store, all in about an hour with no added costs. This service is currently available in select markets including San Francisco, Charlotte, and Atlanta. And pending a successful pilot, our goal is to roll out the program to the majority of our markets later this year. This exciting new initiative really embodies the digital mission of CVS Health to make healthy lifestyles more accessible and convenient for our customers all across the country. Now turning to store openings, in the first quarter, we opened 24 new stores, relocated 14 others, closed five, resulting in 19 net new stores, and we expect to open about 100 net new stores for the full year. As for MinuteClinic, the Target integration was completed in 24 clinics, converting them to MinuteClinic's branding, electronic health records, systems and health offerings. And we expect the balance of the clinics to be converted by the end of the summer. We now operate 1,136 clinics across 33 states plus the District of Columbia and including Target, MinuteClinic's revenues increased 17.7% versus the same quarter last year, despite the mild and late flu season. Another digital innovation is what we call the hold my place in line online queuing tool that was launched nationally at MinuteClinic in late March, and this tool enhances convenience by allowing patients to view wait times online and hold their place in line through any digital channel. So MinuteClinic continues to advance in innovative ways to increase convenience and access to care. So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review. David M. Denton: Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will provide a detailed review of first quarter results, followed briefly with an update on our guidance. And as always, I'll start first with a summary of the various ways we continue to enhance shareholder value through our capital allocation program. Throughout the quarter, our quarterly cash dividend increased by 21% per share, and we paid approximately $470 million in dividends. Our dividend payout ratio currently stands at 31.9%, and we remain well on track to achieve our target of 35% by 2018. In addition, we have continued to repurchase our shares. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 22.4 million shares for $2.1 billion, or approximately $98.52 per share. So between dividends and share repurchases, we've returned approximately $2.5 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter alone. Looking forward to remainder of the year, we continue to expect to repurchase an additional $1.8 billion worth of our stock, completing the planned $4 billion in repurchases for the full year. Our expectation is that we'll return more than $5 billion to our shareholders in 2016 through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases. As Larry mentioned, we generated approximately $1.8 billion of free cash in the first quarter, and we continue to expect to produce free cash of between $5.3 billion and $5.6 billion this year. Turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.18 per share, $0.01 above the top our guidance range and 4% over LY. GAAP-diluted EPS was $1.04 per share. The Retail/Long Term Care segment delivered solid earnings within expectations, while the PBM segment posted profit growth above the high end of our guidance. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily driven by stronger-than-expected volumes and better purchasing economics within the PBM. With that, let me quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the first quarter increased 18.9% to $43.2 billion, and the PBM segment net revenues increased 20.5% to $28.8 billion. Given the large amount of new business that came on board on 1/1, this growth is attributable to the increased volume in pharmacy network claims, as well as growth in specialty pharmacy. Overall, PBM adjusted claims grew 19.4% in the quarter, partially offsetting the sales growth was 170 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 85.2%. In our Retail/Long Term Care business, revenues increased 18.6% in the quarter to $20.1 billion, driven primarily by the addition of Omnicare and the Target pharmacies. Solid pharmacy same-store sales contributed as well. This revenue growth was just below our guidance range, while script unit growth remained strong, the mix of branded drugs differed slightly from our plan, resulting in a lower average script price. To be clear, we have not seen a change in the level of branded drug inflation, it was simply mix that affected the weighted average script price. In addition, front store revenues were impacted by our promotional strategies in our non-health and beauty categories, as we gave up some lower-value customer traffic to drive an increasingly profitable front store sales mix. GDR increased by approximately 125 basis points to 85.7%. Turning to gross margin, operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate, the numbers, I'll cite, exclude non-GAAP adjustments, mainly amortization, acquisition-related costs, and a legal charge where applicable. Keep in mind that our guidance for the quarter also excluded these items. We reported gross margin of 15.6% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 135 basis points compared to Q1 2015. Gross profit dollars increased a healthy 9.5%, in line with our expectations. Within the PBM segment, gross margins contracted by approximately 45 basis points versus Q1 of 2015 to 3.8%. Primarily due to the mix of new business and price compression, partially offset by the GDR improvement and favorable purchasing economics. However, gross profit dollars increased 7.4% year-over-year, due in part to strong volumes, specialty pharmacy, the improvement in GDR, and again favorable purchasing economics. Partially offsetting these drivers was continued price compression. Gross profit dollars increased approximately 10% year-over-year in the Retail/Long Term Care segment, while gross margin declined approximately 225 basis points to 29%. Now about 40% of the decline in the gross margin rate was mix driven, due to the inclusion of the Omnicare and Target businesses that we acquired. The decline in gross margin was also due to continued reimbursement pressures. Gross margin was positively impacted by the increase in GDR, as well as increased front store margins due to our continued rationalization of our promotional strategies and improved mix of the products that we sold. Turning to expenses, we saw strong improvement in total operating expenses as a percent of revenues from Q1 of 2015 to 10.4%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved about 10 basis points to 1.1%, benefiting from the additional sales leverage. SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail/Long Term Care segment improved significantly by approximately 120 basis points to 19.9%. This too was driven by leverage from revenue growth, as well as the addition of the Omnicare business, which carries a lower SG&A relative to sales. Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $20 million to $209 million, slightly better than expectations. Operating margin for the total enterprise decreased approximately 70 basis points in the quarter to 5.2%. Operating margin in the PBM decreased approximately 35 basis points to 2.7%, while operating margin at Retail/Long Term Care decreased approximately 105 basis points to 9.1%. For the quarter, operating profit growth in each segment was in line with or better than expectations, with the PBM increasing 6.6% and Retail/Long Term Care growing 6.4%. Going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $149 million from LY to $283 million. This is due primarily to the debt associated with the acquisitions that we took on last year. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 39.3%, and our weighted average share count was 1.1 billion shares. Now let me update you on our guidance. I'll focus on the highlights and you can find the additional details of our guidance in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier his morning. As Larry said, we are confirming our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $5.73 to $5.88, which reflects strong year-over-year growth of 11% to 14%. We are very pleased with our strong performance year-to-date and it's still early in the year. With respect to GAAP diluted EPS, we are revising our full-year guidance to reflect the integration costs and the legal charge that we saw in the first quarter, which we explicitly excluded from our initial guidance. So we now expect GAAP-diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.24 to $5.39. Keep in mind that our GAAP guidance for future periods excludes the impact of acquisition-related integration costs and we will update for these costs that we incur throughout the year. In the PBM segment, with the better-than-expected increase in network volume from our new business in Q1 expected to flow throughout the full year, we are increasing revenue guidance by 150 basis points to a range of 21.75% to 23.25%. This increase takes into account lower-than-anticipated volumes of the Hep C and PCSK9 therapies. As a result of this, along with stronger expected purchasing economics, we are narrowing and raising the midpoint of the PBM's operating profit guidance by taking the lower end up 125 basis points, resulting in a new range of 11% to 13.25%. In the Retail/Long Term Care segment, we are lowering our revenue growth guidance and maintaining our operating profit growth guidance. The reduction in our revenue growth expectations reflects several factors, including our decision to discontinue certain RxCrossroads programs to more fully align this business with our focus on cost, quality, and access. Additionally, the reduction in revenue growth reflects the shift in the mix of branded drugs along with the earlier-than-anticipated launch of generic Nasonex, as well as slightly weaker front store sales trends as we continue to execute on our targeted promotional strategies. We now expect Retail/Long Term Care revenue growth of 13% to 14.25%, a reduction of 125 basis points on both ends. And we now expect total cost of 1.75% to 3%, while continuing to expect script comps of 3.5% to 4.5%. Despite the revenue change, we remain confident in our prior operating profit expectations, given the immaterial impact the changes I noted are expected to have on profitability. Consolidated net revenue growth is now expected to be 17.5% to 19%. With the increase in network volume and a higher GDR, intercompany revenue eliminations are now expected to be approximately 11.4% of segment revenues. And as the mix of generics increases within our Maintenance Choice product, we expect higher intercompany profit eliminations. This change essentially offsets the improvement in PBM operating profits. And as I said before, our free cash guidance for the full year remains in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. And with that, now let me provide guidance for the second quarter which excludes all acquisition-related integration costs. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.28 to $1.31 per share in the second quarter, reflecting growth of 4.75% to 7.5% versus Q2 of 2015. GAAP-diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.20 per share in the second quarter. Starting with Analyst Day and continuing over the past several months, we have been highlighting several timing factors that will affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout this year. I want to take a moment and remind you of those factors. The introduction and timing of break-open in generics, the timing of profitability in our Medicare Part D business, the timing of the benefits from our strategies to drive growth in their front end, and the timing of share repurchases and certain tax benefits were all factors expected to impact the cadence the most. And while we delivered a strong first quarter slightly above our own expectations, the cadence of profit growth is still expected to be very much back-half weighted. Our EPS guidance for the second quarter is very much in line with our budget and what we said at Analyst Day. All things considered, we see a ramp-up in growth and we still expect a strong back half of the year. Within the retail segment, we expect revenues to increase 15.5% to 17% versus the second quarter of LY, driven in part by the addition of the acquired businesses. Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 3% to 4%, while we expect total same-store sales to be up 1.25% to up 2.5%. The Easter shift out of Q2 is expected to have about a 20 basis point impact on comp growth. In the PBM business, we expect second quarter revenue growth of between 22% and 23.25%, driven by continued strong growth in both volumes and specialty. Consolidated revenues are expected to grow 18.5% to 20%. We expect retail operating profit to increase 5% to 7% and PBM operating profit to increase 4% to 8% in the second quarter. Consolidated operating profit is expected to grow 3.75% to 6.5%. In closing, I'm very pleased with our solid first quarter results and remain confident in our full-year outlook. As we noted when we gave guidance at Analyst Day, our growth this year will be back-half weighted and that is playing out just as we anticipated. We continue to expect to deliver solid growth in our core businesses, along with the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions and more importantly our growth will be very strong at the enterprise level. This growth will help us maintain and generate substantial free cash flow and we'll continue to execute on our commitment to return significant value to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thanks, Dave. Again, I think as you heard from Dave and myself, we're off to a solid start in 2016 and our distinctive channel-agnostic solutions are resonating strongly in the market as they continue to control patient and client costs, while improving health outcomes. And we continue to believe that we have the right strategy for success in this evolving healthcare marketplace. And with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed. Peter Heinz Costa : Thanks for the question, guys. I'd like to get to understand a little more about the second quarter guidance and some of the factors that you mentioned seem to mostly argue for improving dynamics over the course of the year towards the back half, but yet you showed stronger growth in Q1 relative to what you're sort of projecting for Q2. Can you help me understand what's making the pressure on Q2 or is it just some earnings move from Q2 into Q1? Help me understand what's going on there. David M. Denton: Yeah, Peter. This is Dave. I would say that our budget and our cadence of profit delivery in Q2 is essentially on plan with what we created at the beginning of the year. There's been no movement from that perspective. Again, all the factors that I cited are really first half versus second half versus first quarter versus second quarter. So again, our plan remains largely intact. Our EPS guidance for the second quarter is very consistent with our budget and our outlook as we created our plan for 2016. Peter Heinz Costa : Okay. Larry J. Merlo: Next question? Operator : Our next question is from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Please proceed. Charles Rhyee : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I just had a question around the Target stores and what you're seeing in terms of the traffic into the stores now that \u2013 in the ones that you've now rebranded in CVS relative to sort of what the volumes they were doing before. Have we seen a sort of a pickup there? Well, what do you see in terms of traffic around other stores, regular CVS stores outside of the Target areas? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Charles, I'll start and then I'll flip it over to Helena. But keep in mind that, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're about halfway through the heavy lifting part where we're rebranding the system conversion, everything to create the look and feel of a CVS, along with all the products and services that we offer. So, as I mentioned earlier, that work won't be done until the end of summer. And I'll flip it over to Helena to pick up from there. Helena B. Foulkes: Yeah, I would say we're pleased so far with the performance. I would start, actually, with the fact that we have a retention rate of those Target employees of over 98%. So the first thing we know when customers come into those stores is they want to know that their Target pharmacists are still with them, and so we feel very good about that. The store conversions are going well, as Larry and Dave said, and our service scores are strong. So we're coming out of these resets feeling good about the service experience. I would say it's too soon to see any impact on script trends. We're continuing to phase in our clinical programs, and we'll see more of that in the second half of the year. Larry J. Merlo: And, Charles, keep in mind that you won't see any broad-based marketing until we've completed the integration activities. So in terms of awareness and all of those things that ultimately drive utilization, you won't see that until the fall timeframe. Charles Rhyee : Yeah, I just wanted to see what the early kind of signals were, and is the purchasing seamless? Like if someone just bought like a wellness product that might be still under Target? Can they still pay for it at the pharmacy desk? Helena B. Foulkes: Yes, absolutely. Charles Rhyee : Okay. Helena B. Foulkes: It feels very similar to what it was before. We wanted to make sure that those Target guests have a great experience, and I would say our pharmacists in those stores are still out in the aisles and talking to patients and customers and so the feedback so far has been very good. Charles Rhyee : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Nathan Rich : Hi. This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Dave, I just wanted to go back to your comment on generic Nasonex coming a little bit earlier than expected. And it seems like there's a pretty kind of healthy calendar of new launches coming over the next several months. Just wanted to ask around the profitability of those launches; is there any reason why the profitability of the new generics that are coming this year would be any different than what we've seen in past years or maybe even a little bit better now that you guys are able to buy through Red Oak? David M. Denton: Yeah, Nathan. The profitability is, I wouldn't say better or worse, I think it's dependent upon how those products are launched. Many of those products are single-sourced generics and have an exclusivity period typically of several months. So during that exclusivity period, those products behave more like a branded product versus a break-open generic product. And again, our profits are maximized once those products break open. So if you just look at the cadence of delivery this year, a lot of those products as they come to market are in the exclusivity period. Nathan Rich : Okay. So the break-open period would probably be more kind of late this year and into 2017 for those drugs that are launching? David M. Denton: That's correct. You would see it happen late in the year, which is part of the cadence of our profit delivery, number one, and you'll see that wrapped into 2017. Nathan Rich : Okay, makes sense. And then if I could just ask one follow-up going back to your comments on the selling season. You guys highlighted an increase in RFP activity. Should we think about this kind of mainly coming from health plans, given where we are in the selling season at this point? And any color on kind of what you think is driving this kind of overall increase in RFP activity his year? Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah, Nathan, this is Jon. So, health plans are pretty much completed. They've made their decisions and we saw similar activity the prior years. So we're in the process of working through employer and government. It's really too early to say whether overall RFP activity is going to be up or it's just the cadence and the timing. But we feel pretty good about our value prop, and as we're out with clients, our integrated model continues to resonate. And you combine that with our high levels of service, it creates a compelling value proposition. So, as Larry said, we'll give you more details in August on our Q2 earnings call. Nathan Rich : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. George R. Hill: Good morning, Larry and Dave, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just talking about the retail pharmacy business for a second, two questions; first is, can you talk about the demand that you're seeing from the retail pharmacy side as it relates to preferred pharmacy networks and the impact on pricing? And then the second question is, post the close of the Target acquisition, have you guys seen any positive lift on reimbursement rates in the Target pharmacies now that they're owned by you guys? Larry J. Merlo: Yes, George, it's Larry. I'll start with your first question and in terms of the preferred Med D networks, George, I don't think there's anything new to reference from what we've talked about in the past. From a contracting perspective, we look at the makeup of the Med D population in terms of the, we call them the choosers versus the low-income subsidies and evaluate potential share shift against margin pressure as a determinant of our desire to participate in the preferred network. And from a consumer perspective, that carries the fact that the low-income subsidies are not subject to the co-pay differentials that you see in the chooser market and the fact that the Med D plans have a variety of options in terms of what those deltas are. So, I would say, at this point, we're not seeing anything that would surprise us from those guiding principles that I just referenced. George R. Hill: Larry, I'm sorry if I misspoke. I didn't mean to say Med D, I was thinking more about the commercial book and what's happening in the growth of some of the (39:56) exchange business and the Medicaid business versus Med D. I'm sorry. David M. Denton: I don't know that \u2013 George, this is Dave. I don't know if you've seen anything substantially different. The commercial business is probably hasn't adopted, I'll say, a narrow or preferred network as rapidly or as completely as Medicare has. In the Medicaid market, it's a little bit more narrow network focused and that's really where we as CVS Health from a PBM and a retail and a MinuteClinic perspective can really plugs into these Medicaid programs \u2013 managed Medicaid programs in a pretty meaningful way. And so I think it's a little bit of a sweet spot for us right now. George R. Hill: Okay. Larry J. Merlo: And George, on the second question, I'd just simply say that as we think about contracting, our retail pharmacy group is contracting for CVS Pharmacy in totality, which would include the Target pharmacies as well as our Long Term Care pharmacies. George R. Hill: Okay. Thanks for the color. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed. John Heinbockel : Hey, guys. So two things; you said the 40% of the retail margin pressure was the new business mix. I don't think the other 60% was reimbursement pressure or was that right? And just how would you characterize the reimbursement compression say versus a year ago? David M. Denton: Yeah, John, this is Dave. As I said, obviously 40% of the downdraft in the margin was related to the mix of the business which we acquired. John Heinbockel : Right. David M. Denton: The remainder of that is largely the effect of the reimbursement pressure within the marketplace. So that is in fact the case. You think about, we have been focused from a front store perspective on really, I'll say, tailing our promotional strategies to drive improvements in front store margin rate, and we've seen that play out at the \u2013 I guess at the detriment of probably some top-line trade off. Larry J. Merlo: And John, keep in mind as you've heard us reference that margin compression in pharmacy is \u2013 you really have two drivers behind it. You've got the mix change into some of the lower-margin businesses, principally Medicare and Medicaid. Again, very productive on top line, okay? And then you have on an apples-to-apples basis just the sheer step-down in profitability. So you've got both of those forces creating some downward pressure. John Heinbockel : Okay. And then secondly, different topic; when you think about creatively other ways for you to work with Target? And you're already obviously collaborating a little bit on with respect to the pharmacy, but you think about whether it be HBA, OTC, loyalty, are there any other ways creatively to \u2013 for you guys to work together, either kind of drive success in pharmacy versus HBA or is that \u2013 it really will end up being limited to pharmacy alone? Helena B. Foulkes: Well, this is Helena. It's something we talked a lot about with the Target folks, and essentially what we've agreed to is for right now all hands on deck and making sure that the pharmacy conversion goes really well. And as I said before, we're happy with where we are. There's a lot of work that goes into converting all of those pharmacies over and having a great experience. But we certainly think there are other opportunities for both of us when we think about, for example, loyalty, we think about different categories in the front where we have relative strength or Target has relative strength. And we haven't gone into the specifics of those because again we wanted to focus on the pharmacy, but those things could come down the road. John Heinbockel : Okay. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah, hi. Good morning. When you talked about kind of like the top line results in the retail segment, you talked a lot about kind of like the generic comps. But was wondering what you're seeing in the marketplace in terms of branded inflation, because there's some conflicting data points in the marketplace that we are hearing. That's one. And second of all, from your seat and all this data you see both kind of like the PBM side and the retail, so you have a very unique perspective. How do you think \u2013 what do you think we'll see in terms of just kind of like the branded price increases in the environment for the remainder of the year? And maybe even into 2017 in light of the controversy and the very public debate around the gross versus net trend. Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Ricky, it's Larry. I mean on the branded side, we're really not seeing anything out of the norm from \u2013 I mean, if you go back and look historically, this industry has seen branded inflation in the low-to-mid double digits, and so far this year, we're not seeing anything different than that. And really don't anticipate seeing anything different based on our view of the marketplace. I think what Dave was alluding to in his remarks in terms of brand mix that, again, no change in the inflation or in the assumptions that we've made around that. And we may be seeing the impact of consumer-directed health plans in terms of driving some mix changes within brand where you can say that the patient is becoming more of a payer until they reach their out of pocket max deductibles. And this is really driving patients to lower cost brand options where a generic is not available. And that's why what we see is simply an impact on revenue, but not an impact on prescription unit growth or profitability. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And do you expect any kind of like changes in the gross product versus rebate dynamic on more of the longer term aspect? David M. Denton: Well, Ricky, this is Dave. I do believe as you've seen over the past several years, Jon and his team in the PBM have really introduced a pretty comprehensive formulary management strategy, and with the exclusionary strategy, you've seen us improve our rebates and therefore essentially as you know the vast majority of those rebates go back to our clients in the form of a buy down in cost, and I think we will continue to innovate in that category and that process to continue to drive value for our clients. Jonathan C. Roberts: And Ricky, just to add to this, this is Jon. I mean obviously we've demonstrated we can move market share based on access when we introduced our formulary strategy back in 2012. That has created a significant amount of value. But we've also evolved this strategy to begin to negotiate price protection so that as manufacturers raise prices, a portion of that comes back to our clients in the form of a rebate. And I think some of the next things we're beginning to see is contracting by disease state. So, as an example, in the autoimmune category, we might have one rate for drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis where you have 13 drugs that can treat that condition and a different rate for those same drugs that are prescribed for Crohn's disease where there is only four drugs in that category. So \u2013 and we see similar opportunities in oncology. So I think we're going to continue to see these negotiations and opportunities evolve, and we believe we're very innovative in this area and actually leading the industry. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Mike D. Otway: Hey. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Otway in for Scott. Thank you for taking the questions. I guess first question, I think mail choice was up 6.6% in the quarter, driven mostly by Maintenance Choice. Are you guys seeing some initial success with the health plan clients in adoption of the company's proprietary programs like Maintenance Choice or Pharmacy Advisor? I think, Larry, you said the new business won since the last update was a health plan. I'm just wondering what's driving that and what are you guys seeing? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Mike, it's Larry. I'll start and then Jon I'm sure will jump in. But if you go back and look at the new business, almost half of the new business adopted one of the Maintenance Choice programs. And I think consistent with what we've talked about in the past, we have begun to see some uptake of Maintenance Choice in the health plan segment, recognizing that that lifecycle is longer for the reasons that we've got to sell those programs through the sales organization and I think Jon's team has done a good job in terms of creating more alignment across all the stakeholders so that we have shared goals and incentives in that regard. Jonathan C. Roberts: And then, Mike, this is Jon. So we have begun to see health plans adopt this. I would say it's still slower than what we would like to see, so we think there continues to be significant opportunity to see even more adoption and a good place for health plans to start is Maintenance Choice 2.0 that has been very successful in the marketplace. And as clients get experience with Maintenance Choice 2.0, we see them move up to the Maintenance Choice 1.0 product that moves more the volume through the Maintenance Choice channel. So we're still very bullish on this plan design. Mike D. Otway: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you both. And I guess the next one probably for Helena. It sounds like the front end traffic is negative in the quarter and you guys pulled back on some promotions, targeted promotions. It's clearly a much smaller portion of the overall business these days, but to some extent it's how consumers see CVS. You guys have invested in Curbside, but Helena can you talk about the longer-term strategy in the front end to make sure that you guys are still continuing to stay relevant given things like online incursion and I guess ultimately what's your vision for how you want consumers to interact with the front end and with CVS? Helena B. Foulkes: Yeah, it's a great question, something we spent a lot of time thinking about because ultimately we see the role of the front store as essentially a door into the pharmacy. This is where consumers get connected to CVS, and ultimately over time, they start using us for prescription. So it's a very important part of the business is consumers think about us. And it's why we've been shifting more and more of our focus towards health and beauty. Because when our customers think about healthcare, obviously they think pharmacy first, but they think health and beauty. And so we're in the process essentially of putting more and more effort around the health and beauty businesses and our top customers. Those have been the thrust of the two places we spent time and energy. And I'm actually quite pleased with where we are. And if you look at our health and beauty category, for example, we continue to grow share across the marketplace in health and beauty. Now, where we're pulling back are the categories Dave was speaking to earlier, it's the promotional business where it might be edibles or general merchandise, not categories we need to win in from the consumers' perspective as we think about healthcare. So I think that piece of it is sort of generally how we're thinking about the role of the front. Connected to that is the role of ExtraCare and loyalty and personalization. So we know 30% of our customers drive 80% of our sales and profit. Again, we're focused on those customers, giving them more value, more reasons to shop. And we're very happy so far. We continue to see more trips and more sales and more profit from those customer segments. And then as you said, we certainly are looking very hard at the world of digital. We know that the consumer is living in an omni-channel world and we need to be relevant. We're excited about Curbside because we thought to ourselves we don't need to out-Amazon Amazon. We certainly have an e-commerce play, but we really wanted to take advantage of 7,800 convenient locations and the fact that when the consumer needs health and beauty aid products or some milk on the way home from work or diapers, we're the convenient go-to location for her. So the fact that she can order online, let's say, from the office and pick it up on the way home and not have to get out of her car, we think is a very big winning proposition. And as Larry said, we're still in the early stages of testing that in some markets, but the research we've done with consumers is really quite encouraging. Larry J. Merlo: And just one other point to emphasize that when you drop the two acquisitions into our revenue denominator, the front now represents about 11% of our revenues. So it really affords us the opportunity to think about the front store in a very differentiated way with a different set of goals and objectives as Helena outlined. Mike D. Otway: That's really helpful. I appreciate the time. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Ross Muken : Good morning, gentlemen. So, as we think about just going back to the selling season, are you seeing any change in competitiveness within certain segments whether it be health plan or government or employer or any notable trends that are different year-on-year relative to benefit design requests or interest in one service versus another or some new program you have that's maybe garnering more traction? I'm just trying to get a feel for how all of the RFP interest in sort of your recent success can kind of translate to the ultimate outcome here? Larry J. Merlo: Ross, it's Larry. I'll start and then flip it over to Jon. But I'll just share my observation from our client forum an if you go back to our Analyst Day and remember the tool that Jon demoed, our RX insights tool that can provide real-time meaningful data for clients in terms of kind of where they're at and what they can do to bend that cost curve. There was a lot more discussion around that at the client forum. And my observation was a tremendous amount of excitement and enthusiasm in terms of the ability to make that very, very actionable and to serve as a decision tool for payers in terms of the options and choices that they have. Jonathan C. Roberts: Ross, this is Jon. The other thing I would add is, pharmacy is a meaningful piece of the overall healthcare cost now. So I think what's changed is the C suite is much more involved in the process than what we have seen historically. And I think what that's translated to is, very focused on cost, very focused on service, and that means that they're looking for a PBM that can implement plan designs and move their members to either new channels or new therapies, so much more of a focus on their members or their employees. And so as we're out in the marketplace, our integrated assets really position us to work with their employees or their members through all the touch points that we have to communicate and transition them to the new plan design. So this is really resonating I think to an even greater degree today than what we've seen historically. So I think from a competitive standpoint, not much change in what we've seen historically. But from a capability perspective, people are much more interested in what we can do to help them manage cost and deliver great service to their members. Ross Muken : That's helpful. And just maybe quickly, can you just update us, last year you had a very successful health plan selling season. One of the big focus points is sort of converting some of those new members into the drugstore into a Maintenance Choice-like program. How does that sort of progress? What are the key sort of benchmarks we should be looking at to sort of judge how much progress you're making there? Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah, well, so if we start with employers, I mean, no surprise there. They continue to move faster to these solutions. We've seen that historically. We continue to see that. I think health plans are much more interested than what we've seen in the past, but they do continue to make decisions at a slower pace. And they have to sell to their downstream clients. So we've done a lot to work with them on educating them on the programs, as well as incentivizing their teams to sell our products and services to their downstream clients. And it's a win for them if health plans can help their clients save money. It turns into a retention tool for them if they're doing a good job on their clients' behalf and it's a win for us. As they implement plan designs, we will generally see more share. So, I think the metrics that we've shown at Analyst Day around enterprise share will continue to be how we'll measure our success in this area. Larry J. Merlo: I do think as you think forward and if you look at the contributions from generics, okay, through a payer lens, the fact that they will still contribute but the year-over-year benefit is not going to be what it's been for the last couple years. I do think it's going to very much align to what Jon was talking about in terms of people looking at some of the things that have been available, but maybe I didn't need to go there because I had another avenue to achieve my objectives. So I do think that it will be looked at differently as we go forward, and I think the point that was made earlier in terms of we've worked hard to create more alignment around goals and incentives, I think we're in a good place with that in mind. Ross Muken : Makes total sense. Larry J. Merlo: Next question. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please proceed. Lisa Christine Gill : Hi. Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow up as to one of your comments, Larry, where you talked about more aggressive plan design, formulary, et cetera. Do you see incremental opportunities for mid-year plan design changes where it could actually impact the back half of this year? Or is that what you're seeing that was implemented for 01/01/2016 or is that your future thoughts on 2017? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Lisa, I'll start and flip it over to Jon. I do think, Lisa, there is the option for that to happen, largely because that design tool that I referenced earlier, it gives people real-time data. I do think that there are going to be some employer groups that are going to find that probably more challenging or difficult, especially if they have a bargaining unit, as an example. I don't think it would happen there, for obvious reasons. And I think that would break the paradigm that has existed within employers in terms of they've kind of got their cycle of when information goes out and then it gets updated on an annual basis. But there may be an opportunity to make some subtle changes along the way that I think could be meaningful. Jonathan C. Roberts: So, one example, Lisa is, particularly around as it pertains to formulary, we now are rolling out programs on a quarterly basis. So in April, we rolled out a dermatological bundle that really focused on UM programs to manage the cost in this area. So, I would say that helps clients manage their cost much more effectively, and they're willing to do that throughout the year as opposed to just once a year. And we'll continue to look for opportunities not just around therapeutic categories, but even specific drugs that we think we need to take action against. I think the broader moves, network moves, as an example, will probably still happen on the cadence that we've historically seen them occur. It's a little more disruptive, and they like to do that when they're making all the other changes. Lisa Christine Gill : And then I guess my second question would really be around the new Optum Walgreens Boots Alliance offering in the marketplace. Can you just comment, Jon, do you think that's going to have any impact this year's selling season, them trying to replicate or emulate something that you have at CVS? And secondly, Helena or Larry, do you see any of that impact in their ability to be able to shift scripts away from your CVS stores? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Lisa, it's Larry. I'll go ahead and start and then others may jump in. But I think, as you know, this is not the first time that a competitor has tried to create a Maintenance Choice-like program. And we've been able to effectively compete against those programs in the past. We're still the only ones with a fully integrated product, and you think about that integration, it applies both clinically as well as operationally. And Maintenance Choice is the only 90-day program that is truly channel-agnostic with the ability to realize the same enterprise economics regardless of the channel that the patient chooses. And our offering is becoming even more relevant with the addition of Target's 1,600 pharmacies into the Maintenance Choice network. And I guess just one other example of that clinical and operational integration, as you know, as we've talked about Specialty Connect, which is a more recent rollout, we've simply defined that as a Maintenance Choice product for the specialty patients. So, I think that's another proof point in terms of the real integration that exists that does provide elements of differentiation from those other programs that are attempting to mimic Maintenance Choice. Lisa Christine Gill : Great. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Lisa. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robert Willoughby from Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Hi. Just one. Larry or Dave, you mentioned that the CVS retail and mail penetration of the PBM volume had been in the 40% range. It obviously comes down after the big selling season you had last year. But could you hazard a guess maybe where that stands and how quickly you could ratchet that back up to the 40% range and any longer term target you might have for that metric? David M. Denton: Yeah, hey, Bob, it's Dave. We'll update that more broadly at Analyst Day coming up in December. I will say that as Jon indicated earlier, clearly we have a lot of programs that have been adopted pretty completely within our employer book, and that continues to resonate. The opportunity we have really is in our health plan book. And not all health plans are created alike. Those health plans that are largely Medicare focused will have a different solution set and product offering that we will sell into that group of health plans that will likely not have all the mechanisms to aggressively move share compared to health plans that are more, I'll say, commercially focused that can sell in Maintenance Choice as an example. So, they will happen over different cadences. I think clearly with the adoption of and the onboarding of a bunch of new clients on 1/1, our first job was to get them onboard, get their service levels at very stable levels, and then work to sell them new programs as we cycle into 2017, so probably more to come on that, Bob. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) And would there be a general rule of thumb I could think about, though, if you win X amount of business one year by the end of year three you'd kind of be at that range or is it just absolutely impossible? David M. Denton: I think it's impossible and the reason being is each one of those health plans, they have very different business models and they compete in very different business segments. And so again a Medicare dominated health plan, the share is going to move very slowly compared to a commercially dominated health plan. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Right. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Larsen from Leerink. Please proceed. David M. Larsen: Hey, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you talk a bit more about your indications pricing capabilities? It sounds to me like that gives you a bit of a head start with this proposed Part B rule that was recently published. And also can you talk about ScriptSync? Exactly what is that and how does that serve your client base? Thank you. Jonathan C. Roberts: Yes, David, this is Jon. So we're \u2013 I talked about the autoimmune opportunity RA for \u2013 where there's more drugs that treat that disease state, so more competition, we believe we can get better rebates versus Crohn's disease. I think there are similar opportunities in oncology. So we're still early, but we're working on that. I think again there's been a lot of talk about outcomes-based contracting. We think that is a good idea, but practically very challenging. So EHRs don't communicate with each other. Members move between health plans. The information often doesn't move with them. But we believe with the tools and capabilities we have that we're best situated to make progress in this area, and we're continuing to look at it and work it then \u2013 and we'll be able to talk more about it we believe on Analyst Day. Helena B. Foulkes: And then I'll pick up on ScriptSync. So this program is really as you can imagine the million people who signed up for it are basically those patients who are filling roughly four prescriptions or more per month, and as we did our research with them, what we saw and heard is their number one pain point is they've got a lot of complexity healthcare wise in their lives. The pharmacy is a piece, but there's other elements of it. So, they're making lots of trips to the pharmacy and that's hard for many of them. So a big solve for them is consolidating all of it. The way it works is we help those patients, and we line them up to one date per month, which they can come in. It sounds simple, but as you can imagine with all of the insurance plans out there, we've got to work behind the scenes to get them synced up. So that's sort of the hard part behind the solution from a consumer perspective. I think what's exciting for both the patients and the plans that we're serving is that ultimately this leads to very high consumer satisfaction and much higher levels of adherence. And that's ultimately the healthcare outcome that we were looking for as we developed ScriptSync. David M. Larsen: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Steve Halper from FBR. Please proceed. Steve P. Halper: I appreciate your comments on the Target pharmacies, but one point of clarification. Would you suggest that the performance of the Target pharmacies at least on a volume perspectives are equal to where they were before the acquisition? Jonathan C. Roberts: Steve, I guess you have to look at that based on timing from a seasonal perspective given year-over-year overlap with the flu. I would say we've not seen a material change in the volumes at this point in time absent that. Steve P. Halper: Of course. Thank you. Jonathan C. Roberts: Yep. Larry J. Merlo: Next question? Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mohan Naidu from Oppenheimer. Please proceed. Mohan Naidu : Thanks for taking my questions. This question maybe is for Jon or Larry. So given the focus from clients on the costs and an increasing mix of the specialty prescriptions, how are you guys seeing the change in the PBM landscape, especially with the smaller PBMs who presumably cannot impact the specialty drug cost as much as you guys can do? Is this coming up in an ongoing selling season with the clients? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Mohan, there's no question that size and scale in this business matters probably more today than it ever has, with costs in mind. And I do believe that, as we go through the RFP process, it starts with price and service, and you've got to be right there. And then we can certainly add to our offering with the differentiation that we provide in the marketplace. So, yeah, I do believe that if it is harder, if one is lacking size and scale to effectively compete. Jonathan C. Roberts: And then, Mohan, this is Jon. So, clients' biggest concern when they think about cost they're really thinking about specialty. And about half of their specialty spend is in the pharmacy benefit, which PBMs historically have managed. And the other half of the specialty spend is under the medical benefit, which is not being managed very well today by the health plans. The platforms that they manage specialty medical on just weren't built for managed drugs. So we actually have a capability to manage that benefit across the pharmacy in medical benefit. And we think about unit cost, Larry talked about that. And so size, scale, and capabilities really make a difference there. And we're seeing specialty drugs come to market and be limited to a few providers. So our capabilities enable us to have access to those limited distribution drugs. The other side of it is, what can we do clinically to manage the 3% of our clients' patients that are driving 25% of their overall healthcare costs. And so we've integrated a capability that allows us not to just manage the specialty prescription, but to manage that patient, not just with their specialty condition, but with all their comorbidities and we've demonstrated that we can reduce overall healthcare costs. So, as we tell that story to clients, it resonates and it's a \u2013 I think it's a key decision point for them as they're making a selection in the marketplace. Mohan Naidu : Thank you so much, Jon and Larry. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thank you. And we'll take one more question, please. Operator : And our final question is from the line of Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies. Please proceed. Mark Gregory Wiltamuth : Thank you. So wanted to ask a little bit for, Helena, on the front-end margins, do you think there's a case to be made for more margin discipline for the industry in general? You're clearly working a margin strategy here. Walgreens is trying to enhance their margins. And I'm also just curious if right aid has been behaving any differently while we're waiting for their deal to close? Helena B. Foulkes: Yeah, I think we're seeing a pretty rational marketplace, especially in the drugstore business. We haven't seen any major moves, I would say, the last six months or so. It may be even longer among our key drugstore competitors. And so I feel like it allows us to continue to focus on what I said before, which is driving profitable growth, focusing on that 30% of our customers where we really are seeing some nice sales and margin growth and being aware of the marketplace, but being rational as you said in terms of our approach here. David M. Denton: And, Mark, probably one thing that is a little different with CVS is just given our tenure and the depth of expertise we have from the loyalty card program, we know who our best customers are. We're engaging with them. And we design strategies that's allowed us to really tailor our market programs and our promotional offers to them. So we're probably in a different spot than some of the other industry participants at this point in time. I think we have the ability, if you will, and you saw it through this quarter to trade off a little bit of top line, but really focus our promotional dollars on those customers that really matter to drive margin expansion in the front. Mark Gregory Wiltamuth : And Walgreens is also emphasizing cosmetics and beauty. Do you feel that at all? You mentioned your share is still gaining there. But have you noticed them changing things and has that affected your sales at all? Helena B. Foulkes: No, I think that we continue to watch them. They're doing a nice job. But it's a big marketplace, and as I said, we're growing share in that category. Mark Gregory Wiltamuth : Okay. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Everyone, thanks for your time this morning, and again, we appreciate your ongoing interest in CVS Health. And if you have any follow-up questions, you can reach out to Nancy or Mike. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operation Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, August 2, 2016. I would now like to turn the conference over to Nancy Christal, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Nancy R. Christal: Thanks, Ivana. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I\u2019m here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Jon Roberts, President of CVS Caremark; and Helena Foulkes, President of CVS Pharmacy are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up, so we can provide more people with a chance to ask their questions. I have one announcement this morning. Our Annual Analyst Day has been scheduled for Thursday, December 15 in New York City. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to hear from several members of our senior management team, who\u2019ll provide a comprehensive update on our strategies for driving long-term growth. We plan to email invitations with more specific details at the end of the summer, but please save the date. Again, that\u2019s Thursday, December 15. This morning, we posted a slide presentation on our website, just before this call. The slides summarize the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Later this afternoon, we\u2019ll be filing our Form 10-Q, and it will also be available on our website at that time. In addition, note that during today\u2019s presentation, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings, including the risk factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings. During this call, we\u2019ll use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company\u2019s performance, including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the reconciliations of these non-GAAP items to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And, as always, today\u2019s call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there, following the call, for one year. Now, I\u2019ll turn this over to Larry Merlo. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thanks, Nancy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. And I\u2019m pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the strong second quarter results we posted today. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8.3% to $1.32. That\u2019s $0.01 above the high end of our guidance. And excluding acquisition-related costs in both years, operating profit increased 6.5% enterprise-wide, with operating profit in the Retail/Long Term Care segment in line with our expectations, and operating profit in the PBM exceeding expectations. We generated more than $1.1 billion of free cash during the quarter, more than $2.9 billion year-to-date and, as Dave will describe, we are raising our free cash flow target by $1 billion for the year. Now, given our outperformance this quarter and solid results year-to-date, we are raising and narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range. Excluding the costs associated with the debt tender and acquisition-related costs, we currently expect to achieve adjusted EPS for 2016 of $5.81 to $5.89, reflecting year-over-year growth of 12.5% to 14.25% and that compares to our previous range of $5.73 to $5.88. And Dave will discuss this guidance in more detail during his financial review. Now, let me turn to the business update, and I\u2019ll start with the PBM. The marketplace has been active. And I\u2019m pleased to report that with our differentiated value proposition, we see 2017 shaping up to be another successful selling season. We currently have gross wins of approximately $7.4 billion and net new business of approximately $4.6 billion. These new business numbers do not include any impact from our individual Med D PDP. I\u2019ll touch on that shortly. And I\u2019d also note that only about 7% of the gross wins relate to the previously-discussed transition of the Coventry commercial business, which was acquired by Aetna back in 2013. To-date, we\u2019ve completed about 75% of our client renewals for 2017. That\u2019s a bit ahead of where we were at the same time last year, and our retention rate is currently at 97.5%. Importantly, we have continued to win in the marketplace while maintaining our pricing discipline. Now, a lot has been said and written about the competitive dynamics of this selling season. And facts and realities can easily be lost or overlooked amidst the attention being paid to a few client shifts. So let me remind you of the things that have not changed in the competitive landscape, along with our ongoing strategic advantages. As you look at our key points of differentiation, we see consumer-directed healthcare gaining traction and points of access are critical. And our more than 9,600 pharmacies give patients immediate access to advice as they take on more responsibility for their healthcare decisions. And the data has shown the undeniable benefit of the face-to-face interactions for better adherence, reducing healthcare costs and improving health outcomes. And we have multiple patient touch points through our unique suite of assets, not just our retail pharmacies, but also mail, specialty, infusion, MinuteClinic and now, long-term care. At the same time, we\u2019re the only company with the ability to impact not only patients, but also payors and providers with our innovative channel-agnostic solutions. Maintenance Choice continues to be a truly integrated program delivering financial, convenience and clinical benefits to clients and members. It\u2019s not just about price. It\u2019s about enabling clinical programs that require deep integration of data. And our Health Engagement Engine serves as that enabler, so that products like Maintenance Choice cannot easily be replicated through a partnership or an alliance. Additionally, we have the broadest capabilities to holistically manage specialty, which continues to be a key area of focus for clients. We continue to outperform in this area, with specialty revenues increasing 22.9% in the second quarter. Clients continue to expect proactive, innovative, real-time solutions to manage their drug trend. And the Insights tool that we demoed at our last Analyst Day is unmatched and it delivers those real-time solutions for our clients. Furthermore, our scale and innovative purchasing strategies are unsurpassed, and they continue to drive meaningful value for our clients. So in summary, those are just some of the factors that have differentiated us in the past and continue to drive our success this selling season. And we\u2019re certainly not sitting still as we continue to find new and innovative ways to drive value for patients, payors and providers. I also want to note that we continue to offer our clients cutting-edge solutions to formulary management as we believe it is one of the most effective ways to manage rising drug costs while ensuring access to clinically-appropriate care. And our 2017 formulary management strategy continues to address emerging cost drivers with new market-leading enhancements, which we have just announced to our clients effective this coming January. And given the growing number of supplemental indications for many drugs, we will be creating opportunities for additional client and member savings through an indication-based formulary. And on a quarterly basis, products with significant cost inflation that have readily available, clinically-appropriate and more cost-effective alternatives may be evaluated and potentially removed from the formulary. So effective January 1, 2017, we expect to remove 35 products from our standard formulary, including 10 hyperinflationary products, as I just described. These formulary changes affect less than 1.5% of plan members, while helping to reduce costs for clients and their members. In fact, from 2012 through 2017, this rigorous approach to formulary management will help generate total savings of more than $9 billion for our clients without disrupting member care. And you can find an overview of our strategy, along with the 2017 formulary details, on the Investor Relations portion of our website. Now, while it\u2019s too early to discuss the 2018 selling season, many of you have asked about the timing of the next FEP contract renewal. So let me clarify that the FEP Specialty business has a Request for Information in the marketplace for January 2018. However, the FEP Retail and Mail Order businesses, comprising more than 70% of our total FEP revenues of about $9 billion, have been extended until January 2019. Now, before turning to retail, let me touch briefly on our Med D PDP SilverScript. We currently have about 4.1 million captive lives in our individual PDP, about 1.2 million captive EGWP lives and we serve another 6.4 million lives through our health plan clients. So in total, we currently serve approximately 11.8 million Med D beneficiaries. Late last week, we received the preliminary benchmark results from CMS for 2017. And I\u2019m pleased to report that SilverScript qualified in 32 of the 34 regions. These strong benchmark results should enable us to retain the vast majority of the auto-assignees we currently serve, along with the ability to track new lives. And we\u2019re very pleased with these results. Now, moving on to second quarter results in the Retail/Long Term Care business, total same-store sales increased 2.1%, with Pharmacy same-store sales up 3.9%. This was negatively impacted by about 355 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Pharmacy same-store prescription volumes increased 3.5%; that\u2019s on a 30-day equivalent basis, continuing to outperform overall market growth. Our retail pharmacy market share, again, on a 30-day equivalent basis, was 23.9%. And that\u2019s up about 230 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago, driven by the inclusion of the Target pharmacies, as well as underlying share growth. Now, I\u2019m pleased to report that the Target integration has been completed ahead of schedule. We converted all 1,667 Target pharmacies, 79 clinics, to CVS systems, programs and interior branding. And this was one of our most smoothest integrations-ever, despite the complexity of the store-within-a-store format, and we certainly appreciate the strong communication and collaboration with our Target partners. So with CVS systems and branding now in place, we\u2019re ramping up our patient care programs, along with our marketing and member engagement campaigns that are expected to increase awareness and utilization of CVS at Target. Our Long Term Care Pharmacy business through Omnicare continues to perform well and in line with our expectations. Our integration efforts are progressing as planned, and we remain on track to complete the vast majority of the integration activities by year-end. Now, in addition to those integration activities, we\u2019re working with our Long Term Care clients to address the currently unmet needs of their residents, all with the goal of improving patient care and driving operational efficiencies. In Q1, we introduced the use of CVS pharmacies to speed the delivery of first fills and emergency needs to the facilities. This program continues to grow, and we now fill nearly half of all emergency scripts using a CVS pharmacy. In Q2, we began piloting our transition of care program to enable us to better serve patients as they transition across different care settings. And we also continue to pilot our integrative service offerings to the Assisted and Independent Living communities, offering residents enhanced prescription delivery options based on their preference and acuity level. So while there\u2019s still much work to do, we remain excited about our ability to enhance patient care in these settings. Now, turning to the front store business, comps decreased 2.5%, or 1.7% after adjusting for the negative impact of the shift of Easter from April last year to March of this year. We saw softer customer traffic, which was partially offset by a notable increase in basket size. And, at the same time, we saw notable front store margin gains in the quarter. Now, some of the traffic decline was expected as we continued to optimize our promotional spend for our lower-value, promotionally-oriented customers. In contrast, we saw front store spend and margin increase with our most valuable customers. And through our personalization efforts, we continue to deliver a value-based offering derived from longitudinal shopping habits, while increasing engagement through app and email capabilities. Now, keep in mind that our front store business accounts for about 11% of enterprise revenues, and these personalization efforts are allowing us to invest our promotional spend in a very differentiated way, producing a margin flow-through. And we\u2019ll talk more about these efforts at our Analyst Day. Now, we\u2019ve also been focused on a mix shift towards our higher-margin health, beauty and store brand categories. We continue to roll out store resets to improve our Health and Beauty leadership. And following last year\u2019s health and beauty enhancements across thousands of stores, we continue to scale our healthy food selection, optimize our key categories in the Health quadrant and elevate our beauty offerings, while improving shopability. Store brands are another area of significant opportunity. Our Store Brands represented 21.8% of front store sales in the quarter, and that\u2019s up about 85 basis points from the same quarter last year, as we continue on our trajectory to a goal of 25%. Turning to store openings, in the second quarter, we opened 22 new stores, relocated nine others, closed 10, resulting in 12 net new stores. And we expect to open up about 100 net new stores for the full year. As for MinuteClinic, we currently operate 1,136 clinics across 33 states, plus the District of Columbia. And, as I noted earlier, the Target conversion was completed. And our nurse-practitioner providers are adjusting well to the MinuteClinic scope of services and Epic EHR. Now, including Target, MinuteClinic revenues increased 15.2% versus the same quarter last year, despite the mild and late allergy season. The hold my place in line on-line queuing tool that was launched nationally in March continued to gain momentum in Q2. And by the end of the quarter, the use of the tool had increased to 13% of all MinuteClinic visits. So customer feedback is extremely positive, and further enhancements are underway to improve the customer experience. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave for the financial review. David M. Denton: Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019ll provide a detailed review of our second quarter results, followed with an update on our improved guidance. And, as I typically do, I\u2019ll start first with a summary of the progress we\u2019ve made in enhancing shareholder value through our strong capital allocation program. During the quarter, we paid $459 million in dividends. Our dividend payout ratio currently stands at 35.5%, but that is artificially high due to the loss on the debt extinguishment we incurred in the second quarter as well as the ongoing integration costs associated with our recent acquisitions. On a more comparable basis, our payout ratio stands at 31.1%, and we remain well on track to achieve our target of 35% by 2018. In addition, we have continued to repurchase shares. During the second quarter, we repurchased 18.5 million shares for approximately $1.9 billion, or $102.32 per share. And we have now essentially completed our planned $4 billion in repurchases for 2016. As I said at our Analyst Day, we expected share repurchases to be front half-loaded, and it very much played out that way. So between dividends and share repurchases, we returned approximately $2.4 billion to shareholders during this quarter and nearly $4.9 billion year-to-date. We continue to expect to return more than $5 billion to our shareholders in 2016 through both a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As Larry mentioned, we generated more than $1.1 billion of free cash in the second quarter, and we have produced more than $2.9 billion year-to-date. We are increasing our full-year free cash flow guidance to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion from the prior range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. This primarily reflects timing in our Medicare Part D SilverScript\u2019s business, as well as overall improvements in the core. Basically, healthier members and lower utilization than what we assume when we submitted our bids, are leading to changes in the timing of our cash flows as we expect to continue to be in a payable position with CMS at the end of this year. Now, turning to our debt, in order to take advantage of the current favorable interest rate environment, during the second quarter, we issued $3.5 billion in debt, refinancing approximately $3.1 billion of outstanding debt through a tender offer transaction. As a result, we booked a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $542 million during the quarter. Furthermore, last month, we retired an additional $1.1 billion by calling certain debt and, as a result of that, we recorded a $102 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt during the third quarter. Together, these actions provide an ongoing benefit in terms of lower interest expense going forward. The benefit to 2016 is expected to be in the neighborhood of $50 million. Turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.32 per share, $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range and up 8.3% over LY. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.86 per share. The Retail/Long Term Care segment delivered solid earnings within our expectations, while the PBM segment posted profit growth above the high end of our expectations. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily driven by better purchasing economics in the PBM. So with that, let me quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the second quarter increased 17.6% to $43.7 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 20.7% to $29.5 billion. This growth is largely attributable to the increased volume of pharmacy network claims resulting from the very successful selling season we had last year. Additionally, and despite a year-over-year decline in Hep C sales, specialty pharmacy growth has been strong, driven, in part, by the Omnicare acquisition and the addition of its ACS book of business. Overall PBM adjusted claims grew 18.7% in the quarter. Partially offsetting the sales growth was a 155 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 85.4%. While achieving strong growth year-over-year, the PBM\u2019s top line did come in below our expectations. The chief drivers were lower than expected specialty revenues from the continued year-over-year decline in Hep C prescription volume due to lower new patient starts and fewer days of therapy. In our Retail/Long Term Care business, revenues increased 16% in the quarter to approximately $20 billion, driven by the addition of Omnicare and the pharmacies within Target, as well as solid pharmacy same-store sales. GDR increased by approximately 110 basis points to 86.1%, partially offsetting this increase. Turning to gross margin, operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate, where applicable, the numbers I am citing exclude non-GAAP adjustments in both current and prior periods, which we have reconciled for you on our website. Keep in mind that our guidance for the quarter also excluded those items. Gross profit dollars for the consolidated company increased a healthy 9.7% versus the same quarter of last year. Consolidated gross margins contracted approximately 115 basis points compared to Q2 of 2015 to 16.1%. Within the PBM segment, gross margin contracted by approximately 45 basis points versus Q2 of 2015 to 4.6%, primarily attributable to the mix of business and continued pricing compression, partially offset by the GDR improvement and favorable purchasing economics. However, gross profit dollars in the PBM increased 10.2% year-over-year, primarily due to strong claims growth, membership growth in SilverScript, improvements in GDR and favorable purchasing economics. Of course, partially offsetting these drivers was continued price compression in the market. In the Retail/Long Term Care segment, gross margin declined approximately 165 basis points to 29.2%. About 40% of the decline in gross margin rate was mix-driven, due to the acquisitions. Lower reimbursement rates also continued to pressure margins. Partially offsetting those pressures were increasing generic dispensing rates as well as increased front store margins as we continue to rationalize our promotional strategies and improve our mix of products sold. Gross profit dollars increased 9.8% year-over-year in the Retail/Long Term Care segment, largely driven by the addition of Omnicare and Target businesses. Turning to expenses, we saw strong improvement in total operating expenses as a percentage of revenue from Q2 of 2015 to 10.5%. The PBM segment\u2019s SG&A rate improved about 10 basis points to 1.1%, benefiting from the additional sales leverage from the volume increases. SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail/Long Term Care segment improved significantly by approximately 85 basis points to 20.3%. This, too, was driven by leverage from revenue growth as well as the addition of the Omnicare business, which carries a lower SG&A rate relative to sales. Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $25 million to $220 million, slightly better than our expectations. Consistent with our expectations, operating margin for the total enterprise decreased approximately 60 basis points in the quarter to 5.6%. Operating margin in the PBM decreased approximately 35 basis points to 3.5%, while operating margin at Retail/Long Term Care decreased approximately 80 basis points to 8.9%. For the quarter, operating profit growth in the operating segments and at the enterprise level was in line with or better than expectations, with the PBM increasing 10.5%, Retail/Long Term Care growing at 6.2%, and consolidated operating profit growing at 6.5%. Consolidated EBITDA was up 9.8% over LY to $3 billion. Going below-the-line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $150 million from last year to $280 million, due primarily to the debt issued in the third quarter of 2015 to fund the acquisitions we made last year. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 39.3%, and our weighted-average share count was 1.1 billion shares. So with that, now let me update you on our guidance. I\u2019ll focus on the highlights. You can find the additional details of our guidance on the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning. As Larry said, we are narrowing and raising our 2016 adjusted earnings per share range to $5.81 to $5.89 from a prior range of $5.73 to $5.88, which reflects strong year-over-year growth of 12.5% to 14.25%. We have raised the midpoint by $0.045, reflecting the positive impact of the interest benefit derived from the debt extinguishment as well as our outperformance in the second quarter. With respect to GAAP diluted EPS, in addition to narrowing the range and layering the benefits from interest and the second quarter outperformance, we are revising our full-year guidance to also reflect a couple of additional items. One is the integration costs that we saw in the second quarter, which we explicitly excluded from our guidance on the last earnings call. These costs totaled approximately $81 million pre-tax. The other is the losses on the early extinguishment of debt that we completed in both the second quarter and now, the third quarter. Those losses totaled $644 million pre-tax. So we now expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.92 to $5 per share. Keep in mind that our GAAP guidance for future periods continues to exclude the impact of acquisition-related integration costs, and we will update for those costs that we incur as the year progresses. Before I continue, let me remind you that the following guidance excludes all acquisition-related integration costs. In the PBM segment, we are decreasing revenue guidance to a range of 21% to 22%, reducing the midpoint by 100 basis points. This decrease takes into account lower than anticipated volume of Hep C, as well as an associated reduction in days of therapy. At the same time, we are raising the midpoint of the PBM\u2019s operating profit guidance range by about 2.5 percentage points to account for the outperformance in the second quarter, as well as continued expectations for better purchasing economics over the course of the remainder of the year. This results in a new range of 13.5% to 15.5%. In the Retail/Long Term Care segment, we are narrowing guidance for revenue growth by taking the top end of the range down by 50 basis points. The reduction in the high end mainly reflects our performance in the second quarter, as well as slightly weaker front store sales trends as we continue to execute on our targeted promotional strategies. We now expect Retail/Long Term Care revenue growth of 13% to 13.75%, and total comps of 1.75% to 2.5%, while continuing to expect script comps of 3.5% to 4.5%. Despite the revenue change, we remain confident in our prior operating profit expectations, given the immaterial impact the changes I noted are expected to have on profitability. We are narrowing the range to take into account our performance in the second quarter. So we now expect Retail/Long Term Care operating profit growth of 6.75% to 8%. Consolidated net revenue growth is now expected to be 17% to 17.75%. Intercompany revenue eliminations are now expected to be approximately 11.6% of segment revenues. And we expect higher intercompany profit eliminations. And, as I said before, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance for the year by $1 billion to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion. Now, let me provide guidance for the third quarter which, again, excludes all acquisition-related integration costs. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.58 per share in the third quarter, reflecting growth of 21% to 23.75% versus Q3 of 2015. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.41 per share in the third quarter, which includes a $102 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt that we completed in July. At the risk of sounding a little bit like a broken record, I want to take a moment to remind you of several timing factors we have been highlighting since Analyst Day that affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout the year. The introduction and timing of break-open generics, the timing of profitability in our Medicare Part D business, the timing of the benefits from our strategies to drive profitability in the front end, the timing of share repurchases and certain tax benefits were all factors expected to impact the cadence. And while we have delivered two strong quarters slightly above our own expectations, the cadence of profit growth is still expected to be very much back half-weighted. Our EPS guidance for the third quarter is very much in line with what we said at Analyst day. All things considered, we see a ramp up in growth in Q3, and we still expect a strong back half to the year. As we\u2019ve seen in years past, the timing of Medicare Part D profits in the third quarter remains difficult to forecast, since this is the time period where the risk sharing corridor is usually least effective at providing risk sharing protection. Thus, changes in any current estimates, such as utilization, significantly impacts our timing of profits between the third and fourth quarters. This forecasting challenge is compounded by the significant growth in this business. We\u2019ve made our best estimates and included those in our guidance, but keep in mind that there could be a shift of margin between the third and fourth quarters. Additionally, the tax benefits I\u2019ve mentioned are forecast to occur in the fourth quarter. If those come earlier, that will obviously benefit the third quarter at the expense of the fourth. We\u2019ll update everyone the final timing of these, again when we report our results. So, within the Retail/Long Term Care segment, we expect revenues to increase 11.5% to 13% versus the third quarter of LY, driven, in large part, by the addition of the acquired businesses; although, sequentially, you\u2019ll note a step-down, due to the mid-August anniversary of the closing of the Omnicare acquisition. Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 3% to 4%, while we expect total same-store sales to be up 1% to up 2.25%. In the PBM, we expect third quarter revenue growth of between 21.25% to 22.5%, driven by continued strong growth in volumes, Medicare Part C and non-Hep C specialty. Consolidated revenues are expected to grow 16.5% to 17.75%. We expect a sequential increase in operating profit growth due to the impact of the timing of this year\u2019s generic introductions. Notably, Crestor, Glivec, Glumetza are all breaking open in this quarter. As a result, we expect Retail operating profit to increase 10% to 12% and PBM operating profit to increase 20.25% to 24.25% in the third quarter. Consolidated operating profit is expected to grow 14.75% to 17.5%. So in summary, we\u2019ve posted strong growth year-to-date. Our 2016 outlook is strong across the enterprise. And we expect to generate very significant free cash this year. We remain committed to using this cash to drive returns for our shareholders through value-enhancing investments, dividends and share repurchases. And with that, I will now turn it back over to Larry. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thanks, Dave, and just let me wrap up and then we\u2019ll open it up for Q&A. But obviously, we\u2019re pleased with our second quarter results, confident in our full-year outlook, and we\u2019ve made good progress on integrating our recent acquisitions. The PBM selling season has been very successful, confirming again that our distinctive channel-agnostic solutions resonate strongly in the market. And we remain focused on continuing to provide innovative solutions that enhance access and lower healthcare costs, while, at the same time, improve health outcomes. So let\u2019s go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operation Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Rich : Good morning. This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Just wanted to start on your comments on the selling season, appreciate all the detail that you gave and definitely nice to see a strong new wins number. I was just wondering if you could talk about the mix of new business that you\u2019ve won; how it looks, you know, for health plan versus employer. And is there anything unique this year with regards to profitability, both from a pricing perspective but also kind of considering the uptake of the suite of programs that you have to offer? Larry Merlo : Yeah, Nathan. It\u2019s Larry. I\u2019ll start and then ask Jon to comment as well. But of the business wins, about 75% of the business wins are in the health plan segment; again, recognizing the value that we can bring our health plan clients. I think the themes that you\u2019ve heard us talk about in the past have continued this year in terms of big focus on specialty. And I\u2019ll flip it over to Jon to talk more about our integrated programs. Jon Roberts : Yeah. So, Nathan, I would describe the selling season as pretty typical. The number of RPs are comparable. And we\u2019ve been at a consistent level of performance in the selling seasons over the last several years. If you look at the plan designs, which, obviously, drives profitability, clients continue to be focused on the tools to help them manage their pharmacy spend. And their top priority, as we\u2019ve talked about many times, is specialty pharmacy. And we see both health plans and employers adopt our utilization management programs. We\u2019re seeing even stronger movement into exclusive specialty and a higher utilization of our specialty formularies. And clients across our, again, both health plans and employers, are becoming even more aggressive with all of our formulary strategies. So Larry talked about our standard formulary option that we offer clients. Good uptake to that, but we even have more aggressive formularies, advanced control and value formularies, that we continue to see increased interest in. And then our integrated programs, like Maintenance Choice, Specialty Connect and Pharmacy advisor, are becoming even more important as people not only look at the unit cost in pharmacy, but also how pharmacy can help reduce overall healthcare costs, so strong adoption of those programs as well. And so I think it\u2019s been, as I look at this new business mix in wins and profitability, I think it\u2019s pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years. Nathan Rich : reat. Appreciate the detail. And then, if I could just move over to the Retail/LTC segment, question on gross margins. It seems like for several quarters now, you\u2019ve seen some nice improvement in the front end margin and you kind of highlighted the changes to the promotional cadence and some mix impact. Could you help us frame the opportunity for front end margins, just around the changes that you have made to promotions? And then any comments on what impact this has had on the top line, as we think about maybe the trade-off that you\u2019re making between top line and margin performance on the front end? Larry Merlo : Yeah, Nathan, it\u2019s Larry again. And I think as you heard us comment on in the prepared remarks and prior to today\u2019s call, the ability to utilize our ExtraCare data, okay, to really understand our customers at a micro level, is what\u2019s providing us the opportunity to do what we talked about earlier around this personalization effort and acknowledging that we can derive value in different ways. And there\u2019s an awful lot of trial and error that goes on there. And I would say that we\u2019re still learning from that. I mentioned earlier that Helena will talk more about that at Analyst Day in terms of the learnings that we\u2019ve gotten and where we go from here. So I guess to sum it up, we\u2019re certainly not done. Okay? We still think that we have capabilities beyond where we\u2019re at today. But as I mentioned, you have to take a surgical approach, okay, so that we\u2019re preserving the value of our best customers, okay, and enhancing their experience. Dave Denton : And just to be clear, Nathan, it\u2019s Dave here. Despite the fact of giving up, I\u2019ll say, a little bit of top line from a front store sales perspective, the flow-through to the business is accretive. Nathan Rich : Okay, great, makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Lisa Gill : Great. Thank you and good morning. I had two questions on the PBM. So the first question would be, Larry or Jon, can you maybe talk about where you\u2019re taking business from? We\u2019ve now heard from Optum as well as Express Scripts. It sounds like everyone\u2019s having pretty good retention years, but, clearly, with $7.4 billion of gross wins, you\u2019re taking business from somewhere. Is it some of the smaller players? Are we seeing any incremental carve-out activity? How do we think about the competitive market right now and where that business is coming from? Larry Merlo : Go ahead, Jon. Jon Roberts : Lisa, this is Jon. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one competitor we\u2019re taking business from. I think it\u2019s across the spectrum, both large players and the small players. So I think it\u2019s a very balanced selling season. And, obviously, we continue to be very successful and our message continues to resonate. And, by the way, even on the renewals, when you look at how we\u2019re doing from a renewal perspective, again, very consistent performance relative to the last several years. So I know there\u2019s been a lot in the press about a few contract moves, but when you step back and look at overall retention work, we\u2019re very pleased. Lisa Gill : Okay, great. And then, I guess my follow-up would just be around cash flow, Dave. I mean, obviously, great cash flow in the quarter, great cash flow update for this year; how do we think about that on an ongoing basis? Is there some things in there that are one-time in nature? And would you think about doing an accelerated share repurchase with this incremental cash? How do we think about the deployment of it? Dave Denton : Yeah. Lisa, a little bit of the cash flow, I\u2019d say probably 75% of the increased guidance, is probably just - think about that more as timing, as you think about us being in a payable position to the Federal government at the end of the year. That will flip on us in 2017. So think about that as just moving into 2016 from 2017. I would say the balance is just general improved performance across our business, in both PBM and Retail. As it comes to capital allocation, as you know, we will continue to focus on what\u2019s the best use of our cash to drive value for our shareholders. And we will continue to think about that, and we\u2019ll certainly come back to everyone as we think about how to use that cash over time. Lisa Gill : Okay, great. Thank you. Larry Merlo : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Charles Rhyee : Great. Thanks. I want to get back to specialty a bit and when you talk about the 22% growth that you saw so far, can you talk about sort of the mix within that? What categories are you seeing this year that are going to be a bit concerning for your clients, as well as sort of the mix between utilization versus pricing? Jon Roberts : Yeah. Charles, this is Jon. I mean, we\u2019re seeing continued growth across all categories, so autoimmune, multiple sclerosis and oncology are examples. Hepatitis C, as Larry and Dave mentioned, we\u2019re really seeing a less utilization there. And then, as you look at the specialty category and what\u2019s driving the growth, you have price increase is really driving the majority of the growth. You have pretty strong utilization, north of 3%, more than you see in traditional pharmacy. And then you have new drugs coming into the market that also drive year-over-year growth. So, again, it\u2019s specialty growing faster than - it\u2019s the fastest growing part of the pharmacy benefit. It\u2019s our clients\u2019 highest priorities, and we have solutions for them that can actually help manage that, not only under the pharmacy benefit but also under the medical benefit. Charles Rhyee : And just for a clarification, can you remind us what percent of the Caremark, the PBM client business, is served by the specialty pharmacy? So basically how much do you cover of the existing client base versus how much of the specialty business is outside the CVS base? Thanks. Larry Merlo : Yes. Charles, it\u2019s right around 60%. Charles Rhyee : Okay, great. Thank you. Larry Merlo : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Ross Muken : Good morning. And obviously, you\u2019ve given us a ton of color so far on the success you\u2019ve had, but a lot has been made, at least in the investment community, about sort of a debate on the merits of whether your model, which has been so successful for so many years, will continue to be successful in the changing competitive landscape and, ultimately, what\u2019s happening with managed care. As you think about the outcome as it stands right now in terms of selling season wins and the feedback, Jon, you\u2019ve gotten, and as you continue to evolve the strategy, I guess, where do you think some of us were wrong in terms of the assumptions? Or what are folks not focusing on where you continue to kind of push the needle and evolve the model and push share where maybe folks aren\u2019t seeing it? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for where you feel like the messaging has been most off from our side of things or the perception, at least, versus kind of the reality of clearly what you\u2019re seeing in the market. Larry Merlo : Yeah. Ross, it\u2019s Larry. And first of all, let me just say United Optum, obviously, they\u2019re a highly respected company and their well-publicized wins this selling season demonstrate that they can successfully compete for business in the PBM space. At the same time, back to your question, if you ask why we\u2019ve been successful and why we expect to continue to be successful, we continue to see this retailization of healthcare. And you see more people in consumer-directed health plans. You see more care being chosen individually, when you think about some of the government-sponsored care with Medicare. And that points to the value associated with multiple consumer touch points. And I touched on those in our prepared remarks that, yeah, there\u2019s 9,600 retail consumer touch points. We\u2019ve got 80% of the U.S. population that lives within a couple miles of one of our stores, along with MinuteClinic assets and specialty and mail and infusion and now, long-term care. And we have created a true level of integration across these different assets. And, Ross, you remember years ago, we were talking about the Consumer Engagement Engine, which we now refer to as the Health Engagement Engine. And it\u2019s a piece of technology that connects the dots with these various capabilities, so that it\u2019s not just about collecting data. It\u2019s about how we use that data to affect an outcome. So you combine that with the ability to touch the consumer in multiple different ways, and we think that that is our value proposition that will increase in importance and that has allowed us to bring products in the marketplace that can impact patients, payors and providers. Ross Muken : That\u2019s helpful, Larry. And maybe just in general, it seems like again, another very successful season on health plan side. Obviously, you had that as well last year. Can you just remind us what that means in terms of profit ramp and how we should think about the business won last year and how that\u2019s trended profit-wise, or is expected to over the course of this year into next and that whole dynamic? Dave Denton : Yeah. Ross, this is Dave. I\u2019ll start off here. As you know, the health plan business is a little different than the employer business, whereas in the employer business, typically a benefit manager can make a decision for their population immediately and those programs can be implemented pretty rapidly. In the health plan business, even despite a health plan, let\u2019s say, Chief Medical Officer wanting to adopt one of our programs, they need to in turn, go and sell that through their book of business or, in some cases in the Medicare book of business, the ramp-up of share is just a little slower. So think about us starting off at pretty thin margins and that ramping up over time. And the cadence of that is probably a little slower than the employer book of business. Dave Denton : And, Ross, I guess if we look at 2016 health plan clients that we won, we\u2019re now talking to them about programs that they can implement in 2017. And they have four lines of business that, quite frankly, you have to think about very differently. So in Medicare, they can\u2019t just simply narrow the network. They can have a preferred network. In Medicaid, we see, very aggressively, clients narrowing their network. With their fully insured book of business, they have to work through the Department of Insurance and they historically have opted for consumer choice broad networks. We do see that changing. And for the self-insured, that\u2019s no different than our employer clients. So it\u2019s really arming them with programs and incentives to sell that into their employer book of business. So it does move slower, as Dave said, but we\u2019re confident it will move. And we\u2019re confident we can grow share. Ross Muken : Great. And thanks. Larry Merlo : Thanks, Ross. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alvin Concepcion with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Alvin Concepcion : Thank you and thanks for taking my question. I think you mentioned the retention rate in PBM was 97.5%. So I\u2019m wondering, would you happen to know what it was last year at this time? Larry Merlo : Well, Alvin, the year ended up at 97.2%, okay, for last year\u2019s selling season. And, as we mentioned, we have about 75% of the renewal is done, so we\u2019re in the homestretch there. I don\u2019t know what the retention rate was at this time last year. It probably wouldn\u2019t be that far off with where we are. Jon Roberts : Right. And I mean, it\u2019s pretty similar to the selling season, right? The large players have made their decisions and now it\u2019s down to the midmarket and the small players. So I would say it\u2019s pretty comparable to where we were last year. Alvin Concepcion : Great. Thank you for that color. And a question on retail, with things like ScriptSync and Curbside, you talked about it a bit last quarter. And maybe it\u2019s still early, but how should we think about retail comps longer-term, in particular, the front end? I\u2019m wondering if this would pressure your front end comps further or if you see basket sort of offsetting the potential less traffic. Larry Merlo : No, Alvin. I don\u2019t see those aspects pressuring front end comps. I think it\u2019s important to emphasize that some of what we\u2019re experiencing is planned, as we think about our front store business and the segmentation or personalization strategies as we had talked earlier. Helena Foulkes : Yeah. I would say, too, Alvin, we\u2019ve said all along, we\u2019re focused on driving profitable growth. And so when you look at where we\u2019re very pleased in our core Health and Beauty businesses, that\u2019s where we want to win. That\u2019s where our most valuable customers expect us to be unique and that\u2019s going very well. And then, we\u2019re pulling back in general merchandise and edibles businesses, which tend to be very promotional, and reinvesting those dollars in our best customers, so I think you\u2019ll continue to see us do that. Alvin Concepcion : Thank you very much. Larry Merlo : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ricky Goldwasser : Good morning and congrats on a very good quarter and thank you for all the details. Question I have here is on Maintenance Choice. Obviously, it\u2019s been proven to be very effective tool to gain market share. Under a scenario that you lose a Maintenance Choice client, how much of the share do you expect to keep? Larry Merlo : Well, Ricky, we have had an extremely high retention rate of those Maintenance Choice clients, so there\u2019s really not a good proxy there, okay, to answer that question. In the few cases where that\u2019s happened, CVS continues to be in the provider network, and we\u2019ve retained a large percent of that business. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And then, when we think about the quarterly result, obviously, you highlight in the press release and the prepared comments that there\u2019s contribution from Omnicare and Target. Can you quantify for us what percent of the operating income growth per segment was from acquisitions versus organic? Dave Denton : Yeah. Ricky, it\u2019s Dave. We haven\u2019t broken than out. Quite honestly, the integration of those businesses are pretty complete now, so actually having them broken out is a little bit more difficult than you might imagine. But they\u2019re part of our forecast for this year and our forecast is very much in line from a quarter perspective. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And just one last follow-up on the selling season, obviously, last year, you had about 80% of the business came from managed care. When you think about the mix of business, I know that in response to an earlier question, you said that it\u2019s similar to last couple of years, but it seems that every year was a bit unique. So what percent of the net new business, or maybe I should say what percent of gross wins, are from managed care versus commercial book of business? Larry Merlo : Yeah. Ricky, it\u2019s around 75%. And if you look at the mix of business within the PBM excluding Med D, the makeup of that business is now 60% health plan, 40% employer. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. Thank you. Larry Merlo : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question. John Heinbockel : Sure. So, Larry or Helena, what can you tell us about those most valuable customers? I don\u2019t know how you define them, but when you think about importance to the business, either percent of sales or transactions, demographics and where you see, when you think about your share of wallet with them, where are the biggest opportunities; just curious, some color on those customers? Helena Foulkes : Sure. We look at it a lot of different ways, but I would say at the most simple level, the top 30% of our customers drive about 75% of our sales and profit. And we are meaningful to them, but we still have significant upside in terms of share of wallet opportunities for them. So what we\u2019ve really been focused on is the personalization strategy that Larry talked about. And essentially, investing in those customers, because we can see from the data where we have upside with them. And we segment them either from a value perspective sometimes or we look at them in terms of their shopping behavior. So we might look at beauty enthusiasts who, for example, tend to be less promotionally-oriented and are very focused on new items and what\u2019s hot and relevant for them. And that might be different than food and family loyalists, who are looking for different kinds of offers and strategies. So for us, it\u2019s all about getting at the very micro level and giving them targeted offers that matter for them. And we can track those customers over time, and we\u2019re very focused and pleased with the fact that we continue to grow sales and profitability among those best customers. Larry Merlo : And, John, it\u2019s Larry. If I could emphasize one point, I think you\u2019re hearing a theme emerge. And it\u2019s not a new theme, but whether we\u2019re talking about your point on the front store or some of the things that have come up earlier with some of the questions about the pharmacy, there is a tremendous amount of data out there, okay? And it\u2019s one thing to collect the data. It\u2019s another thing in terms of how do you use the data to create an outcome or a behavioral change. And that\u2019s where we\u2019ve made significant investments in our business, whether it\u2019s ExtraCare or whether it\u2019s the capabilities back in the pharmacy, that is allowing us to do things in a very differentiated way that we think that is giving us an advantage in the marketplace. John Heinbockel : And that would obviously, I assume there\u2019s some customers that are truly unprofitable. I mean, how do you think about weaning yourself off of those and then balancing that with, obviously, there\u2019s the direct profit, but there\u2019s also overhead and other costs that they might cover. Helena Foulkes : Right. Yeah. John Heinbockel : Right? So, that\u2019s... Helena Foulkes : Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. John Heinbockel : So that\u2019s an interesting balance, right? Helena Foulkes : That\u2019s the delicate balance that does not just make this a math exercise. We certainly know, if you look at our bottom two deciles of customers, where there\u2019s potential. And that\u2019s what you saw us doing the last couple of quarters, is pulling back our promotional spend, but weaning those customers off of it. We certainly want to continue to keep their business, and reinvesting that in other segments where we can see more profit upside. But that\u2019s exactly the balance we\u2019re looking at. And we said before, the role of the front store is different in our company than other companies. It represents 11% of our total enterprise sales, but it also is the front door to how people start to use us as a pharmacy. So as we look at those customers, we\u2019re looking not just at their front door sales and profitability, but we also know which of those customers are our pharmacy customers and that\u2019s an important part of the decision-making process as well. John Heinbockel : And then, just one last one for Jon, do you think, at this point, competing solely on the basis of price, or largely on the basis of price, is not something your account base is particularly interested in; they\u2019ve kind of moved off of that to capabilities? Larry Merlo : John, as we\u2019ve said many times, price has been important. It will continue to be important. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that price is ticket to the game. Q - John Heinbockel Yeah. Larry Merlo : And listen, when you look across the PBM business, we\u2019re talking a lot about retention rates. We never want to lose a client. At the same time, we don\u2019t forecast or expect to have 100% retention. And you can look across the landscape and you can see clients who, every contract renewal they migrate to another PBM. Okay? So there are going to be clients out there that have different priorities. And we think that with our differentiated offering, we can appeal to the broadest set of those clients. John Heinbockel : Thank you. Jon Roberts : And just to add to that, Jon, while we have to continue to be competitive on price, it\u2019s really our differentiated model and our ability to interact with a consumer and impact their behavior and lower overall healthcare costs. That\u2019s what\u2019s resonating in the market. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re continuing to win. John Heinbockel : Okay. Thank you. Larry Merlo : Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Eric Percher : Thank you. As we spoke with benefit managers yesterday, I think that there was some interest in the indication-based formulary and cost - or inflation efforts, but what really caught their eye was your aggressiveness relative to biosimilars, particularly as compared to the one competitor whose formulary we\u2019ve seen. Could you speak a little bit about what this represents in terms of your strategy on biosimilars? It seems like a material statement, and also, how you think about the ability to serve and drive adoption of biosimilars, both as a PBM and as a retailer? Larry Merlo : Well, Eric, it\u2019s Larry. I\u2019ll start and then flip it over to Jon. But as you\u2019ve heard us talk in the past, okay, while biosimilars are just beginning to enter the market and their impact will be will be nominal or minimal, okay, in the near-term, we believe that they will grow in importance. And they will behave more like brands than generics, which create opportunities within the formulary management area. So that\u2019s how we\u2019ve thought about it at a very high level. I\u2019ll flip it over to Jon to talk more specifics. Jon Roberts : Yeah. And then, Eric, maybe I\u2019ll step back and talk about the three dimensions to our formulary strategy for this year, because it\u2019s a little bit different than what we\u2019ve done in years\u2019 past. And it does include these biosimilars, or in the case [ph] of a sidebar, (65:00) it\u2019s a follow-on biologic, but I would think of it as a biosimilar. So first, we\u2019ve got our normal therapeutic review that we started back in 2012. And that\u2019s all about making sure we have cost-effective medications for our clients and their members. And we\u2019ve been able to deliver the $9 billion in savings that Larry talked about. And over the last several years, we\u2019ve been able to negotiate price protection into those contracts. So if a manufacturer raises a price over a predetermined threshold, that comes back to our client in the form of a rebate and lowers their price. What we introduced this year is indication-based formularies. So think about Hepatitis C that has six different genotypes. The genotypes are different. So we will have different formulary options based on the genotype or, in the case of autoimmune, you have the same drugs that treat psoriasis and RA. We may have a different preferred product for psoriasis than we do for rheumatoid arthritis. And the third dynamic is really hyperinflation. And we looked at drugs that had a three-year cumulative WACC increase of greater than 200%. And we\u2019ve taken on 10 of those drugs this year. And our goal is either we\u2019re not going to cover them, or we\u2019re going to get the economics back to prior to these WACC increases that they took. And for biosimilars, I think it\u2019s just part of that theme. How can we get the lowest, most cost-effective drugs for our clients to provide as a benefit to their members? And we think biosimilars will be an opportunity. Now, when you look at biosimilars, most of the pipeline is filled with biosimilars under the medical benefit, with the exception with Humira, but we\u2019ll continue to look to make decisions that are in the best interests of our clients and their members. Eric Percher : Very good. Thank you. Larry Merlo : Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. George Hill : Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. Jon, we saw the preliminary Med D bid rates come out last week, and it looks like Med D providers\u2019ll be down 2%-ish as it relates to total revenue. And I guess as we think about as the company goes to market and contracts in providing the benefit for 2017, if you think about where you get the cost savings to kind of continue to drive those price declines, do you feel like more of them are coming on the pharmacy network side or are more of them coming on, what I\u2019ll call, the manufacturer side, either through formulary actions or through rebates? Larry Merlo : Sure. It\u2019s Larry. I\u2019ll start and then David or Jon, or both, will jump in here, but, George, I would say it\u2019s really the surround sound, okay, that is contributing to that. It\u2019s not just about the procurement side of things or the network side of things. And I do think that Med D is a great example of competition prevailing in the marketplace, okay, to drive down overall costs. And as you look today at the cost of the Med D program against what it was projected a decade ago, it\u2019s a fraction of that. Jon Roberts : And the only thing I would add is, I think that\u2019s right. It\u2019s pretty balanced. You know, we continue to get value to have a very competitive product in the market really across all those dimensions. I think the only thing I would add is that I think our expertise and how we\u2019ve been able to help [ph] service reps and our clients is really how you design your plan, how the formulary that supports that plan, what\u2019s your network strategy, all of those need to work together to provide a synergy that gives you a competitive product in the marketplace. And that\u2019s really the expertise that we\u2019ve built over the years that allows us to continue to be successful. George Hill : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just maybe a quick housekeeping question, for the net new wins for the PBM for next year, does that or does that not include the bid balance of the Coventry business rolling on? Larry Merlo : No, George, it does. I think in our prepared remarks, I mentioned that less than 7%, you know, of the gross wins are made up of the Coventry business. George Hill : Sorry. I missed that section. Thanks for the color, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Scott Mushkin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First up is just, and I know we touched on it a little bit for the 2016 and upselling, Jon, and you did a good job of the four different buckets upselling your unique offerings into the healthcare plans, but I just wanted to get any update. I think you guys said you were about 23% penetrated processing scripts, I think it was at year-end maybe. I think I got that right. Any update on that number? And where we\u2019re going as far as like Maintenance Choice and processing the scripts from healthcare plans? Larry Merlo : Yeah, Scott, it\u2019s Larry. Scott Mushkin : [ph] In your own assets, okay? Larry Merlo : Yeah, well, I think, as Jon mentioned earlier, you know, we have seen the ramp begin in terms of the clients that came online, you know, in January 2016. At our Analyst Day, we\u2019ll provide more insight and quantify exactly where that sits as we\u2019re able to ramp up through the year. Scott Mushkin : Would you say, Larry, you\u2019re pleased with how things are going or any thoughts? I know you talked a little bit last quarter about, you know, it\u2019s slow, but kind of methodical. Any updates on kind of how you\u2019re thinking about it? Larry Merlo : No, Scott, I think we\u2019re pleased, you know, with where we\u2019re at and, you know, recognizing that as you\u2019ve heard us talk about, this is a marathon. It\u2019s not a sprint, okay? And we\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making. And again, for the reasons that we mentioned earlier, okay, we think that the assets and capabilities that we bring will grow in importance, recognizing the direction that healthcare is headed. Scott Mushkin : Perfect. And then, just a little bit for Dave, you know, the guidance, I think, Dave, you said incorporated a better second quarter and also interest savings. It does seem like the underlying business is performing better than expected just maybe so far in the first couple quarters. Do you think that can actually continue into the back half? And how should we think about that I guess, particularly on the PBM side? Dave Denton : Well, I do think, obviously, the business has performed well, I\u2019d say kind of in both segments, both Q1 and Q2. Obviously, we are driving benefit from, I\u2019ll say, below-the-line as we think about refinancing our debt. But, again, you saw us raise operating performance expectations within the PBM segment for the balance of this year, and I continue to think that we\u2019re well-positioned as we think about delivery for Q3 and Q4. Scott Mushkin : All right. And I just wanted to sneak one last one in for Helena. Just on your best customers, Helena, where do you think you\u2019re priced compared to mass and online, and then I\u2019ll yield. Thanks, guys, for taking my questions. Helena Foulkes : Yeah. Sure. So we look at our price, the net price to customers, as you think about all of the promotions, ExtraCare rewards and targeted offers we give them, and we think that\u2019s sort of how the consumer views it. And we think we\u2019re within striking range, essentially, of those competitors when you look at all those offers for our best customers. Scott Mushkin : Perfect. Thanks. Larry Merlo : Thanks, Scott. Next question? Operator : Is from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Mark Wiltamuth : Hi. Congrats on the PBM selling season news. Pleased to see that. But also wanted to ask a little bit about what\u2019s the next step here at Target? The integration has gone well. At this point, can you tell if the stores that have CVS density around them, are those Target stores doing better? And do you plan to add more CVS stores around the existing Targets? Larry Merlo : Well, Mark, I\u2019ll start and then flip it over to Helena. But listen, and I\u2019m sure you know this, so just as a reminder, any acquisition, especially on the retail side, you have to do the things you must do before you can do the things you like to do. So I think we\u2019re all really pleased with the work of the team to be able to convert almost 1,700 pharmacies in what amounted to a six-month period. And it was a terrific job by all. And we got tremendous support from our partners at Target. So we\u2019ve completed those activities within the last 30 days. So now, we get to move to the things that we really like to do. And I\u2019ll flip it over to Helena to talk about that. Helena Foulkes : Right. So, as you can imagine, with all of that conversion, there is always - we\u2019ve done a lot of acquisitions. You do have a fair level of disruption. And, as Larry said, the Target folks have been great in working with us through all that. But we were very pleased. The service scores coming out of those stores are tremendous. The leadership alignment is fantastic. We\u2019re on track to achieve our targeted EBIT for those pharmacies. And now, we\u2019re really focused on ramping up our patient care programs. As we looked at this opportunity, there were really three big areas where we saw opportunity, and those are beginning now. First is the core clinical programs that we\u2019ve always used at CVS. We call them our patient care programs, things like adherence outreach and other ways that we can drive clinical outcomes, which drives scripts. The second is around all the member engagement efforts that we\u2019ve got going on. And these are essentially targeted at our members through the PBM who now have opportunities to fill prescriptions at Target. And so, we\u2019re letting them know about that, inviting them into those Target pharmacies to experience the new offering, as well as some targeted marketing that we\u2019ve been doing in conjunction with Target. Most of that\u2019s been digital. It\u2019s also been radio. And that is really just kicking off now as well. So all those things, together, give us a high level of confidence that with all of these unique programs, as well as our brand recognition, our clinical capabilities and these digital tools that we\u2019ve introduced, that we\u2019ll be able to increase script volumes in these locations. Mark Wiltamuth : And my question about your existing footprint where you have CVS stores around an existing Target, are those Targets performing better than the others? Helena Foulkes : I would say the only thing we would really say is, probably noteworthy in terms of performance is those markets where CVS had very little presence, like a Denver or a Portland, Oregon, those Target pharmacies are probably performing the best, because, as you think about it, that\u2019s where our model of allowing Maintenance Choice members to now fill at a CVS pharmacy inside a Target really is unique. They don\u2019t have a CVS nearby. So that\u2019s probably the one difference we\u2019ve seen so far in performance. Dave Denton : Yeah, Mark, this is Dave. I think what\u2019s important, too, as you think about that combination is the overlap between the Target pharmacies and the CVS pharmacies was pretty minimal. So I think there\u2019s not a lot of those situations where we\u2019re head-to-head, number one. That\u2019s why it was a good match, from that perspective. And number two is that we share customers. Many of our customers shop the Target channel and many of the Target customers shop the CVS channel. And right now, what we\u2019ve done is given those customers options. So I think at the end of the day, it\u2019s going to be enhancing to our overall market share, not just switching from one box to another. Larry Merlo : And, Mark, I\u2019ll just kind of wrap it up by saying it\u2019s a hard question to answer, at this point, for the reasons that Helena mentioned. We\u2019re just beginning the broad-based marketing programs. And there is a tremendous opportunity to increase the level of awareness of CVS at Target, and all that work has just begun. Mark Wiltamuth : Okay. Thank you very much. Larry Merlo : So before we take the next question, we just want to go back and add a little color to the question that came up earlier on the Coventry business. Dave Denton : Yeah, so this is Dave. George Hill, you asked a question about Coventry about, again, for the 1/1/2017 selling season, about 7% of our gross wins is related to the migration of the Coventry business onto the Caremark platform. There is an additional piece of Coventry commercial business that does migrate on to CVS on 1/1 of 2018. Larry Merlo : Okay. So next question? Operator : Is from the line of Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Steve Valiquette : Okay. Thanks. Good morning, guys, congrats on these results. I guess, just for us, really probably another question on this PBM. It does seem that 2016 is a unique year, where your PBM revenue growth is really almost double your operating profit growth. And that\u2019s partially because of the mix of wins you had for this year. I think what everybody is trying to figure out on this call, kind of big picture, without you giving any guidance is can we generally assume that PBM revenue and EBIT growth will hopefully be a little bit more in line with each other for 2017 than what we\u2019re seeing in 2016 or should we still generally assume a large spread there next year? Thanks. Dave Denton : Steve, this is Dave. I would say if you go back and look at our long term targets, which is probably the best way to think about this, and you look at those targets, you\u2019ve seen us give expectations that the top line is going to grow faster than the bottom line as we capture share, as specialty continues to grow, as we continue to invest in our business and do bolt-on acquisitions. I would say that that long term forecast remains intact today, from as you think about the top line growing more rapidly than the bottom line. And so I would expect that to occur. Steve Valiquette : Okay. Also, since 2016 was kind of a record year for the wins you took on this year, does that $13 billion to $15 billion of business become more profitable and higher margin in 2017 than the 2016 contribution, just generally speaking? Dave Denton : Generally speaking, that\u2019s essentially how this business typically operates. As we\u2019ve always said, is the health plan business, they\u2019re a little slower to kind of adopt our programs and to sell those programs in. It depends upon the complexion of the health plan business. Some might be more Med D-weighted versus commercial. So the cadence of that ramp does vary, but it\u2019s typically a bit slower than the employer book of business. Steve Valiquette : Okay. And then, finally, just real quick, the FEP mail and retail extension, the January 2019, I kind of missed your comments on that. So is that an early renewal and extension, so that there would be some different pricing on that for next year? Or is that just nothing changes on the pricing front? That was just your disclosure that that\u2019s still intact through January of 2019, just wanted to get the extra color on that. Thanks. Jon Roberts : Yeah. So, Steve, they had an option to extend the contract and the economics were already built into that deal, and they chose to extend. So it wasn\u2019t a new financial arrangement. It was an extension of the existing deal we had offered them. Steve Valiquette : Okay, perfect. Okay, all right, great. Thanks. Larry Merlo : Okay. We\u2019ll take two more questions, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mohan Naidu with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Mohan Naidu : Thank you very much for squeezing me in. Larry, maybe given the success you\u2019re seeing with the Target pharmacies [ph] and TNX (81:58), is there any appetite to do more of such partnerships? Larry Merlo : Yeah. It\u2019s a great question. And we\u2019re certainly open to that. I think that as you look at how pharmacy is evolving, and the importance of investments in technology to not just satisfy the regulatory priorities that are associated with pharmacy, but how pharmacy becomes an important part of the solution of driving down healthcare costs and serves as something more than just a dispenser of prescriptions, I think that as that increases in importance, I think that there may be more opportunities that present themselves. And we\u2019re certainly interested in those. Mohan Naidu : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink. Please proceed with your question. Dave Larsen : Hey, congratulations on an excellent quarter. Can you talk about the impact of generic deflation and the performance of Red Oak? How is that progressing relative to expectations? Thanks. Dave Denton : Dave, Dave Denton here. Obviously, we\u2019re very pleased with the progression of Red Oak. Both us and Cardinal continue to see value from that joint venture. I would say that, as we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, both inflation and deflation across our business has not really been that impactful. So I don\u2019t think that the change in those levels of pricing within generics has been a major impact on us. It certainly has not been material, both this year and in prior years. So it\u2019s progressing very much as planned this year. And we\u2019ll probably have more to update as far as generic introductions as we get to Analyst Day in December. Dave Larsen : Okay. And then, in December, will you provide a new sort of five-year guidance range for these different metrics? Dave Denton : We always update kind of our performance, both from a current period perspective and an ongoing perspective. So we\u2019ll certain hit on key topics and the outlook for those key topics over the course of the next several years in December. Dave Larsen : Great. Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: Okay, everyone. Thanks for your ongoing interest in CVS. And if there are any follow-up questions, you can contact Nancy Christal. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, November 8, 2016. I'd now like to turn the call over to Nancy Christal, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Nancy R. Christal: Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Jon Roberts, President of CVS Caremark; and Helena Foulkes, President of CVS Pharmacy are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. We want to leave as much time as possible for questions today. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up, so we can provide more people with a chance to ask a question. We have a lot to cover this morning, and we plan to make only brief remarks about the third quarter, so we can spend the majority of our time talking about our guidance for the remainder of this year, our 2017 preliminary outlook, and our longer term targets. You can find all the usual details of the quarter on the slides we posted on our website just before the call. We also filed our Form 10-Q this morning, and it's available on our website as well. I have one quick reminder, Annual Analyst Day is scheduled for Thursday, December 15 in New York City. You'll have the opportunity to hear from several members of our senior management team, who'll provide a comprehensive update on our strategies for driving long-term growth. The meeting will be webcast for those unable to attend in person. In addition, note that during today's presentation, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings. During this call, we'll use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance, including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the reconciliations of these non-GAAP items to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And, as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there, following the call, for one year. And now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thank you Nancy and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. While we announced solid results this morning for the third quarter, as Nancy mentioned, we want to spend most of this call addressing the recent changes in the marketplace, what they mean for CVS Health in the short-term, and most important our plans to address these issues, so we can resume our robust growth trajectory. You can find the detailed business and financial review of the quarter in the slides we posted before the call. So let me touch briefly on our strong third quarter we announced this morning. Net revenues increased 15.5%, rising 19.2% in the PBM, 12.5% in the Retail/Long Term Care segment. Adjusted earnings per share increased 28% to $1.64, including approximately $0.05 related to a lower tax rate, primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters previously anticipated to occur in Q4. So this is basically a timing shift benefiting the third quarter at the expense of Q4. Our results in the third quarter also include another penny related to below the line items. So putting those benefits aside, we posted strong adjusted earnings per share growth at the high end of our guidance range. The PBM performed slightly above the high end of our expectations, mostly due to Medicare Part D profitability, while the Retail/Long Term Care segment performed at the lower end of our expectations. Retail same store sales grew 2.3%, with Pharmacy comps up 3.4%, and comp scripts up 3%, and that's on a 30-day equivalent basis. Script growth was at the low end of our expectations, reflecting the slowing script growth trend in the overall market and a soft seasonal business. However, our retail pharmacy share grew more than 200 basis points to 23.8% versus the same quarter last year, and that was driven by the addition of Target, along with core CVS share growth. In the front store, we posted a 1% decrease in same store sales while achieving a nice improvement in front store margins, as we continued to execute successfully on our personalization strategy. We generated $3.7 billion of free cash during the quarter, $6.6 billion year-to-date, and we are raising our forecast for the year to a range of $6.8 billion to $7 billion. And we'll continue to use this cash to create value for our shareholders. Now, let me address what has changed in the marketplace, and the near-term implications for our business. As you know, there have been numerous headwinds over the past couple of months facing our industry that have impacted the overall sentiment on the company. The negative sentiment largely misplaced in our view, included competitors winning PBM business and the perceived impact on Caremark, broad industry concerns about drug pricing and the value of the PBM, and concerns about what the results of today's election might mean for the healthcare industry. None of those are significant factors, in our view, of the current marketplace, or of our performance. However, very recently, there have been some unexpected marketplace actions that will have a negative impact on our results for the fourth quarter of this year, and a more meaningful impact on our outlook for 2017. So let me go into further detail. Over the past few months, Walgreens has been establishing various network relationships with a number of other PBMs. For example, they have 90-day offerings in the marketplace through both Express Scripts and OptumRx. And since the first announcement, we've said these are not expected to have a major impact, and we continue to believe this. Very recently, however, we became aware of additional network changes that are putting a significant number of our retail scripts at risk, beginning in the current quarter. For example, there are new restricted network relationships between Walgreens and Prime Therapeutics as well as within the Department of Defense, TRICARE program that in both cases take CVS Pharmacies entirely out of those networks. In total, we believe these network actions will result in more than 40 million retail prescriptions shifting out of our stores on an annualized basis. The DoD TRICARE action begins on December 1, but they have already notified members, and we expect to begin seeing these prescriptions migrate out of our stores. The Prime network changes will begin on January 1, and impacts CVS Pharmacy's participation in selected, fully insured networks in several key states. And while we continue to participate in Prime's Medicare Part D plans, in many cases it will be as a non-preferred provider. Now, as you know, we have always said that our last script is our most profitable one given our ability to leverage our fixed costs with incremental volume. And unfortunately, this means that the scripts we lose will tend to be our most profitable scripts, and as a result, we will de-lever, as a result of, losing more than 40 million prescriptions. And as we stated many times in the past, margin compression is a factor in the business, and our strategy of driving more share through our channels is a key element to achieving our overall retail growth objectives. And this unexpected loss of share will make that a difficult proposition in the short-term. Now, I'm going to turn this over to Dave to walk you through our updated guidance for 2016, our preliminary outlook for 2017, and our longer-term outlook, and then I'll be back to provide a high level outline of our plans for responding to these marketplace changes, and reaccelerating our growth. David M. Denton: Thank you Larry, and good morning to everyone. I'll start today with our revised guidance for this year. We currently expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for 2016 of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11.75% to 13%. We've effectively lowered the midpoint by $0.05 per share compared to our prior range of $5.81 to $5.89 per share. This takes into account the recent competitor actions restricting us from pharmacy networks as well as current trends in the Retail business, including the slowing script growth in the overall market and a soft seasonal business which is affecting both the Pharmacy as well as the front store. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.84 to $4.90 a share. This now includes the addition of the integration costs in the third quarter, which we explicitly excluded from our prior guidance. Keep in mind that our GAAP guidance for the remainder of the year excludes the impact of acquisition-related integration costs, and we will update for those costs at year end. Before moving to the fourth quarter guidance, let me quickly remind you of the timing factor affecting Q3, Q4 profit cadence. As Larry mentioned, we had a timing shift related to a lower tax rate that benefited Q3 by approximately $0.05 a share, primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters. These matters were previously anticipated to occur in Q4, which I talked about on our last earnings call. So in the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.70, up 7% to 10.75% from Q4 of 2015. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share. And you can find the details of guidance in the slides that we posted online early today before the call. But let me take a moment to point out a few items. For the fourth quarter, we expect enterprise revenues to be up 12.25% to 14% driven primarily by PBM growth. Total same-store sales at Retail are expected to be flat to down 1.75%, and adjusted script comps are expected to increase 1% to 2%, a sequential decline that reflects the impact of the network changes and retail trends. Additionally, enterprise operating profit is expected to grow by 2% to 5.5%, again, driven primarily by the PBM. The network changes and other factors will impact our business next year, so we want to provide you some early clarity on our outlook for 2017 today. In 2017, we currently expect to deliver $5.77 to $5.93 in adjusted earnings per share, with results contracting a 0.5% to up 2.5%. It will be a tale of two parts. Our PBM is still expected to deliver healthy growth, while the Retail business is challenged. We currently expect an increase in PBM EBIT of about 8% and a decrease in Retail EBIT of about 8%. As you know, we had another very successful PBM selling season, with significant new business wins and a retention rate of about 97%. Importantly, we have continued to win in the marketplace while maintaining our pricing discipline. Our specialty business is expected to deliver strong growth next year, and our SilverScript's business is also expected to continue to perform very well. So the PBM continues its healthy growth trajectory into next year. In the Retail business, we completed the integration of the Target pharmacies and clinics, and are now better positioned to drive growth. With CVS systems and branding in place, we are ramping up our patient care programs along with our marketing and member engagement campaigns that are expected to increase awareness and utilization of CVS at Target. We also completed the vast majority of the Omnicare integration, although there's still much to do to sell our innovative new programs to the market. In the front store, we continue to drive health and beauty sales, private label sales, and to build upon our personalization strategies as we drive value for customers. However, as we cycle into 2017, our Retail business will be challenged in a few areas, so let me review them now. First, the combination all the network changes that Larry discussed earlier are causing a significant headwind as more than 40 million prescriptions are expected to cycle out of our stores next year. Secondly, although both the Omnicare and Target pharmacy acquisitions are performing well, the ramp-up in the level of accretion is slightly slower than anticipated. Between them, the year-over-year improvement in accretion was initially forecasted at $0.26. However, we now currently expect the year-over-year incremental accretion to be about $0.17, which includes the script impact on the CVS Pharmacies within Target related to the network changes that we discussed. We are making good progress on these acquisitions, but it's taking a little longer than expected to realize all of the benefits. And finally, we continue to see ongoing margin declines related to both reimbursement pressures and the mix of business. The offsets to margin pressures, as you know, are lumpy and they relate to the anticipated timing of generics along with the timing of share gains. Recall that our growth model has been based on driving share through our channels to offset the ongoing reimbursement pressures in the business, which we have been very successful at accomplishing for the past several years. Given the recent network changes, it has become more difficult to grow our share, and therefore, offset the ongoing margin pressures in the near term. So 2017 will be a challenging year from that perspective. As you know, we are committed to driving shareholder value, and our cash generation capabilities are a real asset to our shareholders. We will continue to increase our dividend on an annual basis and do value-enhancing share repurchases after considering strategic opportunities. To that end, our board has just approved a $15 billion share repurchase authorization. Combined with what we have left on our prior authorization, we now have $18.7 billion available for buy-backs. Our adjusted earnings per share estimates for 2017 assumes that we complete $5 billion in share repurchases. In addition to providing our preliminary outlook for 2017, I wanted to provide a high-level summary of our long-term financial targets, particularly in light of today's news. Back in December of 2013, we provided our five-year financial targets which included many assumptions. If you look at our cumulative performance from our jump-off point in 2013, we're tracking to the higher end of our adjusted EPS targets with a compounded annual growth rate of about 13.6% from 2013 through 2016. Given the sheer scale of our enterprise with about $180 billion in revenue and more than $10 billion in EBIT, we want to acknowledge that maintaining a 10% to 14% adjusted earnings per share growth rate off a much larger base is becoming more challenging. So going forward, we are targeting enterprise adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 10% on average. Some years may be higher than 10% while some years may be a bit lower than that. And we expect that growth should generate $7 billion to $8 billion in free cash flow per year on average. And again, we will provide more details at our Analyst Day coming up, and we continue to believe that we are very well positioned in the healthcare marketplace, and we will continue to work diligently to deliver on these targets. And so with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry. Larry J. Merlo: Well, thanks, Dave. Well, obviously, we are not satisfied with next year's growth projection. We have a plan in place to return to healthy operating profit growth, and let me provide a high-level outline of that plan. First, we will leverage our enterprise capabilities and CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition to partner more broadly with other PBMs and health plans. We have capabilities that generate results that other retail competitors simply cannot match, so we'll begin to offer a suite of bundled services, including exclusive capabilities such as MinuteClinic services, infusion and long-term care capabilities as a component of the CVS Pharmacy value proposition. And as the healthcare market continues its evolution to a value-based environment, the clinical capabilities that are resident today at CVS Pharmacies will become increasingly important, making us a clear partner of choice. Second, we'll focus on driving growth through new PBM product introductions that capitalize on the benefits inherent in our unique integrated model. Some offerings by others in the market, they have attempted to mimic the success of our programs, such as Maintenance Choice, and while they may get part of the way there, we don't believe they can extract the full value that we do through our truly integrated model. Our ongoing innovations will encompass clinical solutions to support all stages of care : new value-based contracting approaches in specialty and traditional pharmacy, including partnering with pharma in different ways to drive savings; new CVS Caremark retail network strategies including performance-based networks; as well as a new generation of Maintenance Choice that will offer even more convenience and help drive further adoption. Third, in this environment, it's critical to continue to be a low-cost provider. And to that end, we've begun work on a new multi-year enterprise operations improvement initiative that will generate significant annual savings beginning in 2017 and accelerating beyond. And while we've been efficient and productive in our business, we do see additional opportunities to leverage the technology investments that we have made to further improve enterprise-wide efficiencies. And fourth, we'll continue to be very thoughtful with respect to using our strong cash generation capabilities to return value to our shareholders. We expect to continue to evaluate opportunities for acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial criteria, and we'll be disciplined about investing in the right opportunities that drive long-term growth. So before closing, let me reiterate that we continue to be confident in our business model, and our ability to drive long-term growth. You know, we've always said that the beauty of our model is that we can pivot to address changes that take place in the market, and we'll continue to do that as the healthcare market evolves. We're the only company with the ability to impact not just patients, but also payers and providers with channel-agnostic solutions. Furthermore, our goals around achieving higher quality at a lower cost are very much aligned with our partners, and we'll continue to find new and innovative ways to drive value for patients, payers and providers by making care more accessible, more affordable and more effective. And we certainly look forward to speaking with you in greater detail about all of the initiatives that I just outlined at our Analyst Day next month. So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please proceed. Lisa Christine Gill : Thanks very much for the detail, and good morning. Larry, I just want to better understand competitively what's happening on the retail side of the business. So you talked about Walgreens and their new relationship with Prime and Department of Defense, but yet said these 90-day programs not really having much of an impact. Can \u2013 one, can I just better understand the make-up of the 40 million prescriptions you're talking about? Is that just Prime and Department of Defense? Or is there some assumption around these 90-day programs? Or any other restrictions around network? And then secondly, can you maybe just give us a better understanding of what the opportunities are in your own Caremark book of business to try to replace some of this volume over time? I know you've talked in the past that especially with health plan business, it takes time to work these programs in. But is that an incremental opportunity over the next couple of years of hey, you know what, they might be taking away some market share from others, but we've got this really big business that we've won over the last few years and we can pull it into our own store? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Lisa. It's Larry. Let me start, and then I'm sure others will jump in here. Lisa, if you go back to the 40 million scripts that we talked about, and if you looked at the make-up of that, it's probably about 40%; 40% of that 40 million is the TRICARE impact, and then the Prime impact, and the balance of that is just the normal churn that takes place in any particular selling season. So it's really a function of the restricting of those networks. David M. Denton: Yeah, Lisa, this is Dave. Just to be clear, this is not necessarily a 90-day offering; these are restricted networks which takes CVS fully out of the network offerings. Lisa Christine Gill : No. I understand that. I understand that, but I'm just saying that I think you made the comment that that's specific to this, but you're not really seeing any shift in the 90-day. Is there the risk, Dave, that we do start to see some of these 90-day programs pick up, and so it would be more than 40 million scripts that need to come out next year? That's what I was trying to get at. David M. Denton: Lisa, I think we've contemplated that into our outlook for 2017. As you know, when we sell in a 90-day network with co-pay incentives, either into our book or somebody sells it into their book, there is movement of scripts, and that's contemplated in our script forecast for next year. So those are fully contemplated. And then... Lisa Christine Gill : Okay. And then what about on the other side, though? Like, for your own book of business, do you see an opportunity? I just look at how much business you've won in the last few years. Is there that opportunity to start pulling more of that into your store, maybe not in 2017, but beyond 2017? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Lisa, listen, we think that we compete very effectively on price, and our network strategies are a critical part of that value proposition. We always offer our clients a variety of network options to meet their specific needs of their members, and certainly, the results prove out that CVS Pharmacy drives better outcomes and better overall performance as a result of our integrated model. And we look to aggressively sell that to our clients to help them achieve better outcomes and lower overall costs. And at the end of the day, we have multiple network options, and the choice is up to our clients. We have continued to see steady progress, alluding to the new business that we picked up over the last couple of years, especially last year as we've talked about it, it is a longer tail, if you will, on the health plan side of the business than the employer side, but we've seen steady progress there, and there's certainly more opportunity that remains. Lisa Christine Gill : Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Lisa. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed. John Heinbockel : So, guys, if you think about that 10% growth rate long-term, that would sort of suggest I think mid-single digit EBIT growth. Is it fair to think the PBM would grow faster than Retail? And any thought on where you think Retail can grow? I assume you would think after 2017 you would be back to gaining share and leveraging the Retail business. David M. Denton: Yeah, John, it's Dave. Obviously, we do expect to return to healthy growth in 2018 and beyond. And yes, I think if you look at our long-term growth rate at approximately 10%, the company generates a significant amount of cash. That cash can be effectively utilized to return value to shareholders through value-enhancing share repurchases, which if you look at the past practices, we've delivered somewhere between 4% to 5% to 6% adjusted earnings per share growth just from the cash that we generate out of the business, which is significant. Obviously, we do believe that the underlying business organically is going to be able to grow healthy. We don't really provide guidance by segment because our businesses are really integrated today, but we do expect to return to that healthy growth outlook in 2018 and beyond. Larry J. Merlo: And, John, and keep in mind, to Dave's last point, we've got \u2013 as you look at our model, some of the dispensing channels that may fall traditionally under the Retail umbrella in other businesses like specialty or mail, that's flowing through the PBM segment in our reporting. John Heinbockel : And when you \u2013 do you think when you think about restrictive networks and your approach to them, do you think about that a little bit differently going forward, or pretty much the same as you had? And you talked about sort of going after enterprise-wide cost reduction. Does that tie-in at all to how you think about attacking restrictive networks? Larry J. Merlo: Well, John, listen, in the environment in which we're all operating, being the most efficient and productive, that continues to be a key guiding principle, if you will. And we've done a number of things over the years. We have historically been a very efficient and productive provider when you look at our cost metrics, and as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, leveraging many of the investments that we've made in technology over the last few years, we have another opportunity to do that. And again, as Dave mentioned, we'll outline the details around that at Analyst Day. John Heinbockel : Okay. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Robert Patrick Jones : Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just \u2013 I have to imagine the Retail network rates needed to shift this level of share away from CVS, it'd obviously have to be pretty meaningful. Can you guys give us any sense of the discounts that you've seen offered in the marketplace to exclude CVS Pharmacies? And then I guess as it relates specifically to the Prime example, were you given the opportunity to match the pricing that was offered to create these restrictive networks? David M. Denton: Yeah, Bob, this is Dave. Maybe I'll start with that. I think what was interesting about these couple of market moves is that typically we see a pretty competitively bid process. These major network changes quite honestly happened without a chance for us to actively engage and really tell our value proposition as these changes were contemplated in both Prime and with TRICARE. So from that perspective, we were kind of caught a little bit off guard. Robert Patrick Jones : Understood. And then I guess just looking at the math for 2017, it seems like the majority of the kind of below long-term EPS growth is really from this share shift, these 40 million scripts you guys highlighted, but you did then put out the long-term expectation for 10% growth. Given that there does seem to be this price for volume trade-off occurring in the marketplace, how can you get comfortable that we really kind of see the end of this, or more of a stabilization of this as we move beyond 2017? David M. Denton: I think a little bit around that, if you look at the \u2013 some of the competitive pressures that we're seeing right now are not necessarily new. We face reimbursement pressures and network changes on an ongoing basis. And you think about it the way we've offset it really is three ways. One's, we've lowered our cost of goods sold, and our Red Oak joint venture is a great example of that. We've improved the efficiency, and we're continuing to launch a new program this year to further improve the efficiency across our network. And then finally, we've been able to increase the capture of dispensing share into one of our channels. Obviously, in 2017 that lever is not really available to us. But I do think, if you look at how we're positioned in the marketplace, and our ability to plug in and really add a lot of value to the payers, that we serve, I think we're really nicely positioned in a world of which networks begin to narrow and outcomes become more important. Larry J. Merlo: And, Bob, it's Larry. Just a couple of other additional points. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, the point about CVS Pharmacy's ability to provide incremental offerings, leveraging the assets that emanate out of CVS Pharmacy besides simply dispensing, I think that becomes an important component of the story, recognizing the cost savings opportunities that result from MinuteClinic or infusion, as it relates to site of care management, and now long-term care pharmacy. And we believe that we can enhance our value with other PBMs, okay, not just Caremark, in making those services available that will be very much aligned with their clients in an effort to provide high quality, and at the same time, lower costs. So we believe we can be a partner of choice as we go forward. Robert Patrick Jones : Make sense. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Bob. Operator : Our next question is from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. George R. Hill: Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to look at the PBM side a little bit from this angle. I guess, Larry, can you talk about what you're seeing in the PBM selling season as it relates to pricing, and what I'm wondering is have Walgreens pharmacies, PBM competitors, ESI, Optum Prime with lower network rates that are going to pressure you on that side of the business as well, and make it harder to retain PBM business? Larry J. Merlo: Well, George, it's Larry. I'll start. Others may want to jump in. As we've said for probably the last couple years now, pricing certainly is competitive, but we've seen it remain rational in the marketplace. We haven't seen anything on the horizon that changes our view of that, and we're beginning the 2018 selling season, as we speak. So obviously we'll be talking more about that as we get into the new year, but it seems to be lining up very consistent with prior years. George R. Hill: Okay. And then maybe a quick follow-up with Dave, I guess, anything you can give us to make us more comfortable with that medium-term earnings growth profile of 10%, given that these issues in retail are likely to persist because these market share gains and these pricings and these multi-year contracts, it's going to be hard to turn in one year or even two years maybe. How do we think about the mix of operating earnings growth versus capital deployment? Just how do we get to the 10%? David M. Denton: Yeah, we'll talk, I'm sure, a little bit more about that in December, but I will go back to say if you look at our past track record, when you look at our ability to gain share both from a PBM perspective and then turning that share into dispensing channel share gain in our network, we've been quite productive at doing that, and I think the outlook for that remains strong. Keep in mind we still have a very robust specialty business. It continues to perform well. We have a very large Medicare Part D business that is performing quite well, and we've done two fairly sizable acquisitions in the form of Omnicare and Target, both while are not being as accretive as we once thought, as we cycle into 2017, but as we look long-term have a real opportunity for us to grow and develop that business in a meaningful way. And again, and finally, not to put this \u2013 to minimize this, if you look at the cash that our organization throws off, we can get a substantial amount of accretion just from the share buy-back program as you look at deploying that capital in a very effective way, keeping in mind, we might also deploy that capital from a strategic lens to make sure that we bolt on the right businesses to enhance the infrastructure that we have today. George R. Hill: Okay. Thanks, guys, I appreciate the color. David M. Denton: You're welcome. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, George. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Eric Percher from Barclays. Please proceed. Eric Percher : Thank you. Another question related to the profitability of the 40 million scripts, and maybe I'll come at it this way : if you hadn't seen the unexpected or kind of non-competitively bid pieces move away, would your earnings growth have been within shouting distance of the 10% guidance that you're providing? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Eric, the \u2013 as you think about the answer to that, it brings us back to \u2013 going \u2013 I guess it would've been 2012/2013 when Walgreens and Express had a dispute, and certainly, many capitalized on that in the marketplace. And if you looked at the profitability associated with those incremental scripts at that point in time, it parallels what we talked about this morning, extracting from that the advertising and labor investments that we made in an effort to gain a disproportionate number of those scripts. So again, factoring that in, we certainly would have been within striking distance of that 10% target that Dave outlined. David M. Denton: Yeah, Eric, just keep in mind, too, that if you look at the, as we cycle into 2017, there were really three, I guess, topics that I outlined that were headwinds. One is obviously the loss of prescriptions in the marketplace. Two is slightly less accretion in the two acquisitions. And third, I'll say the competitive reimbursement pressures and the mix in our business. All three of those contribute to our slower growth or lack of growth in 2017. Eric Percher : That's helpful. And on the third one, if we look at the PDP performance, it looks like this quarter was in line with what you expected. We see fewer preferred relationships next year. Can you speak to the way in which that may be impacting the next year, kind of the outlook on PDP? David M. Denton: Yeah, we have, I think, a very nice growth plan for 2017 in SilverScripts. Our PDP business continues to take share and perform well, both this year, and we expect the same next year. Larry J. Merlo: And, Eric, obviously, we're in the annual enrollment period, so it's open for another month, and from early indications, we've gotten off to a good start. Obviously we'll provide a recap once the season closes, and we'll probably talk a little bit more about that at Analyst Day. Eric, on the Retail side, I'm not sure if your question was really looking at SilverScript or CVS Pharmacy's presence in the Medicare Part D networks. It would be on par with our various relationships this year, absent some of the changes that took place in the Prime sponsored Med D network. Eric Percher : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Larsen from Leerink Partners. Please proceed. David M. Larsen: Hey. Can you talk about the timing of these retail network contracts? Like, how long do they last for? And are there any other sort of large, I guess, PBM contracts on the retail side that are up that would (39:16) perhaps enable you to win all or some of that business back over the next year or two? Larry J. Merlo: Well, David, as you look at the retail contracting cycles, they are probably, I would describe them as more frequent than they once were, acknowledging that the Medicare space is an annual cycle. And some of this gets back to, in our prepared remarks, our plan to respond to these marketplace changes, the opportunity that we see us having with other PBMs, recognizing our goal of providing more bundled services. So we have \u2013 today we have contracts with \u2013 retail contracts with all the PBMs, and we'll be working with those goals and objectives in mind that we outlined, again, in our prepared remarks, to enhance our offerings with them. David M. Larsen: Okay. That's great. And then in terms of like drug pricing, like, let's say, there's been a deceleration of brand inflation, there's generic deflation. Has that had any impact on your 2017 guidance, or not? And then is there any update to the net new wins for the PBM and also your retention rate? Thanks. David M. Denton: Yeah, David, this is Dave. I think from an inflation standpoint, no real material change to our outlook in both branded and generic, and that is not presenting either a headwind or a tailwind as we cycle into 2017. So that's not really a factor in all the prepared remarks that we just talked about. Larry J. Merlo: And, David, in terms of the update on the selling season, I believe we have a slide in there. It's pretty much on par with what we reported on the second quarter call. The net business is slightly lower, reflecting some of the changes that you've seen in terms of some of our health plan partners exiting the exchange business, and \u2013 but it's not really material. And our retention rate remains right around 97%. David M. Larsen: Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Next question? Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Scott A. Mushkin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question; hopefully I can articulate it well. But I guess I'm kind of going back to Lisa's question and some of the questions earlier in the call. I'm trying to understand why your vertical model appears to have lost some steam in the marketplace compared to what Walgreens is doing with some of their partnerships, and why those partnerships seem to be having more success on restricted networks, at least right now, and more success on the 90-day retail? It's our understanding Texas is going to have a 90-day retail component in that contract. Is Walgreens and the health care plan attached to a PBM cost advantage to you guys when you look at it with your PBM retail model attached to a health plan? I'm just trying to understand if the model \u2013 where the model stands and how you guys are viewing that? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Scott, let me \u2013 there's probably a couple questions in there, and let me start, and then I'll ask others to jump in. That first of all, from an integrated model perspective, Scott, I don't believe that we have lost any steam whatsoever, okay? As you heard Dave mentioned in our prepared remarks, Caremark once again had another very successful selling season, despite some of the publicized losses that occurred back in the spring timeframe, with net new business well over $4 billion, compounding prior successful selling seasons. And as we talked, we continue to grow enterprise dispensing share. Obviously, for the reasons that we mentioned earlier, not enough share growth to offset the 40 million script headwind, but we continue to make progress. And back to Lisa's question, we continue to see opportunities beyond that. In your question, Scott, around is Walgreens making some headwind here, listen, we can hypothesize that there may be a perception out there that CVS Pharmacy is not a neutral platform, okay? And by the way, that's reflected in our response to this environment and our efforts to demonstrate that we are the best partner to all PBMs and health plans, given our unique suite of capabilities along with our track record of delivering results. So \u2013 and I think we're all very confident that that will make a difference. And obviously, as you've heard us say many times, we believe that we have the right assets in terms of the healthcare environment moving forward. I'm not talking about 2017 now, recognizing this retailization of healthcare and the role that the consumer will play and the migration from a fee-for-service system to one that's more value-based, acknowledging that that migration has been slower than what everyone would like to see, but it is happening. Scott A. Mushkin: All right. That was it for me. Thanks, Larry, for the answer. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta from Barclays. Please proceed. Priya Ohri-Gupta: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Dave, just given some of the moving pieces that we have over the short-term, and then given your moderation in terms of EPS growth over the medium-term, how should we think about your balance sheet usage? Leverage target? Ratings target? Was hoping to get your thoughts on that since we didn't hear that in your prepared remarks. Thank you. David M. Denton: Sure. We're very committed to maintaining our high BBB rating. We're still very committed to returning to the 2.7 times adjusted debt to EBITDA. As you heard as our cash flow performance this year has been quite strong, we're going to probably de-lever a bit more this year than we thought we were going to in our original plan, given that strong cash flow performance. As we cycle into 2017, kind of given all the moving parts and I'll say the headwinds that we have, our leverage will probably, year-over-year, our leverage will be essentially constant. We will not deleverage as we cycle into 2017. We will work to get back down to that leverage target in a reasonable amount of time. Priya Ohri-Gupta: Thank you. That's very helpful. David M. Denton: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Peter H. Costa: Thanks for the question. Larry, do you see this as more of a response to your verticalization of the industry in terms of the industry becoming more vertical? Or do you see this as the start of a price war from Walgreens trying to take more share and fixing their pharmacy counter? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Peter. Listen. There's certainly been competitive pressures; that's nothing new to the healthcare environment. As you've heard us talk many times, we've experienced them for several years now in both Retail and PBM segments. We have several ways in which we manage against those reimbursement pressures, whether it's lowering our cost of goods. And we've gotten some nice synergies from the Red Oak model, and that team continues to work to bring even more innovation. As we talk, continuing to be the most efficient and productive provider of care and then growing our share. And unfortunately, that third lever of growing share will not happen in 2017. And again, as we've been talking this morning, we have a response plan to the market dynamics and a plan to reaccelerate our growth there. So that's how we see the marketplace. And probably not changing beyond that dynamic anytime soon. Peter H. Costa: So just as a follow-up, do you see yourself then responding to this by trying to lower price to re-win some of those customers that went away from you, or get into those networks again? Or do you see them as vertical networks that have been separated away from you? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Peter, again, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, I don't want to be redundant, but we're very confident that in responding to these market dynamics, the ability to enhance the CVS Pharmacy value proposition and include other services that have been proven to drive down costs, we believe will be appealing for PBMs, because it's very much aligned with the goals for their clients. Peter H. Costa: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Alvin Concepcion from Citi. Please proceed. Alvin Caezar Concepcion : Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on that. Just unclear. Beyond TRICARE and Prime, are you seeing the differentiation of your model, your integrated offering? Is that weighing less on the decision of payers? Or are they just more motivated by price at this point? And do you need to consider lowering your threshold on margins? Or are you sticking with your plan? David M. Denton: Alvin, this is Dave. I think our value proposition continues to resonate in the marketplace, both from the PBM perspective and a Retail perspective. A couple of network changes obviously went the other way on us here. But I do believe that the power of our integrated model and the things that we can offer to payers when we're not the PBM or the things that we can offer to the ultimate payer when we are the PBM, really still quite relevant in the marketplace. It's getting a lot of traction, and we continue to perform well from that perspective. And we think the outlook beyond 2017 as we get into 2018 and the years out, I think is quite strong. Alvin Caezar Concepcion : Great. And just my follow-up, I don't know if you're planning on providing color on sales longer term relative to the 13% target. I know that the losses are probably impacting that, so I'm wondering if you could give any more color on that. David M. Denton: We'll probably give a little bit more color on Analyst Day, but I expect to walk through the model at a macro level as I've done in prior years and make sure everybody understands our growth algorithm. Alvin Caezar Concepcion : Okay. Thank you. David M. Denton: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mohan Naidu from Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed. Mohan Naidu : Thank you so much for taking my questions. Larry, you talked about you're giving your clients option of various network coverages. Can you talk about what portion of your business has restrictive networks that were CVS exclusive? Larry J. Merlo: You know what, we have not provided it as a percentage. We've talked about the number of clients and members and Maintenance Choice, and I believe that number is now over 23 million lives, and that is \u2013 Maintenance Choice will constitute our most restrictive network. Mohan Naidu : Okay. Got it. Maybe if I can \u2013 one quick follow-up for Dave. So Dave, you're talking about the 40 million scripts for next year, and that includes the TRICARE and Walgreens. How much of that is unknown that you have baked in for further changes as you go into 2017? David M. Denton: I think as we said here for 2017, we have a pretty good handle on, I'd say, network changes. Keep in mind, most network changes happen kind of in late Q3, early Q4 as you cycle into next year. So we have a pretty good line of sight to our network participation and volume outlook as a network participant as we cycle into 2017. So I think we're pretty good there. Mohan Naidu : Okay. Thank you. David M. Denton: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Please proceed. James Auh : Hi. It's James Auh for Charles. So my question is, so you mentioned that you plan to infuse new PBM product in the future to drive growth. What kind of solutions can we expect? One of your competitors is taking a risk on price with inflation protection. Do you plan to provide a similar solution? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Jim, we have that today in our offerings where we have price protection for our clients. In our prepared remarks, we talked about the four areas of new product innovation around clinical solutions, new value-based contracting approaches, both in specialty and traditional pharmacy, and then a new retail network strategies that would include performance-based networks. We have that a little bit today in Medicare Part D, but we see an opportunity to go further with that to be very much aligned with value-based reimbursement and outcomes management. And then a new generation of Maintenance Choice, so again we'll provide a lot more details next month at Analyst Day but that's how we're thinking about it. And by the way, there are elements of risk that we take today, whether it's in Medicare or some aspects of what we do with NovoLogix in terms of managing that portion of pharmacy flowing through the medical benefit. James Auh : Also, how much capital deployment is assumed in the preliminary 2017 guidance? David M. Denton: We have $5 billion in share repurchase is within that guidance range, and we'll talk more about the dividend on Analyst Day. But we do expect over time that we will be deploying \u2013 raising our dividend up to our 35% payout ratio by 2018. That expectation is still consistent with our thoughts. James Auh : All right. Great. Thank you. David M. Denton: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Yeah, hi. Good morning. Two questions here. First one, obviously it seems that growth on the PBM side is going to be key to achieving the 10% long-term earnings growth. So can you just give us some context in how much business you have up for renewal, how much PBM business you have up for renewal for next year, i.e., for the 2017/2018 selling season? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Ricky, it's Larry. We've got $22 billion to $24 billion up for renewal. Keep in mind that that's off a much higher denominator. So as a percentage, it would be pretty much on par with prior years. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Okay. Thank you. And -- David M. Denton: Ricky, I would also \u2013 I would just add that I think it was probably important to step back, and you talked about the PBM being the growth engine, and while it is, we need to really think about the enterprise. Our business is so integrated now that you need to really look at it in totality from that perspective. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Okay. And then, Larry, in response to one of the questions, you really talked about the fact that you think that you have all the assets that you need in your portfolio to succeed longer term. Off the (55:40) health plans are key to longer-term success as we see the Optum-United model developing further. So can you talk a little bit about how you think about that managed care model partnership versus ownership? And obviously, Anthem talked last week about putting an RFP out early next year. So how important do you feel an Anthem-like contract for your long-term strategy? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Ricky, it's Larry. As you know, we typically do not talk about specific contracts or specific RFPs. And as you think about the healthcare business broadly or health plan business broadly, today we have over 70 health plan relationships with the PBM. Obviously, it's an important growth component of the business, and there's nothing that prevents us from adding to that list as we've done the last couple of years. I do think that there is an ongoing evaluation of, does the health plan in-source their pharmacy PBM functionality, or do they outsource it? And we continue to believe that whether you're looking at size and scale or the fact that pharmacy is our focus and the clinical capabilities that we bring to that, along with the challenges of the regulatory environment from a compliance point of view and the investments that need to be made to comply with that for the Medicare and Medicaid businesses, we think that it makes a lot of sense for folks to outsource that business. And quite frankly, that's what we've seen this year, this past selling season, where I think everyone was trying to figure out that, well, wait a minute, how can everybody grow, okay? And part of the answer to that is that the pie got bigger because there were some health plans that outsourced their PBM, their pharmacy business. Ricky, I think the only other point to add to that is we see opportunities that we have, recognizing the assets that we have assimilated are the ones that largely touch the patient or the consumer. And that gives us the opportunity to partner with health plans, whether we're the PBM or whether we're not the PBM. Obviously, if we are the PBM, there is enhanced offerings that we can provide as a result of the integration. But there are also capabilities that we have that we can partner with health plans in a very differentiated way without having to be the PBM. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Okay. And lastly, one last question. You talk about Target and Omnicare and the integration there. Can you maybe give us some more specific color on what's holding back Target and Omnicare from meeting your near-term accretion expectations? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Ricky, maybe I'll take Omnicare and ask Helena to comment on Target. With Omnicare, Ricky, it's certainly not a question of if; it's more a question of when. And one of the things that we learned this past year through our pilots in the assisted living space is that we found that we had to target both the needs of the residents in those facilities along with the facility operator needs. And in doing that, we need to make some additional and incremental technology investments. Those investments are underway, and they really need to be completed for us to broadly sell the value proposition that we can bring to the assisted living space. So we'll be getting that work done in 2017, and I'm confident that we'll capitalize on the synergies once that work's complete. Helena B. Foulkes: Yeah, and I would say we're actually very happy with Target. As we discussed earlier in the year, the integration certainly led to some disruption which we expected. We've been through a lot of integration and we're on track to achieve the performance we were looking for this year. The most exciting thing I would say is that the Target team has responded in a tremendous way to the new systems and programs that we've delivered to them. So the service levels in those pharmacies are quite strong. We're seeing them come out of the integrations and the system changes at a very strong pace. And what we're starting to do now is turn on our patient care programs which CVS historically had and Target did not. And given their ability to execute and how well they've done all year, we're actually feeling quite confident that they'll be able to do that well into 2017. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thanks, Ricky. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Cherny from UBS. Please proceed. Michael Cherny : Good morning, guys, and thanks for all the details. So I want to dive in a little bit on -- the question came up about the assets that you have in place. You obviously spent a lot of time about focusing on the enterprise approach and drive incremental services in the business. As you think more broadly about those services, and this can be obviously the thought process on organic versus inorganic. And maybe using, for example, MinuteClinic and acute care as an option. What's the most sense to bundle in, outside of specialty, are you doing relative to the acute care base that you are ready touch? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Mike, I don't think there's one answer to that question. And I think that the benefit that we have is that we have a series of assets that we can bundle in a whole variety of ways that would meet the needs of that particular client and their members. And so I actually think that will be an advantage to us. Michael Cherny : Okay. That's all I have for now. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Steven Valiquette from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Steven J. Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning. I guess just with TRICARE obviously as a government contract, and then Prime Therapeutics as sort of a different type of entity tied to Blue's plans, just curious if you see differences in appetite for restricted pharmacy networks among different customer types in the market. And I guess, just when thinking about government, versus commercial employers, versus health plan customers. Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah, Steven; this is Jon Roberts. With the employer clients, we clearly have seen a big appetite to restrict networks, narrow networks, so Maintenance Choice with 23 million members has been very successful. When you move over to health plans, you've seen a big appetite in Medicare with preferred networks, most preferred networks. Most Part D plans have preferred networks. In Managed Medicaid we see many of those plans willing to restrict networks. I think where there has been a reluctance historically has been in the fully-insured market, and I think with Prime making a move to narrow their network in fully-insured that may be a catalyst for the rest of the market. So we view that as an opportunity. And I think with the government programs it's a little bit of a mixed bag. We see some willing to move into either restricted or Maintenance Choice networks and others like full access. So different parts of our client base really do have different priorities and willingness to narrow or restrict networks. Steven J. Valiquette: Okay. So there are some changes in the market, maybe some growing appetite. But maybe just to confirm again, this is asked a bunch of different ways, but do you characterize these most recent changes as rational competition? Just to try to confirm that. Just given how some of these stocks are reacting today. I think people are worried about irrational pricing. But just would you characterize these last two changes as rational competition? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Steve, I would say as we've talked many times, whether it's on the PBM or Retail side, we've continued to see margin compression. And I would say that we have not seen anything that we would put under the heading of irrational. David M. Denton: And I guess I would \u2013 this is Dave. I guess I would just look at the Prime decision. And it appears to us \u2013 and listen, we're a little bit of an observer here is that Walgreens acquired their specialty pharmacy and their mail order pharmacy or at least partnered with them from that perspective. And I'm assuming that as part of the arrangement, there was some network participation agreement that was confirmed through Prime. So I think that might be a little bit of a unique animal compared to other network changes in the marketplace. Larry J. Merlo: And, Steve, again I think Dave mentioned this in response to one of the earlier questions that in the two cases that we've talked a fair amount this morning, we became aware of the network changes after the fact and were not given the opportunity to respond. So in an irrational pricing environment, you would not \u2013 you would expect a different type of process associated with that. Steven J. Valiquette: Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. We'll take two more questions, please. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed. Eric Bosshard : Thanks. In terms of the updated long-term growth target, Dave, I understood some of the measures that you outlined, the size of the company. But curious if there's anything that you could help us with today in terms of different assumptions; if this is a different rate of you gaining share. If this is a different rate of underlying market growth, or an assumption that's different about profitability opportunities. Just curious if you could give us a little bit more color behind what's different with the long-term growth rate going forward. David M. Denton: Yeah, Eric, obviously as I said, we're jumping off a lot bigger base at this point in time given where we were in 2013 as we've grown the company substantially. This is probably a deeper conversation that we probably have time for on the call today, but it was something that we'll talk about more at Analyst Day. I will say though that if you just look broadly, I don't believe the fundamentals of our growth algorithm has substantially changed. Obviously, the marketplace has moved a bit and there's been different offerings in the marketplace. But I think our ability to compete in the market hasn't changed in a substantial fashion. And we do believe that if you look at the market probably where it was a few years ago to where it is now, obviously the government-sponsored plans and health plans have grown, and they continue to be a growth area. Whereas the employer book has been relatively modest and flattish from a growth perspective. So we'll see more of our growth coming out of government-sponsored plans over time. And again, I think we're nicely positioned with all of our assets to compete successfully and gaining share in that marketplace. So that's probably the biggest I'll say underlying change is to \u2013 as we pivot to make sure we service that need of the segment of the market. Eric Bosshard : Okay. Thank you. David M. Denton: You're welcome. Operator : And our final question is from the line of Todd Duvick from Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Todd Duvick : Good morning. Thank you for the question. Dave, I had a follow-up for you with respect to your guidance about free cash flow. Given that free cash flow is a little stronger this year and you talked about de-levering in 2016 and probably flat in 2017. You have a debt maturing in December, a $750 million note. Should we assume that you're going to pay that note off as opposed to refinance it? And then with respect to share buybacks in 2017, should we assume that those are going to be fully funded from free cash flow as opposed to partially debt-financed? David M. Denton: Yes. They will not be debt-financed, other than we might need to do a little short-term borrowing to just accommodate the timing of that. But we will not be issuing debt to support a share repurchase program into 2017. I can't really comment about our debt maturities. I do think at the end of the day, we will be expected to be de-levering over time as we grow our way out of our current capital structure. Just a little bit over 3 times, so probably 2.9 times at the end of the year down to 2.7 times in a reasonable amount of time. Todd Duvick : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Well, let me just thank everyone for your time this morning. And just wrapping up, obviously we're not happy with our outlook for 2017. At the same time, we outlined our actions in response to some of the marketplace dynamics that are taking place. And we're confident that our response and our actions will allow us to reaccelerate our growth going forward, and we look forward to seeing all of you next month at Analyst Day where we'll provide additional details on many of the things we talked about this morning. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Thursday, February 9, 2017. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Nancy Christal, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, madam. Nancy R. Christal: Thank you, Nelson. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Jon Roberts, President of CVS Caremark; and Helena Foulkes, President of CVS Pharmacy are also with us today, and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up, so we can provide more people with the chance to ask their question. Please note that we posted a slide presentation on our website before this call. It summarizes the information in our prepared remarks, as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Later this afternoon, we'll be filing our Form 10-K and it will also be available on our website. During today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section and Cautionary Statement disclosures in those filings. During this call, we'll use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the reconciliations of these non-GAAP items to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And, as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there, following the call, for one year. And now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo. Larry J. Merlo: Well, thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. The solid fourth quarter results we posted today nicely wrap up our 2016 year. And for the full year, consolidated net revenue increased 15.8%, with operating profit growing 8.3% and adjusted earnings per share increasing 13.2% with strong results across the enterprise. And the growth rates I'm citing are on a comparable basis and you can find the non-GAAP adjustments on the slides we posted on our website. Now, as expected, enterprise growth in the fourth quarter was solid with consolidated net revenues increasing 11.7%, operating profit increasing 4.6%, and adjusted EPS increasing 11.8% to $1.71, a penny above the high-end of our guidance. In the fourth quarter, operating profit in the Retail/Long Term Care segment was in line with expectations and operating profit in the PBM segment was ahead of expectations. We generated approximately $1.5 billion of free cash during the quarter and $8.1 billion for the full year, above the high-end of our guidance range. And we'll continue to be thoughtful and discipline with respect to using our strong cash generation capabilities to return value to shareholders. For 2017, we are confirming the EPS and cash flow guidance we provided at our Analyst Day in December, and Dave will review the guidance details in his remarks. Now, before turning to the business update, I want to touch on a few areas of investor interest. And let me start on the topic of DIR within the Medicare Part D program, so we can correct some false and misleading statements in the marketplace which suggested that DIR performance network-based fees represent a material risk to our company; a statement that could not be further from the truth. So here's what you need to know about DIR. First, DIR includes any rebates, any discounts or other price concessions that are unknown at the point-of-sale; and DIR, ultimately, is utilized to reduce the net cost of the Med D program. The second point; DIR performance network fees charged to pharmacies are allowed under CMS regulations. They're fully passed through from the PBM to their clients. They are fully disclosed as part of the annual bid process. And, again, are ultimately used and reflected to help lower member premiums. As a matter of fact, member premiums over a five-year period have increased at a CAGR of just 1.7%. So you can see the positive impact this is having on controlling costs. The third point, and for the reasons just mentioned, CVS Caremark does not keep or profit from performance network-based DIR. And as a reminder to everyone, both CVS Pharmacy and CVS Specialty participate in the same performance network programs being called into question. The fourth point, network pharmacy providers are proactively informed of, and educated on, program details including their forecasted financial impact in advance of program implementation. And the fifth and final point, any suggestion that Part D plans favor high-priced drugs to drive people through the benefit and into catastrophic coverage faster is erroneous, and the data proves that. In fact, the percentage of our beneficiaries reaching the coverage gap and ultimately catastrophic coverage has decreased over the past several years and is a relatively small percentage of our overall population. Now, we don't think DIR is likely to go away given its effectiveness in helping to lower premiums. But hypothetically, if it were to go away, there would be a level playing field, we would remain quite competitive, and we would not expect any material impact on our business. So I hope this clears up the gross misunderstandings surrounding DIR with the simple statements of fact. So with that, let me move on to the topic of the potential repeal and replacement of the ACA. We believe it's important to provide affordable coverage for all Americans, which both Democrats and Republicans have acknowledged. However, at this point, it's extremely difficult for us to comment on the possible scenarios that may play out in the coming months. And that said, CVS Health can pivot to address policy changes, help reduce healthcare costs, and bring meaningful solutions to the marketplace. I also want to address the ongoing rhetoric around drug pricing. And whether it's new launches at elevated price points or increasing prices of older drugs, those contributing to a sense that government interventions are necessary and any suggestion that PBMs are causing drug prices to rise is simply erroneous. We are the solution and not the problem. And that's why both public and private payers continue to count on PBMs as indispensable partners that help to manage their drug trend. And numerous evaluations from the FTC, or the Congressional Budget Office and other government agencies have consistently concluded that PBMs operate in a highly efficient market and drive real savings to the healthcare economy. And our CVS Caremark solutions have helped reduce crime client costs from an unmanaged gross trend of 11.8% to a managed trend of 3.3%; and those results are for the first three quarters of 2016. In addition, a recent industry study showed that every dollar invested in PBM services returned $6 in savings for clients and members. So the value of PBMs is quantitatively pretty clear. And one additional topic that we've received a lot of questions about centers on the potential impact of corporate tax reform. As you know, we are at the highest end of corporate tax payers given our domestic profile, with an effective tax rate around 39%. And the details of tax reform certainly will matter, and today, while there's a lot of discussion, nothing has been reduced to writing. But suffice to say that a fairer tax code that includes a meaningful reduction in the effective corporate tax rate would allow CVS to unlock even greater economic opportunities. So we certainly look forward to continuing to engage in the dialogue around all of these issues that may impact our industry, our business, and the clients and customers that we serve. So let me turn now to the business update, and I'll start with the 2017 PBM selling season. Our gross and net client wins are slightly higher that at Analyst Day with gross wins totaling nearly $7.9 billion, net new business around 4.4 billion and a client retention rate of around 97%. And these numbers exclude enrollment results from our SilverScript PDP, which I'll touch on shortly. In addition, I'm pleased to say that we have had an outstanding welcome season, continuing our record of strong implementations over the last few years. We processed significant more transactions during this year's welcome season, and client satisfaction showed continued improvement across all business lines reaching record performance levels. And while we remain committed to improving and advancing every day, we continue to believe the investments we made in quality, automation and customer focus are delivering measurable value to our clients year after year. Looking ahead, we have about 23 billion up for renewal in 2018, which is comparable with prior years from a percent of business perspective. As for new business, it's pretty early to gauge the full extent of RFP activities in the 2018 selling season. And our strong service history, our size and scale, and our unique suite of capabilities gives us the tools we need to be successful in retaining business and winning in the marketplace as opportunities arise. Now, as we've discussed many times, top of mind for our clients continues to be managing their rapidly growing specialty trend. And we offer a comprehensive set of solutions and continue to see solid growth in specialty. And specialty revenues increased 12% in the fourth quarter, continuing to outpace the market. Our Medicare Part D business, SilverScript, wrapped up another successful annual enrollment period and retained its position as the number one PDP spots. We began the 2017 plan year with more than 5.5 million captive PDP lives and that includes EGWPs, and that's up about 10% from January of the prior year. When adding the Med D lives we manage for our health plan clients, the non-captive lives, the total rises to 12.3 million Med D lies under management. And you can find a reconciliation of the Med D lives in the posted slides. Now, moving on to the fourth quarter results and the Retail/ Long Term Care business, same-store prescription volumes increased 2%. That's on a 30-day equivalent basis. Total same-store sales decreased 0.7%, with pharmacy same-store sales up 0.2%. Our pharmacy comps were negatively impacted by about 380 basis points due to recent generic introductions. And they were also negatively impacted by the decision to restrict CVS out of the TRICARE network. And as we said on our last call, that network changes communicated in early October with a December 1 effective date. And we saw these scripts begin to migrate out of our stores during the fourth quarter and in line with our expectations. Let me touch briefly on the CVS pharmacies within the Target stores. And now that the integration is behind us, we're seeing improving script performance versus prior quarters; and this is being driven by the strength of our patient care programs and Maintenance Choice. The Target pharmacies have also exhibited a solid operational foundation providing high levels of service to our patients. So we're making good progress since completing the integration activities and moving in the right direction. In our Long Term Care pharmacy business, we continue to target the significant growth opportunities we see in the Assisted and Independent Living markets. And we're focused on creating better solutions that meet the need of senior living communities and their residents. And we're taking advantage of all of our enterprise assets, including CVS Pharmacy, our infusion properties and MinuteClinic. And we launched some new programs in these settings during 2016, we're piloting others in early 2017 and we'll have more on these programs in the coming quarters. Before turning to the front store, let me highlight our recent announcement on generic epinephrine. Given the urgent need in the marketplace for a less expensive epinephrine auto-injector for patients with life-threatening allergies, we partnered with Impax to purchase their product at a price lower than similar brand or authorized generic products. And we now have available at all CVS Pharmacy locations the authorized generic for Adrenaclick at a cash price of about $110, a price that's 80% lower than that of the brand competition in the market. And this move is consistent with the fact that increasing competition within therapeutic drug classes is a way to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, and we're using our capabilities and our scale to do just that. Turning to the front store business, comps decreased 2.9% as a result of softer customer traffic, combined with our continued focus on increasing personalization and rationalizing our promotional strategies. At the same time, front store gross margin once again improved in the quarter versus last year. And keep in mind that our front store business accounts for about 11% of our enterprise revenues, and these personalization efforts are allowing us to invest our promotional spend in a differentiated way producing margin flow-through. In fact, we have started to further reduce mass promotion in 2017 to better serve our loyal customers and continue driving profitable front store sales. We continue to focus on growing our beauty, healthcare and personal care businesses, and recognizing the growing presence in the digital market, we've been focused on enhancing our online capabilities to create an integrated health and pharmacy experience that only CVS can provide. CVS Curbside is now live in about 4,000 CVS Pharmacy stores and it provides a fast, seamless shopping experience with customers ordering products on their mobile devices and then picking them up at a CVS store without getting out of the car. We also introduced CVS Pay which allows customers to pick up prescriptions, use ExtraCare, pay for front store items, all with one scan of their CVS app. And this year, we plan to enhance our online shopping tool and further integrate personalization into digital platforms to increase engagement with health and beauty shoppers. We also continue to roll out store resets to improve our health and beauty leadership. Our focus is on scaling our healthy food selection and optimizing our key categories in the health quadrant and elevating our beauty offerings while improving shopability. And finally, Store Brands remain an area of strength and significant opportunity. Our Store Brands represented 23.7% of front store sales in the quarter and that's up about 160 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. Now, before turning it over to Dave for the financial review, I want to again acknowledge the near-term headwinds in the retail business this year given the unexpected network changes we highlighted late last year. And as previously outlined, we have a plan in place to return to more robust levels of earnings growth. And let me quickly summarize this four-point plan in response to the near-term market dynamics. First, we'll leverage our enterprise capabilities and CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition to partner more broadly with other PBMs and health plans to deliver the greatest overall healthcare value. And our partnership with Optum, which starts with a 90-day solution, is a great example and we look forward to discussing other long-term opportunities to bring together complementary capabilities that provide greater convenience and value for our clients and customers. We've begun to offer a menu of services to other PBMs and health plans as well, including exclusive capabilities such as MinuteClinic services, infusion and Long Term Care capabilities as a component of the CVS pharmacy value proposition. Second, we'll continue to innovate to bring new integrated PBM products to market that capitalize on the benefits inherent in our unique integrated model, while meeting the ongoing needs of our clients and members. Third, as we discussed on Analyst Day, we've begun work on a new multi-year enterprise streamlining initiative. And through these efforts, we expect to achieve nearly $3 billion in cumulative savings by 2021. And fourth, we have significant cash generation capabilities that provide us with a variety of ways to grow and return value to shareholders. And we remain confident that we can achieve solid operating profit growth across the enterprise in the years ahead. And our substantial cash flow affords us opportunities to bolster that growth, either through strategic acquisitions to supplement our existing asset base or through value-enhancing share repurchases. So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review. David M. Denton: Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide a detailed review of our 2016 fourth quarter results, and I'll briefly touch upon our 2017 guidance, which again remains materially unchanged from what we outlined back in December. First, I'll start with a summary of last year's capital allocation program. Maximizing shareholder value continues to be a major focus of CVS Health. And the key areas we focus on to do this are : driving productive long-term growth, generating significant levels of free cash flow, and remaining disciplined in our approach to capital allocation. In summary, for the year of 2016, we delivered adjusted earnings per share growth on a comparable basis of more than 13%, generated more than $8 billion in free cash, and returned very significant $6.3 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. And I think this clearly demonstrates how we've continued to use our strong free cash flow to drive shareholder value. So with that, let's walk through some of the details. We continue to drive steady state improvement in our dividend payout ratio. Recall back in 2010 that our payout ratio was approximately 14%. We finished 2016 with a payout ratio of 34.6%, more than double 2010's level and 450 basis points higher than 2015. Keep in mind that this ratio is artificially high as it includes the integration cost related to both Omnicare and Target, as well as other items described in our non-GAAP reconciliation on our website. So there's still room for growth. We paid approximately $1.8 billion in dividends in 2016 and $456 million in the fourth quarter alone. Our earnings outlook this year, combined with the 18% increase in the dividend we announced at Analyst Day, keeps us well on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 35% by 2018. Along with a significant increase in our dividend, we've continued to repurchase our shares. For all of 2016, we repurchased approximately 48 million shares for about $4.5 billion, averaging $96.78 per share. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares for $461 million, averaging $75.20 per share. At the end of 2016, we had $18.2 billion left in authorizations for share buybacks, and we continue to expect to repurchase $5 billion this year. Our expectation is that we will return more than $7 billion to our shareholders in 2017 through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases. And given the dislocation of our stock price, recently, we entered into two accelerated share repurchase transactions totaling $3.6 billion and we've repurchased 36.1 million shares at a price of $80.34 per share in January. This represents 80% of the total value of the transaction, which will close by the third quarter. We generated $1.5 billion of free cash in the fourth quarter. And all of 2016, we generated approximately $8.1 billion of free cash, which exceeded the high-end of our guidance by about $1 billion. The outperformance was primarily driven by the timing of PBM cash receipts and payables. And keep in mind that some amount of this beat is timing within Medicare Part D as we will end 2016 in a payables position with CMS, and we will need to settle this obligation in 2017. At the same time, we improved our cash cycle by nearly 3.5 days, driven by improved inventory and payables management. And we remain committed to further improvements in working capital as we look forward. For the year, our gross capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion; about $145 million lower than last year. This was due to our expected reduction in store openings as we integrated the Target pharmacies. With $230 million and sale-leaseback proceeds, our net CapEx for the year was approximately $2 billion. As for the income statement, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.71 per share, one penny above the high-end of our guidance range, up 11.8% over LY. This is on a comparable basis, and the reconciliation of the adjusted earnings per share from GAAP can be found in our press release, as well as on the Investor Relations portion of our website. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.59 per share. On an adjusted basis, results within the PBM were slightly above expectations, while Retail/Long Term Care was in line with our expectations. So with that, let me provide you some more details as I quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the fourth quarter increased 11.7% to nearly $46 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 17.9% to $31.3 billion. As we've seen all year, this growth was attributable to increased volume and pharmacy network claims, as well as growth in specialty pharmacy. While very strong, this top line growth was slightly below our guidance range, primarily driven due to lower inflation and drug mix versus our expectations. Partially offsetting the sales growth was an approximate 170 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 85.4%. PBM adjusted claims grew by 19.9% in the quarter. And we finished the year with 1.39 billion adjusted claims, at the top end of our expectations. I want to mention that for 2017 we're changing our methodology for counting pharmacy network claims in order to keep script counts consistent across our operating segments. Going forward, 90-day prescriptions filled within our pharmacy networks will be adjusted to a 30-day equivalent basis, just as we've been doing within the Retail/Long Term Care segment for several years. This change will also make us more comparable to one of our competitors, who recently made a similar change. The supporting schedules posted to our website this morning provide the historical adjusted script counts. So with the change to methodology, our PBM adjusted claims grew 24.6% in the fourth quarter. In our Retail/Long Term Care business, revenue increased 4.7% in the quarter to $20.8 billion. This was in line with our expectations and driven primarily by strong pharmacy same-store sales script growth, partially offset by decline in front store same-store sales. During the quarter, GDR increased by approximately 120 basis points to 85.2%. Turning to the gross margin, excluding acquisition-related integration costs recorded within the Retail/Long Term Care segment, we reported 16.6% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 115 basis points compared to Q4 2015. This was consistent with our expectations and primarily driven by a mix shift as the lower margin PBM is growing faster than the Retail segment. Within the Retail segment, gross margin declined approximately 40 basis points versus Q4 of 2015, to 5.2%, while gross profit dollars increased 9.6% year-over-year. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increases in volumes, the improvement in GDR, and favorable rebate and purchasing economics. Partially offsetting these drivers was the impact of continued price compression. We outperformed versus our expectations due to lower utilization within the Medicare D PDP, as well as more efficient expense management within cost of sales. The decline in gross margin rate in the PBM was primarily due to continued price compression and the timing of Med D margins, partially offset by improved cost of sales management. Gross margin in the Retail/Long Term Care segment was 29.8%, down 40 basis points from last year, excluding acquisition-related integration cost. This decline was primarily driven by continued pressure on reimbursement rates. Partially offsetting this was the increase in GDR and the strong front store margin improvement, aided by the continued rationalization of our promotional strategies and improved product mix. Gross profit dollars increased 3.4% in the quarter. Turning to operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate, the numbers I am citing on a comparable basis also exclude the items noted on the slides. Total operating expenses, as a percent of revenues, notably improved from Q4 2015 to 10%. The PBM segment SG&A rate improved approximately 25 basis points to 1.1%; thanks to improving efficiencies. SG&A, as a percent of sales, in the Retail segment remained relatively flat to LY at 19.5%. Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $20 million to $236 million, above our expectation. This was primarily driven by higher severance associated with our continued focus on cost improvements. Operating margin for the total enterprise declined approximately 45 basis points in the quarter to 6.6%. Operating margin in the PBM declined approximately 20 basis points to 4.2%, while operating margin at Retail declined approximately 40 basis points to 10.3% on an adjusted basis. For the quarter, operating profit growth in the PBM was above expectations for the reasons I provided earlier, while Retail/Long Term Care was in line with our expectations. The PBM increased a solid 13.3%, and Retail/Long Term Care grew 0.8%, again, on an adjusted basis. Going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter decreased approximately $34 million from last year to $242 million, due primarily to paying down debt and a lower average interest rate on the debt that remains outstanding. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 38.5%, and our weighted-average share count was 1.1 billion shares. For the year, our effective tax rate was 38.6%. The tax rate was lower than expected for the quarter and the year due to certain permanent items that were recognized during the fourth quarter. So with that, let me now touch on our 2017 guidance. I'll remind you that 2017 is expected to be a rebuilding year of sorts, but our goals remain clear and we fully intend to get back to healthy levels of growth going forward. I'll focus on the highlights of our guidance here, but you could find all the details in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning. In 2017, we continue to expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.77 to $5.93, and GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $5.02 to $5.18. Note that the growth rates have been adjusted slightly to reflect the actual Q4 2016 jump-off point, which you can see on our slides. Let me point out that we are now including an estimate of $35 million of Omnicare-related integration costs in the GAAP guidance. Recall that we have been excluding those costs when we provided guidance last year, given our inability to reasonably forecast their magnitude and their timing. But with the integration winding down and the small amount of expected costs in 2017, we can now reasonably estimate these costs. As you can see in the non-GAAP reconciliation, these costs were expected to be offset by minor changes in other non-GAAP adjustments resulting in no change to our GAAP guidance. We have reduced our top line growth expectations in both the Retail/Long Term Care and the Pharmacy services segments, while at the same time maintaining our dollar estimates for operating profit within each segment. Both segments are being impacted by lower inflation than what we had originally forecasted. Additionally, we're reducing script growth expectations at Retail to account for some softness that we're seeing in our business. As a result, we now expect revenues to be down 1.75% to 3.25% in the Retail/Long Term Care segment, with same store sales down 2.75% to 4.25% and same-store scripts between down 0.25% to up 0.75%. Top line growth of 7.5% to 9.5 is now expected in the PBM, while claims growth remains unchanged except for the change in methodology that I laid out before. Under the new methodology, we now expect adjusted claims of $1.76 billion to $1.78 billion. We expect consolidated net revenue growth of 2.5% to 4.25%. As I mentioned earlier, our expectations for operating profit generated in 2017 remains unchanged. After updating the baseline for Q4, we continue to expect Retail/Long Term Care operating profit to decline by 7% to 9.5%, and now expect PBM growth of 5.75% to 8.75%. This results in a decline of 2.5% to 5.25% in the consolidated operating profit. Now, moving on to the first quarter guidance, we're making similar adjustments to the top line expectations to account for the same factors. We expect a decline of revenues in the Retail/Long Term Care segment of between 3.25% and 5%, with same-store sales down 4.25% to 6% and same-store scripts down 1% to 2%. We now expect PBM revenues to grow 6.25% to 8%, and consolidated net revenues to grow 1% to 2.75%. As you may recall, we highlighted several timing factors at Analyst Day that affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout this year, which is expected to be significantly back half weighted. With that in mind, in the first quarter we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.13 per share, a decline of 4.75% to 9.75%. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.88 per share. Additionally, our free cash flow guidance for the year remains in the range of $6 billion to $6.4 billion. I'm very pleased with the company's continued ability to generate significant cash flow, which will continue to play an important role in driving shareholder value over the longer term. And so, with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Well, thanks, Dave. And we remain confident that we are well-positioned as the healthcare market continues to evolve. We continue to have the most extensive suite of integrated enterprise assets, and on a stand-alone basis each one would be market-leading. What really sets them apart lies in our ability in a large way through technology to integrate pharmacy care from the payer to the provider and ultimately to the patient. And these capabilities help us to deliver on our goal of driving more affordable, more accessible, and more effective care. So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Lisa Christine Gill : Thanks very much, and thank you for all the color. Larry, how do we solve for this problem of the perception that PBMs are part of the problem and not the solution? Is there a way to provide more transparency, maybe as an industry is there a way to provide more transparency on Medicare Part D? I appreciate, clearly, everything that you had to say today, but I think that the rhetoric discontinues because of that lack of transparency. So any comments that you have around that, number one. And number two, as this discussion is going on in D.C., are you and the other PBMs part of this discussion? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Lisa, it's a great question. And, first of all, I think it is important that the story be told in a succinct and factual way, starting with the key policymakers and decision-makers, and that starts in D.C. And we've certainly been having those discussions in an effort to separate fact from fiction. And I think for the reasons that I alluded to in my prepared remarks there, we need to deal with this issue today. But the PBM industry has dealt with this issue in the past and has gone through a series of reviews, as I alluded to earlier, whether it was through the FTC, through Congressional Budget Office, other governmental agencies that have quantified not just the role that PBMs play, but the value that PBMs bring to the healthcare economy. And so, it is important that we start there. And at the same time, listen, we're having an awful lot of discussions with our clients. And as we talk about transparency with them, I do believe that they understand the role that we bring for them. And I think that in this environment where benefit plan designs continue to evolve and change, I think we're doing more to share with them what we see as best practices across the industry, especially as you think about the growth of consumer-directed health plans and what it means to provide the value of those rebates or discounts at the point of sale and what it means to have a preventive drug list, where there's zero out of pocket expense for their members. I just use those as two examples. So, Lisa, I don't think there's a single answer to that other than \u2013 which I think is where you were going \u2013 it really needs to be a surround-sound dialogue with a variety of constituents. Lisa Christine Gill : And, Jon, since he's in the room, I mean as we move through the early parts of the selling season, are people asking for different things? I mean, we clearly just heard what Larry talked about, high-deductible health plans, having more visibility. Do you hear from your clients that they have the transparency that they want and, therefore, this is more of an outside type of event where the rest of us sitting here on the outside don't have the level of transparency we'd like, but your customers are happy and they feel like they're getting what they need out of their PBM and, therefore, over time this will solve for itself? I think that this is really just the biggest issue right now as we think about the PBM industry going forward. Jonathan C. Roberts: I mean, Lisa, listen, those are all good points. I think at the end of the day our clients hire us to manage their pharmacy benefit. And the trend that we've seen through the first three quarters of the year is 3.3%. We'll be looking at our final number for 2016 in a couple weeks, and we think that number could potentially come down a little bit. So they're very happy with the cost of their overall benefit relative to the price increases they're seeing in the market with branded prescriptions. Secondly, on the transparency issue, our clients do have audit rights with rebate contracts, network contracts. They have the level of transparency they need while protecting our ability to negotiate and ensure that they get the best economics that we can in the marketplace. So I think part of the challenge is just the complexity of the pricing model in pharmacy. There's no easy answer for that, but we're continuing to work on it. Larry J. Merlo: Lisa, it's Larry again. I think when I hear you ask that question, you think about the rhetoric from those who are perhaps selling the drugs from those who are buying the drugs. And when you hear that, it gives me pause in terms of taking a step back and really asking the question, why are we in this position to begin with. And you look back and you think about just the sheer number of branded products that have come off patent over the last four, five years. We've got nearly $100 billion of branded drugs that have lost patent protection. Obviously, that's created somewhat of a headwind for the pharmaceutical industry. You've got new products that have entered the market that to some degree I describe as me-too products that are entering the market at inflated price points with no incremental effectiveness over the existing therapies. So why should sponsors of care pay for a higher price of those drugs, especially when many of those drugs are the ones that we're seeing advertised on TV, okay, countless times; and there's a cost to that. So I think when you start connecting the dots in terms of why the rhetoric now, what has changed in the marketplace that is driving this, it starts to bring some of that dialogue to the discussion. Lisa Christine Gill : Larry, just last thing. I know Nancy wants to kick me off the call, but if it were to change, we go from gross to net, some model changes. Do you think that this has a substantial impact on your model, or is there still value to what you bring from a PBM perspective? And I'll stop there. Larry J. Merlo: Lisa, I'll start, then I think Jon will want to jump in. But I think as we've talked many times, as we underwrite the business we underwrite it to an overall level of profitability, and there are many, many things \u2013 as we talked at Analyst Day, PBM tools that are utilized that create value for clients. So the answer to that would be no. There's many, many other things that we do that create value for our clients and their members. Jonathan C. Roberts: And, Lisa, the other thing I would add is, if branded products were to move from a gross to net, I think it would look more like the generic market where you would get discounts on the buy side. And we think we're in a great position to negotiate favorable economics and continue to deliver value to our clients. So that doesn't worry me at all. Lisa Christine Gill : Okay. Thank you so much. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Lisa. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim securities. Please proceed. John Heinbockel : So, Larry, on the topic of partnering more broadly, how broad might you be thinking? And then, maybe talk about the dialogues you're having today in massaging the tension, right, between being partners and competitors at the same time. And does that limit where you think you can take this? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, John. Let me start, then Helena will jump in. But, John, listen, when you look at the industry broadly, I do think that for many stakeholders across the supply chain the lines are blurry in terms of being competitors and at the same time being partners. And I think that everybody is kind of learning their way around that. There are many examples of that out in the marketplace. We shared some of those, beyond the example that you're alluding to, in terms of our CVS Pharmacy business. But you look at our Med D business where we have SilverScript and at the same time we're managing the Med D benefit for about 40 of our health plan clients. And we can show that while we're competing and at the same time partnering, the health plan growth for our clients has been faster than the market. So I think it's a great example of how we can create a win-win situation. And so, the answer to your question in terms of how broadly, quite frankly, it's with all the PBMs that we do business with. And I'll flip it over to Helena to talk in a little more detail about those conversations. Helena B. Foulkes: Right. So we started talking about this with you at Analyst Day, and I think that we're making nice progress. And really the change in strategy is we used to go to PBMs and health plans simply as a retailer essentially talking about rate. And now what we're really doing is broadening the conversation and bringing to those conversations the idea of marrying the other assets within the CVS Health suite, so we could bring to them capabilities, for example, like MinuteClinic, like Omnicare. And so, it's starting to really change the dialogue from being a rate-only conversation to one where we can bring even more value. And we're having those conversations, as Larry said, both with all the PBMs that we do business with. And as we said to you at Analyst Day, 65% of the prescriptions that we fill are with other PBMs, so those are very important partners to us, along with health plan partners where we see great upside and potential. So it's very early in the game, but I'm encouraged by the kind of conversations we're having. John Heinbockel : And then lastly, so you talked about a little bit of softness in \u2013 I think more particularly in the retail script business, and it may be a little bit beyond the network exits. If that's true, sort of a way to parse out where that might be coming from. And I guess that that would be in addition to \u2013 I assume you're getting some flu benefit \u2013 it would be apart from that, correct? David M. Denton: Yeah. John, it's Dave. I think flu is probably on the early stages here from a trend perspective, so I haven't really seen much of that compared to where we were last year. I would say that if you look at the network changes, they're tracking very consistent with what our expectations were. I think we are seeing some soft script volume as we entered this year. I do believe that there was probably some utilization that probably flowed a bit into December at the expense of January, just as patients thought about where they were in their days of supply. But there's no one specific issue that's driving it at this point. Helena B. Foulkes: And I would just jump in on flu, essentially it hasn't been a really strong flu season. And in particular what we're mostly seeing is over-the-counter increases in the cold category, for example, but not so much flowing through to the script side. John Heinbockel : Okay. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore. Please proceed. Ross Muken : Good morning, guys. Larry J. Merlo: Good morning, Ross. Ross Muken : What more do you think can be done on the consumer side to start to educate the average individual with respect to the value-add and with respect to sort of a better visibility to what actually they're paying for on the drug price perspective? Because, obviously, one of the key issues is at the counter you're obviously not seeing the full rebate. And we saw that in the EpiPen situation as well, where that causes quite a bit of furor. I mean, what do you think you can do maybe to help on the consumer side educate a bit more about the value-add and about what the true cost is, given your toolkit? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Ross. Listen, it's a great question, and I think some of it goes back to the earlier point that I made that what can we do, how can we work with our clients on the PBM side in terms of best practices around plan design. Obviously, there's a completely different story for that consumer at the pharmacy counter if the rebate value is flowing through at the point-of-sale versus back to the client and the client reflecting that rebate value in some way, but it kind of gets diluted across the overall plan design benefit. And I think we obviously see that as a best practice amongst some other things that we can talk about there. And listen, I think some of the \u2013 you brought up epinephrine, and I think what we were able to do with Impax is a great example of what can happen when we can introduce more competition within a therapeutic class even though it may not be an A/B rated generic. And yes, it does require an intervention with their physician oftentimes. But I do believe that the medical community is becoming more sensitized to price being a variable around the quality and continuity of care. And by the way, we play that role at retail. And by the way, the PBM plays that role as well in the development of formularies. So, Ross, I think it's a complicated answer or question. It's an important question, and I think it'll continue to evolve. We're already doing things and we're working hard to do more in that regard. Ross Muken : And maybe just on a longer term strategy perspective, many years ago now Caremarket and CVS got together and that was kind of a transformational transaction, really quite favorable obviously to the equity. And you gained a ton of share. I mean, as you think about \u2013 obviously you talk about some of your strength in PBM relationships, but just more broadly across the healthcare system, the number of different places you can touch and different relationships you can have. How would you say the dialogue is with other healthcare leaders, or the types of things, maybe not specifically, but in general the organization is thinking about in terms of how you can utilization this massive breadth you have and the delivery system and have a greater impact not only on the consumer, but on obviously your equity? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Ross, listen, it's another great question. And I think I'll probably take us back a minute to Analyst Day where we showed all of the different I'll say assets that we operate. And the common denominator across those assets lies in the fact that we're delivering that last mile of care to the patient. And by the way, it doesn't matter where you're at in the health care supply chain. That becomes kind of the important conduit at the end of the day. So I think there is a growing awareness and a growing understanding of the role that that can play, especially as there are more demands on changing consumer behavior, okay? Quite frankly, it kind of goes back to your first question. So I think it's that. And it comes back to the other question that was asked that we've got to figure this out recognizing that the folks that we're having these discussions with oftentimes are competitors as well. So I think it starts with a recognition and an acknowledgment that in cracking the code around this, we can find the sweet spot and still be competitors, but at the same time be partners. And I think we have some success stories. We're looking forward to growing that list of success stories with those objectives in mind. Ross Muken : Great. Thanks, Larry. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Ross. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with UBS. Please proceed. Michael Cherny : Good morning, guys, and thank you for all the details as well. I want to get back to Lisa's question a bit in terms of thinking about the PBM selling season. Over the last few years you've seen evolution of the competition across the market, you've seen various mergers, you've seen some moving pieces in terms of alignment from a business model perspective. As you go into the selling season, as you pitch your capabilities to the health plan community, to the employer community, what's changed in terms of what resonates from a historical perspective when you are out and selling against some solutions that essentially have not been proven yet to fully work in the market, to fully deliver the same types of savings that you guys have done historically? Jonathan C. Roberts: Michael, this is Jon. The PBM industry has been very dynamic. There's been a lot of consolidation really across the last 10 years and it's just continued to evolve. I think is I'm out speaking to either health plan or employers, I talk about the fact that they have three very different models to choose from, and we talk about the different models and then spend a lot of time talking about our capabilities, which is it's all about getting the best unit cost, which is one thing that is important to them, but then all the things we can do to lower overall healthcare costs because of our ability to touch and influence the consumer. And our ability to have more points of access through things like Specialty Connect, MinuteClinic, Maintenance Choice 3.0, where we're going to be able to deliver both prescriptions and front store products to someone's home. And I think the ability to do that has won the day. If you look over the last three years, we've brought on $31 billion in new business. And so, I think the story we've been telling is becoming more important is people or clients are very interested in managing their overall healthcare costs. So I think we're going to continue with our model to continue to have success in the marketplace, and the market is voting with their selections. Larry J. Merlo: And, Michael, it's Larry. I think the only point that I would add, and again it brings us back to the Analyst Day, but you may recall Alan Lotvin showed some examples of how using the pharmacy data, okay, we can provide a similar level of integration as one may be thinking about integrating medical and pharmacy benefits. And there's a lot of information and diagnostic information that can be ascertained simply doing a deeper dive in terms of the pharmacy information that we have. So we're looking to expand those capabilities, again, for the reasons that Jon acknowledged. Michael Cherny : Great. Thanks, guys. I know you have a lot, so I'll keep it at one. Larry J. Merlo: All right. Thanks, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Steven J. Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So it seemed pretty positive that you grew the Medicare Part D captive membership by over 10% for 2017. And I guess my question is, without really going into any specific numbers, I think some investors are just wondering whether the margin profile of the SilverScript Part D business for 2017 will be about the same as what we saw in 2016? Or maybe just in general, I mean, what are the general margin trends for your Part D business over a two, three, four-year period? And people just want to get a better flavor for that. Thanks. David M. Denton: Yeah. Steve, this is Dave. I think as we look at our Medicare Part D product, one, it's a very \u2013 a successful product in the marketplace and we've done quite well there. I think from a margin perspective and our expectation, I would say that it's a probably a similar profile as we cycle into 2017 versus what we saw in 2016. This is a competitive market. You rebid this process and re-create a product every single year. So that's part of the dynamics of this market. And that's why, one, we bid successfully because we have a very nice competitive product, but also the fact that we're working really hard to reduce cost in this area. And our product is very efficient at doing that. Steven J. Valiquette: Okay, great. I'll keep it at one question as well. Thanks. David M. Denton: Great. See you soon. Take care. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Robert Patrick Jones : Great. Thanks for the questions. Just to go back to the updated guidance, it does look like you guys are tweaking down some of the segment level assumptions. And I know you touched on this in piecemeal throughout the prepared remarks, but could you maybe just go back and share with us what specifically changed from Analyst Day through today that would have you dialing back some of the assumptions around revenue for the retail and then revenue and profit growth for the PBM? David M. Denton: Yeah. Just be real clear, Bob, it's Dave, is that keep in mind we did not adjust operating profit guidance at all. The dollars remain the same. We just trued it up from a growth perspective based on our results in Q4. So profit remains unchanged and our expectation for profit remains unchanged. I think what you're seeing from a revenue perspective, the vast majority of our revenue adjustments, as we cycle into next year or into 2017, is all about inflation. While we're seeing the same number of inflationary events, the magnitude of that inflation event, each one of them, has been slightly softer than what we planned. And I think this has been a topic where there's been a lot of dialogue in the marketplace about inflation, the worry of inflation. If inflation goes away, our profits would be hampered. And what you're seeing here is inflation is exactly dampening and our profits are remaining unchanged. So I think it's the proof point a bit about maybe taking that worry off the table a bit. Larry J. Merlo: Yeah. And, Bob, it's Larry. Listen, I guess, I just want to emphasize Dave's comments, okay? Because I think what we have seen over the last several weeks is more pharmaceutical companies coming out with, I'll call it, their version of the social contract, if you will. And, as Dave mentioned, typically you see pricing activity occur in January; and we've seen similar levels of activity, but at a lower rate. So that's where it's coming from. And as Dave pointed out, I think the fact that we're not changing our profit guidance and objectives reflects the comments that we made last year as this question was coming up that modest changes in inflation really have no impact on the profitability of the enterprise business. Robert Patrick Jones : No. That's all actually a really fair point. And I guess just to sneak one more in, because, Larry, you went to a lot of detail on the DIR fees and I think that was very helpful given how topical it is for investors right now. But I guess the question that I'd have is, why do you think there has been such a recent misperception and angst from the customer side as it relates to these fees? I don't think anything that you laid out in those slides obviously would be unfair or untrue, but yet there seems to be a lot of angst coming out of the customers' side of those who receive those fees. Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Bob. Listen, I think it's a great question. And I think as we outlined in the prepared remarks that through the PBM lens we're working across the network to provide transparency across the pharmacy providers and providing education. And by the way, when all this rhetoric began, we went back and we took a look at, if you looked at the overall reimbursement rates year-over-year, from 2016 to 2015, okay, in an environment where we've talked about pharmacy margins being under a lot of reimbursement pressures, there are many, many pharmacies to include some specialty pharmacies, in the SilverScript network that their reimbursement rates in 2016 were more favorable than what they were in 2015, largely as the result of the performance network fees and the performance that they demonstrated around that. So I'm a little puzzled as to why all the rhetoric other than the fact that some people didn't get it right. Robert Patrick Jones : Got it. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Hey, Dave, just a quick one. You did mention some upside to the cash flow for the year. Was there any timing issues around that, i.e., any pull through from 2017? And just maybe for Larry on front end, obviously, I see the tradeoff between store traffic and basket size and profitability, but at some point doesn't that front end number have to grow or is just not something we can really count on going forward with the model? David M. Denton: Yeah. Hey, Bob. On the cash flow, certainly from a 2016 yield perspective we did quite well at delivering over $8 billion of free cash. Some of that is timing as we've built a payables position with CMS. We will settle that up in 2017. So that's why you see the year-over-year decline from 2016 into 2017 is partially due to that. I will say that I'm very proud of the team as we continue to improve our working capital terms. Part of that is our focus on inventory and receivable and payables management, but quite honestly part of that is the power of the PBM, as the PBM grows. The PBM's a very efficient working capital enterprise, and you're seeing the effect of that play out from a free cash flow perspective both in 2016 and in 2017. Larry J. Merlo: Go ahead. Bob, I'll flip your second question over to Helena. Helena B. Foulkes: Yeah. I think, Bob, we feel like we've probably been on, I'd call it, the leading edge of looking at our mix of mass spend versus targeted spend and probably more aggressive than the rest of the marketplace on pulling back on unprofitable promotion and really focused on driving profitable growth. So I do think that as we cycle through that, the good news is we continue to grow share and win in health and beauty, which is the lion's share of our focus. And where we've pulled back and seen more of an impact on comps has been in mostly the edibles and general merchandise businesses where we've been less focused and where we really don't have as much of a point of differentiation. A lot of those sales historically have been promotional. So that's the constant balance. It's a balancing act we're always looking for, but wholeheartedly agree in the long run we do see this as a growth business. We stated at Analyst Day we'll continue in 2017 to pull back more on mass promotions. We continue to see profit potential there, but at the same time we're ramping up our targeted capabilities with ExtraCare. And those things will evolve over the next couple of years. The only thing I would point out as well, just as you cycle into the first quarter and look for our performance, I did want you to know that we're cycling two things for Q1 in 2017 that will make the comparison more difficult. In 2016, we had Leap Day, which we won't have in 2017. And we also have an Easter shift out of Q1 and into Q2. And if you add those two things together, just those things will adjust our growth in Q1 of this year by negative 185 basis points. So that's front store only in terms of just wanted to calibrate that for you as you look forward to Q1. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink. Please proceed. David M. Larsen: Hi. Do you have a program similar to like Express Scripts SafeGuardRx program where you can guarantee trend in certain therapeutic classes and you work with manufacturers to perhaps share in risk? Thanks. Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah. So, David, this is Jon. So we do have price protection in 90% of our pharma contracts. So as manufacturers raise their prices over a pre-negotiated threshold, that value goes back to our clients in the form of a rebate. We will have certain guarantees in therapeutic classes. I talked about diabetes at Analyst Day. So we're very targeted where we're using that. And I think at the end of the day our clients will evaluate us based on how their overall costs are being managed. And I think our trend, once we wrap up the year, will be received very well by both our clients and stand up well with our peers. Larry J. Merlo: And, David, it's Larry. We also have some programs -- we've talked about these in the past -- on indication-based pricing which is a version of that. To some degree, that's largely in specialty. We're working with pharma in a different way, okay, based more on outcomes with the patient. David M. Larsen: Okay, great. And then, just one more quick one. If DIR fees went back to the same level they were at last year, would that have any impact on your P&L or would that all pass through to CMS? Larry J. Merlo: Passed through. Jonathan C. Roberts: All those are passed through to CMS. They're all \u2013 it's all \u2013 think about it as part of our cost of goods sold as we price that insurance product. And so, that's how it's underwritten. David M. Larsen: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Barclays. Please proceed. Eric Percher : Thank you. So what I have left is with respect to the selling season, and I know it's early in the stages. But as we think about the share gains that you've had from managed care or healthcare plans over the last two years, have we reached a point where the low-hanging fruit has been plucked and it becomes harder to generate the same type of market share gains? Or do you think that opportunity remains where it has been and maybe will add to that the opportunity in Part D? Do you see that expanding at the same type of levels? Larry J. Merlo: Eric, It's Larry. I'll start, and then I think Jon will jump in. I think to a large degree those opportunities are more time-driven based on the current or existing contract, and it's going to end up tying back to the RFP process. And I would say that there continues to \u2013 we've talked a lot over the last year about insourcing, outsourcing and the fact that we continue to believe that we bring a lot of value to that equation, and that there is \u2013 makes a lot of sense. I think when the health plan mergers were being bantered about, there was some growing concern around that. And it looks like those are now in the rearview mirror. So we still continue to believe that we can bring value for smaller regional players. And, listen, we have a great relationship with Aetna, and we look forward to continuing to be a key partner with them and helping them to grow. Jonathan C. Roberts: Hey, Eric. The only other thing I would add is, I don't view the health plan market as the low-hanging fruit is gone and it's going to be more challenging to win health plans moving forward. Quite frankly, the biggest barrier to health plans moving historically has been the level of effort and the disruption in those moves. And what we've been able to do with automation and processes around moving health plans has really demonstrated we can do it in a near seamless way. As an example, I was with two CEOs of health plans that we won this year within 10 days of welcome season of 1/1, when they had just transitioned to us. And they were just thankful and appreciative of the great job that we did in welcome season. So as I look forward, our capabilities and how we can help health plans manage their overall costs with all of our integrated assets and our ability to move them in a non-disruptive way I think becomes a compelling value proposition. Eric Percher : Thank you for that. And a quick one for Dave. The ASR; can you tell us what the timing is in terms of impact at when it was put into place versus at close? David M. Denton: It was put into place early in January. It should settle by the third quarter. Eric Percher : It'll settle in the third quarter. And is there an initial amount versus total amount at the end that we (1:12:25)? David M. Denton: Yeah. I'll encourage you to take a look at our filings later today. You can see it in our K. Eric Percher : Okay. Thank you. David M. Denton: Yeah. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Eric. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I have some follow-ups here. First, on the implied scripts for the year. Can you remind us what are you assuming for the cadence of losing DoD in Prime? And once you normalize for these two contracts, what would be the implied script growth for 1Q that you're factoring into the guidance? And then, I have a couple of more follow-ups. Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah. Well, at the end of the day there's a little more than 40 million prescriptions that are cycling out of our business. So TRICARE began on really December 1 for the most part, so maybe some bleed before that, and Prime begins on January 1. So thinking about it, almost pretty equally spread throughout the year for the most part, Ricky. So it's really 40 million scripts on our base from a volume perspective. Ricky R. Goldwasser: So what would that mean on a normalized businesses? Does this mean that kind of like on a normalized basis there's around 2% to 3% script growth for the rest of the business? David M. Denton: Yeah. I haven't looked at it that way, Ricky. So I don't have that number right on the top of my head, but it's something that's easily calculated if you take that 40 million scripts, pro rate them over each of the quarters, you can kind of figure out where we'd be. Ricky R. Goldwasser: So that's where we're getting to, which is a little less than what you've done in the last couple of years, at 5%? So is that kind of like a function of just some additional losses that were not as publicized, or is it more kind of like slowdown of the market? David M. Denton: No. That's not the case, Ricky. I think what you're seeing is a couple things. One, and I think probably the biggest, over the last couple of years we've seen a pretty big expansion of state Medicaid programs. So that was kind of fueling scripts into the marketplace, and so you're probably seeing a little bit less than that as we cycle into 2017. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Okay. That is helpful. And then, one question on the impact from pricing on margin. So just to clarify, because when we hear kind of like what other companies in the channel are saying, they're saying that January price increases came in line. So are you basically making the assumption that we're not going to see that second price increase, that historically it's happened later in the year and that's where the impact is? That's first. And second of all, SG&A savings that you are seeing that help offset some of that are sustainable going forward. Should we use this SG&A level as a new run rate? David M. Denton: Well, Ricky, a couple of things just on \u2013 I would say that everybody probably had their own forecast and expectation for price increases; and what we specified today is based on our forecast for 2017. Inflation's coming in a little lighter than we expected. It's really twofold. Partly is that what we've seen, pricing increases early in the year or late last year was a little less than what we thought. And also, we do anticipate that trend to continue throughout the year as we think about price increases later in the year as well. Larry J. Merlo: And, Ricky, if you look at the 40 million prescriptions on our base at retail, it's about a 3.5% impact, if you will. 350 basis points, from a script perspective. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Okay, great. And then, just last thing on the selling season. Last couple of years 75% of the new business that you brought on was health plan, which is in line with your strategy. When you look at the RFP pipeline for the 2017-2018 selling season, what's the mix that's coming up for renewal for the market, not for your book? Is it comparable in terms of the opportunity on health plan versus what we've seen in prior years? Larry J. Merlo: Ricky, it's still pretty early around that. And keep in mind that health plans typically start a little earlier. So, quite frankly, some of the stuff that's starting to come in right now is really for January of 2019 because of their cycle. So as we've done in prior years, we'll have more to say on this on the first quarter call. We'll have a better idea of certainly the RFP activity consistent with prior years. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Okay. Thank you very much. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Ricky. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alvin Concepcion with Citi. Please proceed. Alvin Caezar Concepcion : Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. How would you characterize the savings you experienced for Red Oak versus what you would've expected by now? It sounds like it's still very much helping your profits in light of the revenue pressure. So what inning would you say you are in, in achieving the savings targets through that venture? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Alvin. Listen, I think we're all very pleased with not just standing up Red Oak, but the value that it's bringing to the supply chain. And I think as we've talked previously, the incremental year-over-year benefit obviously has slowed because we've got it up and running, but I think the Red Oak team continues to look for ways in which we can make the supply chain more efficient. And we're still looking and exploring those opportunities. So I think we're all very pleased with where we are today and where we're going with it. Alvin Caezar Concepcion : Great. And a quick follow-up. How would you describe the competitive pricing environment during the quarter and so far in the year, both on the retail and PBM side? Is it still pretty rational? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah. I would say, Alvin, we haven't seen any material change and it' a competitive, but rational market as you just acknowledged. Alvin Caezar Concepcion : Great. Thank you very much Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thanks. So, Nelson, we'll take one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. George R. Hill: Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. And I guess, Larry and Jon, this is a kind of a quick follow-up on the last one, which is, as it relates to the PBM selling season are you seeing anything that you would consider disruptive from any of the larger players, whether it's kind of a pricing or sales model, or offering? And then, my quick follow-up will be for Dave, just any guidance on interest expense in 2017? Jonathan C. Roberts: George, this is Jon. As far as anything new or disruptive for the selling season, it's pretty consistent with what we saw over the last couple of years. So nothing really new to report. David M. Denton: And, George, I think in our deck that we posted on the website, it should have our interest expense guidance for the year. And I'll pull it up real quickly for you here. (1:20:04). Do you see it? It's a billion... George R. Hill: Yeah, yeah. I'm still flipping through, but I can pull that up. I'll let you guys get off. Thank you. David M. Denton: Over $1 billion, George. George R. Hill: Good deal. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. So with that, I know it's been a long call, but hopefully we've provided a lot of information for you today and in light of some of the, I'll call them, current events in the marketplace. And we appreciate everyone's time. And as always, Nancy and Mike are available for any follow-ups you might have. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

Afterwards, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded, Tuesday May 2, 2017. Now, I'd like to turn the conference over to Nancy Christal, Senior VP of Investor Relations. Please go right ahead, ma'am. Nancy R. Christal: Thank you, Tommy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO : and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Jon Roberts, Chief Operating Officer; and Helena Foulkes, President of CVS Pharmacy, are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up, so we can provide more people with a chance to ask a question. Please note that we posted a slide presentation on our website before the call. It summarizes the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operational performance and guidance. Later this afternoon, we'll be filing our Form 10-Q, and it will also be available on our website. During today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings. During this call, we'll use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the reconciliations of these non-GAAP items to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And, as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year. And now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo. Larry J. Merlo: Well, thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to hear more about our first quarter results. Total company revenues increased 3%, slightly above the high end of our guidance. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.17, a slight contraction versus a year ago, but $0.04 above the high end of our guidance range. We generated approximately $3.1 billion of free cash during the quarter, and we continued on our path of delivering significant value to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Now, while we're pleased with our financial performance versus our expectations, we won't be satisfied until the total enterprise returns to sustainable, healthy earnings growth. Now, given our Q1 performance and the fact that it is still early in the year, we are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.77 to $5.93, and Dave will review the details of both our results and guidance in his remarks. Before diving into the business review, I do want to touch on the continued role that CVS Health plays in making health care more affordable, more accessible and more effective. We are continuously innovating to offer solutions that lower cost for our clients and members, and these efforts are driving meaningful results. Our recently published 2016 Trend report highlighted our PBM's commercial book of business trend coming in at only 3.2% compared to an unmanaged trend of more than 11%. At the same time, our members saw their out of pocket costs decline by 3%. We effectively purchase generics through Red Oak Sourcing using our size, scale and expertise. And we encourage generic utilization to drive down costs, with generics now comprising about 87% of scripts filled across the enterprise. To more effectively manage the cost of the remaining scripts, we employ sophisticated formulary management tools to ensure that the right patient receives the right drug at the lowest possible cost. And we create plan designs that lower member out-of-pocket costs while managing health outcomes. For example, we offer our clients the option to adopt point-of-sale rebates, which enable their members to directly benefit from lower negotiated costs for branded drugs. We also offer a preventive drug list, where drugs for common, chronic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, are made available to members at a $0 co-pay, effectively at no cost. This encourages adherence, better health and, ultimately, lower overall health care costs. We're also working on innovative solutions for the uninsured. We brought to market a dramatically lower cost alternative to EpiPen. And we've now announced a program called Reduced Rx, its goal to offer dramatic discounts on certain drugs directly to patients. As an example, customers will be able to purchase a Novo insulin product for $25 per vial, a potential savings of as much as $100. So overall, our integrated model enables us to effectively address costs across the health care system, and not just through our PBM but also through our retail, specialty, MinuteClinic and long-term care capabilities. Now, let me turn to the business update, and I'll start with the PBM selling season. Since our last update, the expected revenue for 2017 has grown, with gross new business of $8.5 billion and net new business of $5.4 billion, and that's up about $1 billion from our last update. And the majority of this increase relates to our clients' Medicare add-on lives, which were still being reconciled at the time of our last call. We closed out the 17th selling season with a strong retention rate of 96.5%, and 2017 was another successful year in a string of strong selling seasons for CVS Caremark. Turning to the 2018 selling season, we're off to a solid start across both the commercial and health plan spaces. Our integrated products and services are resonating strongly and remain differentiated in the market, and we've already had some contract wins for 2018. Additionally, we were pleased to have been selected as one of two pharmacy partners by the Health Transformation Alliance. HTA is comprised of large, sophisticated employers, many in the Fortune 100 listing, and we see the potential for incremental multi-year growth opportunities as we work with these innovative companies. Of course, we were disappointed to learn of the loss of the FEP specialty contract. And, as we have stated previously, the loss of this specialty contract, which is expected to generate 2017 revenues of about $2.8 billion, is not expected to have a material impact on our 2018 operating profit. We continue to believe it's important to maintain our pricing discipline in the marketplace, which has served us very well over many years. And let me also remind you that we will continue to provide retail pharmacy and mail order pharmacy services to FEP's more than 5.4 million Federal employees, retirees, and their dependents, under separate agreements that run through 2018. And I would also note that our service and satisfaction metrics within the FEP business are at an all-time high. As far as renewals, we have about $23 billion up for renewal in 2018 and that's comparable with the previous year from a percent-of-business perspective. We've completed about 43% of our client renewals to-date, which is ahead of where we were last year at this time. Now, it's still early in the selling season. And at this point, the magnitude of bidding opportunities is actually flat to down versus the 2017 selling season. And consistent with our past practice, we will provide a more quantitative update on the 2018 selling season on our Q2 earnings call in August. Just this past week, we held our Client Forum. We had a record attendance of nearly 1,000 attendees. And the forum provides us an opportunity to update our clients on our latest innovations in products and services, while gaining important feedback on their evolving priorities. Our recently-announced Transform Diabetes Care program, which is a value-based clinical program to better manage diabetics, is a great example of our continued innovation and evolution towards outcomes-based care. This program was very well received by our clients, as it's very much aligned with their priorities of lowering overall health care costs. And we expect to roll out Transform Care programs for four additional disease states over the next 24 months. Consistent with recent years, clients want help in managing the fast-growing specialty costs, while, at the same time, driving improved patient outcomes. And our comprehensive set of specialty solutions helps them do just that. We continue to see client interest in adoption of our medical pharmacy and clinical care products. And these industry-leading capabilities have helped us achieve sustained above-market growth rates in our Specialty business. And in the first quarter, specialty revenues increased 10%. Now, moving onto the first quarter results in the retail Long Term Care business, total same-store sales decreased 4.7%, with pharmacy same-store sales down 4.7%, in line with our expectations. Pharmacy sales comps were negatively impacted by approximately 480 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Same-store prescription volumes declined 1.4%. That's on a 30-day equivalent basis. And it's expected the decisions to restrict CVS from participating in the TRICARE network beginning in December and many Prime networks beginning in January, negatively impacted Pharmacy sales and script comps. The network changes had about a 460 basis point negative impact on volumes, while the absence of leap day had about a 120 basis point negative impact on same-store prescription volumes. Now, if you adjust for both the network changes and leap day, same-store prescription volumes would have been about 580 basis points higher. And this would have increased script comps 4.4% in the quarter on a 30-day equivalent basis. Now, we're very focused on working with all payors to drive volumes and capture share as we look to 2018 and beyond. Our partnership with Optum to provide a 90-day retail solution to their ASO clients and members is progressing nicely. Our teams are currently working on the implementation of what we'll call the clinical wrap for the offering, which includes our Health Tag and ExtraCare Health Card. We're also in the process of co-creating materials that will support Optum's sales team in their go-to-market efforts, so we're making good progress in anticipation of the July 1 launch. At the same time, we're exploring other potential ways to partner with Optum to best leverage the joint capabilities of both companies, all with the goal of driving better health outcomes and reducing costs. We're also continuing the dialogue with other PBMs and health plans, offering a menu of services to partner more broadly, leveraging CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition, along with our enterprise capabilities, including those such as MinuteClinic services, Infusion and Long Term Care, so more to come on these potential partnerships. Let me touch briefly on the CVS Pharmacies in the Target stores. Putting the network changes aside, we're continuing to see improving script performance versus prior quarters. And the strength of our patient care programs and Maintenance Choice continues to drive performance. So the Target pharmacies are moving in the right direction. Turning to the front store business, comps decreased 4.9%, reflecting softer customer traffic related to a number of factors. 175 basis points of the comp decrease relates to the absence of leap day versus 2016 as well as the shift of Easter into the second quarter. Our comps also reflect our decision to rationalize our promotional strategies and, to a lesser degree, the network changes that reduced our script volumes and had some associated front store impact. Now, despite the decline in front store comps, front store gross margin once again improved nicely in the quarter versus last year, which speaks to the success we've had with our personalization and promotional strategies. We also remain focused on growing our Beauty, Health Care and Personal Care businesses, and these efforts involve a number of actions that include a new store design and enhanced customer experience. The new store formats offer an expanded assortment of healthier food, health-focused products and additional beauty offerings paired with discovery zones in key categories. And while the new store format is focused on 70 stores this year, we will continue to evolve as we test and learn in order to meet the needs of our customers. Recognizing the growing presence in the digital market, we've also been focused on enhancing our online and mobile capabilities to create an integrated health and pharmacy experience that only CVS can provide. Building on the strength of our digital tools within pharmacy, where 60% of our patients are using them, we're focused on defining the next generation of convenience for our customers. And these ideas range from our Curbside program to same-day delivery options as well as enhanced mobile functionality, to name a few. And finally, Store Brands remain an area of both strength and opportunity. Our Store Brands represented 22.8% of front store sales in the quarter. That's up about 85 basis points from a year ago. There are significant opportunities to expand the share of Store Brand products by building on core equities in health and beauty, while seeking growth in other areas where we can provide customers a good value proposition. So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review. David M. Denton: Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide a detailed review of our 2017 first quarter results, followed by a brief update on our guidance. As I always do, first, I'll start with a summary of how we continue to enhance shareholder value through our strong capital allocation program. During the quarter, we paid approximately $516 million in dividends, after increasing the quarterly cash dividend by 18% for this year. Our 12-month trailing dividend payout ratio currently stands at 36.8%, but keep in mind that this ratio was artificially high, as it includes some expenses that are more temporary in nature, such as the loss on the early extinguishment of debt that we incurred LY, as well as the other items described in our non-GAAP reconciliations on our website. Nevertheless, we remain well on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 35% by the end of 2018. In addition, we have continued to repurchase our shares. In the first quarter, as part of our previously announced accelerated share repurchase program, we bought back approximately 36 million shares for about $3.6 billion. So between dividends and buybacks, we returned approximately $4.1 billion to shareholders in the first quarter alone. You should also note that the final receipt of shares from the ASR occurred in April, closing out the transactions a little earlier than anticipated. In total for the ASRs, we repurchased approximately 46 million shares at an average price of $78.74 per share. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we have about $14.6 billion left in authorizations to repurchase shares, and we continue to expect to repurchase $5 billion for the full year. As a result, our expectation is that we will return more than $7 billion to our shareholders in 2017 through both a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As Larry mentioned, we generated $3.1 billion of free cash in the first quarter, which is unusually high, due, in large part, to the timing of receipt of a Medicare Part D payment. This was expected, given that April 1 fell on a weekend. We continue to expect to produce free cash of between $6 billion and $6.4 billion for the full year. Now, turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.17 per share, a decline of 1.4% over last year. Keep in mind that these results are on a comparable basis, and the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted earnings per share can be found in the press release as well as on the Investor Relations portion of our website. Adjusted earnings per share came in $0.04 above the high end of our guidance range. Below-the-line items contributed roughly $0.02 to the over performance, while the remainder relates to our core business operations. Within operations, the Retail business over-delivered by about $0.03, due largely to timing factors, while the PBM came in within our expectations. Retail pharmacy margin benefited from several timing items that were anticipated to occur later in this year. Additionally, Retail operating expenses were lower than expected, as certain store-related costs shifted to later in the year. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.92 per share. So with that, let me provide more detail as I quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the first quarter increased 3% to more than $44.5 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 8.5% to $31.2 billion. Given the large amount of net new business, this growth was due to increased claims volumes in the pharmacy network as well as brand inflation and growth in specialty pharmacy. Partially offsetting the sales growth was an approximate 140 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 87%. PBM adjusted claims increased 9.6% in the quarter. As we discussed during the February call, we improved our methodology for counting pharmacy network claims in order to keep script counts consistent across our operating segments, converting each 90-day claim into three 30-day claims to more appropriately account for the amount of product days supplied. We've been doing this within the Retail Long Term Care segment for several years and now have consistency across the enterprise. In our Retail Long Term Care business, revenues decreased 3.8% in the quarter to $19.3 billion. This was in line with our expectations and driven primarily by a decline in script volume due to the network changes that we discussed last year. During the quarter, GDR increased by approximately 180 basis points to 87.5%. We also saw a decline in front store revenues due to a softer customer traffic and our promotional decisions. As Larry mentioned, front store same-store sales were negatively affected by about 175 basis points from the absence of leap day as well as the shift of Easter into the second quarter of this year. Turning to gross profit, operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate, the numbers I am citing are on a comparable basis and exclude the items noted on the slides. First, turning to gross margin, we reported 14.8% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 85 basis points compared to Q1 of 2016. This was consistent with our expectations and primarily driven by a mix shift, as the lower-margin PBM business is growing faster than the Retail Long Term Care segment. Total enterprise gross profit dollars decreased 2.5%. Within the PBM segment, gross margin declined approximately 30 basis points versus Q1 of 2016, to 3.5%, while gross profit dollars were relatively flat year-over-year, declining by only about $5 million. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to continued price compression and the changing mix of our business. Gross margin in the Retail Long Term Care segment was 29.4%, up 35 basis points. This improvement was driven by an increase in GDR as well as improvement in front store margin rate and dollars related to the continued rationalization of our promotional strategies and improved product mix. It was partially offset by continued pressure on reimbursement rates. Gross profit dollars decreased 2.7% in the quarter, mainly due to the loss of prescriptions. Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues remained relatively flat to Q1 of 2016 at 10.3%, improving 15 basis points. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved approximately 10 basis points to 1%, thanks to improving efficiencies. SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail Long Term Care segment deteriorated approximately 110 basis points to 20.9% as we lost leverage due to decline in net revenues from the loss of prescriptions. A portion of the increase in operating expense dollars year-over-year relates to the investments we are making in process improvements and technology enhancements as part of our enterprise streamlining initiative. During the quarter, among other projects, we continued to work on new tools and processes designed to improve service and labor productivity in our long-term care facilities. We closed 60 stores in the first quarter related to our store rationalization efforts and recorded a charge in our Retail Long Term Care segment of $199 million, which primarily represents the present value of the non-cancelable lease obligations for those stores. However, the charge was excluded from our comparable numbers that I just mentioned. We expect to see some benefit from the closing of these stores in 2017, which was anticipated in our guidance. As the majority of the 70 planned store closures have now occurred, we only expect minimal store closure costs during the remainder of this year. Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $14 million to $226 million, in line with our expectations. So as a result, operating margin for the total enterprise declined approximately 70 basis points in the quarter to 4.5%. Operating margin in the PBM declined approximately 20 basis points to 2.5%, while operating margin at Retail declined approximately 80 basis points to 8.4% on our adjusted basis. Operating profit in the PBM was relatively flat year-over-year, meeting the low end of expectations, driven by continued price compression. Operating profit in the Retail Long Term Care segment declined 11.9%, again on our adjusted basis. This exceeded our expectation, with the outperformance delivered by the timing items I discussed earlier. Going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter decreased approximately $31 million from last year, as expected, to $252 million, due primarily to paying down debt in the prior year and an at lower average interest rate on a debt that remains outstanding. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 37.7%. This was better than expected, due to our estimates on the discrete tax benefit from the adoption of a new share-based payment accounting guidance, which was described at Analyst Day and is disclosed in the 10-Q, which we will file later today. This accounting change will continue to impact the tax rate going forward and will fluctuate, perhaps significantly, based on the changes in our stock price. Our weighted-average share count was just over 1 billion shares, reflecting the first receipt of shares from the ASRs. So with that, now let me update you on our guidance. I'll focus on the highlights, but you can find the additional details in the slide presentation we posted on our website earlier this morning. I'll start with EPS. While the year is off to a very solid start, it's still early and we continue to expect 2017 to be a rebuilding year. With that in mind, we are confirming our 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $5.77 to $5.93 and GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $5.02 to $5.18. You can find a reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted EPS in our press release and on the Investor Relations portion of our website. Top line growth expectations have not changed, and the details are provided in our slides. Moving to operating profit, with one quarter behind us, we are narrowing the Retail Long Term Care segment's range. Retail operating profit is now expected to be down 7.75% to 9.5%, while consolidated operating profit is expected to be down 3% to 5.25%, narrowing the top end by 75 basis points in the Retail segment and 50 basis points for the enterprise. There are no changes in our expectations for the PBM and the Corporate segments. I should note here that we have retrospectively adopted a new accounting pronouncement and reclassed a small portion of our net benefit cost from operating expenses to other expenses, which has the effect of increasing operating profit in all periods by an immaterial amount. You can find the details of this adoption in our 10-Q that's filed later today. Now, let me provide guidance for the second quarter, which excludes certain non-GAAP items described in our slides. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.29 to $1.33 per share in the quarter, reflecting a decline of 2.5% to up 1% versus Q2 of 2016, a sequential improvement. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.19 per share. Keep in mind there are several timing factors that affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout this year. The introduction and timing of break-open generics, the timing of profitability in our Medicare Part D business and the timing of benefits from our enterprise streamlining initiatives are all factors expected to have the greatest impact on cadence. And while we delivered a strong quarter versus our own expectations, the cadence of profit growth is still expected to be more back half-weighted. Within the Retail Long Term Care segment, we expect revenues to be down 2.5% to 4.25% versus the second quarter of last year, due, in large part, to the restricted network changes discussed previously. Adjusted script comps are expected to decrease in the range of 0.5% to 1.5%, while we expect total same-store sales to be down 3% to 4.75%. The Easter shift into Q2 is expected to have a positive impact on front store comp growth of approximately 75 basis points. In the PBM, we expect second quarter revenue growth of between 9% and 10.75%, driven by continued strong growth in volumes and specialty. Consolidated revenues are expected to grow 3.25% to 5%. We expect Retail Long Term Care operating profit to decrease 10.25% to 13.25% and PBM operating profit to increase 2.5% to 5.5% in the second quarter. Consolidated operating profit is expected to decline 6.5% to 9.5%. Now before closing, I've one piece of news today. Nancy Christal plans to retire later this summer, right about the time of her 22nd year anniversary with the company. We launched an internal and external search. And today, I'm extremely pleased to announce that Mike McGuire will be appointed Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm sure many of you already know Mike very well. Currently VP of Investor Relations, Mike has been with the company for more than 20 years, working closely with Nancy for the past 15 years in areas of increasing responsibility. He has also had experience in strategic planning and capital management. His financial experience, his industry knowledge and deep understanding of our company made him an outstanding candidate to replace Nancy upon her retirement. So before turning it back over to Larry, let me just state that we remain confident in our full year outlook and our ability to return to sustainable, healthy earnings growth. And we continue to demonstrate our ability to generate substantial free cash flow. We have a proven track record of success in meeting long-term growth targets, generating significant free cash and optimizing capital allocation to drive shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thanks, Dave. And you may recall back in November, we outlined a four-point plan to return to healthy growth, and I think today you heard us describe examples of the progress that's being made in each of those areas. And we're certainly focused on leveraging our enterprise capabilities and CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition to partner more broadly with other PBMs and health plans. Second, we're focusing on driving growth through new PBM product introductions that capitalize on the benefits inherent in our unique integrated model. Third, to continue to be a low-cost provider, we're working on a multi-year enterprise streamlining initiative that'll generate cumulative savings of $3 billion by 2021. And finally, we continue to be very thoughtful with respect to using our strong cash generation capabilities to return value to our shareholders. Before we go to the questions, I do want to personally thank Nancy for the terrific job she has done for many years now and congratulate her on her pending retirement, and also congratulate Mike McGuire on his well-deserved promotion. So with that, let's go ahead and open up the lines for your questions. Operator : Certainly. Thank you very much. And we'll get to our first question on the line from Michael Cherny with UBS. Please go right ahead. Larry J. Merlo: Good morning, Michael. Michael Cherny : Hi. Good morning and thank you for all the detail so far. I know it's a little early to give exact details on the selling season, but given the volatility seen across the PBM market, could you talk about just also qualitatively how this selling season discussions have changed early on, what people care about in terms of whether it's transparency or network performance, restricted network, I guess, some of the other trends that versus previous years may be different, particularly given a lot of the noise across the market and that question, which I think you did a good job answering, of why the PBM continues to deliver value? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Mike. It's Larry. I'll start and I think Jon'll jump in as well. Again, acknowledging that we just had our Client Forum last week, we had a great opportunity to meet with a very, very diverse group of our clients. I would say the dialogue hasn't changed dramatically from what we've seen the last couple of years. I think there continues to be a focus on cost. And obviously, we've got a great story to tell there in terms of the ways that we can deliver value. And, at the same time, your question on transparency, obviously, that had gotten increased dialogue. I would say that clients want the flexibility of plan designs to meet their diverse needs. When it shakes out, I think that we'll continue to see steady movement in adoption of some of the products and services that you've heard us talk about many times. Jonathan C. Roberts: And Mike, this is Jon. So obviously, cost is very important, but it's not the most important. And the environment remains competitive but rational, so not really a change over the last several years. Clients, something very important to them is the service we provide to them as a client, but also the service we provide to their members. And that's a reason you can actually lose a client if you're not delivering good service. And our service levels are at an all-time high. And thirdly, they're more focused today, than I would say they were several years ago, around this ability to manage overall health care costs. And when we introduced our Transform Care diabetes program, that's really all about managing overall health care cost for diabetics. The response we got was very positive around this program. We also introduced a value-based network, which is going to be a skinnier network, but the network will be expected to perform around certain clinical outcomes around adherence, which clients know lower overall health care costs. So a lot of receptivity and focus around helping them manage their overall health care costs, not just their pharmacy benefit, which I think five years ago, was their primary focus. So this has been a gradual shift in the market over the last several years. And candidly, our assets and how we go-to-market and our ability to reach the consumer and change their behavior and lower overall health care costs, has had a lot to do with our success in the marketplace, and we continue to be very successful. Michael Cherny : Great, thanks so much and congrats again to Nancy and Mike on your new roles; Nancy, your retirement. Nancy R. Christal: Thanks. Operator : Thank you very much. We'll get to our next question on the line from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Go right ahead with your question. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Yes, good morning and congrats on the quarter. Nancy, really enjoyed working with you, so best wishes for the retirement, and, Mike, congratulations for the new role. I have a follow-up question on the selling season. So first of all, Larry, you highlighted HTA in the prepared remarks. What is the key difference between HTA and other coalition businesses that you service? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Ricky I think that with HTA, as we've talked, you've got several Fortune 100 companies, so you've got pretty sophisticated purchasers of health care in there. I would say that, in some respects, short-term, there's probably not a big difference between what HTA is focused on and what are other coalitions are focus on. I think that their short-term goal is to make sure that they're getting unit price right, like all buyers, okay. I think longer term, I think there's going to be a bigger focus in terms of how HTA can lower overall health care costs. And I think that we're in a great position to play a major role in providing solutions by leveraging our integrated assets to improve patient care. It really picks up on what Jon was just talking about. So I see it as a short-term, long-term opportunity. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Okay. And Aetna, on their call this morning, talked about the fact that they're trying to look for ways to work closer with you. So how do you view the relationship with Aetna? What are the ways that you can work closer together? And with that respect also, when do you expect to unload all of the Coventry business? When is that going to be completed? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Ricky, I'll take the first part, and then flip it over to Jon on Coventry. But, Ricky, I think we have a terrific relationship with Aetna. I think our teams have been working extremely well together, recognizing that for the first few years, the focus was all about integration and how do we do all the, I'll call it, the blocking and tackling work to create a common platform that can service the diverse clients that they have across their network. I would say for the last few years, now that we've got that in the rearview mirror, the focus has been how can we create value for Aetna, their members, and obviously for us in there. And I think that we've done some terrific things working together. I think as we go forward, you've heard us talk about how the patient of health care is now becoming a consumer of health care. And if I go back to Analyst Day, we had talked about when you look at all different customer touch points that we have with health care in mind, you can describe it as we have the front door to care and, at the same time, we're delivering the last mile of care. So I think the opportunity is not just in terms of what we can do across our pharmacies, but now you think about Infusion in the home, the role of MinuteClinic, now Long Term Care, I think that there are some exciting opportunities as we think about partnering more broadly. Jon, do you want to cover Coventry? Ricky R. Goldwasser: And then on Coventry? Jonathan C. Roberts: Yes. So, Ricky, Coventry will be moved by the end of this year. So we've been moving it over the last several years. We're almost complete with that effort. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. We'll get to our next question on the line from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please go right ahead with your question. Scott A. Mushkin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And, Nancy, I'm not sure I'm going to survive without you, but picking Mike was an outstanding pick, so I'm excited that he got the job, too. So it's great news. Nancy R. Christal: Thanks, Scott. Scott A. Mushkin: I have two questions, and I guess the first one's more short- term oriented. Why the slightly worse outlook for Retail? David M. Denton: Yeah. This is Dave, Scott. I think what you're seeing here is probably if you look at our guidance range for Retail, it was probably abnormally high. We've now, I'll say, narrowed that range. And I think it was more of us looking at the future and saying, what would it take us to get to the top end of that range, more than I'll say a disappointment from an outlook perspective. So think about it as narrowing the range and not seeing, at this point in time in the market, a catalyst to get us to the top of that range. Larry J. Merlo: And, Scott, when Dave's talking about range being higher, he's really referring to the guardrails associated with that range. The width of that was broader than it had been historically, simply because of all the change dynamics going on. Scott A. Mushkin: Okay. And my second question is more strategic as we think about 2018 and beyond, and I thought it was interesting in the release you said you won't be satisfied until you return to growth. I think, Larry, you said that. I guess my question in 2018, what do you think like the two or three levers are to get you to return to the growth, outside of M&A, like internally in your business, as you think about it as we look at 2018 and 2019, to reinvigorate growth? And then I'll yield. Thanks. David M. Denton: Scott, this is Dave. There's probably not one thing to that. I would say that obviously we have to continue to execute on the plan that Larry articulated around plugging into payors in more meaningful ways to drive value for them, but also move dispensing volume into one of our channels. That'll be key to us as we think about growth over time. We continue to need to execute from a selling season perspective to gain lives within our PBM business, but importantly convert those lives, again, by selling in our integrated products to, again, drive value for those clients and move share into one of our dispensing channels. And we're continuing to focus on the cost side as we think about the things that we need to do to be more productive, both in the PBM business and in the Retail business and the Long Term Care business. We're making investments this year that will deliver for us over the next many years significant savings to drive performance. So all of those collectively need to work together to drive our performance in 2018 and beyond. And don't underestimate the importance of bolt-on acquisitions. Those are part of our targets. We continue to look for ways in which we can supplement our business to drive synergies for our business and expand our scope of services through the enterprise. So I think all of those will be important as we think about 2018. Scott A. Mushkin: That's great. Thanks, guys. Good answer. David M. Denton: Take care. Operator : Thank you. And we'll get to our next question on the line from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Please go right ahead. Lisa Gill : Thank you. And, Nancy, I will definitely miss working with you. I wish you the very best in your retirement. I hope you enjoy it and, Mike, congratulations. But, Larry, let me just follow on to the last question, and as we think about the bolt-on acquisitions and other strategic things that you could do in the marketplace, you talk about managing overall health care costs. I know I've asked this before, but do you think about owning a health plan? Is that something that you think would fit within the core assets of what you're trying to deliver from a health care perspective? Larry J. Merlo: Well Lisa, I think some of this, it does go back to the last couple questions, and if you look over the last couple of years, we have certainly broadened the base of services that we provide. That has enabled us to touch more of the health care spend, creating value for respective stakeholders. And, as I just mentioned a minute ago, we've been talking about this retailization of health care, where patients are becoming consumers. And we've got some very, very important assets. As that continues to gain traction, when you think about all the different consumer touch points that we have and all the different ways we engage with those consumers, whether it's on the front-end or delivering directly the care. So, listen, we're always looking for additional ways to capitalize on that. And that's the work that we do and we remain open to those thoughts and opportunities as they come up. Lisa Gill : And as we think about the store, you talked about MinuteClinic Infusion, bringing that to Long Term Care, and I understand the bridge of all of those things. What are some of the other things that you think you could bring into your store to continue to drive the health care offering? I mean, do you think about things like vision or hearing or other services like that? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Lisa, I think you'll recall that we've talked about some of the pilots that we currently have underway, okay, with both vision and audiology. I think we're certainly continuing to focus in terms of the role that MinuteClinic plays and how we can broaden the scope of services that we provide, again, with quality as a key attribute. I think we're pretty excited with the opportunity that's been created with the Veterans Administration. I think that is very unique, recognizing some of the challenges that exist in terms of veterans getting timely access to care. And the pilot program that was kicked off last year in Northern California was successful. And as you may have seen two weeks ago, it's been expanded now to the Arizona market. And I think there's optimism that we can expand it even more broadly across that. So I think, again, it's something that continues to be a focus, and more to come. David M. Denton: Hey, Lisa, this is Dave. I also think probably the biggest opportunity we have in the short term is you think about, I'll say, care management and think about care management from a pharmacy perspective, a patient is in our pharmacy typically several times a month. Certainly, patients with greatest needs are in several times a month. We've built an infrastructure within our pharmacies that come to life through our engagement tools at the counter that enable us to really intervene with that patient and coordinate their care across spectrums of health care, much broader than just pharmacy. And some of our health plans are beginning to tap into that capability, but I think if you look to the future, you could see that expanding pretty dramatically for us to even be more impactful as we think about how that patient manages their total health care. Larry J. Merlo: And, Lisa, if you just think... Lisa Gill : And do you envision getting paid for that? I'm sorry. Just before, Larry, before you continue, do you envision getting paid for that service or is this just more of how we get paid is we're going to have more scripts through the CVS store? David M. Denton: I think it's a little bit of both, Lisa, but I do think as you think about it, think about if you narrow the network, getting more patients into our channel, we can deliver better outcomes and bend the cost curve even more dramatically. So I think you're going to see a combination of share capture, from that perspective, but also there's probably some revenue stream tied to it as well Larry J. Merlo: And Lisa, some of this goes back to the notion, and you've heard us allude to this in the past, that as you think about a future network, pharmacy network, it won't simply be defined by price. It'll be defined by capabilities through a clinical lens, as Dave outlined. And if you think about, we mentioned Transform Care in our prepared remarks. And the first disease state focuses on diabetes. And you think about the fact that that diabetic patient visits their doctor four times over the course of a year, but they visit the pharmacy more than 30 times. So the opportunity to engage in a differentiated way speaks exactly to what Dave was talking about. Lisa Gill : Okay, great, very helpful. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Lisa. Operator : Thank you. And we'll get to our next question on the line from David Larsen with Leerink. Please go right ahead. David M. Larsen: Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you talk a bit more about the Transform Care program and your value-based clinical programs? Are you working with the manufacturers and like allowing them to bear some financial risk with some programs? And are you working with other retail chains beyond like the CVS stores to engage in some sort of risk-bearing programs with them? Thanks. Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah, Dave, this is Jon. So Transform Care, as we talked about, is focused on diabetes. We have for other disease states that'll roll out over the next 24 months. And that program starts by moving their members into one of our channels, so either retail or mail. And that way, we get to apply all of the programs that we have, from connected glucometers to coaching by nurses, free MinuteClinic visits. We put guarantees around the trend. So we will be engaging with pharma around value-based contracts, and diabetes is a good example. We haven't announced those yet, but there are certain drugs in that category, as an example, that may be effective on their own, but sometimes you have to add a second drug. And if you add a second drug, we would get a reduced cost, as an example. So we do believe there's a real opportunity to bring pharma into the fold as we roll-out these programs. And then, as Larry mentioned, we actually launched at our Client Forum last week, a value-based network for the commercial space. And this will be working with other retailers around other programs beyond diabetes, where they will have certain clinical goals that they'll have to execute on, and their reimbursement will partly be tied to their ability to deliver. And that'll be a smaller network, say, in the 30,000 to 40,000 store range, so those retailers will get more volume into their channels. The clients get an actual unit cost savings because they're moving into a smaller channel, and then they get overall health care-lowering programs based on the clinical results that these stores deliver. So it is a comprehensive program. Some of it will be focused exclusively in our channels for very high cost, fragile patients, like diabetics. Other programs will be in value-based networks, so it'll be smaller than the broader networks. And we believe this is where the market is going. And based on feedback we had from our clients last week, they are aligned with the direction we're moving in. David M. Larsen: That's great. And then Jon, I think you were recently promoted to the COO role, which I think means that you now have Retail reporting to you as well. Is that true? And then, what are you sort of most interested in doing with regards to the Retail business and the strategy; any general thoughts on how that strategy might evolve, from your perspective? Thanks. Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah, Dave, so, yes, I now do have responsibility for Retail and really all the operating units within CVS Health. And the purpose of this role is to bring innovation to the market faster. That is really going to be my focus. And by having these business units actually work more closely together and more coordinated, we think we'll be able to bring innovation to the market much faster than we previously have. David M. Larsen: Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you very much. And we'll get to our next question on the line from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go right ahead. Robert Patrick Jones : Thanks for the questions, and let me also offer my congratulations to Nancy on the retirement and Mike on the new role. I guess just looking at the decrease in scripts that you guys called out from TRICARE and Prime specifically, sounds like you're saying that it had about a negative $14 million claim impact in the quarter. I'm just curious if you could talk about how that's trending relative to the full year expectations that you guys shared with us back at Analyst Day, if you've seen any changes in the marketplace that were kind of outside of what you had anticipated around those two situations. David M. Denton: Yeah, I don't think we've seen anything dramatically change from our expectations as we think about that. You can't really look at it quarter-by-quarter because you do have some seasonality in there. I do think it's important, if you look at our delivery in Q1 from a script perspective, we were kind of right within the middle of our range. So in totality, our script unit growth has been pretty consistent with our expectation. And if you further fast-forward that through the balance of the year, our expectation for script growth has not changed in any material fashion. Robert Patrick Jones : Great. I guess just a quick follow-up on the Aetna relationship, it does sound like they're putting out there that they are looking to evaluate all options with you. So I guess, in your mind, you touched on this a little bit, what could that look like? And I guess the more important question that I'd have is there anything specific within your current Aetna contract that would restrict you from taking on other large health plans? David M. Denton: Maybe I'll hit that one first, and then I'll turn it over to Larry. Obviously, today, we service probably a little over 70 health plans today, many of them in a pretty deep relationship. So there's really nothing that would preclude us from driving value with others in the marketplace from a health plan perspective. Larry J. Merlo: Yeah. And, Bob, I think the first question, I think it goes back to the theme that you heard Jon talk about. I talked about it earlier, deeper integration around the clinical opportunities or clinical products, services that can be provided across our breadth of assets. And I think you heard some examples of that today, and I think there is a lot of white space there that we can work together on. Robert Patrick Jones : Got it. Okay. Thanks, Larry. Thanks, Dave. David M. Denton: Thanks, Bob. Larry J. Merlo: See you. Operator : Thank you very much. And we'll get to our next question on the line from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Please go right ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. And congratulations to Mike and good luck with everything, Nancy, good working with you. My question was going back to Transform Care, and just quickly on the diabetes program, can you talk about what has the uptake been, how it's being packaged in the offering in the current selling season and what kind of guarantees are you giving in terms of managing trend? What are the metrics that you're looking at? Thanks. Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah. Charles, this is Jon. So we've got a couple clients that are in pilot now, and we're signing clients up for January 1, 2018. Still early in that process, so we'll have more to say about that later this year, but I would say, again, clients seem very aligned to this concept. And they're thinking about these diabetics very similar to how they're thinking about specialty. So specialty, most of these clients move those members into our channels because they need a higher level of care. Well, now we're extending that to diabetes and to other disease states. And we're guaranteeing a drug trend and that's client-specific based on their mix and utilization, so we actually have to do a specific underwriting for each of those. So there's a unit cost benefit to the clients as well as the ability to lower overall health care costs that we think can be a significant savings for them. So we're very bullish on this program and excited to be launching it. Charles Rhyee : You talked about providing other services around that in terms of coaching, et cetera, to keep members compliant, adherent to therapy. Can you talk about what kind of technology assets you're using to help drive that as well? Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah. So an example is we'll be giving members a connected glucometer. And as they test their blood sugar each day, it goes up into the cloud and is monitored by our teams. And when we see somebody off track, there's an intervention with them with a nurse to talk about what they need to do to get their blood sugar back under control and back on track. These coaches will also work with them on things around diet and making sure they're following up and having the right tests around eye tests and foot tests. We'll be able to offer those services as part of this program for free in MinuteClinic. And so all this information will be collected and monitored. And we think we'll have a very much higher reach rate than you see in a typical disease management program. So all of this is now being implemented in the pilots that we have up, and we think the results are going to be pretty compelling. Charles Rhyee : Is that a third-party device or is that something self-developed? Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah. We'll be working with a third-party on that. Charles Rhyee : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you very much. And we'll get to our next question on the line from Steven Valiquette of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go right ahead. Steven J. Valiquette: All right. Thanks. Good morning, Larry and Dave. Let me offer my congrats to Nancy and Mike as well. Hey, Nancy, I think we've spoken for just about all of those 22 years, so I'm clearly doing something wrong if I'm not retiring yet, but that's just... Larry J. Merlo: Steve, you don't know how she's put up with us for 22 years. Steven J. Valiquette: Just a question on Anthem. I know there's obviously not too much you can really say at this stage in relation to the Anthem RFP, but just at a high level, I think the investment community is assuming that this is an opportunity that would likely be attractive to you. So I'm hoping you can at least confirm that, if that is the case. And then just further, my belief is that you guys would have no capacity issues or conflicts taking on this business, but some investors still seem to keep asking us about whether any of your existing managed care relationships would make it maybe more difficult for you to take on Anthem. So I'm hoping you could maybe just clear the air on that subject a little bit as well. Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Steve, it's Larry, and I think Dave alluded to this earlier that there is nothing that precludes us, either contractually or capability-wise, from adding to our business portfolio. And we've grown our health plan business quite nicely over the last couple of years. And we've now got more than 70 health plan clients that I think that we can work with each one in a very unique and differentiated way to satisfy their goals and objectives. And we have a guiding principle that as we work with them to make them more competitive in the marketplace, as they grow, we grow. And I think that speaks a lot to the investments that we've made, especially on the PBM side of the business, that we brought on billions of dollars of new business over the last three, four, five years. And our welcome seasons have only gotten better each year as a result of the investments and the capabilities and, quite frankly, the talent that resides within the organization and the learnings that we get from each year that makes next year better. So, listen, we look forward to continuing to grow the business. Jonathan C. Roberts: The other thing I would add is that there's been a lot written about the disruption that happens when you move business, and the industry has evolved a lot over the last four or five years. We now have automation, so a lot of these new clients are implemented in an automated way. And then, our testing platform now employs artificial intelligence, where we crawl through the claims and look for anything that's unusual. And so that has resulted in what I think have been very successful welcome seasons over the last several years. So we're very confident in our ability to implement new business, large and small. Steven J. Valiquette: Okay. That's great. Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you very much. We'll get to our next question on the line from Alvin Concepcion from Citi. Please go right ahead. Alvin Caezar Concepcion : Thanks for taking my question and, Nancy, Mike, congratulations to you both. It's been a pleasure working with you, Nancy. Nancy R. Christal: Thank you, Alvin. Alvin Caezar Concepcion : Just a follow-up on that question, just broadly, your strategy on acquiring large books of business on the PBM side, would you ever make exception and pursue a deal as a loss leader or if not at least significantly below your typical EBITDA for script metrics? David M. Denton: Well, hey, Alvin, this is Dave. As you well know, when we implement a new client, typically, we implement that at very thin margins and then we work to sell in our programs and drive substantial value for that client over the long term. And typically, you see our margins enhanced over that. As I think you know, and we discussed it earlier today, we've been very disciplined in our pricing. We have historically had very high retention rates, but our retention rates haven't been at 100%, indicating that we've been focused on underwriting each client at the appropriate return on investment, looking both to the short term but, more importantly, to the long term in our relationship with that client. Alvin Caezar Concepcion : Thanks. And just a follow-up about Maintenance Choice 3.0, I'm just wondering if you could talk about progress there and consumer response and impacts you're seeing. Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah, this is Jon. So, again, we introduced Maintenance Choice 3.0 at our Client Forum. The reception was, again, very positive, and you really think about all the ways we can service now a member, and members define convenience in very different ways, from: some people like mail; some people want to go to retail. We now have drive-thrus. We have Curbside. And now, we'll have home delivery within one to two hours. And it's not only for the prescription, but it'll include front store products as well. And so we think that the flexibility, access, and convenience that we will be able to bring to the marketplace with Maintenance Choice 3.0 will, again, make what is a very attractive benefit even that much more attractive. Alvin Caezar Concepcion : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We'll get to our next question on the line from Eric Percher with Barclays. Please go right ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. I think an area we haven't focused much on is specialty and the role that specialty is playing in the coming selling season. I know there's been a lot of focus on Specialty Connect. We saw the EMD Serono report out, and a lot of focus there on data integration and managing medical alongside pharmacy. Could you speak to some of the areas where you've invested and what you're focused on within specialty this year? Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah, Eric. So this is Jon again. We have a capability that is fairly unique in the marketplace, and that's NovoLogix, which gives us the ability to manage the specialty spend under the medical benefit, which is, quite frankly, half of the specialty spend. So we're up to now over 60 million members being managed through this capability. And you combine that with what we're able to do on the pharmacy side of specialty through Specialty Connect, through our disease management program, where our nurses not only manage the member's specialty condition, but all their comorbidities, and we have a reach rate that's 13 times greater than a traditional disease management. So we think we have a comprehensive, complete solution for this marketplace. And it's a very high priority for our clients. And our capabilities and story resonate very well. Eric Percher : Jon, what does that NovoLogix 60 million represent? I imagine that's not a full data set of all medical or can it be? Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah. We can manage all of the specialty under the medical spend. And it's a combination of prior authorization capabilities, repricing with some of the edits that you see on the pharmacy side that medical platforms aren't capable of managing, and also site of care. So it manages moving specialty from higher sites of care to lower cost sites of care Larry J. Merlo: Eric, it's Larry. One of the things that we heard from the Client Forum last week, with a select group of clients, and it certainly warrants additional follow-up, but I think the lines are blurring more than ever in terms of the component of pharmacy that's going through the medical benefit and the complexities that that's creating for the health plan. And I think there is an opportunity, to pick up on what Jon was talking about, in terms of creating an even more robust and meaningful solution. That's something that we're going to be talking to those folks more about. Jonathan C. Roberts: And, Eric, the last thing I would add is, as you know, there really hasn't been much control on the medical side because the medical platforms aren't capable of doing that. So this now allows us to begin to manage formularies on the medical side, which we think can bring value to the marketplace and the payors. Eric Percher : Well, thank you for that, and I'll extend my congrats to Nancy and Mike. Thank you. Nancy R. Christal: Thanks. Operator : Thank you very much. We'll get to our next question on the line from Mohan Naidu with Oppenheimer & Company. Please go right ahead. Mohan Naidu : Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Maybe, Larry, you commented about engaging patients more actively. Can you talk about the role MinuteClinics can play there and perhaps any opportunities to expand your services in the clinics to maybe increase the foot traffic and also offer more services for patients? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Mohan. I think if you go back in probably, I'm going to say, over the last two years, as a result of rolling out the [FATHR], (71:26) we have broadened our scope of services. I think we now have over 30 of the top 50 acute conditions with which we're now seeing patients. And I think one of the things that I think is probably an even bigger opportunity is we've established these relationships with some leading health institutions. Some of those institutions are getting into care management in a bigger way. And the opportunity to triage patients back and forth, I think, in the form of chronic care management, I think is a big opportunity. We've talked about some examples of that over the last few months, the VA being one, as an example. So, I think there's more opportunities there. I think as technology continues to move forward, that also may be a conduit for expanding the scope of practice there as well. Mohan Naidu : Okay. Any thoughts on perhaps adding like labs or leases or anything like that clinics? Larry J. Merlo: Yes. We do. As you think about labs, we do some of that today in the form of point-of-care testing. And I think that's an area that we continue to monitor with technology always changing in that space. Mohan Naidu : Okay. Thanks, Larry. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks. All right, we'll take two more questions, please. Operator : Certainly. And we'll take our next question from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Please go right ahead. Brian Gil Tanquilut : Hey. Good morning, guys. Just to follow up on the questions on specialty and piggybacking on your comments earlier about maintaining pricing discipline and trying to think about growth going forward, so as we look at the FEP specialty contract loss that's upcoming in 2018 and what Prime is doing in the market, I mean, how do you look at the competitive dynamics that they bring to market in terms of the risk that they would try to shake it up and win more business? How do we get confidence that this is a one-off rather than a possible trend in terms of pricing and just the competitive nature, specifically on the specialty side or even the PBO side? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Brian, listen, as you look at Prime, obviously, they're a well-respected competitor. And we would describe them as competing effectively for business, particularly in the Blues plans. And I think as you know, FEP has a very important relationship with the Blues plans in which their members exist. And that said, it does remain to be seen how attractive their model will be outside of the Blues plans which, I think as you're probably aware of, make up the vast majority of their membership today. Listen, we continue to believe that the alignment and the integrated model that we have continues to give us an advantage in the marketplace. And going back to the FEP contract, we retained the clinical elements associated with managing the specialty patients, which I think is evidence of the integration of our model and the value that that brings for clients. Brian Gil Tanquilut : I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up on the store closings, how much runway do you think you have left in terms of just the number of stores that are out in the market that you could close down or just a cost opportunity, if you're willing to size that? David M. Denton: Yeah, this is Dave. I think our store base, we've been pretty disciplined over the past decade or so in building out our stores. I don't think we have a big store rationalization effort underway, absent I'll say just trimming what we did this year. Brian Gil Tanquilut : All right. Got it. Thank you, guys. David M. Denton: Take care. Operator : Thank you very much. And we'll proceed with our final question on the line from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Please go right ahead. John Heinbockel : I'll add my congratulations to Nancy and Mike as well, here at the end. And so, Larry, two things; when you think about how difficult the pharmacy business is for those without scale, and I think you just picked up some pharmacies from Marsh, what's sort of the prognosis, do you think, for doing more of that, whether it's a small player like that or someone bigger, like Target? It would almost seem like that's something that would have to happen over time if some of these retailers are going to preserve economics in that business. Helena B. Foulkes: I'll start. This is Helena. We continue to look in the marketplace and see opportunities, to your point, just given the pressure in the business. And I would say historically, we would look at smaller players and think about buying their files or opening up a new CVS. And I'd say a recent change in strategy is probably to be a little bit more aggressive around looking for those opportunities. But as well, I think I might have mentioned before, we're looking at more buy-and-operate opportunities, where we can go into a marketplace with a small-scale player who serves a great set of customers \u2013 we don't have a CVS nearby, and it allows us to then serve a whole new group of customers, which is not just a retail play but obviously, a PBM opportunity for us to serve these new customers. And for us, ultimately, it's about taking advantage of scale and all these integrated capabilities that we have. So we're thinking very differently, both in terms of how the other players in the industry are reacting to the pressure, but also about building our integrated model as a result. John Heinbockel : Do think some of the larger guys are rethinking the need to own that pharmacy relationship, or no? Because I think that's been the hindrance for some of them in getting out of it, right? They want to continue to own that relationship. Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, John, it's Larry. Listen, it's hard to answer that question with a broad brush. I do think that for some of the reasons that you heard Jon talk about in terms of how network constructs evolve with not just price as the variable, but price and clinical capabilities, I do think that that could be the triggering point that gets people to look at things differently because, obviously, a grocer has a different value proposition or a different lens in terms of the role that pharmacy plays. And if all of a sudden, they're on the outside looking in, I think that that may change how they view what's important. John Heinbockel : Okay. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: All right, thanks, John, and let me just take a minute to thank everybody again for your time this morning. And if you have any follow-up questions, Nancy and Mike are available. So thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask you to disconnect your lines. Have a good day, everyone.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, August 8, 2017. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike McGuire, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Michael P. McGuire: Thank you, Leila. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO, and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Jon Roberts, Chief Operating Officer, and Helena Foulkes, President of CVS Pharmacy, are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up so that we can provide more people with a chance to ask their questions. Please note that we posted a slide presentation on our website before this call. It summarizes the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. We also filed our Form 10-Q, and that too is also available on our website. I have one announcement this morning. Our annual Analyst Day has been scheduled for Tuesday, December 12, in New York City. You'll have the opportunity to hear from several members of our senior management team, who will provide a comprehensive update of our strategies for driving long-term growth. We plan to send invitations via email with more specific details at the end of the summer. But please save the date. Again, that's Tuesday, December 12. Additionally, during this presentation we will make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views related to our financial performance, future events, and industry and market conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what may be indicated in the forward-looking statements. We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these specific risks and uncertainties, in particular those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10 K and the cautionary statement disclosures in our Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings press release. During this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being webcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for one year. Now I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to hear more about our second quarter results. Total company revenues increased 4.5%, comfortably within our guidance range. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.33, which is $0.01 better than last year and at the high end of our guidance. On an adjusted basis, operating profit was down 7%, within expectations. And this reflects performance in the retail business that was in line with expectations along with performance in the PBM that was ahead of our expectations. We generated approximately $1.6 billion of free cash during the quarter and more than $4.6 billion year to date. And while we are pleased to report results within our expectations, we won't be satisfied until the total enterprise returns to healthy levels of earnings growth. Back in November, we outlined our four-point plan to return to healthy growth, and that plan included : leveraging our enterprise capabilities and CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition to partner more broadly with other PBMs and health plans; focusing on driving growth through new PBM product introductions that capitalize on the benefits inherent in our unique integrated model; continuing to be a low-cost provider; and continuing to be very thoughtful with respect to using our strong cash generation capabilities to return value to our shareholders. And as we go through today's call, you'll hear about the progress we've made against this plan. Given our solid first half performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range and raising the midpoint. We currently expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for 2017 of $5.83 to $5.93, reflecting a year-over-year change of down 0.25% to up 1.5%. That compares to our previous range of $5.77 to $5.93. and Dave will discuss the details of both our results and guidance in more detail in his remarks. Turning to the business update, and I'll start with the 2018 PBM selling season. Despite the magnitude of bidding opportunities being flat to down versus the prior year, we've had good success across all segments, and in particular in the government space. We currently have gross wins in the 2018 selling season of approximately $5.4 billion and net new business of about $1.8 billion. These new business numbers include the previously announced loss of the FEP specialty contract but do not include any impact from our individual Med D PDP, which I'll touch on shortly. To date, we have completed about 70% of our client renewals for 2018, and that's roughly in line with where we were at this point last year, and our retention rate currently sits at 97%. Additionally, I reminded you on our last call that our agreements to provide both retail and mail-order pharmacy services to FEP's more than 5.4 million members runs through 2018. And today, I'm happy to report that we extended those agreements for another year and will continue to provide retail and mail service for FEP members through 2019. The selling season isn't complete, but our integrated products and services continue to resonate strongly with clients and prospective clients alike, and we continue to maintain our pricing discipline in the marketplace. Last week we announced our 2018 formulary strategy, building on our formulary management success of the past six years. Effective January 1, we plan to remove 17 products from our standard control formulary across 10 drug classes while adding back 17 products that had been removed in previous years. We remove drugs only when clinically appropriate lower-cost alternatives are available and our targeted approach ensures minimum member disruption. For 2018, we estimate that 99.76% of members will be able to stay on their current therapy. And of course, our proactive member and prescriber communications strategy helps members transition to clinically appropriate medications, which minimizes disruption. Let me also note that we are in the process of finalizing changes for the autoimmune and hepatitis C categories, which will be communicated in mid-September. The autoimmune class is a trend driver for our commercial clients, due primarily to utilization and price, and new entrants are expected in the hep C class soon. There will be more to say on that next month. Since introducing our industry-leading formulary management approach six years ago, through 2018 we expect to deliver $13.4 billion in cumulative savings for our PBM clients through the inclusion of lower-cost brands and encouraging the transition to generics. I would note that over that same time period, we seen our generic dispensing rate rise by more than 10 percentage points. You can find an overview of our strategy along with our 2018 formulary details in our latest Insights commentary, which is available through the Investor Relations portion of our website. In addition to our formulary management strategies, we also introduced our new Transform Value program, which is designed to offer incremental benefit based on specific outcomes in key trend categories. Outcomes-based management aligns reimbursement for a drug to achievement of a predefined outcome. For example, in obesity, the manufacturer would be required to provide additional value if members do not achieve a minimum level of weight reduction within the initial assessment period. This program will launch with Transform Value programs in the oncology, obesity, and respiratory categories. And these join our Transform Diabetes Care program, which was introduced earlier this year. This program targets support for actions that can help influence measures such as A1c levels, improving outcomes, and reducing costs. Now turning to SilverScript, our Med D PDP, we currently have 4.5 million captive lives in our individual PDP, 1 million captive EGWP [Employer Group Waiver Plan] lives, and we serve another 6.9 million lives through our health plan clients. So in total, Caremark currently serves 12.4 million Med D beneficiaries. Last week we received the preliminary benchmark results from CMS for 2018, and we're pleased to report that SilverScript is below the benchmark in 32 of the 34 regions. These strong benchmark results enable us to retain all of the auto-assignees we currently serve, and importantly qualify us to receive new auto-assignees in all 32 regions, which is an improvement over prior years, as none of the regions are in de minimis status, so we're very pleased with these results. Before turning to retail, let me touch briefly on Specialty. As you know, the industry continues to see a year-over-year decline in hepatitis C script volume due to lower new patient starts along with fewer days of therapy. And overall, the rate of specialty revenue growth across the industry has slowed. However, CVS Specialty's growth continues to outpace the market, seeing strong growth in the open market while securing significant wins in the standalone specialty market. In the second quarter, Specialty revenues increased a solid 11.5%. Moving on to Q2 results, in the Retail/Long-Term Care business, total same-store sales decreased 2.6%, slightly better than expectations, with Pharmacy same-store sales down 2.8%. Pharmacy sales comps were negatively impacted by approximately 410 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Same-store prescription volumes were flat. That's on a 30-day equivalent basis. And as expected, the decision to restrict CVS from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully insured prime networks negatively impacted Pharmacy sales and script comps. The network changes had about a 460 basis point negative impact on volumes, and that's consistent with the impact that we saw in Q1. And adjusting for those network changes, same-store prescription volumes would have been up 4.6% in the quarter on a 30-day equivalent basis, a sequential improvement from Q1 after accounting for the absence of leap day this year. Now as we look to return to healthy growth, we continue to be very focused on partnering with all payers to drive volumes and capture share, and these conversations have already yielded excellent results. Our partnership with Optum to provide a 90-day retail solution to their ASO clients and members launched last month. We've already seen some uptake from clients, and the pipeline of additional opportunity in the coming years is promising. Additionally, in June, we announced a collaboration called Cigna HealthWorks that aligns Cigna-administered health benefits with CVS Pharmacy and MinuteClinic. It leverages the CVS footprint, including the use of the CVS 90-day network, in addition to Health Tag messaging, the ExtraCare Health card, and discounts at MinuteClinic for select preventive and acute care. And we see a strong pipeline of opportunity in this program. And lastly, we will be the anchor for a retail network option for Express Scripts' Diabetes Care Value program, a performance-based program focused on meeting certain medication adherence thresholds. And we continue to talk with other PBMs and health plans, offering a menu of services to partner more broadly leveraging CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition along with our enterprise capabilities, which also include infusion and long-term care. Now before moving to the front store, let me touch on our Long-Term Care business. As you know, there was a bit of news in the space last week with PharMerica agreeing to be acquired by KKR and Walgreens. And in a lot of ways, their agreement is a confirmation of both the growth potential for long-term care and post-acute services as well as the additional value that our retail pharmacy can bring to this market. Omnicare remains the leader in the market, and this potential acquisition does nothing to change that. We've invested the time and capital over the past two years to get the right technology and processes in place in order to differentiate our offering to make it more compelling for our clients as well as the residents at these facilities. It's been a slower process than we expected due to technology enhancements that needed to be built along with certain dynamics in the skilled nursing space. However, we remain optimistic in this market and our ability to grow the Omnicare business. Turning to the front store, comps decreased 2.1%, including a positive impact of 75 basis points related to the shift of Easter into the second quarter. In addition, the decline in front store comps reflects a number of factors, including our decision to rationalize our promotional strategies, scaling back on mass promotions, and reducing our circular page count. Softer customer traffic was partially offset by the continued increase in the average front store customer ticket. And when adjusting for the Easter shift as well the leap day impact in Q1, front store comps improved sequentially from Q1 to Q2. Our personalization and promotional strategies have been successfully contributing to growth in front store profitability. Front store gross margin once again improved nicely in the quarter versus last year, as did front store gross profit dollars despite the decline in front store comps. We remain focused on growing our Beauty, Health Care and Personal Care businesses, and continue to enhance our digital presence to increase engagement with our Health and Beauty shoppers. We have integrated digital manufacturer coupons into our app, providing customers a new and easy way to save money in our stores. We also implemented new technology that is making our digital communications even more relevant by automating the selection of products, offers, and messages, leveraging advanced analytics and ExtraCare. Store brands also remain an area of both strength and opportunity, and our store brands represented 22.6% of front store sales in the quarter. That's up about 80 basis points from a year ago. And we've been growing and gaining penetration in Health Care, Beauty, Personal Care, and Edibles by focusing on providing high-quality value alternatives and through innovation that improves the customers' experience. Before turning to the financials, let me touch briefly on MinuteClinic, which posted revenue growth in the quarter of 8%. Since its inception, MinuteClinic providers have now conducted 37 million patient visits. Recently, MinuteClinic joined the Alere eScreen Occupational Health Network. And through this new collaboration, employees of businesses that utilize Alere can visit MinuteClinic for a number of services commonly required, such as biometric screenings, vaccinations, Department of Transportation physicals, and drug testing. We look forward to helping improve the accessibility of these workplace testing services. With that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review David M. Denton: Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll provide a detailed review of second-quarter results, followed by an update on our guidance. I'll start first with a summary of how we continue to enhance shareholder value through our capital allocation program. During the second quarter, we paid $512 million in dividends. Our 12-month trailing dividend payout ratio currently stands at 36.6%. Let me remind you again that this ratio is artificially high, as it includes some expenses that are more temporary in nature, as described in our non-GAAP reconciliations on our website. On a comparable basis, we remain well on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 35% by the end of 2018. In addition, we have continued to repurchase shares. As we discussed in the first quarter earnings call, in April we completed the previously announced accelerated share repurchase programs. We received approximately 10 million shares at the close of those programs. We repurchased an additional 4.3 million shares during the quarter, bringing the total repurchased in the second quarter to 14.3 million shares. Year to date we've repurchased 50.4 million shares for approximately $4 billion or $78.67 per share. So between dividends and share repurchases, we've returned approximately $852 million to shareholders during the quarter and nearly $5 billion year to date. We continue to expect to return more than $7 billion to our shareholders in 2017 through both a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As Larry mentioned, we generated approximately $1.6 billion of free cash in the second quarter, and we have produced more than $4.6 billion year to date. Free cash flow in the quarter benefited from the timing of PBM cash receipts and payable, due in part to the early receipt of a Medicare Part D payment that shifted into Q2 due to the timing of month end. For the full year, we continue to expect to produce free cash flow of between $6 billion and $6.4 billion. Now turning to the income statement, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.33 per share, at the high end of our guidance range and up 0.8% over LY, or $0.01. These results were on a comparable basis, and the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted earnings per share can be found in the press release as well as on the Investor Relations portion of our website. As Larry noted, the Retail/Long-Term Care segment delivered results within our expectations, while the PBM segment posted profit growth above the higher end of our expectations, primarily driven by timing factors related to purchasing economics. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.07 per share. This is $0.08 below the low end of our guidance range, primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge associated with our RxCrossroads business that was recorded during the quarter. You may recall that we bought RxCrossroads a couple of years ago as part of the Omnicare acquisition. It administers programs that provide patients with assistance in obtaining high-cost drugs, working directly with manufacturers to do this. And this has not been a material contributor to our results. Additionally, it also acts as a third-party logistics provider for plasma cold chain management services. It's a really small piece of our business, and we've continued to work to ensure that the patient assistance programs are completely aligned with our focus on driving down costs for our clients. However, that work has resulted in us walking away from some business that was potentially inconsistent with our enterprise goals. So we've made the decision to pursue strategic alternatives for the RxCrossroads business. In connection with this decision, in the second quarter we performed an interim goodwill impairment test that resulted in the fair value of RxCrossroads being lower than its net book value. As a result, we recorded $135 million in non-cash goodwill impairment charge within the operating expenses for the Retail/Long-Term Care segment. You can find further details on this in our Form 10-Q. So with that, let me provide more detail on our quarterly results as I quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the second quarter increased 4.5% to $45.7 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 9.5% to $32.3 billion, within our expectations. This growth is largely due to the increased volume of pharmacy network claims resulting from the successful selling season we had last year as well as brand inflation and solid specialty pharmacy growth. This was partially offset by a 130 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 87.2%. Overall, PBM adjusted claims grew 9.5% in the quarter. In our Retail/Long-Term Care business, revenues were approximately $19.6 billion in the quarter, decreasing 2.2% year over year, slightly better than our expectations. This decline was driven by continued reimbursement pressure, which was magnified by flat script comps caused by the network changes we've been discussing. During the quarter, GDR increased by approximately 150 basis points to 87.6%. We also saw a decline in front store revenues due to softer customer traffic and our promotional decisions, which was partially offset by an increase in basket size. As Larry mentioned, front store same-store sales comps decreased 2.1% and were positively affected by approximately 75 basis points from the shift of the Easter holiday into the second quarter of this year. Turning to gross margin, operating expenses, operating profit, and the tax rates, the numbers that I'll cite reflect non-GAAP adjustments in both the current and prior periods where applicable, which we have reconciled on our website. Keep in mind that our guidance for the second quarter reflected these items. The consolidated company's gross margin was 15.2% in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 85 basis points compared to Q2 of 2016. This contraction was mainly driven by a mix shift, as the lower margin PBM business is growing faster than the Retail/Long-Term Care segment. Gross profit dollars for the company decreased 1.2% versus the same quarter of last year, primarily due to a loss of scripts in the Retail segment. Within the PBM, gross margin contracted by approximately 10 basis points versus Q2 of 2016 to 4.5%. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to continued price compression and changes in the mix of business, partially offset by favorable generic dispensing. However, gross profit dollars in the PBM increased 7.4% year over year, driven by strong claims growth and favorable purchasing economics as well as improvements in GDR. Of course, partially offsetting these drivers was continued price compression. In our Retail/Long-Term Care segment, gross margin declined approximately 20 basis points to 29%. The decline in gross margin rate was primarily driven by lower reimbursement rates that continue to pressure pharmacy margins. Partially offsetting those pressures were an increase in generic dispensing rate as well as increased front store margin that Larry spoke about earlier. Gross profit dollars decreased 2.8% year over year in the Retail segment, mainly due to the loss of scripts from the network changes as well as continued reimbursement pressures. Consolidated operating expense as a percent of revenues improved approximately 25 basis points to 10.2% compared to Q2 of 2016. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved about 10 basis points to 1%, benefiting mainly from additional sales leverage related to volume increases. SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment worsened by about 80 basis points to 21.1%, as we delevered due to the loss of prescriptions related to the restricted networks. Additionally, a portion of the increase in operating expense dollars year over year relates to investments we are making in process improvements and technology enhancements as part of our enterprise streamlining initiative. During the quarter, we continued to work on new tools and processes designed to improve labor productivity across our enterprise pharmacy operations, among many other projects. Recall that we expect cost to outweigh savings this year but that savings should ramp up as we move throughout the year. Within the corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $20 million to $240 million due to an increase in benefit costs and the investments in strategic initiatives. Consistent with our expectations, operating margin for the total enterprise decreased approximately 60 basis points in the quarter to 5%. Operating margin in the PBM remained relatively flat at 3.5%, while operating margin at retail declined approximately 95 basis points to 8% on an adjusted basis. For the quarter, operating profit growth in the segments and at the enterprise level was in line with or better than expectations. The PBM exceeded our expectations, with operating profit growth of 9.1%. Operating profit in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment declined to 12.7%, in line with our expectations. And the consolidated operating profit declined 7%, also in line with expectations. Going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter decreased approximately $33 million from LY to $247 million, due primarily to pay down debt in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a lower average interest rate on the debt that remains outstanding. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 38.4%, which was higher than expected. This was driven by a delta between our estimates of the discrete tax benefit we've seen from adopting the new share-based accounting standard and what we've actually experienced during the quarter. As previously discussed at Analyst Day and in prior earnings calls, the amended accounting guidance seems likely to result in increased tax rate volatility because of changes in both share price and behavior of employees that can exercise best adoptions. This required change in accounting treatment will continue to impact the tax rate going forward, which will fluctuate based on these factors. Our weighted average share count was just over 1 billion shares, reflecting the receipt of shares from the ASR that was completed in April and some additional repurchases made throughout the quarter. So with that, now let me update you on our guidance. I'll focus on the highlights here, but you can find additional details of our guidance in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning. As Larry said, we are narrowing and raising the midpoint of our 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $5.83 to $5.93, from a range of $5.77 to $5.93, reflecting the year-over-year change of down 0.25% to up 1.5%. This raises the midpoint by $0.03, reflecting our performance to date as well as our expectations for the second half. With respect to GAAP diluted EPS, in addition to narrowing the range, we're revising our full-year guidance to also reflect a few additional items. One obviously is the goodwill impairment charge of $135 million pre-tax related to RxCrossroads, which I discussed earlier. The others total $25 million pre-tax, and mainly relate to additional costs associated with the loss on the defined benefit pension plan settlement expected in the third quarter. So with that, we now expect the GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.92 to $5.02 per share. You can find a reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted EPS in our press release and on the Investor Relations portion of our website. With half the year now behind us, we are updating our revenue and operating profit guidance. In the PBM segment, we are narrowing revenue guidance to a range of 8% to 9%, leaving the midpoint unchanged. We are also increasing our estimate of adjusted claims to a range of 1.78 billion to 1.8 billion claims. This takes into account the solid performance the PBM has delivered thus far and reflects our confidence in our adjusted claims volume for the remainder of the year. In the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we are narrowing and revising guidance for revenue. This mainly reflects continued reimbursement pressure and expected softness in script volume. We now expect Retail/Long-Term Care revenue to decline 2.75% to 3.5%, and total comps to decline 3.5% to 4.25%, and script comps of down 0.75% to up 0.25%. As a result of all these changes, we narrowed our consolidated net revenue growth to 3% to 4%. Now turning to operating profit, we are narrowing the PBM operating profit get range by lowering the top end 150 basis points to account for slightly slower growth in Specialty than planned, mainly due to the slowdown in hep C. This results in a new operating profit growth range of 5.75% to 7.25%. We are narrowing and lowering the guidance range for the Retail/Long-Term Care segment to reflect slightly lower volumes. So we now expect Retail/Long-Term Care operating profit to decline 8.75% to 10%. We narrowed the consolidated operating profit range by 75 basis points to reflect the changes in PBM and the retail segments as well as increased investments related to our streamlining effort that will help us achieve our long-term goals. We now expect operating profit to increase 4.25% to 5.75%. This reduction in the high end of the operating profit guidance range is mostly offset by an improved outlook in our effective tax rate and a lower weighted average share count for the full year of 2017, thus enabling us to maintain the top end of our previous adjusted earnings per share guidance. Now let me touch upon the earnings pattern for the third and the fourth quarters. Starting back at Analyst Day, we highlighted several timing factors that would impact our cadence of earnings for this year. One of those drivers was the timing of profitability in our Medicare Part D business. As we've seen in years past, the timing of Medicare Part D profits in the third quarter remains difficult to forecast, since this is the time period where the risk-sharing corridor is usually least effective at providing risk-sharing protection. Thus, changes in any current estimates, such as utilization, significantly impacts the timing of profits between the third and fourth quarters. This forecasting challenge is compounded by the growth in this part of our business. We've made our best estimates and included those estimates in our guidance. This year, we expect the timing of Med D profitability to shift to the fourth quarter. This is in contrast to 2016, when we experienced members moving through the risk corridor more quickly, which led to higher profitability in the third quarter. This year-over-year swing in timing of profitability is not impacting the outlook for the year. It is simply a shift of earnings from the third to the fourth quarter. We used our best estimates to provide Q3 guidance, but the cadence between Q3 and Q4 does have the potential to change because it's based on how members move through their benefits. In addition to the timing of Med D profitability, we continue to expect the benefit from our enterprise streamlining initiatives to be greater in the back half of the year than they have been year to date. Turning specifically to the third quarter, which includes certain non-GAAP items described in the slides, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.47 to $1.50 per share, reflecting a decrease of 8% to 10.5% versus Q3 of 2016. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.23 in the third quarter, which includes an estimated $220 million loss on the settlement of the defined benefit pension plan discussed previously at our 2016 Analyst Day. Within the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we expect revenues to decrease 3.25% to 5% versus the third quarter of last year, driven in large part by the network changes discussed previously. Adjusted script comps are expected to be down 0.75% to up 0.25%, and total same-store sales are expected to decrease 4% to 5.75%. In the PBM business, we expect third quarter revenue growth of 8.5% to 9.75%, driven by continued strong growth in volumes in specialty pharmacy. Consolidated net revenues are expected to grow 2.75% to 4.25%. We expect consolidated operating profit to decline 11% to 13.5% in the third quarter. Retail/Long-Term Care operating profit is expected to decrease 11% to 13.5%. Additionally, we expect PBM operating profit to decrease 5.5% to 7.5%, but you do need to be mindful of the shift in Medicare Part D profits, as I just outlined. If the Medicare Part D PDP were excluded from all periods, PBM year-over-year growth in Q3 and Q4 would be more in line with the growth that we saw in Q2 of this year. In closing, we remain very confident in our full-year forecast and our ability to return to sustainable healthy earnings growth over the longer term, and we continue to demonstrate our ability to generate substantial free cash flow. We remain committed to using the cash to drive returns for our shareholders through value-enhancing investments, dividends, and share repurchases. And so with that, let me turn it back over to Larry Merlo. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Dave. Before moving into the Q&A, I did want to share our approach and actions in dealing with the rhetoric around the drug pricing debate. We have been and continue to be a very active voice in Washington with regard to healthcare issues. In fact, at the beginning of this Congress, we outlined a series of proactive proposals to lower drug costs. And these proposals focus on increasing competition in the drug market, strengthening the ability to use our drug management tools, and easing out-of-pocket costs for consumers, and we have seen action on a number of fronts. Foremost, the new FDA Commissioner has embraced proposals to prioritize the review of generic drug applications, launching a Drug Competition Action Plan. And as part of this plan, the agency has published a list of more than 260 off-patent branded drugs without approved generics in order to encourage the development of ANDAs in markets without competition. Additionally, the FDA now will expedite the review of generic drug applications until there are three approved generics for a given product, recognizing that patients do see significant price reductions when there are multiple generics available. And we're already seeing results, as May and June of this year have seen the most generic drug approvals since the FDA began tallying its monthly approvals. We're also engaged with the administration at all levels, and our discussions have increased the understanding of the value of the PBM, are highlighting the significant savings being generated in Medicare Part D, and are providing solutions for consumers to better afford the drugs they purchase at our pharmacy counters. And there's still more that can be done. We're piloting the use of technology to provide drug pricing information to both the patient and the prescriber at the point of prescription. This dramatically changes the conversation with policymakers, several of whom have expressed great interest in these capabilities. And ultimately, we believe continuing to demonstrate the role that CVS Health plays in making healthcare more affordable, more accessible, and more effective will be the winning strategy. So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question. Scott A. Mushkin: Hey, guys. I appreciate it. I had one shorter-term question regarding the guidance and then one longer-term question. So the guidance is, to summarize, it looks like the operating profit for the enterprise is coming down a little bit. That's specialty and maybe some more investments in retail. David M. Denton: That's correct. Scott A. Mushkin: And then bridge me to the better performance. Is it just tax rate and the share buybacks? That's how you get to the move up in the range? David M. Denton: That's correct. There's a little bit of softness due to volume in retail and a little bit of softness due to specialty at the operating profit line and some investments that we're making to drive the long term. But all of that's being mainly offset through both tax rate and our performance from the share repurchase program. Scott A. Mushkin: Okay, perfect. And then this is a broader question. I'm sure it's going to come up in the call, so I might as well ask it because I cover Amazon. Amazon has been rumored to be entering, or may enter. I know it came up on the Express Scripts call. How do you guys view that, especially on the retail side of the business? And what would prevent them from taking share if they decided to enter? Larry J. Merlo: Scott, listen. It's Larry. I think as you've heard many talk about, there are many barriers to entry when you're looking at pharmacy. And I think most people are thinking about pharmacy as another distribution point. But pharmacy is also about the clinical outcomes that are provided. And in an environment where there's a migration to more value-based care, those clinical capabilities are going to continue to grow in importance. It's highly regulated, so the barriers to entry are high. And you know the role that \u2013 today you've got more than 90% of prescriptions that are covered by some type of third-party insurance, so there's an awful lot of work that exists between pharmacists working with payers and physicians to provide that care. And we know the role that pharmacists play in the community. We've seen mail-order pharmacy decline to some degree over the last couple years, and patients put a lot of value in the trust and the relationship that they have with their community with their retail pharmacist. So I don't think there's anything that is in the near-term world that changes those dynamics. I think as you flip over and think about the front store, listen, there are many more online retailers today than what we had five years ago. And the CVS Pharmacy model is built on convenience, when you think about 9,700 points of access and the fact that you've got almost 80% of the U.S. population that lives within a few miles of a CVS. And over the last couple years we've been working hard to define what omni-channel means for us and means for those customers, and have been investing in our digital tools and capabilities to provide more of an omni-channel experience. So listen, there's no question that Amazon is a competitor in the marketplace. They've done a great job, and you don't take anything that they're doing for granted. But at the same time, I think that we have a lot of capabilities and a value proposition that can compete effectively in the market. Scott A. Mushkin: All right, perfect. I'll yield. Thanks, guys. Larry J. Merlo: All right. Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Lisa C. Gill: Great, thanks very much and good morning. Larry, you talked about the relationships with Cigna, Optum, and Express Scripts. Can you maybe just give us any updated thoughts around the number of prescriptions you think this could drive over time? And then secondly, any updates on Medicare Part D network relationships, any thoughts around participating in preferred networks as we think about 2018? Larry J. Merlo: Lisa, the relationships, the things that we talked about in the prepared remarks, I think those products are out being sold in the marketplace as we speak. We don't expect it to have any material impact in 2017, and we hope to see it begin to ramp up in 2018 and beyond because we think that there is a robust pipeline. At the same time, I think we've learned from our experience between Caremark and our health plan clients the challenges that exist in terms of selling those products in the marketplace, so it will take some time. In terms of Med D. I think you've seen some announcements that this is work in progress. We'll have more to say on this at the end of the year, but CVS Pharmacy will be preferred in Aetna's Medicare Part D network beginning in 2018. So I think that there's progress being made as we continue to evaluate those opportunities. Lisa C. Gill: And then my follow-up just would be on the generic comments that you made, obviously, more generics coming to the market, generally viewed as a positive as we think about the PBM and drug retail. Is there a certain point where the pricing is so low that you can't capture the same amount of margin opportunity, or is lower pricing and competition around generic procurement always a positive for your book of business? Larry J. Merlo: Lisa, I would say at this point and for the foreseeable future, we view it as a positive for our business. And it would be interesting if we can ever find a point where that hypothesis that you mentioned would \u2013 we've got a long way to go before we get to that point. Maybe that's the right way to say it. Lisa C. Gill: Okay, great. Thank you Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Lisa. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. John Heinbockel : Larry, on the Transform Value program. I know it's early, but what learnings have you had from the diabetes portion of this as you look at rolling out the next three \u2013 maybe enhance those three? And then when you think about using this to get closer to your health plan and other PBM partners, have you been able to \u2013 is there a way to dimensionalize that possible impact, or you know it's positive but it's very difficult this early to figure out what that might mean for share? Larry J. Merlo: John, I'll start and then I think Jon will want to jump in here. John, the learnings that we've got from the Transform Diabetes Care, I would say it's largely come from the pilot program. And I think what we found is that \u2013 keep in mind that there are two parts to this program. There's the client part in terms of which we're telling them that we can control their costs in a differentiated way, recognizing that diabetes has been a contributor to trends over the last couple years. And for the patient, we're working with them in terms of providing more effective care and a better health outcome by monitoring their blood glucose in real time and avoiding unnecessary visits to the physician or to the emergency room. So the pilot program demonstrated for us that we can improve the patient outcome and reduce costs for the client. That's what we're out there selling right now, and there has been a high level of interest. But again, those programs are being sold in the marketplace, so we'll have more to say on that later this year or early next year in terms of the traction that it's getting. Jonathan C. Roberts: And, John, this is Jon. We've been talking for many years about the value of adherence and lowering overall healthcare costs. And I think this diabetes program, which is our clients' top priority when they look at their population and what's driving their overall healthcare costs. So it really is positioning us as a partner to not only provide pharmacy services but also to help manage the overall healthcare costs for those clients. And so the response has been very positive. People are interested in solutions. There have been solutions in the marketplace, but they are point solutions, so they can now come to us and get a comprehensive program and we can talk about not only their pharmacy costs but their medical costs. And we expect to roll Transform Care programs out for four additional disease states over the next 24 months, and that will be asthma, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and depression. And we tell our clients that these members have to be in one of our channels to get the value of these programs. So I do think there is share shift. There will be share shift that comes as clients adopt these programs and we demonstrate our ability to lower overall healthcare costs. John Heinbockel : And then maybe as a follow-up for Larry, if you think about the reimbursement pressure you and everybody else is seeing and what that has to be doing to those with subscale business models, what happens to share over time? And do you think \u2013 by definition does there have to be some moderation in reimbursement pressure, either as a means to not prevent some of these other channels from leading the market or maybe we get there because share consolidates too much? What's the prognosis there? Larry J. Merlo: John, I think the question that we've talked about probably every year for the last several is that I wouldn't describe reimbursement pressure as increasing from its historic levels. I think the dynamic that we see, at least this year, is the offsets associated with that reimbursement pressure are more challenging than what may have existed in prior years. And you would expect there are going to be ebbs and flows to that, whether it's the contribution that new generics can make to the market or other dynamics underway. You've heard us talk, John, about the migration to \u2013 and we're talking about value-based networks. And I do think that dynamic will change the construct of networks because now pharmacy networks will not be simply defined by location and price, they'll be defined by clinical capabilities and outcomes. And I think that will create a different dynamic than what exists today in terms of who can participate and who can't when you look at clinical capabilities. John Heinbockel : Okay, thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Hi, good morning. Larry, in your prepared remarks about the selling season, you talked about some wins in the government segment. So can you just help us think about how the mix of the new business with the profitability associated with it, and how should we think about that compared to last year? David M. Denton: Ricky, this is Dave. As typical in the PBM space, profitability within a new client is pretty thin in the first years. And I would say that as we look forward to profitability in these contracts next year versus this year, I'd say more or less on a comparable basis consistent with year over year. I do think one of our challenges and that we work hard on is once we onboard a client is making sure that we work to improve their performance, drive value for them and drive value for us, whether that's shifting to new generics, whether that's improving clinical outcomes, whether it's moving into some value arrangements. And that's the program that we constantly run, and that is something that our organization and our teams are consistently focused on. Jonathan C. Roberts: Ricky, this is Jon. The only other thing I would add is about half our wins are in the government space, and they probably perform more like health plans because they're limited in the programs they can adopt. So I would probably think of it along those lines. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Okay, that's very helpful. And the other half, is it commercial? Jonathan C. Roberts: The other half, Ricky, think of it as being split between health plan and employer. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Okay, and then just a question around capital deployment. When you provided us the long-term guidance growth of 10%, it included capital deployment, so two questions there. One, how do you think about capital deployment? I know that Pfizer last week said that they are holding back on M&A until they have more clarity around tax reform. Is that something that you're thinking about as well? And my second question is when we think \u2013 this might be a little bit early for that. But when we think about \u2013 how should we think about 2018 within the context of that long-term 10%? David M. Denton: Ricky, it's probably a little too early to talk specifically about 2018. As you know, we're targeting 10% adjusted earnings per share growth over time. We said that some years will be better than that. Some years will be light to that. We're obviously working hard to get ourselves back to a growth platform here. From a tax reform perspective, we are encouraged by the progress and the discussions that are occurring around tax reform. We are not waiting on tax reform to make investments in our business. I think at a nearly 40% tax rate all-in from both federal and state, we're more likely than not to be a beneficiary of tax reform. So therefore, it will enhance our performance over time. So we're not going to wait for that to come through legislatively. We're going to work towards making investments in our business that make the most sense long term. Ricky R. Goldwasser: And any thoughts about areas of M&A and the scale that you would be considering? David M. Denton: Ricky, we've probably not much comment there. We obviously continue to look at the healthcare space pretty holistically. I think our platform from a pharmacy care management perspective is pretty robust. I do think there are still areas that we can continue to invest on that platform and continue to add value to both our shareholders and to the clients and members that we serve, but I can't probably give you any more specifics at this point. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Good morning, guys. Thinking about the updated guidance and particularly on the retail side and the script growth, can you maybe give a sense, especially since you talked about the lighter script growth being some of the driver for the reduced EBIT guidance? Are the numbers you had expected at the beginning of the year or late last year when you first gave guidance relative to the initial 40 million or so scripts tracking in line with what you had expected? David M. Denton: I think materially, they're fairly consistent with what we expected, so no big changes there. I think as you've seen, our script delivery for the first half of the year within the Retail/Long-Term Care segment has been pretty consistent with expectations. We are seeing a little softness from a market perspective, so our go-forward guidance reflects that. I would also say that just from a Long-Term Care perspective, we're seeing bed census lower, so that obviously had some effect on script delivery in that portion of our business. Larry J. Merlo: And mostly, Mike, within the skilled nursing space. Michael Cherny : Thanks, that's helpful, and then just one quick follow-up on Part D. As you think about the evolution of the competitive dynamics in the market, and SilverScript obviously has been a leader for a while, have you seen any changes in parallel to what's happening with regards to the repeal-and-replace debate that are impacting Part D and your view of Part D and the competitive dynamics around Part D to the positive or negative? David M. Denton: Mike, I don't think we've seen much change from that perspective. This continues to be an area where we've excelled in Part D. Our set of services and products are priced very competitively. We've been able to drive a lot of value, and we continue to grow share and membership in this space over the last several years. And I think it's important to note that we're not only growing share within our PDP business. At the same time, the capabilities that we deliver from a PBM perspective are allowing our health plan partners and clients to grow share within their base, so we're participating in both aspects of that business. Jonathan C. Roberts: Mike, if anything, I think the dialogue is probably the reverse; that are there things that exist within the Medicare space that should be applied to Medicaid. And you think about the fact that there is still a large percentage of Medicaid fee-for-service that there are opportunities to reduce costs across the country and in many state Medicaid programs by migrating some of the tools that exist in other spaces. Michael Cherny : Excellent, thanks. Jonathan C. Roberts: Thanks, Mike. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Patrick Jones : Great, thanks for the questions. Dave, you covered a lot of the changes to the outlook, but I wanted to just go back and ask specifically on the retail pharmacy gross margin. It went down in the quarter after showing some improvement last quarter, and you guys obviously maintained modest improvement for the year. So just curious if you could talk a little bit about what changed in 2Q versus 1Q. And then how are you thinking about the improvement or the implied improvement in the retail gross margin in the back half? David M. Denton: I think this is largely tied to the timing of break-open generics as we think about the back half of this year. So you would think a little bit about that driving that performance. Also, when you get to the fourth quarter, you start overlapping the restricted network changes as it relates to TRICARE. So that overlap helps, at least from a growth perspective \u2013 maybe not the rate, but it certainly helps from a growth perspective. Robert Patrick Jones : Okay, great. I guess just one quick follow-up on the selling season. Obviously, good news on the FEP retail and mail extension. I'm curious about the thought process behind the one-year extension. If I think back, I believe these contracts were typically longer in duration when they were renewed or reassigned, so just wondering if there was any more background on the extension around FEP. Jonathan C. Roberts: Bob, this is Jon. They had two one-year options to extend the contract. They had exercised one, and this is the exercising of that second one-year option. Larry J. Merlo: And, Bob, FEP continues to be extremely satisfied with the levels of service that we're providing for their members. Robert Patrick Jones : Okay, got it. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Bob. Michael P. McGuire: Thank you. Next question? Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Ann Kathleen Hynes : Hi, good morning. Can we talk about Omnicare a little bit more? Because if I'm hearing you correctly, I think maybe the softness in guidance for retail is more related to Omnicare than anything else. Is that correct, and maybe just a little bit more detail on what's happening and how you can fix it? Thanks. David M. Denton: Ann, this is Dave. I think the softness from a volume perspective is a little bit of both, both Long-Term Care and we're just seeing some softness in retail more broadly. And by the way, that's just a tweak, that's not a major trend break, so we're just tweaking that guidance expectation around the edges here. I do think what you see in the skilled nursing facility space, you're seeing length of stay and just that census come down a little bit in the marketplace. And as that has occurred, that affects Omnicare disproportionally greater because it has a fairly sizable share in that space. I will say as we think about new beds and as we think about marketing and offering new services to new clients and new operators, I think our products are resonating in the marketplace. I feel like we're nicely positioned here. We have a little industry headwinds as we cycle in the back half of this year in that business as it relates to volumes. Larry J. Merlo: Ann, the only other thing I would add is that we had talked about some of the technology investments and enhancements that we needed to make in that business, and those have largely been complete. So now it's a question of executing those new capabilities. And in addition to what Dave mentioned, there are opportunities to improve the productivity and efficiency in that business as well. Ann Kathleen Hynes : Okay, great. And then just to focus on the ramp to Q3 to Q4, I think there is some concern historically because it's much bigger, but I'm assuming you're pretty confident on the Medicaid Part D side that it's more a timing issue than anything. And I think you also mentioned there's a second reason why, just maybe some more cost savings. Can you tell us how much of the ramp has to do with cost savings versus the Medicare Part D risk corridors? Thanks. David M. Denton: This is largely a Medicare Part D PDP topic. There's a little bit of investments we're making in the corridor from a cost perspective, driving initiatives, but this is largely Medicare Part D. And I'll just reiterate a little bit of what I said before. If you took Medicare Part D, our PDP, and you excluded it from all periods this year and last year, our PBM year-over-year growth in Q3 and Q4 would be very much in line with the growth that we saw in Q2. Ann Kathleen Hynes : Okay. Larry J. Merlo: And, Ann, the other point in terms of getting comfortable with that, keep in mind that Part D has been growing at a pretty significant rate and represents a bigger portion of the PBM business than it would have last year or the year prior. Ann Kathleen Hynes : Okay. David M. Denton: Yes, and one last topic there. Just also, as I said earlier to Bob's comment I believe or question, is when we get to the fourth quarter, we begin to wrap the impact of the TRICARE decision to restrict the network. And that took effect December of last year, but we started feeling the effects of that a little earlier than December. Ann Kathleen Hynes : Okay, very helpful. Thank you. David M. Denton: Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Ann. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Steven J. Valiquette: Okay, thanks. Good morning, Larry and Dave. I'm just curious with Walgreens and Rite Aid now proposing a scaled-down asset purchase instead of a full merger, I'm just curious whether or not that's changed the tone of any narrow network contracts you're going to be negotiating right now. I guess specifically, does their lack of a full-scale merger maybe put CVS in a better light now on a relative basis when negotiating these narrow network deals when you're trying to be the anchor chain? Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: No. Steve, it's Larry. I don't think that anything has changed with that as a variable. I think that as we talked a fair amount about in our prepared remarks, I think the dialogue around network configuration is about capabilities, and I don't think there's anything associated with Walgreens-Rite Aid that changes that dynamic. Steven J. Valiquette: Okay. By the way, thanks for the confirmation on the Aetna Medicare Part D network that we talked about several months ago as well. We look forward to more color on that in the future as well. Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: Great, thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. David M. Larsen: Hi. Can you provide a little bit more color around your narrow network deals with Cigna, Express, and Optum, like roughly any sense for how many lives are included in each of those deals? And when will those volumes start to impact retail, or have they already? Thanks a lot. David M. Denton: They certainly have not impacted at this point in time our retail performance. Keep in mind, what we have done, and this is just one I'll say product offering or service offering that we provide to PBMs in the marketplace, the option to sell in services related to CVS Pharmacy. And as they sell them in, we begin to get share. And part of that could be a narrow network. Part of it could be a clinical offering. Part of it could be communications with their members. And so we expect that over time, the success of how they sell those lives into their book of business and then over time we will gain share. Our experience with health plans is that it takes time for share to come through. We're optimistic about what we see in the marketplace, but we will have to watch carefully and help those members transition into our channel over time. So I'm not prepared at this point in time to give you a definitive number. I do think \u2013 as we look forward for the next several periods, we do think there's an opportunity to grow share into our channel. David M. Larsen: Okay. And then just quickly, with the exclusions lists that were recently published, it seems like you had 12 that were added, 12 that were taken off, so net zero incremental exclusions. It's very different from last year, where I think you had a lot more exclusions. Can you talk about that, any reason for what appears to be a less, I guess, aggressive approach to your exclusions list for 2018? Jonathan C. Roberts: This is Jon. We're not any less aggressive than we've ever been. And quite candidly, we've been able to demonstrate that we can move share away from product. So these pharma companies are coming back to the table trying to get back into our formulary and bringing value. That then makes sense for us to add those drugs back in those therapeutic classes. And we've been very conservative about adding drugs back, but we felt like this was a year and there was enough value for our clients to make moves that you saw with our new formulary announcement. David M. Larsen: Okay. And then just real quick, any thoughts on your Aetna relationship, how it's progressing? Thanks very much. Larry J. Merlo: I'm sorry, what about Aetna? David M. Larsen: Just your relationship there? Larry J. Merlo: Listen, our relationship continues to be very good. We talked about where we're going with Med D on the CVS Pharmacy side. Next year we'll be taking on a portion of Aetna's rebating. And as we alluded to earlier, we continue to partner very closely with their sales organization in selling in our unique integrated products, whether it's Maintenance Choice or some of the other products you heard us talk about earlier today. So I think our two organizations are working extremely well together in a cohesive and complementary fashion. David M. Larsen: Thanks very much. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thanks, Dave. We'll take two more questions. Operator : Very good, our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about RxCrossroads. You took the impairment charge. But is it fair to think you plan to retain the business itself? And I guess the specific question is within RxCrossroads, their HUB services offering, how important is that to have it still connected to the Specialty Pharmacy business? David M. Denton: Dave, we're obviously exploring all options with that business. I don't think the HUB connectivity to our Specialty businesses is important to us, so that could be disconnected easily, so we're not focused on that at this point in time. Charles Rhyee : Okay. And then when you talked about the timing on Medicare Part D moving more to the fourth quarter, does that imply anything in terms of the growth rate in the Med Part D business this year versus last year? So if you move through the donut hole earlier, was there faster growth last year in the first half versus this year, or is that just timing when you saw the growth? David M. Denton: It has nothing to do with growth. It really has to do with how the members utilize the benefit and when they hit those risk corridors at what stage. So it's not really affecting the year, and our performance in the business is really simply a shift between Q3 to Q4 from a profitability delivery perspective. Charles Rhyee : Okay, great. And then one last clarification around \u2013 I'm sorry, go ahead. Michael P. McGuire: It's all right. Go ahead. Charles Rhyee : I just had one more clarification on the FEP contract. You extended it for a year. Are there any more additional extension periods embedded within the contract, or does it go to RFP at some point then in 2019 or 2020? Thanks. Jonathan C. Roberts: This is Jon. The contract runs through 2019, and we expect it to go out to RFP at that point. There are no more extensions left. Charles Rhyee : Okay, great. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thank you. Michael P. McGuire: Last question. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question. Ross Muken : Thanks, guys. So maybe just thinking about, Larry, the comment you made in the press release that you won't be satisfied until the organization is back to healthy earnings growth, help us tick and tie how the year has played out so far, particularly on the operating income line, with some of the tweaks there relative to the long-term plan you talked about at the Analyst Day. It seems like a few pieces out of your control like volumes are maybe a bit lighter. But then on the positive side, you've got some of these network changes rolling off, and you've also got the streamlined piece kicking in, and it seems like you've got some new interesting relationships with a number of managed cares. So help think us through conceptually in your mind how the business has progressed and your confidence level in getting back to those healthy growth rates that obviously the business was used to more historically. David M. Denton: Ross, this is Dave. I'll start a little bit maybe with some color around this year. I think if you look at our performance year to date, we've largely delivered on the expectations that we set forth at the beginning of this year. I think that the organization continues to focus on driving as much growth as possible. We know this is a rebuilding year, but we've largely been able to through the first half of the year deliver on our top line and our bottom line. I think as we look forward, we made some slight tweaks as we've seen the industry soften a little bit from a volume perspective, but literally tweaks around that. I think the good thing too is despite the fact that because of those tweaks, we've had a little softness in the operating profit delivery in the back half of the year, our strong cash flow has allowed us to continue to deliver from an adjusted earnings per share a range that hasn't really moved. In fact, it actually increased $0.03 midpoint to midpoint. So I think we feel very good about what we've done. We have a lot of work ahead of us. We're focused on that. So with that, maybe I'll turn it to Larry. Larry J. Merlo: Ross, I think, as Dave outlined the focus in terms of delivering 2017, we're also working in terms of how do we plan and prepare for the future. And I think we feel very good about the quality of the work that's been done in terms of the new relationships on the CVS Pharmacy and related business side, and equally important, the innovation that is coming to market through the PBM. The Transform Care programs and some of the things that we talked about that Jon alluded to in his comments as well, and the work that is being done in terms of allowing us to be an even more efficient and productive provider on the streamlining, that work is on target and is moving in the right trajectory. So we feel very good about the work that's being done that prepares us for the future. Ross Muken : And I guess just as a quick follow-up, how would you grade, Larry, your responses to some of the challenges last year in terms of how you've addressed them so far and your confidence level in, again, getting this business back on to the trajectory that's normal? Do you think you've, in most of the pivots you've made, done enough essentially to feel like you've got the business back now to where you've actually got some positive momentum, it seems like for share this year withstanding some of the market noise? Larry J. Merlo: Ross, listen. There's no question that there is a high sense of urgency in the organization in terms of delivering on the things that both Dave and I alluded to. So I feel very good in terms of how the organization has responded and has rallied to the charge to work with speed and in focus. So I'm very proud of the work of our CVS Health colleagues, and I don't think we can ask any more of them in terms of the effort and the work they're doing. Ross Muken : Thanks, guys. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Ross. David M. Denton: Thank you, Ross. Larry J. Merlo: So listen, we know this was a long call. We had a lot of information to talk about, and we certainly appreciate everyone's interest and attention. And if there's any follow-up, don't hesitate to call Mike McGuire. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and we ask that you please disconnect your line.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Monday, November 6, 2017. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike McGuire, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Michael P. McGuire: Thank you, Nelson. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO, and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Jon Roberts, Chief Operating Officer, and Helena Foulkes, President of CVS Pharmacy, are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. During the Q&A, please keep in mind that it is our policy to not comment on rumors or speculation in the marketplace. Also, in order to provide more people with a chance to ask their questions, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up. Please note that we have posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information in our prepared remarks, as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Our Form 10-Q will be filed this afternoon and that too will be available on our website. I do have one quick reminder. Our annual Analyst Day is scheduled for Tuesday, December 12 in New York City. During it, you'll have the opportunity to hear from several members of our senior management team, who will provide a comprehensive update of our strategies for driving long-term growth as well as our 2018 guidance. For those unable to attend, the meeting will be webcast. Again, that's Tuesday, December 12. Additionally, during this presentation, we will make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views related to our future financial performance, future events, and industry and market conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what may be indicated in the forward-looking statements. We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these specific risks and uncertainties, in particular those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and the cautionary statement disclosures in our Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings press release. During this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being webcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for one year. Now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Starting with our third quarter results, total company revenues increased 3.5%, at the midpoint of our guidance range. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.50, at the high-end of our guidance, despite the impact from the devastating hurricanes that swept through Texas, Louisiana, Florida and Puerto Rico. And I'll have more on that in just a few minutes. On an adjusted basis, operating profit was down 13.1%, within expectations, reflecting performance in the PBM business that was in line with expectations, along with performance in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment that was below expectations due to the hurricanes. We generated approximately $2.4 billion of free cash during the quarter and $7 billion year to date. Now, given our year-to-date performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range and raising the midpoint. We currently expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for 2017 of $5.87 to $5.91, reflecting year-over-year growth of 0.5% to 1.25%, and that compares to our previous range of $5.83 to $5.93. And Dave will discuss the details of both our results and guidance in more detail in his remarks. Now, before turning to the business update, I want to provide some color on the hurricanes, not only in regard to the financial impact to our business, but also in regard to the recovery efforts. The considerable damage these storms left in their paths cannot be understated, and our stores and colleagues were not immune to this destruction. In total, about 925 of our stores were closed for some period of time, and today, 11 remain closed. And we estimate that the financial impact is approximately $55 million, which are costs primarily to cover insurance deductibles. Now, as a vital part of these communities, we played roles both in advance of the storms and afterwards to aid recovery efforts. Our proprietary messaging platform enabled rapid and urgent communications to patients who were in the hurricanes' paths, and this helped ensure delivery of specialty and other medications for patients in transition between their homes and safe shelter locations. Additionally, more than $10 million in cash, products and supplies has been raised and donated to support the impacted communities, and we are incredibly grateful to our colleagues who, while dealing with their own personal challenges, made extraordinary efforts in helping and aiding our customers. The rebuilding process for many of these communities will take a long time, and we'll continue to do our part in providing support. Now, turning to the business update, and I'll start with PBM. As you're all aware, we signed a five-year agreement with Anthem to provide services to support their new PBM, IngenioRx, beginning in January 2020. As part of the agreement, we'll manage certain services for IngenioRx, including claims processing and prescription fulfillment through our mail order and specialty pharmacies. These services will be private labeled to IngenioRx in order to ensure a seamless experience for Anthem members. And through this relationship, Anthem will have the ability to grow their business and enhance their value proposition, as we help them improve their financial performance, execute operationally and optimize IngenioRx's control of critical PBM functions. Additionally, Anthem is very focused on improving patient health outcomes and will be relying on our expertise in patient messaging and engagement at the point-of-sale through our multiple patient touch points to support IngenioRx in this goal. So, we're very excited about this new relationship, and we look forward to starting the implementation and to working with Anthem to provide services to help ensure coordinated holistic care for their members. Combined with our continuing success in winning new business, we believe that this contract is further validation of the important role that CVS Health's integrated and innovative pharmacy care model plays in today's healthcare system. Now, as for the 2018 selling season, we've continued to make good progress. With another $600 million in new wins, we currently have gross wins of approximately $6 billion and net new business of $2.3 billion. As I said last quarter, these new business numbers include the previously announced loss of the FEP specialty contract, but do not include any impact from our individual Med D PDP, which I'll touch on shortly. To-date, we've completed more than 90% of our client renewals for 2018, and that's roughly in line with where we were at this point last year, and our retention rate stands at about 97%. Additionally, we recently announced the new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network that will be anchored by CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens, along with up to 10,000 community-based independently-owned pharmacies. The network is designed not only to deliver unit cost savings, but also to improve clinical outcomes that will help lower overall healthcare costs for clients and their members. This network is an innovative solution that utilizes a value-based management approach in order to achieve improved outcomes through adherence for five high-impact, highly-utilized drug classes. It also helps to provide cost savings through formulary compliance. So, we're excited to make this available to our clients for implementation beginning in March of next year, and we look forward to improving overall health and wellness, while lowering cost for patients and payers. Turning to our specialty business, revenue growth in the quarter was 10.6%, and the slowdown in revenue growth compared to prior years is being driven by several factors. First, we are seeing lower levels of inflation on specialty drugs, consistent with the marketplace. Second, we're seeing an increase in generic dispensing within specialty, which as you know is a drag on the top line, but a benefit to margin. And lastly, the mix of drugs within our book is shifting towards lower-priced therapies as well as fewer hep C scripts. And despite these top line pressures, overall growth in specialty pharmacy remains strong and our specialty business continues to expand and gain share. Before turning to Retail, let me touch briefly on SilverScript, our Med D PDP. As we reported last quarter, SilverScript qualified in 32 of the 34 regions, which enables us to retain all of the auto-assignees we currently serve, and importantly, receive new auto-assignees in all 32 regions. The 2018 annual enrollment period is currently underway, and for enrollees, we have worked to reduce premiums for the majority of SilverScript plans across the country, providing plan beneficiaries continued access to a $0-deductible for drugs on all tiers. I'm also pleased to note that, for the third consecutive year, SilverScript achieved a 4-star performance rating from CMS for 2018, surpassing industry standards in delivering value, clinical outcomes and customer service. And of the Med D lives under Caremark management, 83% achieved a 4 or a 5-star rating, which speaks to the outstanding value we deliver for our health plan clients. Now, moving on to third quarter results in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, total same-store sales decreased 3.2%, slightly better than expectations, with pharmacy same-store sales down 3.4%. Pharmacy sales comps were negatively impacted by approximately 435 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Same-store prescription volumes increased 0.3% on a 30-day equivalent basis, slightly ahead of expectations, and the decisions to restrict CVS Pharmacy from participating in the TRICARE and fully-insured prime networks continued to negatively impact pharmacy sales and script comps. The network changes had about a 420 basis point negative impact on volumes. And when adjusting for the network changes, same-store prescription volumes would have been up 4.5% in the quarter, again, on a 30-day equivalent basis. Now, as we look to return to healthy growth, we continue to be very focused on partnering with all payers to drive volumes and capture share, and our partnerships with Optum, Cigna and Express Scripts have seen some uptake from clients and the pipeline of additional opportunities in the coming years remains promising. Additionally, CVS Pharmacy will be preferred in several more Med D networks for the 2018 plan year, and these include the SilverScript Choice plan as well as the preferred networks for Aetna/First Health and WellCare. And we believe that being preferred in these networks will help us to further drive prescription volume in the growing Med D market. Now, turning to the front store, comps decreased 2.8%, sequentially in line with Q2 comps after adjusting for the Easter shift, and as it's been the case this year, the decline in front store comps reflects a number of factors, including our decision to rationalize our promotional strategies by scaling back on mass promotions and reducing our circular page count. Softer customer traffic was partially offset by the continued increase in the average front store customer basket. Our personalization and promotional strategies have been successfully contributing to growth in front store profitability, as has our growth in store brands. Our store brands represented 23.2% of front store sales in the quarter, and that's up about 25 basis points from a year ago, and it remains an area of strength and opportunity. As a result of all of these factors, front store gross margin once again improved in the quarter versus last year, despite the decline in front store comps. Now, before I turn it over to Dave, I would like to say a word about a critical crisis in American healthcare, and that's the alarming and heartbreaking opioid epidemic. As you know, in September, we announced an expansion of our enterprise-wide initiatives to fight the epidemic, leveraging the national presence of CVS Pharmacy with the capabilities of CVS Caremark. With this expansion, we are further strengthening our commitment to help providers and patients balance the need for these powerful medications with the risk of abuse and misuse. Over the past few years, we've been focused on prevention, collection and partnership, and as a result, we've collected and safely disposed of more than 100 metric tons of unwanted medications. We've also worked with 43 states to expand access without a prescription to the opioid overdose-reversal drug, naloxone, to help save lives and give people a chance to get the help they need for recovery. And through our Pharmacists Teach program that connects CVS pharmacists with schools in their local communities, we have educated nearly 300,000 students on the dangers of prescription drug abuse. However, there's more that needs to be done. And as a leading provider of pharmacy care, we believe it is time to institute limits on the quantity of opioids dispensed to patients who are receiving an opioid for the first time in the treatment of acute injuries and to ensure that the prescription fits the medical condition. So utilizing our retail pharmacies and our PBM services, we will work with physicians, patients, plan sponsors, and other stakeholders to limit the supply of opioids dispensed for certain acute prescriptions to seven days while continuing to ensure patients with critical needs have access to appropriate care. And with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review. David M. Denton: Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. First, as I typically do, I'd like to begin by highlighting how our disciplined approach to capital allocation continues to enhance shareholder value. I'll follow that discussion with a detailed review of our third quarter results, and then discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2017. As it relates to our capital allocation program, let's begin with our dividend payout. We paid $511 million in dividends in the third quarter and $1.5 billion year to date. Our dividend payout ratio stands at approximately 39.6% over the trailing four quarters, which includes the impact of the non-GAAP items in both years. Excluding these non-GAAP items, we remain well on our way to our target of 35% by the end of 2018. During the third quarter, we've repurchased approximately 5 million shares for $400 million. Year to date, we've repurchased approximately 55 million shares for approximately $4.4 billion or $78.68 per share. For the full year, our guidance includes the completion of $5 billion of share repurchases, reflecting an increase of approximately 11% versus last year. So again, between dividends and share repurchases, we've returned nearly $6 billion to our shareholders in the first nine months of 2017, and we expect to return more than $7 billion for the full year once the repurchases are complete. As Larry mentioned, we have generated nearly $7 billion of free cash in the first nine months of the year. The strong year-to-date performance is abnormally high due to the build-up of a payable for CMS associated with the current Medicare Part D plan year as well as the timing of receipts. In Q4, we are expecting negative free cash flow for the first time in a long time, as we plan to settle the CMS payable associated with the 2016 plan year that was built up last year. Given this, we are maintaining our prior guidance for the full year and continue to expect to produce free cash of between $6 billion and $6.4 billion in 2017. Now turning to the income statement, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.50 per share, at the high end of our guidance range. These results are on a comparable basis, and the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted earnings per share can be found in the press release as well as in the Investor Relations portion of our website. As Larry noted, the PBM segment delivered profit within our expectations while the Retail/Long-Term Care segment's profit declined more than expected, primarily driven by the effects of the recent hurricanes. Excluding the impact of the hurricanes, Retail/Long-Term Care's profit was within our expectations. Our effective tax rate beat our forecast, allowing us to deliver adjusted earnings per share at the high end of our guidance. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.26 per share, above our expectations, with the negative impact of the hurricanes offset by the lower than expected loss on the settlement of the defined benefit pension plan as well as the better tax rate. Let me quickly walk down the P&L to provide some additional color. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the third quarter increased 3.5% to $46.2 billion. In the PBM segment, revenues increased 8.1% to $32.9 billion. PBM growth in the quarter was 40 basis points below the low end of the guidance range. This was primarily driven by lower than expected volumes. The year-over-year growth was driven largely by increases in the pharmacy network claims, brand inflation, and growth in specialty pharmacy. Partially offsetting this growth was an approximate 100 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate versus the same quarter of LY to 87%. In our Retail/Long-Term Care business, revenues decreased 2.7% in the quarter to $19.6 billion, beating our expectations. This was driven primarily by stronger than expected pharmacy same-store sales and script growth, despite the network changes we've been discussing. Retail/Long-Term Care's generic dispensing rate increased approximately 140 basis points to 87.2%. Turning to gross margin, operating expenses, operating profit, and the tax rate, the numbers that I'll cite reflect non-GAAP adjustments in both current and prior periods when applicable, which have been reconciled on our website. Keep in mind that our guidance for the third quarter also reflected these adjustments. The consolidated company gross margin was 15.4% in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 135 basis points compared to Q3 of 2016. In addition to each segment's performance, the decline is due in part to a mix shift in our business, as the lower-margin PBM business continues to grow faster than our Retail/Long-Term Care business. Gross profit dollars decreased 4.9% versus the same quarter of last year, primarily due to the loss of scripts in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment from the network changes we have previously discussed, as well as the continued pricing and reimbursement pressures across the enterprise. Within the PBM segment, gross margin declined 90 basis points from Q3 of 2016 to 5%. This was primarily driven by the ongoing timing of profits within Medicare Part D operations, as members worked through their benefits more slowly this year versus last year. This was primarily offset with the improvement in GDR as well as favorable purchasing economics. Gross profit dollars were down 8.4%, also primarily due to the shift in the timing of Medicare Part D profits into the fourth quarter. Gross margin in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment was 29%, down approximately 25 basis points from last year. The decline in gross margin rate was primarily driven by lower reimbursement rates that continued to pressure pharmacy margins. This pressure was partially offset by an increasing generic dispensing rate as well as the increased front store margin that Larry mentioned earlier. Gross profit dollars decreased 3.6% year over year, mainly due to the loss of scripts from the network changes as well as the continued reimbursement pressures. Consolidated operating expenses as a percent of revenues improved approximately 35 basis points to 10% compared to Q3 of 2016, primarily driven by expense leverage from the PBM's growth in revenues during the quarter. We saw a consolidated operating profit decline which was consistent with our expectations. Operating margin for the total enterprise declined by 105 basis points in the quarter to 5.4%. Operating margin at PBM declined approximately 70 basis points to 4.1%, while operating margin in Retail/Long-Term Care declined by approximately 110 basis points to 8% on an adjusted basis. For the quarter, operating profit for the PBM was within expectations, while operating profit for Retail/Long-Term Care was less than expected. The PBM segment posted an operating profit decline of 7.2%, reflecting the shift in Medicare Part D profits to Q4 of this year compared to 2016. If the Medicare PDP business was excluded from all periods, PBM year-over-year growth in Q3 was more in line with the growth that we saw in Q2, as I've mentioned last quarter, and we expect a similar cadence in Q4. The Retail/Long-Term Care segment posted an operating profit decline of 14.3%, which includes the impact of the recent hurricanes. Excluding the hurricane costs, the operating profit decline for Retail/Long-Term Care would have been within our expectations. Now, going below the line in the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter decreased approximately $8 million from last year to $245 million, due primarily to paying down debt in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a lower average interest rate on the debt that remains outstanding. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 37.9%, which was better than expected. This was driven in part by the delta between our estimate of the discrete tax benefits we'd see from share-based payment accounting and what we actually experienced during the quarter. As we discussed in prior earnings call, the increased tax rate volatility is caused by changes in both share price and the discretionary actions of employees that can exercise vested options. Our weighted average share count was just over 1 billion shares, in line with our expectations. So with that, let me now turn to our 2017 guidance, and I'll start with our revised guidance for this year. We currently expect to achieve adjusted EPS for 2017 of $5.87 to $5.91, reflecting year-over-year growth of 0.5% to up 1.25%, while narrowing the previous range of $5.83 to $5.93, we've also raised the midpoint by $0.01 per share. This takes into account the third quarter results at the top of expectations despite the impact of the hurricanes as well as favorability in the tax rate for the remainder of this year. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.98 to $5.02, and includes the lower than anticipated defined benefit pension plan settlements. You can find a reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted EPS in our press release and on the Investor Relations portion of our website. Now with only a few months left in the year, we are updating our revenue and operating profit guidance to better reflect our current expectations. In the PBM segment, we are lowering the top end of the revenue guidance to a range of 8% to 8.5%, reflecting lower drug price inflation and slightly lower claims growth of 1.77 billion to 1.79 billion claims. In the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we are narrowing and raising guidance for revenues due to higher script volume expectations. We now expect Retail/Long-Term Care revenues to decline 2.25% to 2.75%, total comps to decline 2.75% to 3.25% and script comps of flat to up 0.25%. These changes result in a narrowing of our consolidated net revenue growth range to 3.25% to 3.75%. Turning to operating profit. We are narrowing the PBM's operating profit guidance range to 6% to 6.5%, to better reflect current volume expectations and changes in the drug mix. We are lowering the Retail/Long-Term Care operating profit guidance range to down 9.5% to 10.25% to reflect the impact of the hurricanes. Taking these changes into account, we'd lower the top end of the consolidated operating profit guidance range and now expect operating profit to decrease 5% to 5.75%. This change in operating profit was offset by the improved outlook on the effective tax rate for the full year 2017, allowing us to take the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range up by $0.01. Before moving to the fourth quarter guidance, let me quickly remind you of the timing factor affecting Q3, Q4 profit cadence. In 2017, we are seeing Medicare Part D members move more slowly through their benefits that we did in 2016. As I said earlier, this negatively affected Q3 profitability in 2017, we expect it to positively affect Q4. So on the fourth quarter, excluding certain non-GAAP items described on our website, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.88 to $1.92, up 10% to 12.5% from Q4 of 2016. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $1.75 per share to $1.79 per share. You can find the details of guidance in the slides that we posted online before this call, but let me take a moment to point out a few items. For the fourth quarter, we expect enterprise revenues to be up 2.5% to 4.25%, driven primarily by PBM growth. Total same-store sales at retail are expected to be down 1% to 2.75%, and adjusted script comps are expected to increase by 1% to 2%. Additionally, enterprise operating profit is expected to grow by 5.75% to 8%, again, driven primarily by PBM growth and the shift in timing of Medicare Part D profitability. And as Mike said, we'll provide 2018 guidance at our Analyst Day in December. Our results in the third quarter and our expectations for the remainder of this year are evidence of our ability to execute on the plans that we've provided earlier this year. We are committed to returning to healthy earnings growth and continuing to drive shareholder value. The steps we have taken over the past year position us well for the opportunities that lie ahead in the healthcare marketplace. We continue to work diligently towards the long-term targets that we provided at last year's Analyst Day. And with that, I will now turn it back over to Larry Merlo. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thanks, Dave, and before we move into the Q&A, I do want to spend a few minutes talking about the evolving consumer expectations and what that may mean in being a convenient and affordable pharmacy destination. We have always been focused on making pharmacy and everyday healthcare better for patients. It has been and continues to be, for us, a point of differentiation. At the same time, we know there's more to be done. In terms of convenience, consumers want their medications on their schedules, and we've built a comprehensive network to serve those patients with a combination of 9,700 retail pharmacies in local communities all across the country and sophisticated mail order facilities, all of this powered by more than 30,000 clinical professionals. Our mail order services provide a convenience that meets the needs of certain patients on maintenance medications. However, some patients prefer to get their medications immediately. And for this group, there's no faster way than by walking into a CVS Pharmacy. Our pharmacists are readily available to provide counseling, answer questions and get a prescription in a patient's hands in 15 minutes. It's also important to remember that one in five prescriptions have some type of clinical intervention that requires pharmacists' involvement. And with that in mind, despite the complexity and variation of regulations across all states, we built streamline connections utilizing both people and technology with insurance companies PBMs and providers to significantly and safely reduce the amount of time consumers have to wait for these issues to be resolved. But there are also those with an immediate need who are unable to make it to a CVS either because of time transportation or mobility issues. And today, we are announcing that starting next year we will bring the pharmacy to our patients' doorsteps, with nationwide next-day delivery from our stores. And in select metro areas, we will even offer same-day delivery. Additionally, we're also announcing that we will offer free same-day delivery for pharmacy and a curated selection of front store products in Manhattan starting on December 4. And with nearly 70% of the U.S. population living within 3 miles of one of our stores, CVS Pharmacy is the most convenient choice for delivery to your doorstep. We also recognize that medication costs are a concern for all patients. And it's important to know that more than 50% of the prescriptions we fill in our stores cost patients $4 or less and 75% of those prescriptions cost patients $10 or less. We use our deep connections with PBMs and insurance providers to help patients maximize their insurance benefit using our clinical expertise to find the lowest cost therapeutically equivalent option on their plans. And we are investing in tools to make it easier for patients to navigate the confusing healthcare market and improve the understanding of their benefit designs. And we apply manufacturer coupons to help further reduce the cost. On average, our patients are realizing $55 in savings on each prescription that is coupon-eligible. In addition, we aggressively source generic alternatives for consumers and use our scale to make care more affordable as we did with Adrenaclick, a lower-cost alternative to EpiPen. We also continue to invest in our digital properties, including our highly rated retail mobile app. It helps patients manage when and how they want to receive their medications, set reminders and manage medications for their families all in one place. And to-date, the CVS Pharmacy app has been downloaded more than 21 million times. At the same time, we currently have 50 million people enrolled in our text message program which enables them to easily refill their prescriptions through their mobile devices and it's as simple as typing yes when prompted. So I think you can see we have a solid foundation that's been built on compelling scale, unsurpassed reach and extensive pharmacy expertise. And we have a plan for how to do even more to make pharmacy an everyday healthcare even better. And we look forward to sharing this in more detail with you at our December 12th Analyst Day. So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mohan Naidu with Oppenheimer. Please proceed. Mohan Naidu : Thanks for taking my questions. Larry, can you comment a little bit on what do you think of vertical integration to leverage your physical store location that can possibly influence the plan design in such a way that you can actually use the stores to deliver more care? Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: Yes, Mohan, we have always been very thoughtful in terms of how we can improve access, okay, and at the same time, ensure that the care that we're providing meets our quality standards. And you put those two together, okay, it results in improving outcomes and lowering cost. And I think we've demonstrated capabilities of doing that, whether it's the role it MinuteClinic plays or the role that home infusion plays. And it's something that we continue to evaluate and something that's always on our radar screen for evaluating and deciding what's next. Mohan Naidu : Just to follow-up on that, around the MinuteClinic, do you have any immediate plans to add more services than what you do right now? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Mohan, we have been \u2013 I think you've seen over the last couple of years where we have added services. And we have in partnership with some of the health system affiliations that we have. We have begun to triage patients, where we are actively managing patients who have been diagnosed with some type of chronic care condition, in an effort to ensure that they're following their regimens of care, in an effort to keep them healthy. Mohan Naidu : Thanks, Larry. Larry J. Merlo: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with RBC. Please proceed. George Hill : Yeah. Good morning. Thanks guys for taking the question. I'm going to follow-up on Mohan's question, Larry, a little bit, and there's obviously been a lot of talk about vertical integration. Can you talk about what you've seen in your non-pharmacy businesses as it relates to beneficiary steerage where you partner with payers? I'm sure you see the claims information for people who walk into MinuteClinics or who use the home infusion business. I guess, from plans that you are more tightly aligned with, versus plans that you are tightly aligned with. And I guess, there's a lot of us sit here and think about the vertical integration story that plays out in the market. I guess, could you just walk through how you've seen between different partnerships and different segments in the book of business, how much the beneficiary steerage capability kind of enhances the offering? Larry J. Merlo: Look, George, listen, I'll start and I'm sure others will jump in. But when you refer to steerage, we think about the role that plan design plays, okay. And if you look at MinuteClinic as an example, that's an offering that's available to our PBM clients, okay. And there are many examples out there where as you look at overall healthcare costs adjusted for age and health status, you see overall healthcare savings anywhere from 8% to 12% lower. And in some respects, it's a simple as some of the treatment and visits migrating out of the emergency room and into the retail clinics. I think one of the other elements that we focus on is how does site of care become a variable, recognizing that there is a cost delta when you look at where that care is being administered. So if you jump over to infusion, we know that providing that care in the home versus in an ambulatory infusion site or perhaps in an outpatient segment of the hospital, there is a pretty dramatic cost differential there. And so I think we have been able to demonstrate that our local presence, the fact that that can lead to direct engagement with customers and patients and as a result, produce better outcomes at a reduced cost. David M. Denton: Hey, George, it's Dave here. I'd just add to that. If you think about moving members into one of our channels because we now touch many elements of healthcare given all the assets that we have, when those members move in our channel, typically what we have been able to prove quantitatively is we deliver better outcomes in totality to those members. So there's an incentive to do that, number one, just from an outcomes perspective. And then secondly, it's not always about care delivery in the MinuteClinics, it's really about patient engagement. And to the degree that we engage with those patients, we can educate them on where is the best site of care or how best can they engage in the healthcare system at the most cost-effective point of entry. I think those two components really demonstrate our ability to improve outcomes and engage with that member to advance their journey on improving their healthcare. Jonathan C. Roberts: Hey, George, this is Jon. The only other thing I would add is that we see our clients offering an X or a range of plan designs that allow us to move patients into our channel. So one can simply be access to the patient where we explain to them that they don't need to go to the hospital for infusion, but they can actually get it done at home. And so we see a lot of patients not even realizing they can do that, so that becomes an incentive. We see plans creating incentives to move them into one of our channels, which is \u2013 Larry talked about that with MinuteClinic and the reduction of copays. And finally, there's the actual narrowing of the networks which we'll see for both Coram and some of our other assets. George Hill : That's super-helpful. And I guess for my quick follow-up, either Larry or Dave, I think we're scratching our heads a little bit on what I would call the macro Rx softness. If you guys were trying to pick one driver to attribute to it, is it benefit design, is it copay design, is it payer mix, are you seeing an uptick in abandonment? I'm just intrigued that volumes across the space continue to be pretty soft. Larry J. Merlo: George, we're not seeing anything that would tell us that patients are not taking their prescriptions as prescribed. And I think if you look in the quarter, we've talked a little bit about the hurricanes, and I think that was tremendously disruptive because you see boluses of activity leading up. During the peak periods, you certainly see some unevenness in volume. And I would say that as you look at the seasonal related scripts, people are getting their flu shots, but we're certainly not seeing any incidence of the cold and flu season at this point in time. So that may be contributing a little bit to some of what we're seeing currently. George Hill : Okay, I appreciate the color. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Please proceed. James Auh : Hi, this is James on for Charles. Same-store sales this quarter were better than expected despite the hurricane. Can you give us some insight into what drove that performance? David M. Denton: Hey, James, this is Dave. I think what we've continued to do is, I'll say, rationalize our promotional spend across the channel. And I think what's important as you look at same-store sales, it's probably more important to look at the gross profit yield on those. You're seeing our gross profit, certainly in the front, continue to improve on a sequential basis and a year-over-year basis. And naturally the focus that we have. I would say, we were slightly better than expected, but I don't think our performance was out of line any major respects. James Auh : Okay, great. And also, it seems like the uptake on the PBM side for Part D is more in 4Q compared to last year. Could you just explain why the shift in timing compared to last year? David M. Denton: So mostly this was driven by the rate of beneficiaries using their Medicare Part D policy. And so they're moving through that benefit this year more slowly than what they moved through last year. And as you know, as the insurance company hits certain reinsurance corridors, the insurance company either earns, I'll say, higher profits during that period or actually can even be in a loss position during the timing. Given that cadence of beneficiary utilization, profits this year are being shifted out of Q3 and into Q4. And so we have very good line of sight to that. Jonathan C. Roberts: And this is Jon. Just to add a couple more specifics, so the initial coverage limit was raised this year by $400, so that means members got to the donut hole a little slower. And then we're seeing less inflation. So I think those two factors is exactly what's causing what Dave explained. James Auh : Okay, great. Thank you. David M. Denton: Thank you. Jonathan C. Roberts: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Lisa C. Gill: Thanks very much and good morning. Larry, I just want to talk about the business model. And listening to what you had to say earlier of being paid for better outcomes, Dave talking about patient engagement, education getting paid around that, how do you get paid? Do you have to own the vertical integration to truly be paid for that, or do you see a shift in the model where you start to take more risk like you do with other risk products, where the dollar amount that you're paid is based on some outcome or your pharmacist is getting paid for that incremental patient engagement, or is it just simply the script versus the MinuteClinic visit? Larry J. Merlo: Lisa, it's Larry. Listen, when you think about our business model, you think about the fact that over several years now, we've assembled a series of assets that create countless touch points with which we can engage with the patient, with the consumer, in an effort not just to improve access to care, but create better outcomes, and in doing so, reduce costs. So from an economics point of view, if we're not providing that fulfillment, then there's not an opportunity to do those other things. So we benefit from that share of going through one of our distribution channels. I think you've heard us begin to talk about the next evolution of that, taking elements of risk, and Jon can touch on the Transform Care programs, which we're in the process of marketing, at least beginning with diabetes and going from there. Jonathan C. Roberts: And I'll use diabetes as an example. It continues to be a trend driver for plan sponsors, and that's both on the pharmacy side and medical side with 30 million people with diabetes. And so our Transform Care Diabetes program delivers on the objectives of lowering drug costs plus lowering overall healthcare cost. And so, we combine a managed formulary with our diabetes network to control cost and guarantee a year-over-year diabetes trend of 10% or less, and that really depends on the clients mix. And then, for patients, we provide clinical support through diabetes coaching, pharmacist counseling, MinuteClinic monitoring, as well as digital solutions like a connected glucometer to help patients better manage their condition. So, that's an example where payers are willing to move those members into our channel. We get value there, and we're delivering unit cost savings on the drug as well as lower overall healthcare cost. Lisa C. Gill: Okay, that's helpful. And then, just as a follow-up, Larry, your comments around CVS Health value proposition sounds like it's really geared towards all of the talk around Amazon and why CVS is well positioned even in the face of potentially Amazon coming into this market. Is there anything that you think you could do better or how do you think about the Amazon's threat as it pertains to CVS? Larry J. Merlo: Lisa, listen, I'll start and maybe I'll ask Helena to jump in as well. But your \u2013 in our organization and in our culture, we're never done, okay. So, we're always listening to our customers, and I think being good listeners helps us understand where they have friction points that we need to work to eliminate. So, we think we do a good job, we think we've got a lot of ways in which we can serve the customer, and we're always looking for ways in which we can do that better. Helena B. Foulkes: Yeah. I would agree. I think, Lisa, what we spend a lot of time talking about is serving the customer wherever, whenever and however she wants. And as Larry said earlier, getting a prescription in 15 minutes or less is super convenient, but we wanted to add on to that. And so, that's why you see us announcing what we did today. But we're also doing even more just to make the in-store experience great, adding clinical programs. So, we keep pushing ourselves very hard to solve the customer pain points. Lisa C. Gill: Okay, great. Thanks so much. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Lisa. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Robert Patrick Jones : Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just to follow-up on some of the announcements with the next-day delivery for all products and same-day for some, is there anything you can share as far as what you would expect the potential impact to be from this from a same-store basis and how it might impact the front-end? I know it's early, but just curious if this \u2013 you guys see this as potentially a needle-mover on either of those fronts. And then, any costs you would highlight that would be needed to accomplish these accelerated timelines? Helena B. Foulkes: Sure, let me just start by saying that we have had 1,600 stores who've been doing home delivery for a long time. And part of what we did is we've really looked at that experience and said, how do we make it even better there. It's still fairly small there even in those stores, and I would say that's because ultimately, we think the best experience for the consumer is one where she can toggle back and forth and decide, some days she wants to come into the stores, and some days she just can't get out of the house and we need her to do it \u2013 we need to get those prescriptions to her. So, whether it's our drive-through locations, it's our Curbside Pickup, we've been actively involved with Instacart, which we're now delivering from 2,800 stores. We're pushing the envelope on basically serving the patient wherever she is. And so, it's too soon to know exactly what the impact will be. But we do know it's this holistic experience that the consumer is looking for, and I think we've got a set of experiences that gives us confidence this is an add-on to her holistic experience. In terms of the cost side of it, we do know that the cost per market can vary, but we've been able to use our scale to negotiate a low-cost competitive option that we think consumers will be willing to pay for, both in same and next-day delivery. And we've been piloting, as I said, different options, so we have a good sense for the elasticity and price. But we'll also be looking at options where maybe there will be free delivery with a purchase of some front store items. So we think it's that holistic review again of wherever, whenever and however she wants. Robert Patrick Jones : Got it. And I guess just a quick follow-up. The last two years, you guys used 3Q as an opportunity to give a preliminary outlook for the following year. I think in both cases, it seemed that the Street maybe was a little bit ahead of where that initial guide came out. This year, I'm assuming we'll have to wait till December for guidance. But could you share maybe the major swing factors that we should be thinking about as we look out into 2018 on a year-over-year basis? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Bob, it's Larry. Maybe I'll start and Dave will jump in. And Bob, just for \u2013 our goal has always been to provide guidance for the following year in December at our Analyst Day. And as you heard from both Mike and Dave, that's what we'll be doing next month, and you shouldn't read anything into that. In terms of what you would think about as, I'll say, headwinds, tailwinds for 2018, I'll start with some of the tailwinds. A lot of the network arrangements that we've been talking about, that certainly will drive Retail share next year. As you heard this morning, we've had another strong PBM selling season. And the enterprise streamlining initiative that we began earlier this year will be in year two and the savings will outweigh the costs. On the headwinds side, we've talked \u2013 we'll continue to see the reimbursement pricing pressures. And I think when you think about what are the offsets to that, obviously, generic introductions play a role in that. And at least at this point in time, we see 2018 contributing, but probably to a lesser extent than what we've seen the last couple of years. Robert Patrick Jones : Great, thanks for all that. I appreciate it. Larry J. Merlo: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed. John Heinbockel : So, Larry, I wanted to start with \u2013 you're obviously doing a lot of partnerships with competitors, maybe people you hadn't partnered with in the past. Maybe talk a little bit what's changed the last year or two, and you're doing it successfully, managing conflicts and then other natural limitations to working with those partners? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah. John, listen, I think that we have \u2013 the capabilities that we have created and the guiding principle of partnering with individuals or entities that as they grow, we grow, okay. I think that that has helped to create a real partnership where we can create a win-win scenario with that most important win being the clients and customers that we serve, okay. And so, we have \u2013 whether you're talking about health plans or \u2013 we've got relationships with more than 70 health plans, and we've talked a lot about how \u2013 in the Med D space, how we've created a compelling offering, where SilverScript can be a competitor in the market. But we can also support the Med D products for other health plans and how we've seen in the market that, through that relationship, they're growing faster than the overall market. And I think the opportunities that we continue to see for innovation, I think, gives us the comfort level that even on the Retail side, we can partner with \u2013 as you pointed out, with \u2013 in a differentiated way from perhaps how we've thought about that in the past. So, I think we're pleased with the capabilities that we're able to offer and the value that that can create in the marketplace. John Heinbockel : And then, just as a follow-up, one of those partnerships to a degree, I guess, is this performance-preferred plan with Walgreens. Where do you think that specific plan goes and more offerings like that go, correct? Because I think you probably agree that the two of you are probably the lowest cost providers out there. So, is this a way to get maybe one of the lowest-cost networks in the market? Larry J. Merlo: Well, John, let me start and then I'll flip it over to Jon. You've heard us say for a while now that the market has been focused on network constructs with CVS or Walgreens, pick one, okay? John Heinbockel : Yeah, yeah. Larry J. Merlo: And we've been talking about, as healthcare migrates to more value-based care or outcomes, that the market may not be thinking about it in the right way that the networks are not going to be based simply on unit costs. They're going to be based on unit cost and the ability to affect outcomes through clinical performance measures. So, at the end of the day, that's what this network is all about. Jonathan C. Roberts: And John, this is Jon. If you just think about diabetes, and we have all the pharmacies that are serving a client's diabetic members, working on adherence, and if they can lower the A1C by 1%, that actually saves $5,800 over the course of the year. So, the power of being able to lower overall healthcare cost, I think, really has been underappreciated by the market. And so, this network with \u2013 that we're calling high performance network with CVS, Walgreens and independents does deliver unit cost savings. But I think even more importantly, it delivers clinical outcomes. And part of the reimbursement to these pharmacies will be based on their ability to deliver clinical outcomes. So, we've selected providers that we believe have the best capability. And as I am out in the market talking to clients, we have not seen as much penetration in narrow networks as we historically have seen, because it was historically unit cost savings. But as we add this clinical component, we're seeing much more interest in moving down this path. John Heinbockel : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please proceed. Eric Percher : Thank you. So, maybe combining those questions around partnership and profit, it seems very clear that the relationships you've created have come based on clinical outcomes in part and that also we've seen a change in market pricing and there's that ability to deliver lower cost. How should we think about the impact next year? You spoke about reimbursement. Is there a change in the way that you've looked at the returns required in order to enter these contracts and any type of material impact for 2018 or even looking out further? What's the balance between partnership and profit? David M. Denton: Yeah. Hey, Eric, this is Dave. We can't give you a ton of color on that at this point in time. It'll be something we'll discuss at Analyst Day. I will say that our \u2013 that conceptually, intellectually how we've thought about this has not changed. Obviously, we underwrite each one of these \u2013 I'll say underwrite. We look financially at each one of these relationships and make sure that it's both good for the client, good for the member and good for us, both short-term and long-term. So, I think our approach to this is pretty disciplined. Eric Percher : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alvin Concepcion with Citi. Please proceed. Alvin Caezar Concepcion : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Generally, could you \u2013 just wondering if you could reach your vision of improving outcomes, creating a holistic experience, driving share to your distribution channels, can you do that with your current business? I know you've been doing more partnerships to improve those. But down the road, is it becoming harder to create a win-win scenario, as there's more encroachment on your PBM business, for example? And with that backdrop, do you view M&A as more of a necessity to accelerate that vision? David M. Denton: Hey, Alvin, this is Dave. I think our business model, as we think about how it stands today and we think about the evolving healthcare marketplace and landscape, I think we're very nicely positioned here. The assets that we've assembled really engage members and lower cost and provides a really robust access point into healthcare. And I think if you look for the next 3, 5, 10 years, those elements are really critical. So, we do like our business model. M&A and continuing to supplement our business model has always been at the core of our business, and we will continue to do that as we look forward. Alvin Caezar Concepcion : Great. And you've talked in the past about people migrating into retail out of mail. I'm wondering if you could elaborate more on that. Can you talk about what happens when a network that may have been very restrictive in favoring mail order allows a retail option, how sizable are those very restrictive networks, and what have you seen when people switch over? David M. Denton: Our experience is pretty complete in this area, because if you look at our book of business at Caremark when we've sold-in Maintenance Choice and given members now options to either utilize the mail channel or utilize the retail channel, within six months, we see about half of the volume move out of the mail channel into the retail channel. I think what's unique about our business model, and Helena touched upon this a bit, is we're creating a model here where the consumer doesn't necessarily have to choose consistently they're going to use mail or they're going to use retail. They're going to be able to pivot and choose what's best for them and engage with us what's best for them at that period of time. So I think this is a real differentiator in our business model going forward. Alvin Caezar Concepcion : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Hi. Can you hear me? Larry J. Merlo: Yes, we can. David M. Denton: Yes, we can hear you. Good morning. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Okay, great. Good morning. We have a new phone system here. So thank you for all the commentary. I want to follow up on the just Amazon question. You talk about the steps you're taking on the Retail side and really bringing pharma to your doorstep. But how should we think about an Amazon potential entry to the drug supply side from a PBM perspective? If you can, just talk about how you think about including Amazon in PBM networks or potentially partnering with them? We get a lot of questions on this topic. Larry J. Merlo: Ricky, it's Larry. When you look \u2013 when you think about partnering, you sit here and you ask the question. If somebody's able to do something that perhaps doesn't exist in the marketplace, we're certainly open to understanding and working with them in that regard. I think that you've heard this morning from us and quite frankly from others in terms of some of the \u2013 whether you're talking about capabilities or some of the challenges to entry that we're sitting here saying, there's a lot that we're doing today and there's more that can be done. So, you would never close the door on any type of partnership, but you have to look at what those capabilities may bring that aren't being met in the marketplace today. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Okay. And then a follow-up on what you're seeing for the 2018-2019 selling season just in terms of opportunities and mix between health plan, commercial, and government. David M. Denton: Hey, Ricky, this is Dave. That's probably something that we'll cover in more depth at Analyst Day. So I'm going to ask you to hold that question until then. We'll go through that in some detail. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Okay, thank you. David M. Denton: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo with Needham & Company. Please proceed. Kevin Caliendo : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I know it's preliminary, but have you done any analysis on the initial Republican tax plan and how it might impact CVS in the future? Larry J. Merlo: Kevin, it's Larry. We've talked a lot about tax, and the fact that our effective tax rate is over 39% or around there, that any type of meaningful comprehensive reform should be beneficial to our business. And we've got our folks going through the House version that was released last week. And listen, there will be a lot more to say about that in the coming days and weeks as it goes through Ways and Means and then the Senate weighs in. David M. Denton: Kevin, I just think at the end of the day, given our profile from being a really high taxpayer that most scenarios would have us benefiting at the end of the day. Kevin Caliendo : Understood that CVS is clearly positioned to be one of the beneficiaries. I'm just looking at some of the things that they're talking about in terms of deductions, maybe less so on interest and depreciation and more so on CapEx, is that in any way \u2013 looking at that, would you potentially change business practices, or are there ways to work through this that might be even more beneficial versus what the company is doing now? David M. Denton: It's probably too early to tell on that. I will say though that to the degree that we have relief, there's a lot of investments that we think we can make within our business model that can more rapidly expand our business model across the country and deliver better care and higher quality and lower cost. So we would look to take the benefit of that and invest it clearly. Kevin Caliendo : Great. Thanks, guys. David M. Denton: You're welcome. Larry J. Merlo: Nelson, we'll go ahead and take two more questions. Operator : Okay, thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Scott A. Mushkin: Hey, guys. A lot's been asked. I have just some odds and ends, so I was going to try to fire them off here a little bit. The partially reserved receivable, the relinquishment of that, Dave, what was that, and is that one-time on the cost side? David M. Denton: Yes, it is one-time. One of our states has a receivable that we've essentially factored, if you think about that one. Scott A. Mushkin: Okay, so that is one-time gain in the third quarter? David M. Denton: It is, it is. Scott A. Mushkin: Okay. And then, I know \u2013 this is a combination of questions here. So the clinics, you guys haven't really been adding that many, and I think the growth rate was up 0.7%. So I was wondering if you can give us some thoughts there on what's going on. I know it's a pretty small part of the business, but there's been talk about vertical integration on the call. And then the last one is your comfort level regarding leverage, and then I'll yield. Thanks. David M. Denton: Hey, Scott, it's Dave. A couple things, one is from a clinic perspective, we took a somewhat pause on expanding clinics geographically, only really due to two things. One is we wanted to make sure that we had the EPIC system fully up and running across our enterprise. We've done that. And two, as we purchased the clinics within the Target pharmacies, we want to make sure \u2013 the Target locations, we want to make sure that we're fully integrated from that perspective. We'll get back on a growth rate trajectory going forward. There's no doubt about that. And then from a leverage perspective, as you know, at this point in time, our balance sheet and our ratings are very important to us. We've been very focused on that. We've been very committed to managing that. At the moment, we're a bit, I'll say, over-levered in the sense of our target at 2.7 times. We hover around 3 times. Our objective, obviously, is to begin to delever over time, and we'll grow our way out of that over the next several periods. Scott A. Mushkin: Would you ever do a deal that made you subject to a downgrade? David M. Denton: It's actually a really big speculatory question. We would make the right investments in our business model to do what's best for us long term, and we would evaluate it on each transaction point at time. Scott A. Mushkin: And then, say, the size of that one-time charge, and then I'll definitely yield. Thanks, guys. David M. Denton: It's immaterial. Scott A. Mushkin: Perfect. Thank you. David M. Denton: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Please proceed. Priya Ohri-Gupta: Great. Thank you so much for squeezing me in. I guess, Dave, just picking up on that last question a little bit, in the past, you've talked about how important the high BBB rating is in the context of your access to the sale-leaseback market as well as the access to commercial paper market. If you were to think just more strategically around the flexibility you have within the BBB spectrum, would there be a willingness to trade off, say, Tier 2 commercial paper access for a short time if they gave you sort of greater access in the long-term debt markets? David M. Denton: We're not focused on that, Priya. We're focused on maintaining our high BBB rating, and that's consistent with our leverage targets that we've established at 2.7 times. So that's not what we're focusing on as of this point. Priya Ohri-Gupta: Okay, and then just a quick follow-up. Can you talk about how you've been funding your sale-leasebacks? It looks like you've been absent from the 144A market for a little bit. Have you been primarily using the private market? David M. Denton: We have \u2013 we've been a little low on the sale-leaseback offering at this point in time. Keep in mind that with the Target pharmacy acquisition, we kind of scaled back, if you will, our organic store development program just a tad. So, because of that business decision, the sale-leaseback offering has been relatively anemic. Priya Ohri-Gupta: All right, thank you so much. David M. Denton: You're welcome. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. So, just wrapping up, we appreciate everybody's time bright and early on a Monday morning. And if anyone has any follow-up items, Mike McGuire is available for that as well. So, thanks everyone and we'll see you next month. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Thursday, February 8, 2018. And now it's my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mike McGuire, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mike McGuire : Thank you, Malian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO, and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO, and Jon Roberts, Chief Operating Officer. Larry and Dave have some prepared remarks to share. After which, we'll open it up for the question-and-answer session. During the Q&A, please keep in mind that the focus of this call is on our earnings report and guidance and we won't be sharing incremental information related to our pending acquisition of Aetna. Also, in order to provide more people with a chance to ask their questions, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up. In addition to this call and our press release, we have posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information in our prepared remarks, as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Our Form 10-K will be filed later this month, and that, too, will be available on our website once filed. Please note that today's call is neither an offering of securities nor solicitation of a proxy vote in connection with our announced transaction with Aetna. The information discussed today is qualified in its entirety by the registration statement and joint proxy statement that CVS Health and Aetna has filed with the SEC in connection with our proposed transaction. The shareholders of CVS Health and Aetna are urged to read those filings carefully because they contain important information about the proposed transaction between CVS and Aetna. Additionally, during this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views related to our future financial performance, future events, and industry and market conditions and forward-looking statements related to the acquisition, including the expected consumer benefits, financial projections, synergy, financing and the timing for the completion of the transaction. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what may be indicated in the forward-looking statements. We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these specific risks and uncertainties, in particular those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and the cautionary statement disclosures and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings press release. During this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and the comparable GAAP measures and the associated reconciliation document we posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being webcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for one year. Now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo. Larry Merlo : Okay. Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We finished 2017 with strong results and the progress we've made against our 4-point plan provides a solid foundation for healthy growth as we begin 2018. In the fourth quarter, consolidated net revenues grew 5.3%, adjusted operating profit grew 5.7% and adjusted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.92. For the full year, consolidated net revenues increased 4.1%, with adjusted operating profit declining 5.8% and adjusted earnings per share increasing 1% to $5.90. Now in the quarter, operating profit in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment was better-than-expected, while operating profit in the PBM segment was in line with the expectations that we laid out on our January call. Additionally, we generated approximately $6.4 billion of free cash during the year. Now turning to the business update, and I'll start with the PBM and the 2018 selling season. Our gross-to-net client wins are slightly higher than on our third quarter call, and we currently have gross wins of approximately $6.2 billion, and net new business of $2.4 billion with a client retention rate of about 96.5%. Now keep in mind that these new business numbers exclude enrollment results from our SilverScript PDP, and I'll touch on that shortly. In addition, I'm pleased to say that during this year's welcome season, we continued our record of exceptional implementation. Client satisfaction continues to improve across all areas, with service levels reaching record performance. Beyond our core service elements, our support capabilities are aligned with the unique approaches of all of our customers across their pharmacy benefit, member and provider strategies. And we believe the investments we've made in quality, automation and client focus, are delivering measurable value to our clients year-after-year. Looking ahead, we have about $39 billion up for renewal in 2019, which when you exclude Med D, is nearly a third of our business. Now keep in mind that this figure includes the FEP retail and mail contracts, which we have already extended through the end of 2019. And while it's early in the selling season, we are making progress with our '19 renewals and have already renewed a high percentage of our health plan clients. As for new business prospects, again, it's early to gauge the full extent of our fee activities in the '19 selling season, but we don't see as much health plan opportunity as we've seen in past years. Our strong service history, our size, our scale and our unique suite of capabilities, provide the tools we need to be successful in retaining business and winning in the marketplace as opportunities arise. Now top of mind for clients are planned designs that effectively lower unit costs and overall health care costs, and that's pretty consistent with what we've seen in recent years. The most common designs to lower unit costs include plans with formularies that are focused on the highest value drugs and clinical programs such as our Transform Diabetes Care and Pharmacy Advisor programs are focused on lowering health care costs and are increasingly becoming a central part of our clients' benefit and health management strategies. In addition, specialty drug management continues to be highly emphasized in planned design elections and is expected to continue to be a focal point for the foreseeable future. Now growth in specialty pharmacy remained strong and our specialty business continues to expand and gain share. Now while specialty revenues grew 9.2% in the quarter, prescription increased by 14.5%, benefiting from new product introductions and increased access to limited distribution products. Our Medicare Part D business, SilverScript, wrapped up another a successful annual enrollment period, and we began the 2018 plan year with more than 6. 1 million captive PDP lives, which includes Eclipse [ph] and that's up about 11% from January of last year. Now when you add the non-captive Med D lives that we manage for our health plan clients, the total rises to 13. 3 million Med D lives under management. Now moving onto Q4 results in our Retail/Long-Term Care segment. Total same-store sales increased 0.1%, and that's more than 100 basis points better than expectations with pharmacy same-store sales up 0.4%. Our pharmacy sales comps were negatively impacted by approximately 340 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Our same-store prescription volumes increased 2.5% on a 30-day equivalent basis, roughly 50 basis points ahead of expectations. And as you're well aware, the flu season strengthened beginning in December, and we've continued to experience a strong flu season during the first several weeks of 2018. In the quarter, the negative impact from the decisions to restrict CVS Pharmacy from participating in the TRICARE and fully insured prime networks had about a 320 basis point negative impact on volumes. Now this is 100 basis points better than the impact on Q3 and a result of having comp the start of the TRICARE restriction at the beginning of December. Now despite this headwind, CVS Pharmacy gained market share in Q4, increasing our share of 30-day equivalent scripts dispensed by about 15 basis points. Now when you adjust for the network changes, same-store prescription volumes would have been up 5.7% in the fourth quarter, again, on a 30-day equivalent basis. Now turning to 2018. We'll return to healthy script growth, driven in part by our exciting new collaborations with Optum, Cigna and Express Scripts. Now as a part of growing trend toward consumer-directed care, our collaborations will help our patients get the most from their health plans, while improving their health. Additionally, we believe that by being preferred in more Med D networks, including SilverScript, Aetna and WellCare, we'll be able to further drive prescription volumes in the growing Med D market. Now turning to the front store, comps decreased 0.7% and a strong cough and cold season added about 80 basis points for the comp. After adjusting for this tailwind, the Q4 comp sequentially improved from prior quarters and has been the case all year, the decline in front store comps reflects a number of factors, including our decision to optimize our promotional strategies in certain ways such as by reducing our circular page count. Overall, our reduction in circular promotion in 2017 was a success, supported by the refinement of our industry-leading promotional analytics and processes. And moving into 2018, we expect to leverage these refined capabilities to drive both top and bottom-line growth. Our Store Brands represented 23.7% of front-store sales in the quarter, that's relatively flat to last year, and it remains an area of focus. There are a significant opportunities to expand our share of Store Brands by launching new products that build upon our core equities in health and beauty, while seeking opportunistic growth in other areas, where we can provide customers a good value. And as a result of our strengthened Store Brands, along with the success of our promotional strategies, front store gross margin, once again, improved in the quarter versus a year ago. So with that, let me flip it over to Dave for the financial review. Dave Denton : Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide a detailed review of our 2017 fourth quarter results and briefly touch on our 2018 guidance with a few updates from our call in January. First as I typically do, I'll begin with a review of last year's capital allocation program. For the full year of 2017, we generated $6.4 billion in free cash, delivering all of this cash back to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases despite the suspension of share buybacks during Q4. We paid $510 million in dividends in the fourth quarter and $2 billion during the full year of '17. Our dividend payout ratio currently stands at 30.9% over the trailing fourth quarters, retreating slightly due to the non-cash tax reform benefit we captured in net income during the fourth quarter. Now going forward, as we previously announced and due to the Aetna transaction, we are keeping dividends flat until we get back to a leverage ratio that is more in line with our credit ratings category. During the fourth quarter, we did not repurchase any shares. However, for all of 2017, we repurchased approximately 55 million shares for approximately $4.4 billion, averaging $78.68 per share. We ended this year with $13.9 billion left in authorization to repurchase our shares. And as with dividend increases, the share repurchases are suspended until our leverage ratio comes back in line. As expected, we saw an outflow of $642 million of free cash in the fourth quarter. This is largely driven by the settlement of the CMS payable associated with the 2016 plan year. For the full year of '17, we saw improvement in our cash cycle of more than 4 days. For the full year, our gross capital expenditure was approximately $1.9 billion, about $306 million lower in LY. This was primarily driven due to higher spending in '16 on the integration of both Omnicare and the Target acquisitions. With $265 million in proceeds from sale leasebacks, our net CapEx for the year was approximately $1.7 billion. So now turning to the income statement. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.92 per share in the fourth quarter, at the high end of our guidance range. Our effective tax rate was lowered than forecasted as there were several open items at year-end that resolved in our favor. None of them are individually significant and where appropriate, these items are factored into our outlook for 2018. As a reminder, these EPS results are on a comparable basis and the reconciliation of the GAAP to adjusted EPS can be found in the press release, as well as in the Investor Relations portion of our website. On an adjusted basis, the PBM segment delivered operating profit in line with our guidance from January, while the Retail/Long-Term Care segment profit came in slightly above the high end of guidance as we outperformed on script growth. GAAP diluted EPS was $3.22 per share in the fourth quarter, which is much better than our guidance. The outperformance was due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December, which reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and resulted in a reduction in our net deferred income tax liabilities. So with that, let me quickly walk down the P&L to provide some additional details. On a consolidated basis, revenues in fourth quarter increased 5.3% to $48. 4 billion. In the PBM segment, revenues increased 9.3% to $34.2 billion. PBM growth in the quarter was 150 basis points, above the high end of our guidance. The year-over-year growth was driven largely by an increase in pharmacy network and specialty pharmacy volumes, brand inflation and Medicare Part D revenues. Partially offsetting this growth was an approximate 80 basis points increase in our generic dispensing rates versus the same quarter of last year to 86.9%. PBM adjusted claims grew by 7.8% in the quarter, and we finished the year with 1.78 billion adjusted claims. In our Retail/Long-Term Care business, revenues increased 0.3% in the quarter to $20.9 billion, again, beating our expectation. This was driven primarily by stronger-than-expected pharmacy same-store sales and script growth, as well as better-than-expected volumes in the front store. The front store volume outperformance was due to a strong cough and cold season, as Larry mentioned. Offsetting the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, revenue growth was higher generic dispensing rate, which increased approximately 160 basis points to 86.8%. Turning to gross margin, operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate. The numbers I'm citing reflects non-GAAP adjustments in both the current and prior periods where applicable, which has been reconciled on our website. Keep in mind that our guidance for the fourth quarter also reflected these adjustments. The consolidated company gross margin was 16.3% in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 30 basis points compared to Q4 '16 and consistent with our expectations. The decline is due to a mixed shift in our business as our lower-margin PBM business continue to grow faster than our Retail/Long-Term Care business. Gross profit dollars increased 3.5% versus the same quarter of LY. Within the PBM segment, gross margin increased approximately 15 basis points from Q4 '16 to 5.4%. Gross profit dollars were up 11.9%, primarily due to the shift in timing of Medicare Part D profits from the third quarter into the fourth quarter versus '16, increased networking specialty volume and favorable purchasing economics. Partially offsetting these drivers was the impact of continued price compression in the marketplace. Gross margin in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment was up - was 30.0%, up approximately 25 basis points from LY. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily driven by favorability in front store margin and increased generic dispensing, partially offset by continued reimbursement pressures. The favorability in front store margin was driven by our continued optimization of our promotional strategies. Gross profit dollars increased by 1.1% year-over-year mainly due to strong front store margin and script growth, partially offset by the loss of scripts from the network changes that occurred at the end of 2016. Consolidated operating expenses as a percent of revenues improved approximately 30 basis points to 9.7% compared to Q4 '16. The PBM segment SG&A rate as a percent of sales was relatively flat year-over-year and in line with our expectations, while Retail/ Long-Term Care segment SG&A as a percent of sales increased slightly due to less leverage from revenue growth. Within the Corporate segment, expenses were $236 million, consistent with last year. We saw consolidated operating profit increased by 5. 7% for the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations. Operating margin for the total enterprise was flat to last year at 6.6%. Operating margin in the PBM increased approximately 15 basis points to 4.3%, while operating margin in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment declined approximately 10 basis points to 10.3% on an adjusted basis. We saw operating profits grow by 13.5% in the PBM segment, while we saw operating profit decline by 0.3% in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment. Going below the line on the consolidated income statement. Net interest expense in the quarter decreased $1.5 million from LY to $241 million. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 38.3% and 38.1% for the full year, which is a bit better than we expected. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was just over 1 billion shares, again, in line with our expectations. So with that, turning to our 2018 guidance. Let me first provide a couple reminders. Keep in mind that for guidance purposes only, we are assuming that the proposed Aetna transaction closes after the end of 2018. Also, all bridge financing fees, transaction and integration costs related to the deal are excluded from our adjusted figures. Now in January, we provide an outlook for the year, and remain comfortable that the estimates on these various elements that we provided. However, at that time, we do not factor any investment of the tax reform benefit into the operating profit guidance. Today, I'm updating our guidance only to reflect our plans for the investment of these benefits in 2018 and beyond. We currently estimate for the 2018 reduction in tax to yield $1.2 billion in cash benefits. As a result, we have a degree of financial flexibility that is unexpected and allows us to make some incremental high-value investments back into our business. And consistent with comments in January, we anticipate spending at least half the tax benefit on debt reduction in 2018. This supports our goal to return to a leverage ratio of 3.5 times within 2 years after the closing of the Aetna transaction and ultimately, to the low 3 times level longer term. In addition to debt reduction, there are 3 areas, in particular, which we will invest. First and foremost, we plan on making investments in our colleagues through increases in wages and benefits. We also plan on expanding our existing capabilities around data analytics and care management solutions. These investments in data analytics will improve our predictive power and further transform our processes with the goal of accelerating our abilities to improve outcomes and lower cost for our patients and the payers that we serve. And finally, we will make investment in our stores to pilot an enhanced service offerings, again, with the objective of lowering overall health care costs and improving the health of all the members that we serve. A portion of the spending in the stores and on these initiatives will be capitalized in the balance sheet and will not flow through operating expenses by the way. Given this plan, in 2018, we expect to invest at least $275 million in operating expenses in these new initiatives, predominantly in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment. When annualized, this is a run rate of at least $425 million of operating expenses. The lower tax rate is a recurring benefit to the business and investments we are making will also be recurring. So with $275 million of additional operating expenses, we now expect full year 2018 adjusted operating profit growth of down 1.5% to up 1.5%, with consolidated net revenue growth of 0.7% to 2.5%. For the segments, we expect adjusted operating profit growth in the PBM segment in the low to mid-single digits and in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we expect operating profit to be in the low - to be down in the low single digits. For the Retail segment, we continue to expect strong pharmacy same-store script growth of 6% to 7% as we benefit from broader relationships established in 2017 and our expanded participation as a preferred pharmacy in more Medicare Part D networks. We also continue to expect same-store sales growth at 2% to 3.5%, and revenue growth for the segment of 2.5% to 4%. The sale of RxCrossroads, that business creates a headwind of about 50 basis points on the retail segment's operating profit growth due to the absence of this business in 2018. For the PBM segment, we continue to expect between 1.91 billion and 1.93 billion adjusted claims, and revenues to grow between 1.5% and 3.5% in 2018. Within operating profits, benefits from the company's enterprise streamlining efforts will be offset by Anthem's implementation costs of approximately $150 million as we get ready to administer that contract beginning in 2020. The Anthem spend, which is a mix of both of capital and operating expenses, the Anthem's PBM operating profit growth by about 190 basis points. Going below the line, our interest expense is still expected to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.3 billion. That expectation includes net interest expense on an existing portfolio of roughly $1 billion, as well as bridge financing fees of $170 million to $205 million, $45 million below our prior estimates as a portion of those fees were booked in Q4 '17. The remainder is interest from new debt. Our effective tax rate is to be approximately 27% for 2018, consistent with what we said in January. So now, moving on to our Q1 '18 expectations. On the call in January, we see that Q1 was expected to be our lowest level of the year for enterprise operating profit growth, and that we expected operating profit in the Retail/ Long-Term Care segment to contract. With one month of the year behind us, we are expecting better result in Q1 due largely to the script utilization at retail. The exceptionally strong flu season across the country has had a major factor in this improved outlook. Given the strong performance, we now expect consolidated revenue growth of 1.5% to 3.25%, with consolidated adjusted operating profit growth of 0.5% to 4.5%. Within the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we expect revenue growth in the range of 4% to 5.5% and operating profit growth in the low to mid-single digits. Total same-store sales at retail are expected to be up 4% to 5.5% and adjusted script comps are expected to increase by 7% to 8.5%. Within the PBM segment, we expect revenue growth of 2% to 3.75% and operating profit growth to be flattish to up slightly. Finally, while we expect our net interest expense for the quarter to be in line with levels that we've seen recently on our existing portfolio of debt, keep in mind that if we end up leasing the Aetna debt during the first quarter, our interest will be above our guidance expectations. Also, our tax rate for the quarter is expected to be slightly lower than the rate we expect for the full year. So in closing, we laid the foundation to return to healthy growth in 2017. We executed on our 4-point plan that we laid out back in 2016 and the solid expectations for 2018 reflect the work that has been accomplished. We remain committed to returning to healthy earnings growth long-term and continue to invest in our business to better position us to take full advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead in the health care space. And so with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry. Larry Merlo : Okay. Thanks, Dave. Before we open up for Q&A, just a few additional comments. As you may have seen last week, we received a second request from the DOJ for an additional information related to the Aetna transaction. And the timetable that we laid out in our initial press release back in December, as well as in our S-4 filing reflected this expectation. So things were moving along as planned, and we continue to expect the transaction will close in the second half of the 2018. In addition, the integration planning has begun, and we have assembled a team with representatives from both companies and are very pleased with how the planning process is progressing. So just wrapping up. As we move forward in '18, I do want to take a moment to thank our more than 240,000 colleagues who have worked tirelessly to move the enterprise forward and position us for our next era of growth. We've emerged from '17, a stronger company, well positioned to meet the health care challenges of tomorrow and to take advantage of the emerging opportunities in this growing and vibrant market. And we're excited to continue on our path of driving more affordable, accessible and effective care for all health care stakeholders in 2018 and beyond. So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. My first question is really around the investments that you're making, Dave or Larry, can you talk about what component of that is wage and benefit when I think about it - that is being permanent versus the data analytics or store pilot, et cetera, where eventually I would expect that we'll see some level of return from investors? Larry Merlo : Yes, Lisa, it's Larry. Lisa, I just - if we get into that, I just want to emphasize that what we're looking to do is accelerate the work that's important you know, in this CVS-Aetna [ph] combination. If you think about the role of technology and analytics and digital tools and capabilities, and as far as investments in our employees, service and capabilities, especially at retail will continue to grow an importance. And specifically, these investments will allow us to enhance the role that pharmacy technicians play, which, we believe is key to enhancing the role that pharmacy can play in overall patient care. As far as the level of investments in terms of what Dave was talking about, I would say that a lion share of that is investments into and with our employees, okay, versus in the other areas. But they're both equally important as we go forward. Lisa Gill : Okay, great. And then just my follow-up would just be on the 2019 selling season. So you talked about the $39 billion. When we think about FEP and the renewal, Larry, am I thinking about this right that, that's roughly $6 million to $7 billion? And then can you just give us any indication? You said health plan business, which is usually renewed now, you don't have a lot of renewal. Can you just give us an indication as to how much of that $39 billion has already been renewed? Larry Merlo : Yes, Lisa, in terms of the FEP, your range is pretty much in the ballpark there. And as we talk about the health plans business, keep in mind that the selling cycle is usually a bit longer than on the employer side. So that in many respects, that's hard - late last or in the fall timeframe last year. So as you know, as we go through the year, we typically begin to quantify the selling season, as well as the renewals. So recognizing the cycles associated with the health plans, we have a better picture of what that looks like. And as we mentioned, a large percentage of our health plan clients have been renewed, okay, there are still work to be done there. And we acknowledge that as we look at RSP opportunities, at least on the health care side, health plan side, most of that is behind us at this point, which we're acknowledging that the opportunities there are not as great as we've seen the last couple of years. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of George Hill with RBC. Please go ahead. George Hill : Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I'm going to commit a foul here and look at a little bit beyond 2018. But I guess, Larry, Dave, as you guys think about the combination of the businesses going forward, do you expect another large step up in the investment rate. I think a lot of us are trying to figure out what the pro forma 2019/ '20 numbers look like, and I think whether or not we have the discretionary expense run rate, right, is a big part of the math. I guess, any color that you can provide around that is helpful? Dave Denton : Hey, George. It's Dave here. I think as we've talk a little bit about the combination, obviously, we're going to make investments in the combination going forward to enhance our care model and data and analytics. Keep in mind that as we discussed, as we build out in our stores new capabilities, we have a fairly robust capital plan for the next several years that's going to touch the majority of our stores. We'll likely repurpose some of the investments that we had earmarked to that into I'll say changing the scope of design in those stores. So the incremental CapEx required to deliver on those promises is not that large. So we think that we can manage within the performance that we put out there over the next several years. George Hill : Okay\u2026 Larry Merlo : George, to Dave's point, keep in mind that our historic run rate on gross capital has been in the $2 billion, $2.2 billion range. So to Dave's point and a lot of that was investments on the retail side of the business. So there is a real opportunity to repurpose much of that capital as we build out these new capabilities. George Hill : Okay. And then maybe a quick follow-up. Interested in the investments in data analytics and care management solutions. Should we think of those investments as specific to pharmacy? Or are they broader with respect to, I would call it, like care management solutions, data analytics for health care? So are these kind of investments in the core or are these investments thinking about 2020 and beyond? Larry Merlo : No George, you should think about these as being broader. We've made many investments on the pharmacy component to date, which we believe has paid us dividends and really, serve as a gateway in terms of how we're thinking about these broader capabilities as you think about the 2 companies coming together. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee, Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. Dave, and Larry, may be following a little bit on that - on George's question. Can you speak more to where you are with MinuteClinics. You had a rollout schedule that you guys talked about a little while back. And I know a couple of years ago, at the Analyst Day, you had talked about sort of where you're tracking in terms of revenues as well. Now, obviously, in the future, this looks like to be a key part of what a combined entity could be delivering. Can you tell us where you were in terms of MinuteClinic today? How that rollout schedule changes at all with the pending acquisition? And maybe any kind of metrics you can give around that? Thanks. Larry Merlo : Yes, Charles. It's Larry, I'll start and I think others will jump in. It's a great question, Charles. And certainly, this combination, it enables 2 things. One, a broader expansion of the MinuteClinic footprint. Today, we've got just over 100 clinics across 33 states in the District of Columbia. But equally important is we see an opportunity to expand the breadth and the scope of practice that exists in MinuteClinic. And so there's a number of things that we're thinking about, whether it's broader management of chronic diseases is one example or even the ability to do lab draws, blood draws in the clinics. So we'll have more to say on that as we get these pilots up and running. Charles Rhyee : Great. If I can follow-up, you talked about the integration cost related to Anthem. Can you give us a sense as we roll into 2019, will those integration costs continue? And would they be more or less than we are looking at here in '18? Thanks. Dave Denton : Yes. This is Dave. Obviously, we'll have some integration costs in '18, likely some in '19 to get that business online, just given the share of scope and scale of that. But I expect more in '18 because we want to be up and running in parallel sometime in '19. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Dave, just a question on same-store script guidance for 1Q, you know, looks strong relative to the 7% to 8.5% relative to full year range of 6% to 7%. I know you talked about the full impact being a benefit in Q1. Just wondering if you can maybe help us think about the magnitude there? And then also, can you give us a sense of how the performance in the new preferred Part D networks like SilverScript and Aetna that you're in for this year, how that's compared so far relative to your expectations? Dave Denton : Yes, Nathan, I guess, it's probably a little too early to answer the performance of those networks at this point in time, just given the - we've just kind of started the year off. Clearly, Q1 as we think about the script, I guess, the growth in script utilization that we cycle into Q1 here being a little bit higher than for the full year. Clearly, the flu season, the impact of that is fairly significant as we look across the country and more or less all of each of the country at this point in time. So that will affect Q1 into the positive. Clearly, as we get into the Q2, likely we'll get back into, I'll say, in the normal zip code. As we - maybe the earlier comment I will make, as we thought about Medicare Part D and being a preferred provider in Medicare Part D, the scripts and in some cases, don't just transition right away, we will see script capture build throughout the year as those members chose to move into our network, in those preferred network points. Nathan Rich : Okay, that's helpful. And then just maybe just a follow-up. Dave, can you help us think about like how you're thinking about gross margin for the Retail segment in '18? I didn't see - I think you, guys, typically give sort of qualitative guidance at least. I'd just be curious this year, given potential to have some pressure from the lower-margin scripts in some of those preferred Part D networks, how we should think about the gross margin trend for the year? Dave Denton : Yes, you're right. We have not given specific color around that. I would say that this year, more so than other years is a transition year or step year as we go through planning for the acquisition for next year. Clearly, I think what's important to us is we have a very robust plan to get back to growth in this business, which we delivered upon, clearly meets some now - some investments with the tax benefit back into the business to support our growth longer term. But I think what's important here is we position the company in preferred networks and in teaming up with other payers and building capabilities and programs to drive long-term growth in the business segment. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher from Nephron Resources. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. So a question with Helena moving on, I'm interested in how your view of retail has changed, of course, now, we include long-term care, and it sounds like there will be a lot more that this done in the store over time. How are you conceptualizing what you need in the leadership of retail? Larry Merlo : Well, Eric, it's Larry. And listen, I think as you're aware, these things happen, and we certainly wish Helena continued success in her new role. And I'll just acknowledge that we're going to - we're an attractive company for people to come and work at, and we'll check the external landscape, but at the same time we've got a deep bench of very talented individuals. And Kevin Hourican', who has had a number of senior level jobs in the retail business, in the supply chain, in field operations. Most recently, he leads of our Retail Pharmacy Services Group. He will take over the business reporting to Jon, and we're all confident that we're not going to miss a beat. So, you know, as you've heard us talk in the past, the retail environment is evolving, okay? And we've talked about the front of store being a combination of products and services, the products with a focus on OTC, beauty, personal-care and some elements of convenience. And you've seen what we've been doing with services, whether it's MinuteClinic or the pilots that we've done, and we're beginning a broader rollout of audiology and optical. And we've talked this morning about some additional opportunities that we're excited to pilot as you think about broader care management, especially with the combination. So I do think that we're making health care a retail option, recognizing that health care is becoming local, okay. And we're looking to deliver health care to where people are, okay, whether it's in their local community or in many cases perhaps even in their homes. So again, we're excited about the opportunities and again, we've talked about where we're headed in terms of the leadership of the Retail business. Eric Percher : So my thought on that was that you're acting as a provider, as much as a traditional retailer, maybe to pivot that to a follow-up. With Amazon I think that many of us were looking to see if there was an answer that would come out of Amazon as to the issues that impact health care. With this new creation, it appears to be a partnership in search of potential answers itself. What would your message be as a player, a provider to what you expect you can do and how you might partner? Larry Merlo : Well, Eric, it's a great question and we all saw the announcement last week. And you know, listen, we absolutely agree with the goals and objectives that were outlined in that press release. And I think it's important to acknowledge that the press release had few details and the press release acknowledge that there is a plan. So what that group aspires to is what we're going to deliver as part of the CVS-Aetna combination. And you think about the fact that we have the infrastructure, we have the assets, we certainly have the health care expertise, resident in both companies. And we've demonstrated that we can execute on goals and objectives. So we're chopping [ph] as a bit to get started. We've talked about the fact that we want this new CVS-Aetna combination to be an open source model that as we build out these capabilities, we can make them broadly available in the market. So we're looking forward to partnering with all groups of individuals, including this new combination of Berkshire, JPMorgan and Amazon. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Good morning. So Larry, in line with the opportunity to have kind of like CVS-Aetna combination is an open source program, what is the feedback that you've been getting from your existing customers about the combination? Are they kind of like open to that idea? Are they taking a wait-and-see approach? Larry Merlo : Yes, Ricky. I'll start and Jon has spent a fair amount of time with our customers as well and he has some thoughts. And Ricky, look, I would say that there is tremendous amount of interest. There's a level of curiosity in terms of what can be created here. And I think that in those conversations, certainly, with our health plan clients, we've talked about the reality of - the lines between being competitors and being partners are blurring like never before. And by the way, as you know and as we've talked many times, we have examples of that in our own business today when you think about Medicare Part D and the fact that we manage the Part D component for more than 40 health plans. And we've demonstrated, not just the high level of service as more than 80% of those members are in 4 or 5star performing plans. But those clients have seen that their business as a result of our support is growing faster than the overall PDP marketplace. So listen, I think, obviously, they want to know more, okay. And the lines of communication will be critically important as we move forward, and keep them updated as to our progress and the opportunities that, that creates for us to partner broadly with them. Jon Roberts : And Ricky, this is Jon. Just to build on what Larry has said. So we, obviously, have a larger book of employer clients, so clearly, no issue there. And in fact, we share some common clients that could create opportunities. We do have health plan clients that may compete with Aetna, and I would describe the dialogue as constructive. We serve Aetna today as a PBM, and our goal will be to continue to serve not only Aetna but all of our health plan clients. And we have firewalls in place today that we talk about that allows our competition to occur today as we support health plans on the pharmacy benefit to compete with each other. And as Larry said, as we build out new products and services, we're going to make them available to all of our health plan, so they're actually pretty excited about that. And we have proven with our SilverScript model that, again, competes with many of our health plans that are in the Medicare market that we can do both. We can compete and support them and with our expertise, they've been able to grow significantly better than the balance of the market. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And then my follow-up is on specialty. Obviously, you highlighted on the press release that you're seeing accelerating contribution. Are there specific products that you can highlight for us? And also, when you think about specialty within your existing members, what percent of your member's dispensed specialty in-house and what's the opportunity there? And how does that compare to the Aetna members? Larry Merlo : Well, I'll speak, Ricky, maybe broadly about what categories therapeutic classes we're seeing growing in specialty. So autoimmune and oncology continue to grow and outpaced the balance of the specialty market. And we actually are seeing multiple sclerosis kind of flat, and we also saw hep C volume come down pretty substantially in '17. So with the puts and takes that we're still seeing this business grow pretty dramatically. We're filling about 60% of the specialty business that we manage in our specialty pharmacy. And for Aetna, we actually fill 100% of that volume in our specialty pharmacy. So obviously, the highest and fastest growing part of the pharmacy benefit, and we're pretty excited about our capabilities and the new capabilities that we continue to build out. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo of Needham and Company. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks for taking my call, guys. Just a couple of quick questions. On the investment spend, you mentioned that the run rate would be about $425 million. In terms of modeling that or thinking about that, should we be exiting the year at up over $100 million in spend, and that's how we should be thinking about it going into 2019? Larry Merlo : Yes. Because as you can imagine, all of those investments don't happen right away and certainly, some of the payroll happened in Q2 and beyond, so it ramps up. Kevin Caliendo : Okay, that's a great. Just a follow-up on the Amazon thing. Post the press release that came out, did you approach them in any way, shape or form? Did they approach you? Have there been any even just cursory conversation high, this is who we are and this is what we're doing kind of thing? Larry Merlo : No, Kevin, we have not had any discussion since the press release came. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Please go ahead. Priya Ohri-Gupta: Hey. Thank you so much for the question. Dave, I was wondering if you may be able to shed a little bit of light on some of the potential plans around your debt issuance. I think one of the question that we've been hearing consistently is sort of how are you thinking about where the debt issuance would take place in terms of sort of the HoldCo versus may be one of the subsidiaries. And then just secondly, how do you think about the treatment of the debt at sort of subsidiary levels versus HoldCo levels and your view on making sure that, that is put through? Thank you. Dave Denton : Yes, so those are all great questions. I would say a couple of things. I think one thing to keep in mind here, which I think is important. If we talked about the capital structure of the company a few months ago when the deal was announced, actually our cash flow yield for the company substantially improved with the advent of tax reform. And we've actually now committed that we're going to take a subtle portion of that - now benefit from tax reform to improve our balance sheet over several years, to deliver more rapidly than what we originally anticipated. So we're committed to our capital structure, we're admitted to paying down our debt in a reasonable fashion here. And getting to about 3.5 times levered by the end of 2 years post the acquisition. So I think that's an important foundation. Clearly, we're looking at all possibilities of how to issue this debt over the next several months. I would say we're going to issue it that HoldCo company levels. We will evaluate exactly the tenure at which we will issue this debt over next several months and we continue to watch the market pretty actively to make sure that we place this debt in the best way for us from an economic standpoint to make sure that's prudent and then also structure in a way that does allow us to delever in the timeframe that we've committed to. Priya Ohri-Gupta: Thank you. Dave Denton : You bet. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. John Heinbockel : So Larry, in terms of investing in people, do you think labor hours in the stores go up as well? And if so, where will that go to? How much does that tie into your thoughts on increased services? And would that be outside of the MinuteClinic? Larry Merlo : Yes, John. There's - you can think about a portion of that and some of that is over time, okay, and you're spot on in terms of as you think about those hours being signed to additional services or extended capabilities that would be created, whether it's through the pharmacy, through MinuteClinic or things that perhaps don't exist today. John Heinbockel : And I mean, as a follow-up, it's clearly the right thing to do. When you invest in labor, is that something you can think about on an ROIC basis like you might make a capital investment? Or is it's hard to do, but you know there ought to be a benefit there? Larry Merlo : You know, what, John, it's a great question. John, there are - think about it this way, okay. There are indicators that we contract in our business that we know if we're doing these things well, sales, profits will follow, okay. So obviously we have those metrics that as we look forward, as we think about these investments, we will use those metrics to guide us in terms of being on target, okay, to ensure that the investments that we make provide a tangible return. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Glen Santangelo : Yes, thanks. And good morning. Hey, Larry, I just want to follow up on some of the comments you made with respect to the second request. You've had it for almost a week now, and I'm just kind of curious, I mean, as you've gone through, was there anything sort of out of the ordinary in there or unexpected or any opposition sort of worth calling out at this point? Anything that sort of make sure rethink the timing? Or does seeing the second request, and what's into that actually make you feel more comfortable about the timing? Larry Merlo : You know, what, Glen, there is nothing that has surfaced. That has come as a surprise, and it's very much as I mentioned in my preferred remarks, things are moving forward as planned. And obviously, we've begun to have discussions with those individuals. And those discussions, there's a very good level of engagement and the discussions have been very constructive and positive. So we feel good in terms of how the process is moving along at this point. Glen Santangelo : Okay. Maybe I'll just have one follow-up for Dave on the investment. I apologize because I think this has been asked a little bit. But you said the run rate was $425 million. And so are you basically and should we assume that most of those are in the people, those costs are going to be ongoing, we should be modeling an incremental $150 million in annual expenses in fiscal '19 on a go-forward basis. Is that the way to think about it? Dave Denton : Yes, that is correct. Keep in mind, think about it this way. We're going to increase wages and those wage increases are not going to be affected until 4 1, or 5 1 or 6 1. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brian Tanquilut : Hi. Dave, just to ask a question on that last comment you made. So as I think about wages, I mean, is this basically an across the board. Wonder is there any waiting as we think about store-level wage increases versus corporate and back office? Dave Denton : Yes, this is - just look at - if you look at the mix of employees that we have across our enterprise, they're largely store based. So if you think about just waiting, this is largely a store wage increase. Brian Tanquilut : Okay, got it. And then Larry, as I think about - my follow-up, as I think about the PBM business in the past, obviously, you're benefited from disruptions in the industry with market share gains. So with about third of your contracts summing up for renewal, how should we be thinking about your strategy and messaging for your clients the play defense against your large competitors trying to put clients away in the middle of the Aetna transaction? Larry Merlo : Well, Brian, I don't - as you think about the things that we have talked about, okay, that there is as you think about Aetna, obviously, there's an important message that is delivered to our clients that, listen, we've got dedicated resources for your business and all of the things that go along with that, and it's our job and it's our commitment, and we are absolutely confident that there'll be no slippage in the level of service that we provide to our existing clients and prospective clients as we go forward. So we've got the infrastructure to do that and the talent resides in the organization to do that. And I think that's an important message that we are delivering in addition to all the other things that we talked about, whether just as part of the normal ongoing business that are independent from Aetna or any other acquisition. Jon Roberts : And Brian, this is Jon. Just as Larry said earlier, the majority of our health plans have already been renewed for the selling season. And then as I think about moving forward, payers have 2 priorities. One is optimizing unit cost. That it's a competitive market. That dynamic hasn't changed and will continue into the future. But the second goal of payers is reducing overall health care cost. And we think that this acquisition will enable capabilities that will allow us to bring even more programs to the marketplace that meet the goal of payers whether they be employers or health plans. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa, Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Peter Costa : Good morning, guys. Once again, in the state of union address, President Trump talked about rising drug prices as being an issue. And you've also seen state-level regulation in terms of Kentucky talking about carbon PBM services out of Medicaid contracts, both seemingly being shot at the pharmacy channel. And the drug companies continue to use a redirect towards the PBM. So what are your lobbying efforts going to be over the course of the next year? And how are you measuring the success of those lobby efforts in terms of what you're seeing in Washington? Larry Merlo : Yes, Peter, it's Larry. Obviously, this has been a dialogue. And as you pointed out, we expect it will continue to be a dialogue. And Peter, there's no one single answer to that question. But you will see a steady stream of activity from us, and we'll be coming out with our annual drug trend report shortly, okay. IT will talk about the year-over-year increase, okay, which will be well below the rate of inflation, okay, that you would see in the pharma marketplace, okay. And how that increase ties to our clients spend, but equally important, okay, we will also be spending more time talking about what about the member okay, and what did the member incur, okay, in terms of their out-of-pocket cost associated with drug spend because I think that, that's the component that's getting lost in this PBM dialogue, okay. That we're spending a lot of time talking about clients spend, we're going to spend more time talking about how their members are benefiting from the roll that PBM are performing in the marketplace. So I think that's one of the things that you will see a little different going forward. Peter Costa : So as a follow-up with that, what would be the impact to you if all of your clients move to point-of-sale, rebates and discounts being taken? Larry Merlo : Yes. Peter, we've talked about this in the past that we have a variety of flavors. We have clients today who have point-of-sale rebates or 100% of the rebate value was passed through and there's an administrative fee associated with that. So it would take some time to transition that, okay. But it would have little to no effect on overall PBM economics. Operator : Your next question is from Mohan Naidu, Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Mohan Naidu : Thanks for taking my questions. Larry, one more on the technology investments. How should we think about this the mix between those investments that you're pulling forward to get ready and to integrate Aetna when it closes versus accelerating investments into solutions that can add new services right away to your store? Dave Denton : So this is Dave. I think one thing that we've done is we've created a platform that is really engages members around the pharmacy benefit. And when we have done that, we see really enhanced improvement from adherence, as an example, and engagement with the member, this changed behavior. Again, that's been largely focused in the pharmacy benefit. So now, think with the Aetna combination, potential combination, we're thinking about other things that we can now engage that member on that was just outside of pharmacy but still in health care. So we're making investments to create that platform of engagement such that now, we can focus that member and other areas of health care. So think about our data and analytics investment and infrastructure to support that kind of engagement model. Mohan Naidu : Thanks. Dave. Maybe one quick modeling question, the Q1 tax rate, is it going to marginally different from full year or is just going to be anything meaningful there? Dave Denton : Yes, it could be slightly better than the full year. So with that, we'll take one more question. Operator : And our final question comes from Scott Mushkin, Wolfe Resources. Please go ahead. Scott Mushkin : Thanks, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. So just kind of housekeeping issue and going back to the health care plans. I just want to see you guys talked about the opportunity not being as big this year. I guess, I didn't quite understand why on that. Is it just something in a market, or is it because the pending acquisitions, so that was kind of a housekeeping issue? And then I had a follow-up. Larry Merlo : Yes, Scott, it's just a normal cycle of the market. And the plans that were available were for the most part renewed by the existing PBM including ours. Scott Mushkin : Perfect. And then my last question and talking about the store footprint, I know you guys are thinking about the assets going forward. How should you think about the store footprint? Do you think over time, you're going to need these many stores? And how should we be thinking about the store footprint as this acquisition unfolds? Dave Denton : Scott, this is Dave. I do think we'll still need a number of stores that we have. And importantly, if you look at our pipeline going forward, we're still going to continue to grow our store base. I do think with a now the advent, the combination of Aetna, we might decide and reposition where the next new store is built such that we can deliver a service model in areas that are most impactful to the combined organization. Operator : And gentlemen, that's all the questions we have. I'll turn it over to you. Dave Denton : Okay, Malian, thanks. And let me thank everybody. I know this was a long call. We appreciate everybody's interest. And as always, you can give Mike McGuire a call for any follow-ups. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. We thank you for your participation. Everyone, have a great rest of your day, and you may disconnect your line.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in the listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, May 2, 2018. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike McGuire, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Michael P. McGuire: Thank you, Savanna. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO; Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jon Roberts, our Chief Operating Officer. Larry and Dave have some prepared remarks to share, after which we'll open it up for the question-and-answer session. During the Q&A, in order to provide more people with a chance to ask their questions, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up In addition to this call and our press release, we have posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Our Form 10-Q will be filed later today, and that too will be available in our website once filed. Additionally, during this call we will make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views related to our future financial performance, future events, and industry and market conditions, and forward-looking statements related to the Aetna acquisition, including the expected consumer benefits, financial projections, synergies and the timing for the completion of the transaction. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what maybe indicated in the forward-looking statements. We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these specific risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the cautionary statement disclosures in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings press release. During this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and the comparable GAAP measures in the associated reconciliation document we posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being webcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for one year. Now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo. Larry J. Merlo: Well, thanks Mike; and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We delivered solid performance in the first quarter in line with our expectations. And while my remarks today will focus more on our past forward, our Q1 results confirm my confidence in the strength of our core model and the foundation it will provide in the CVS-Aetna combination. So let me begin by providing an update on our proposed Aetna acquisition. There have been three very important work streams that began shortly after the December announcement : the regulatory pathway, integration planning and shareholder approval. And we've already seen success on the last work stream, as we reached a key milestone on March 13, when CVS and Aetna shareholders each voted to approve the transaction with over 95% shareholder approval. On the regulatory front, we have a highly experienced legal and regulatory team that has made significant progress since the signing. Currently, we're in the process of responding to a second request for information from the Department of Justice, which we received on February 1. The scope of the request was not unexpected and we are working to provide all the information requested by the regulators. Now, we're also working through the approval process at the state level to secure all the appropriate operating licenses. All of the required Form A filings were submitted to 28 state departments of insurance in January. The states that require hearings are starting to schedule and hold those hearings. In fact, the hearing for the Department of Managed Health Care in California, is taking place later today. So we're making good progress with the states and have already begun to receive approvals. In fact, I'm pleased to share that the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, a large and important state for both companies, provided its approval on April 13. So as we previously stated, we expect the transaction to close in the second half of this year and we'll continue to provide updates as we move forward. Now, turning to integration planning, CVS Health and Aetna have established a formal, tightly organized Integration Management Office reporting to Mark Bertolini and myself, with its efforts led by senior executives from both companies. A steering committee comprised of executive leadership from both companies has been developed to provide guidance and strategic direction to the integration team. And our goal is twofold. First, to ensure a smooth transition along with laying out the path to the $750 million in expected year two synergies; and second, to create the long-term roadmap for success in growth to be used after the close of the transaction. 22 integration work streams have been organized with representation from both CVS and Aetna to ensure effective knowledge transfer. And the integration teams are focused on a wide range of objectives from how we'll work together most efficiently, to operational processes, to mapping out how we will capture the opportunities for growth and innovation that are the driving force behind the vision for the combination. And we've made valuable progress on those work streams aligned with the $750 million synergy goal. The synergy components include : procurement, SG&A, process alignment along with medical cost savings using existing assets such as MinuteClinic or home infusion through Coram. Now, the really exciting part of this transaction is our opportunity to rethink and reinvent health care in our country. And currently, there is a growing recognition of the impact that social determinants have on people's overall health and wellbeing. And after the transaction closes, we will be in a position to address these forces in ways that have never been done through our extensive community presence, along with the broader use of the information and analytics. And here too we're off to a strong start; and while it is still very early in the process, we begun to identify some populations and intervention tools that will become part of the first programs we will undertake. And while this list will certainly evolve, at the outset, we'll focus on three primary patient populations recognizing that there will be some overlap among these groups. First, those patients with one of five common chronic diseases : diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, asthma and depression; second, those patients undergoing transitions in care; and the third being a broader focus on managing high-risk patients. We know there are billions of unnecessary and avoidable health care dollars being spent in these areas and we know that we can and must do better. Now, the initial tools to be developed to address the needs of these groups fall into four major categories : interventions in our stores, activities in the patients' homes, new digital tools and capabilities, with all of this supported by the role of data and advanced analytics. Importantly, we will also utilize our investments in technology to ensure that all of these activities are fully integrated with local providers. The promise of this combination is to utilize the combined company's unique position as an integral part of the local health care community, to enable consumers to achieve their ideal health potential. The combination will create an innovative, new health care platform that will be easier to use, less expensive for consumers, and one that integrates broadly within the marketplace to deliver superior, coordinated care. Additionally, keep in mind that another important asset that results from the CVS and Aetna combination is the cumulative value of our management teams. And the teams are working well together and there is a genuine excitement in fulfilling the vision of the two companies and our commitment to better health. So we'll continue to update you on the progress of our integration activities as we work towards the closing. And with that, let me turn it over to Dave, to review the quarter. David M. Denton: Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. This morning I'll share some financial and business highlights and provide a brief update on our guidance. Unlike past quarters, I won't go through all the details in my prepared remarks, but you could find additional information in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier today and also in our SEC filings. And with that in mind, let me start by touching on our capital allocation program. As a result of the Aetna transaction, we have suspended the share repurchase program and we'll be keeping our dividend flat until we turn to a leverage ratio that is more in line with our credit ratings. In March, we issued multiple tranches of senior notes totaling $40 billion. The tranches are well-lathered with maturities ranging from 2 years to 30 years. We issued the notes ahead of the closing the deal to take advantage of the current interest rate environment, allowing us to secure the debt at a favorable weighted average blended rate of approximately 4.19%. With the new debt, our pro forma trailing 12-month adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio is expected to be approximately 4.6 times post-closing of the transaction. We are committed to improving this ratio to 3.5 times within two years post-closing of the deal, utilizing our strong cash generation capabilities and the savings from tax reform. Ultimately, our goal is to maintain the company's leverage ratio in the low 3 times level. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter, we are excluding net interest expense associated with the Aetna-related debt from our non-GAAP metrics. As the transaction with Aetna is still pending approvals, we obviously are not benefiting from Aetna's cash flow and its earnings, but we are already incurring interest cost of the new acquisition-related debt. By adjusting this expense out, we believe we are providing a clearer picture of our underlying performance until the deal closes. Keep in mind that this represents a change to our prior stated approach. In the first quarter we generated $1.9 billion of free cash, keeping us on track with our free cash expectations for the year. During the quarter, we paid approximately $508 million in dividends and we expect to return more than $2 billion to shareholders through this year through dividends alone. Now turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share was $1.48 per share, an increase of 26.5% over LY. These results are on a comparable basis and the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted EPS can be found in the press release as well as on the Investor Relations portion of our website. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.98 per share. A lower effective income tax rate and higher prescription volume within the Retail/Long-Term Care segment drove the increase year-over-year. In addition, interest in taxes came in slightly better-than-expected for the quarter, contributing about $0.02 to adjusted EPS. Operating profit results for both business segments were within our expectations. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the first quarter increased 2.6% to approximately $45.7 billion, consistent again with our expectations. Gross profit, operating expenses, operating profit, net interest expense and the tax rate we are providing today reflect non-GAAP adjustments in both current and prior periods where applicable, and have been reconciled again on our website. Our guidance for the first quarter also reflected these adjustments. Gross margin for the consolidated company was 15%, representing a small improvement over Q1 of 2017 due to segment mix. Total enterprise gross profit dollars increased 4.4%. Total operating expenses dollars grew $219 million in the first quarter, again in line with our expectations. We are continuing to make significant progress in our enterprise streamlining efforts and we are already benefiting from enhancements that we've made. As an example, CVS Pharmacy and Caremark implemented an improved process to share members' eligibility in real time. Historically, we've seen eligibility-related rejections impact about 6% of Caremark scripts at the pharmacy counter, so the potential customer service improvement and cost savings from this effort is quite large. This project benefits customers at the pharmacy counter, while reducing costs for both CVS Pharmacy and Caremark by reducing member service costs. To date, we've seen a nearly 70% reduction in Caremark's rejects and have eliminated more than 8 million rejections in the first quarter alone. We're also pursuing this solution with other payers. Across all work streams, we expect to generate approximately $475 million in gross benefits this year, well on our way to generating $700 million or more annually once this work is complete. Operating profit for the total enterprise grew 3.4% in the quarter, while operating margins remained relatively flat year-over-year at 4.5%. Now going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter decreased approximately $10 million from LY to $242 million, but is consistent with the fourth quarter of 2017. Our effective income tax rate in the quarter was 26.1% and our weighted average share count was just over 1 billion shares. On the January guidance call, I mentioned that during 2018 we'd be moving to a common financial platform across the enterprise to further our effort to drive more efficient shared services. We made this transition in Q1; and as a result, we have better information to allocate our shared services costs to our operating segments. This change slightly impacts profitability for each segment; however, consolidated operating profit does not change. To enable you to review segment performance on a comparable basis, we are revising both our 2016 and our 2017 financial statements for this change. The reconciliation of the changes have been posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website, and the figures and growth rates that I'm referring to today are based on a new cost allocation method. So with that, turning to the PBM segment; net revenues increased 3.2% to $32.2 billion. This growth was driven by net new business, including the additional lives in Medicare Part D as well as continued growth within our specialty pharmacy business. Partially offsetting the sales growth was continued pricing pressures and an increase in our generic dispensing rate. PBM adjusted claims increased 6.4% in the quarter to 468.8 million adjusted claims. Now looking at the 2019 selling season, our retention rate is currently in line with rates that we've seen in prior years, and we are more than halfway through our 2019 renewals. We expect RFP opportunities in the 2019 season to be less than the opportunities we see in the past few years. However, we do believe that our strong service history and unique suite of capabilities will foster success, with both retaining business and winning new opportunities as they arise. Gross margin remained relatively flat at 3.5%, while gross profit dollars increased a healthy 5.1%. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily due to increased volume in specialty pharmacy and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice, partially offset by expenses incurred to support the Anthem implementation as we get ready to administer that contract beginning in 2020. While relatively small in Q1, we expect the spend associated with Anthem to ramp up as the year progresses. Operating expense dollars increased by approximately $52 million in the first quarter, primarily driven by the reinstatement of the ACA's health insurance tax and the Wellpartner acquisition. As a percent of sales, operating expenses were 1.2%. Operating profit in the PBM was relatively flat year-over-year, while operating margin was consistent at approximately 2.4%, again in line with our expectations. Now turning to the Retail/Long-Term Care business, revenues increased 5.6% in the quarter to $20.4 billion. The strong growth was primarily driven by increased script volumes due to the continued adoption of our Patient Care Programs, partnerships with PBMs and health plans across the industry, and our preferred position in a number of Medicare Part D networks this year. Additionally, the Retail business benefited from a strong cough, cold and flu season in Q1. Revenues were slightly above our expectation. And as demonstrated in our results, our initiatives to expand our partnerships including those with other PBMs and health plans, have progressed well and we continue to see opportunities for 2020 and beyond. We have seen an uptick by a number of both Optum and Cigna clients of many CVS Pharmacy and MinuteClinic programs. Our initiatives are driving growth of adjusted scripts to spend; and as a result, our market shares increased by nearly 140 basis points in the quarter to 24.6%. Same store sales were slightly above expectations at 5.8%, with adjusted same-store script growth of 8.5% at the high end of our guidance range. The flu season was quite strong during the first quarter; and as a result, we saw seasonal adjusted scripts grow by approximately 4 million year-over-year. Front store same store sales grew 1.6%, possibly affected by the calendar shift of Easter to April 1 this year, which impacted comps by approximately 90 basis points, again, as well as the strong cough and cold season. Gross margin in the Retail/Long-Term Care Segment was 29%, down approximately 40 basis points. This contraction was driven by continuing pressure on reimbursement rate. The decline was partially offset by an increase in GDR as well as improvements in the front store margin rate. Gross profit dollars increased 4.1% in the quarter, mainly due to increased scripts and front store volume, as well as improvements in purchasing through Red Oak Sourcing. Operating profit within Retail/Long-Term Care Segment increased 4.1%, while operating margin declined slightly to 8.4%, again on an adjusted basis. Within the Corporate Segment, expenses were relatively flat at $224 million. So overall, we're very pleased with our performance to date. The first quarter results underscored the early success we are achieving in our four-point plan to return to healthy growth. Our partnerships are driving script growth, while our streamlining effort is improving enterprise-wide efficiencies. And Larry will have more to highlight on the innovations we're bringing to market. But with that, let me first provide an update on our outlook for 2018. I'll focus on the highlights here, but you can find additional details in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier today. Let me start with a couple of reminders. First, keep in mind that for guidance purposes only we're assuming that the proposed Aetna transaction closes at the end of 2018. By doing so, we are setting no expectations for the results of Aetna's operations in this year. Secondly, all financing fees, interest, transaction and integration costs related to the deal are excluded from our adjusted figures. Prior today we have not provided an EPS guidance range, given that the uncertainty around the timing of the Aetna debt placement. As the placement occurred in March, we are now able to provide an adjusted EPS estimated range for 2018 of $6.87 to $7.08 per share, representing growth of 16.25% to 20%. We expect GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $5.11 to $5.32 per share. The significant growth in EPS is largely related to the benefit received from tax reform. You can find a reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted EPS in our press release, and again on the Investor Relations portion of our website. We've increased our top line growth expectations, given stronger prescription growth in the Retail/Long-Term Care Segment. Consolidated revenue growth is now expected to be 1.25% to 3%, an increase of 50 basis points from our prior guidance range. For the Retail/Long-Term Care Segment, we now expect both revenue and same store sales growth of 4% to 5.5%, an improvement of 150 basis points and 200 basis points, respectively, versus our previous guidance. Pharmacy same store scripts are now expected to grow 7.25% to 8.25%, an improvement of 125 basis points. We are seeing a greater benefit from the broader relationships we established last year with payers as well as from our expanded participation as a preferred pharmacy in various Medicare Part D networks. Our expectations for revenue growth in the PBM Segment of 1.5% to 3.5% has not changed, with adjusted claims of approximately 1.9 billion. Moving to operating profit, we continue to expect full-year 2018 adjusted consolidated operating profit to be down 1.5% to up 1.5%. For the segments, we continue to expect adjusted operating profit growth for the PBM Segment to be in the low- to mid-single digits and operating profit in the Retail/Long-Term Care Segment to be down low-single digits. Both segments are benefiting from the company's enterprise streamlining efforts. In the PBM, these benefits are being offset by Anthem implementation costs. In the Retail/Long-Term Care Segment, the benefits are being offset by lower expectations for our Long-Term Care business, which are primarily due to lower-than-anticipated benefits from our cost improvement effort and our assisted living initiative, as well as headwinds from the financial challenges faced by many LTC facilities. Recall that Retail operating profit also includes the investment of $275 million of tax savings back into that business. Going below the line, net interest expense on our existing portfolio of debt is expected to be approximately $1 billion, slightly below our previous estimate. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 27% for 2018. Before I move to Q2 guidance, I want to provide some color on the cadence of operating profit growth for the year. Enterprise operating profit growth is now expected to be weighted more to the front half of this year, which differs from what we had indicated previously. There are a few factors that are driving this. First, our investment of $275 million of tax savings back into the business will be invested predominantly in the back half of this year. Second, the Retail/Long-Term Care Segment is making better progress on certain pharmacy initiatives during the front half of this year than previously expected. At the same time, Retail has been positively affected by the strong flu season in Q1. Third, as I stated, the Long-Term Care business is experiencing some challenges and its growth rate is lower than previously expected. And finally, the Anthem expenses we expect to incur this year are back half weighted. Now, let me highlight our Q2 expectations. We expect adjusted EPS in the second quarter to be in the range of $1.59 per share to $1.64 per share in the quarter, reflecting an increase of 19.25% to 23% versus Q2 of 2017. Tax reform will continue to be a major contributor to this increase. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.21 to $1.26 per share. Non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter excludes certain items described in our slides. Consolidated revenue in the second quarter are expected to grow 1.25% to 2%, while consolidated operating profit is expected to be flat to up 3.25%. Within the Retail/Long-Term Care Segment, we expect revenue growth in the range of 4.5% to 6% and operating profit growth in the mid- to high-single digits. Total same store sales at Retail are expected to be up 4.75% to 6.25% and adjusted script comps are expected to increase by 7.75% to 9.25%. In the PBM Segment, we expect second quarter revenues to be down 1.25% to up 1.5% and operating profit to be down mid- to high-single digits. The timing of PBM profit delivery is somewhat unique this year for Q2 and is being driven by a few factors. The year-over-year results are being affected by the investments we are making to support Anthem's implementation as well as the timing of certain client contractual commitments. But despite a weak outlook for profit growth in Q2 in the PBM business, we remain confident in our full-year outlook for that segment. We strongly believe that the investments we are making now set the company up well for the exciting opportunities that lie ahead. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thanks, Dave. And before we open it up for Q&A, I do want to spend just a couple minutes talking about our focus on driving growth and highlight some recent innovations and product introductions that are capitalizing on the benefits that are inherent in our unique integrated model. And with health care costs continuing to rise at a remarkable pace, it's no surprise to anyone that people are looking at the market and asking themselves, what can be done better? It's a question that we challenge ourselves to answer on a daily basis as we think about our model and explore ways in which we can provide greater value to the health care stakeholders that we support across our enterprise. So with this in mind, we are continuing to innovate to improve the quality and lower the cost of health care for our patients and clients. And if you look over the last couple months, just last month we announced that we're marshaling our enterprise assets to help address an area of significant, unmet clinical need; that being chronic kidney disease. And our approach here is centered on two tenets. First, that we can use the wealth of data available to our enterprise to predict and support diagnosis earlier in the patients' disease course; and second, absent renal transplantation, home dialysis is potentially the best alternative for many patients. Earlier identification of patients allows for better symptom management, potentially delaying the need for dialysis; and dialysis in the convenience of the patients' home has the potential to provide a better patient experience, better health outcomes, and reduce total medical costs. Just as background, about 90% of patients in the U.S. are treated with hemodialysis, three days a week for three to four hours at dedicated centers. However, most nephrologists would choose home dialysis for themselves, because it's logistically the only way to deliver more frequent and longer dialysis. And this is the intervention; longer, more frequent therapy that has been reported to improve outcomes in appropriate dialysis patients. And this program is an example of CVS Health pushing the boundaries of innovation in our sector. And to bring this vision to market, we will need to execute a clinical trial to generate the safety and efficacy data to obtain FDA clearance to market a new home hemodialysis device. So we're currently planning to begin this trial late this summer. We anticipate an 18 to 24-month timeframe for the completion of the trial, submission of the data and FDA review before we can come to market. Also last month, we released our latest Drug Trend Report. And for 2017, our PBM strategies reduced drug trend for commercial clients to its lowest level in five years at 1.9%, with drug price growth at 0.2% despite manufacturer price increases of nearly 10%. In fact, 42% of our payer clients spent less on their pharmacy benefit plan in 2017 than they had in the prior year. And just as important as saving clients' money, we also help members save money and lower out-of-pocket costs. This past year nearly 9 out of 10 members spent less than $300 out-of-pocket and monthly cost per member declined to $11.89. Now, keeping drugs affordable also help to improve adherence. We increased the number of optimally-adherent members in key categories like diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia by as much as 1.8 percentage points. And although we're proud of these results, we know that for some patients prescription drugs are still unaffordable. And to help solve this problem, we launched the Saving Patients Money program; the industry's most comprehensive approach to helping make needed medications more affordable. And this approach provides what we're referring to as actionable transparency across all points of care, from the point of prescribing with the physician to the pharmacy and directly to members. At the doctor's office, we're providing real-time patient benefit information that enables prescribers to see the member-specific out-of-pocket costs of a prescribed medication as well as the costs of clinically appropriate therapeutic alternatives based on that patient specific plan design. This capability is built into the prescribers' EHR system and that allows the prescribers to offer members medication options that may be more affordable. At the pharmacy counter, the new CVS Pharmacy Rx Savings Finder enables our retail pharmacists, for the first time, to quickly and seamlessly evaluate individual prescription savings opportunities to determine the best way for patients to save money on out-of-pocket costs, with the primary goal of helping the patient find the lowest cost alternative under their pharmacy benefits plan. And through the PBM, we're continuing to make solutions available to help further drive down drug trend for our PBM clients and their members. For instance, our Point of Sale rebate offering allows the value of negotiated rebates on branded drugs to be passed on directly to patients when they fill their prescriptions. So I think you can see, we're pretty excited about these solutions that are helping to address some of the cost and quality challenges facing our health care system. We know that more challenges lie ahead and we firmly believe that the addition of Aetna will enhance our positioning in the market and allow us to play a larger role in the health of our country. So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Michael Cherny : Good morning, guys, and thanks for all the color so far. Just thinking about the selling season for the PBM. As you think about going to market with the messaging, especially with the pending Aetna transaction, what's been the feedback you've gotten over the course of the selling season, both with your own customers, are they working on for retention as well as new customers where you're pitching new business for an RFP, in terms of how you think about the value proposition and how they should think about the value proposition CVS can provide that evolves, as you work on onboarding Aetna and building out other capabilities from the store? I mean how is that message changing for you and how is that resonating in the market? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Mike, it's Larry. I'll start and I know Jon wants to jump in as well. But Mike, if you go back to December after the announcement, we had a pretty comprehensive outreach to our clients, especially our health plan clients. And we just had our Client Forum this past month. It was extremely well attended. I would say that the reaction from our clients has ranged from interest in learning more about how we can create value for them and their members. And I would tell you that there is a lot of engagement around the opportunities that can be created, recognizing that \u2013 we've talked about the fact that we want to make many of these solutions broadly available in the marketplace for our clients. So, Jon? Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah. And I think the one thing we heard really from all clients, both employers and health plans is, as they're trying to manage their overall health care costs down, they're having to work with a lot of different vendors to provide services. And so, they very clearly told us that they're looking to us for innovation that they are looking to reduce the number of vendors. And the fact that we have this Aetna acquisition and the fact that that will allow us to innovate much more broadly to have a positive impact on our overall health care costs, they're very excited about. So that was a message that we heard loud and clear from clients just a few weeks ago. Larry J. Merlo: And Mike, I think the only other point I'd add and Dave alluded to it in his prepared remarks that in terms of the 2019 selling season, we are seeing RFP activity down. And I do think that, tied to your question, there is a better of a wait-and-see approach as to how does the landscape shake out, okay, as people better understand the various offerings that will be out in the marketplace as they are thinking about making a three-year decision which, as you know, are the typical length for these contracts. Jonathan C. Roberts: And then, Michael, the only other thing I would say is, regards to the selling season, I mean payers really have three priorities. One is service the members and themselves as the client, and we clearly are doing a great job there with everything that we do from sales and account management to all of our support to their members in care, in mail and specialty. Secondly, they are looking to optimize unit cost, so our size and scale allows us to do that along with programs and plan designs like Maintenance Choice and preferred or narrow networks. And Larry talked about the results that we delivered to our clients with our trend at 1.9%, and then they're very interested in reducing overall health care costs. And that's what I talked about earlier, and I think that is becoming more of a priority and that's why they're so excited about the new company that we will become. Michael Cherny : Excellent. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Glen Santangelo : Yeah. Thanks and good morning. Larry, thanks for all the details on the Aetna situation. I think investors very much understand and appreciate the long-term bull case of the combination. But we hear a lot of concerns about the potential for integration issues, incremental investments that may be required to get to where you want to be. And so my two quick questions are : one, when do you think you'll be in a position to give us more detailed information about the integration plan, the services you may look to provide at MinuteClinic, how much you'll need to invest, et cetera? And then secondly, assuming you successfully close the deal in the second half of this year, as you look to 2019, what do you see as the biggest integration challenges? And then I'll stop there. Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Glen, as I alluded in our prepared remarks, the integration work is going very well. Keep in mind that as you think about integration risks, the fact that Caremark and Aetna have had an eight-year relationship, you always worry about systems and that work is behind us. So, we can take that one off the table because of \u2013 we did that about eight years ago or started that process eight years ago. And as we've talked about the tools or the areas of investment, we'll have a lot more to say on that as we get further into the work. But keep in mind that we typically at CVS spend around $2.2 billion in CapEx each year. And we believe that there are elements of that CapEx that can be repurposed that would support some of the investments that we understand will be important to bring things to life. So keep in mind, we've been at this now for probably 8 to 10 weeks. As I mentioned, the work's gone very well and we have not seen anything surface to date that we would say is unexpected, especially as you think, back to your question, large cost ticket items. Glen Santangelo : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with RBC. Please proceed with your question. George Hill : Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for all the question. I guess, Larry, I'm going to ask one of these big picture macro questions. As you guys laid it out in the presentation, I think it's interesting that you guys are looking about reducing the cost of care delivery on a disease state by disease state setting versus like a care delivery treatment area setting, given the collection of assets that you guys are going to have. And I guess, can you talk about whether or not like why is that more important and why does that seem to be the focus as opposed to the assets that you guys have in place in driving higher utilization? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah. George, first of all, I would say, think of it a little bit as both. And I'll start with, we know today that chronic disease accounts for a disproportionate share of those health care costs. And keep in mind that \u2013 I think we've given some examples. We've learned some things from the CVS-Caremark combination over the years that whether you're looking at a patient with diabetes and that patient they visit their doc on a quarterly basis, it's all about the execution of that care plan. That ultimately manages the patient to achieve their best health at the lowest possible cost. And we've seen some things with our Transform Care program, where \u2013 that has been rolling out that \u2013 there's about $2,800 per patient that can be reduced by just making sure that their A1C levels are in the appropriate range, that ultimately avoid some unintended medical event. So, we think there is a huge unlock in terms of the management of those patients with chronic disease. At the same time, we've also talked a lot about site of care in terms of whether it's transitions in care, whether it's how do we ensure that care is being delivered in the right setting with cost as a variable. And again, we think that there is a huge opportunity there when you look at the bricks-and-mortar asset as well as what can be provided for in the home. And George, you recall, I think it was three years ago at Analyst Day that we've started talking about this retailization of health care that picks up some of these themes and that health care was becoming more local. And certainly, the growth of consumer-directed health plans have driven that even in a bigger way as accountability and decision making is shifting to the patient. So, we think there is a surround sound capability that we're looking to build out with that in mind. George Hill : Maybe a quick follow up would be, if you look at a couple of years, does health care become deflationary? And how do you think about kind of the impact to that like as you think about the enterprise income statement? David M. Denton: George, it's probably too early to understand whether it can be, in fact, deflationary. I do think that with certain members, as we think about again taking a big step back and thinking about the retailization of health care and the assets that we have in place and we'll put in place, is all about wrapping ourselves around a member and helping that member better navigate the health care system and be more efficient as they use the health care system. And as we do that, we do believe that we can lower the cost year-over-year for those members, and actually at the same time improve the outcomes as that patient matures. So in those categories, yes, I do think there's some opportunity to really bend the cost curve. George Hill : Okay. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, George. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi, good morning. Two questions here. First one is around the discussions we're hearing out of Washington on potential changes to Part D. If you can provide us just some context of what you are hearing out of D.C., and what could mean to the business? And then the second question is around the MinuteClinic. You've shown very nice growth around 15%. So, should we think about it as a new kind of like run rate for the business? And are you seeing more clients adapting MinuteClinic as part of their offering? Or is it that the consumers just feel more comfortable with the concept? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah. Ricky, let me start with the second one. Ricky, obviously in the first quarter, MinuteClinic is experiencing the intensity of the flu season that we saw largely in the months of January, February began to tail off in March. So, I wouldn't use the first quarter trajectory as a new run rate. At the same time, as part of what we're talking about, one of the work streams is, what is the trajectory from a scope \u2013 I'll say, the scope of practice and services at MinuteClinic? And those are things that we're working on and we'll have more to say on that in the coming months. And I would say, Ricky, that the consumer awareness of MinuteClinic has grown substantially. And obviously, I think that that is helping to drive utilization as well. Jonathan C. Roberts: And then, Ricky, we're going to be launching what we're calling, virtual care, later this year that will either be an online visit or a video visit. So, the video visit will be able to treat things like minor illnesses or injuries, skin conditions and wellness services. And then the online visits will be on-demand diagnosis for limited scope areas like birth control, allergies, hair loss and acne. And we're doing that under our brand that we think will help this virtual care model that has been in the market for quite some time, but had limited traction. In addition, when we look at our clients, employers, we see a lot answers from employers in creating an incentive for their employees to go to MinuteClinic; MinuteClinic's open at nights and weekends. So it keeps them at work, but still gives them the care that they need. And then with health plans, very interested in MinuteClinic so that their members can go to a MinuteClinic versus the emergency room and it really is just a cost save for the health plans. So we're just saying, continued interest. And as Larry said, we're continuing to evolve this model. Larry J. Merlo: And then, Ricky, back to your first question in terms of Part D, what are we hearing in D.C.? Obviously, there's been a lot of dialogue about Point of Sale rebates in Part D. And keep in mind, Ricky, as you've heard us and quite frankly others talk about the dynamic here that 100% of that rebate value in Part D is passed through the plan design in the form of a lower premium. So as it relates to the PBM, that would have no impact on profitability if that ended up moving forward. I think the concern that exists there is, as you model that out, what is the dynamic as it relates to beneficiary premiums going up? What is the consequence associated with that? And ultimately, what's the government costs associated with that? So, I think that work has been done and you've seen some published studies associated with that. I think the other things that we are hearing is, moving certain Part B drugs into Part D. And then there'll be ongoing dialogue about the dynamics associated with the six protected classes, where formulary management typically does not come into play and the opportunities to further reduce the cost of the program for beneficiaries and the government. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Lisa C. Gill: Thanks very much and good morning. Jon or Larry, I just wanted to start going back to the 2019 selling season. So, I understand your comments around being halfway through, not as much opportunity in 2019. But can you talk about what you're seeing in the marketplace? Some of the things we're hearing right now is the shift in contracting towards total care. Even if you don't own the health plan today that some of the contracts are coming out that way, number one. You did talk about point of service (sic) [Point of Sale] rebates, but are you seeing that in the commercial market today where an uptake on that side, if maybe you could just talk about what your expectations are as far as plan design goes, as we think about 2019. Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah. Lisa, this is Jon. So, I do think that there is interest in integrating the medical and pharmacy benefit. And you'll see that more in the mid-level sized employers, where they generally have one health plan and their workforce is more localized, because they're a little more challenging with the large national plans that have multiple health plans. But we spend a lot of time talking about things we can do in pharmacy to lower their overall health care costs, and Transform Diabetes Care is a good example. Larry talked about that earlier. We have over 100 clients and 2 million lives in this program, very targeted to their members with diabetes. So, I just think there will continue to be a growing interest in how pharmacy can help bend the overall cost curve with health care costs. With respect to Point of Sale rebates, I think as we see continued growth and high deductible health plans, I think there will be even more interest in Point of Sale rebates. We have 10 million members in a Point of Sale rebate program today. We can administer that. We can actually encourage those plans with either percent copays or in high deductible plans to adopt those, and we're able to show them how it actually helps members stay adherent and lowers their overall health care costs. So, we think it's a good thing to do. And it's just been a challenge because people like the flexibility of having that rebate check in either applying it to lower premiums or use it for other programs that they're interested in. But I think you'll continue to see us progressing in that direction. Lisa C. Gill: Okay, great. And then just a point of clarification. Larry, I think you talked about virtual care being under a CVS brand. But can talk to us about your teleservices relationship with Teladoc? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah. Lisa, it pretty much is what you just alluded to, we will use Teladoc as the engine that provides telehealth services through the CVS app through and direct it back into MinuteClinic and other providers. So, essentially think of them as private labeling our telehealth program. Lisa C. Gill: Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mohan Naidu with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Mohan Naidu : Thanks for taking my questions. Dave, first on the Point of Sale rebate offerings. Should we think about this as something that could impact your margins? And I just have a quick follow up on the Aetna combination as well. David M. Denton: I don't know if it will affect our margin substantially. I do think it's obviously a product and service that we'll offer in the marketplace pretty comprehensively today. I think it's an opportunity for us to reduce the cost at the pharmacy counter for those members in the deductible phase. I think the adoption of that has been pretty slow at this point in time. I will also let you know that we've been talking about the fact that, while we collect rebates, the vast majority of those rebates go back to our plan sponsors in form of lower cost to them. We have said in the past that about 90% of those rebates have gone back to the payers. Today, probably a lot closer than 95% of all those rebates go back to the payer in the form of lower cost into the pharmacy program. Mohan Naidu : That's very helpful, Dave. Larry, just one more quick follow up on the Aetna combination and you talked about this in the last couple of questions, I guess. As we think about post approval and post Aetna combination, what can you do immediately within the, I guess, first couple of years in terms of offering new services at the store versus what you can do or years (00:55:04) with more investments in the store? Can you do the chronic disease management stuff that you talked about right now as soon as the deal is closed? Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Yeah. Mohan, it's a great question and I do believe that we'll have elements of that that we'll be able to do early on, recognizing the assets and capabilities that are already resident in each of the companies. And that's one of the things that the teams are currently working on, whether it's site of care, we talked about MinuteClinic, we talked about infusion in the home as well as the role that \u2013 the additional role that we can play around improving medication adherence. So these are just a handful of examples of things that we will be able to do out of the gate. Mohan Naidu : Thanks, Larry. Larry J. Merlo: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Charles Rhyee : Yeah. Hey, thanks for taking the question. Most of mine have been asked here. I guess, just maybe first on \u2013 Dave, can you just go into what's going on in Long-Term Care specifically? Obviously, you acquired Omnicare a few years back and there seem to be a lot of opportunities there to bring maybe some of the more CVS kind of brand services into that channel, particularly assisted living. Curious whether \u2013 just want to get an update here, what might has been going on here and when do you think some of these challenges could subside? David M. Denton: Yeah. Well, first and foremost, within the Long-Term Care space, there's \u2013 many of the players in that space are facing financial distress and that has created pressure from a growth perspective just as we service those homes across the country. Secondly, reimbursement pressure continues to evolve in that space and probably a little bit higher than what we originally planned. At the same time, census has been a bit lower across the industry. We experienced that, just given our market share. And then finally, as you indicated, we believe that there is a big opportunity for growth within the out market. However, the growth in that market has not been as fast, from a case perspective, as we originally planned. We have several pilots underway and the success of those pilots have been pretty strong, but we haven't created a platform yet that we can scale nationally across our business line. And so, that's an area of work that we have underway. We think we're optimistic about that in the long term; but in the short term, we're not exactly where we need to be. Charles Rhyee : I see. And just a follow up on telemedicine, in particular, I guess is \u2013 because you talked about hemodialysis and if I recall correctly, I think as part of the \u2013 some of the pilots that are going underway, there's another one with home hemodialysis using telemedicine for, I guess, two out of every three patient visits. Is that something that you expect to also deploy? Or is that part of the opportunity when you're thinking about your home hemodialysis opportunity here? Jonathan C. Roberts: Well, this is Jon. Home hemodialysis, we're taking it to trial and it will take probably 12 months to 18 months to get through the clinical trials. And then that solution is targeted for the home, so there's about 10% of dialysis that takes place at the home today with about 1% of it hemo and the balance peritoneal. So we'll be going after that narrow segment of the market. I think what's interesting is, when you look at other countries, you see home dialysis up to 30%, 40%, even 50%. So, we think there is an opportunity to expand that market as well. So, nothing really related to telemedicine with the hemodialysis that's planned at this point. Larry J. Merlo: Charles, it's Larry. You think back to some of the dialogue that we've had in terms of specialty and the role that Accordant has played in supporting our specialty pharmacy business, and our Accordant team, our Accordant nurses are working with a specialty patient in an effort to manage the patient holistically. And we think that that is the approach that we would apply to home hemodialysis. They'll play a key role in that regard, as... Charles Rhyee : But not necessarily taking over \u2013 I guess, not also ruling up the role of the provider to these patients as well through CVS more directly, but still more as a support to the specialty pharmacy. Is that the better way to understand it then? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah. That's along those lines, Charles. Yes. Charles Rhyee : Okay. Thanks for the clarification. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, I guess I'm just curious if you can speak about copay accumulator programs and whether there was greater adoption of this type of program by commercial employer clients in 2018 versus 2017 within your PBM book of business? And also do you see maybe even greater adoption in 2019, if you maybe more aggressively marketing this in the upcoming PBM selling season? Thanks. Jonathan C. Roberts: Steven, this is Jon. So, it really is a capability that we have and it has to be something that our client opts into. I would say, there has been some interest, but not \u2013 I don't think it's not a priority for clients as we speak to them, because they know that these patients are challenged financially and they actually appreciate the help. But it's a client-by-client decision whether they opt into the program and we support as they do so. Steven Valiquette : Okay. So adoption rates are pretty low right now? And just, by the way, could a customer adopt this mid contract if they wanted to? Or would this typically only change with the renewal of a contract? Just curious how that works. Jonathan C. Roberts: They can implement this at any time. It's a pretty straightforward implementation. Steven Valiquette : Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: Great. We're going to take two more questions. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott A. Mushkin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Really looking out beyond the Aetna closure, I just want to get your thoughts on a couple of things. First is \u2013 and I know we touched on it a little bit, but the risk to the health care plan book of business in Caremark. The second one is really just around drug coverage, and if we look at how many generics are out there. Do we need to look at drug coverage in a different way as we look out maybe beyond 2020? And then the third thing was as you pay down the debt, the appetite to do a deal like you did with Target? Thanks. David M. Denton: Well, I'll take the Target question as it relates to an incremental transaction there. Obviously, just given our leverage, as you said, we're not positioned to do something of scale at this point in time. I would say, secondly, as we look at the overlap of national players around the country, there's probably not a national player that would fit with our geographic needs at this point in time. There could be an opportunity for a small regional fill in as we think about access points around the nation, but those are going to be one-off and pretty small in nature if they were to come about. Larry J. Merlo: And Scott, I'll take that drug coverage question. Jon will take the health plan question. But Scott, if your question is really going down the generic path and listen, we have been pleased with what we're seeing from the leadership in the FDA in terms of streamlining the pathway, beginning to eliminate the backlog of potential generic approvals that have existed for quite a few years now, that has the prospects of moving more generics into the marketplace. And we think that there is an opportunity for greater adoption of things like value formularies that are largely, I'll say, staffed, if you will, with generics and the fact that we have now reached a point, especially as you look at chronic disease where there are multiple generic options within all of those different therapeutic classes. So, we think there is an opportunity for growth there. And we continue to explore different procurement models in terms of how can we work differently with pharma, with more of a focus on outcomes. Now, obviously I'm moving from generics into brands and we'll continue to explore those opportunities. And by the way, I think this \u2013 the CVS combination will open up the door to do even more of that. Jonathan C. Roberts: And Scott, this is Jon. I'll take the health plan question and their reaction. They understand that the lines are blurring between who's a competitor and who's a partner. And they just want to make sure that they're not disadvantaged in the market. And we've been very clear with them that, as we build products \u2013 new products, we're going to make them not only available to Aetna, but all of our health plan partners in this open platform. And we use the example of SilverScript, where we have a Part D plan and it's the largest Part D plan in the country, where we compete with the 40 health plans that we support. And as I talk to these plans, I say, with your brand and your market if I can make you more competitive, you're going to be very successful in the marketplace. And that in fact is what has happened with our health plan partners that are in the Medicare space. They have grown faster than the market because of the product services and expertise that we bring them. And so, the fact that we proved and demonstrated that in SilverScript is giving them confidence that, with this Aetna acquisition that we'll do the same thing for them as we build out these products and services. So I would say, people are from enthusiastic to wait-and-see, but we haven't really had anybody react in a very negative way because of this acquisition. So we're very happy with how this has been received. Scott A. Mushkin: Okay. Thanks very much. Jonathan C. Roberts: Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Scott. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question. David Larsen : Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter. Dave, did you increase the revenue growth expectations for Retail? And then, I don't think I saw an increase in the operating profit growth expectations. Any color there would be great. David M. Denton: Yeah. We actually did, in fact, increase our revenue guidance for the Retail business. Keep in mind that two things have happened. One is, we are making the incremental investments from tax savings largely into the Retail business at the back half of this year. But probably more importantly, why we're not raising guidance is, as we indicated our Long-Term Care Omnicare business is not performing as we expected, so we had a little headwind in the back half of the year compared to our expectations in that. So, think about the Retail business strong from a top line, both from a script and a front store perspective, being offset slightly from softness in Long-Term Care. David Larsen : Okay, that's helpful. And then, can you maybe talk a little bit about biosimilars and maybe your drug trend that you delivered in diabetes. The drug trend of I think 1% was fantastic. What was it for diabetes? And then the use of Basaglar over Lantus, I think, probably had a significant impact there. So it seems to me like CVS's use of biosimilars is actually very effective today. What other products should we be looking at in the near term to sort of see similar results? Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: Yeah. We're very happy with the biosimilar performance in diabetes. I don't have the trends specific for diabetes. I think when we talked about the 1.8% that was we saw adherence improving in that class. So as we look at the biosimilars that are coming to the market, most of them are in the medical benefit in the near term. And I think we're several years off from seeing biosimilars under the performance benefit. But when they come, we're very optimistic that we'll be able to leverage competition as we have been doing with our formulary strategies to dramatically reduce costs for our clients and their members. David Larsen : Okay. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: All right. Well, listen, we appreciate everybody's time this morning. We know it is a rather long call and we communicated a lot of information. And Mike McGuire is certainly available for any follow ups. So, thanks everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, August 8, 2018. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike McGuire, Senior Vice President-Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Michael P. McGuire: Thank you, Jose. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. As usual, I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO; and Dave Denton, CFO. Larry and Dave have a number of prepared remarks to share after which Jon Roberts, Chief Operating Officer, will join us to participate in the question and answer session. During the Q&A in order to provide more people with a chance to ask their questions, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up. In addition to this call and our press release, we have posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Our Form 10-Q was filed this morning before the call and that too is available on our website. Additionally, during this call we will make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views related to our future financial performance, future events, and industry and market conditions, and forward-looking statements related to the Aetna acquisition, including the expected consumer benefits, financial projections, synergies and the timing for the completion of the transaction. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what maybe indicated in the forward-looking statements. We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these specific risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-Q (sic) [Form 10-K] (00:02:00) and the cautionary statement disclosures in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings press release. During this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and the comparable GAAP measures in the associated reconciliation document we posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being webcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for one year. Now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo. Larry J. Merlo: Okay. Thanks Mike, and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. We're pleased with the solid performance of our business in the second quarter and our results year to date continue to validate our confidence in the strength of our model and the strong foundation in place as we bring CVS Health and Aetna together to transform the health care experience. Strong revenue, adjusted earnings per share, gross and operating margins along with cash flow demonstrate our success and driving value. Additionally, our enterprise streamlining efforts are continuing to deliver value through process improvements and technology enhancements and Dave will review our performance in detail. Now that said, we're clearly disappointed with our performance in the Omnicare business. And despite this disappointment, we continue to believe in the business's long-term prospects. And Dave will provide an Omnicare update focusing on the factors contributing to its current performance along with our plan to improve results and deliver on our expectations. We continue to believe in our ability to drive growth in this sector by improving our presence in the assisted and independent living areas. Now let me provide an update on how we are moving forward on the regulatory pathway and integration planning for our proposed Aetna acquisition. On the regulatory front, we continue to make excellent progress. Our highly experienced legal and government affairs teams are working hard, ensuring that we provide all the additional information requested by state regulators and the Department of Justice. To-date, a substantial number of states have approved and more are expected to approve this summer. In fact, several additional states have already held or scheduled hearings. You should also keep in mind that as a matter of practice some states prefer to wait for the DOJ decision before finalizing their approval. And as a result, we expect that a number of approvals will occur shortly after receipt of receipt of DOJ approval. And while I won't provide details on our interactions, I can tell you that we are having productive discussions with regulators. Now some of you may have seen a recent report concerning potential divestitures. And while I won't comment on the specifics of that report, you should keep in mind that when we announced the transaction last December, we contemplated a range of possibilities in the limited Med D PDP area in which both CVS and Aetna offer plans, and we determined the impact of any divestitures would not be material to the deal model. And with all of that said, we currently expect the transaction to close late Q3 or the early part of Q4. Now turning to integration planning, the work streams we have in place are making important progress against their objectives, which include ensuring a smooth transition and achieving the $750 million synergy goal for the second full-year of operation. At a high level, we are pressure testing our day one readiness, gaining a deeper understanding of each and every value opportunity across all of our customers, and ensuring organizational clarity while retaining high potential talent in critical roles. Key work streams are diligently gathering information to map out the future patient journeys within our combined company, assessing various interventions for efficacy and the most effective approaches to reducing medical costs. Our sales and account management teams are evaluating a broad range of possible offerings and developing plans to introduce those effectively in future selling seasons. And we are beginning to link the strengths of both analytics organizations as we develop a holistic view of the patient. Since our last earnings call we completed a milestone step in our journey to combine our companies when we announced the executive management team, that following the close of the acquisition, will lead the combined company. The talent of both organizations is reflected in the main management team. And I look forward to working alongside this outstanding group of individuals to transform how health care is delivered in our country. I would also like to thank those individuals who will not be continuing with us. They too have been instrumental to the success of both organizations. And we are extremely grateful for their contributions. And I especially want to thank Dave Denton for his outstanding leadership and contributions during the two decades he has spent at CVS. He's been a driving force behind the growth we've experienced. And the finance organization that he has assembled is first class. And I know that Dave's next chapter will be met with continued success. So we'll continue to update you on the progress of our integration activities as we work towards the closing. And there continues to be a genuine excitement among the teams from both companies in fulfilling the vision we share and our commitment to better health. Now last quarter, I highlighted our approach to chronic kidney disease and our Saving Patients Money program as examples of CVS Health innovating to improve the quality and lower the cost of care for our patients. Those are but two of the many innovations that we either have or will bring to market. And I want to quickly highlight another, because today we announced that MinuteClinic is offering video visits to its patients through the CVS Pharmacy app. This new telehealth service that leverages Teladoc's technology platform provides patients with access to care 24 hours a day, a referral to a nearby MinuteClinic or other provider is available, if needed, as is the ability for the provider to submit a prescription to the patient's preferred pharmacy, if warranted. The MinuteClinic team spent a great deal of time customizing the experience and patients will receive the same high quality evidence based care that they receive at our in-store clinic locations. So we're excited about the solutions we are bringing to market. And with that, let me turn it over to Dave to review the quarter. David M. Denton: Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll share some financial and business highlights and provide a brief update on our financial guidance for 2018. I won't go through all the details in my prepared remarks, but you can find the additional information in the slide presentation that we posted on our website and in our SEC filings. Overall, the company posted extremely strong financial performance in our core business as we met or exceeded all elements of our guidance in Q2. But before I go into that discussion, I want to begin by addressing the goodwill impairment charge that we took for the Omnicare business. We continue to see growth opportunities in the assisted living market, particularly as the most efficient operator in the space. That said, industry-wide financial challenges have created unexpected financial pressures on our facility clients, which has resulted in lower growth than we anticipated when we acquired the Omnicare business three years ago. The impairment was caused by several factors : higher levels of bad debt and longer collection times on receivables; a faster decline in facility reimbursement rates than we originally forecasted; and lower client retention rates. Additionally, bed census at skilled nursing facilities continued to track lower, resulting in fewer prescriptions across our platform. And despite a growing opportunity in the assisted living market, our programs to serve these clients have grown more slowly than we originally anticipated. In 2017, we disclosed that our annual goodwill impairment test of our long-term care reporting unit resulted in its fair value exceeding its carrying value only by a narrow margin. As a result, we've been closely monitoring the performance of the business for potential indicators of impairment. As we began our planning for our 2019 budget in the second quarter, we updated our 2018 forecast as well as our long-term outlook for the business to reflect our expectations of continued deterioration in our financial results. Given this, we believe that there were indicators of potential impairment. And as a result, it was necessary to perform an interim test of the long-term care business goodwill. The results showed that the fair value was now below its carrying value. Accordingly, we record a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $3.9 billion in the quarter, which reduced the goodwill associated with this business to $2.7 billion. This charge is excluded from any non-GAAP earnings measures going forward. The fair value of the business was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. Apparently \u2013 approximately one-third of the impairment charge is due to rising interest rates and challenged market multiples of our peer group. The remaining two-thirds of the charge resulted from lower than expected financial performance within the Omnicare business. As I said, we continue to believe in the strategic benefit of being a long-term care pharmacy operator and that we are best positioned to thrive longer term as the most efficient operator in the space. Let me outline the steps we are taking to put the business performance back on track. First, we have recently installed a new leadership team to manage Omnicare's day-to-day operation. The team is made up of individuals with expertise in the long-term care market, supplemented with operational talent from CVS Pharmacy. Second, the team is undertaking a broad initiative to enhance service levels with the objective of improving client retention levels. The team has already identified a series of near-term actions that should substantially enhance client retention rates with a target of 95% or better. Third, with the industry continuing to face financial challenges, being a low cost provider will be even more important. We are embarking upon a systemwide cost improvement effort, utilizing assets within both Omnicare and CVS Pharmacy to dramatically lower the cost-to-fill within the skilled nursing channel. The team is targeting $100 million to $150 million in cost takeout opportunities over the next several years to enhance process design, the implementation of automated technologies, and better leveraging our local presence at CVS Pharmacy to serve our skilled nursing facility clients. And finally, the assisted and independent living market remains an attractive long-term care \u2013 a long-term opportunity. Our enterprise product development team is rapidly innovating improved solutions to effectively serve this market and to substantially grow our penetration rate from approximately 50% to 70%. Our initial solutions have produced success in some markets. And we're looking to scale those up across our assisted living book of business. In addition to scaling these solutions, we expect to meet the evolving needs of facility operators, local residents and caregivers enabling us to grow our penetration and win new business. With our expansive network of local assets, we are best positioned to capture share in this market longer term. Again, we remain optimistic about Omnicare's long-term growth potential and its relevance to our value creation strategy. There is no doubt that as the population ages, there will be an increased need for long-term care services and support. We must execute on our initiatives, deliver high levels of patient and client service and drive additional efficiencies so that when the market does turn around, we are well-positioned to take advantage and grow. So, with that, now let me turn to a review of the other aspects of our performance for the quarter and I'll start, as I often do, with our capital allocation program. With approximately $4.4 billion in free cash generated through the second quarter, we are well on track to achieve our strong cash flow generation expectations of approximately $7 billion for the year. Due to the proposed Aetna acquisition and the associated debt we issued, we have suspended the share repurchase program and will be keeping our dividend flat until we achieve a leverage ratio of approximately 3 times adjusted debt to EBITDA. Recall that the combined company's pro forma trailing 12 months leverage ratio is expected to be approximately 4.6 times, post closing of the transaction. We are committed to improving this ratio to 3.5 times within two years after closing, utilizing our strong cash generation capabilities and savings from tax reform. Turning to the income statement, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.69 per share, an increase of 26.8% over last year and $0.05 above the high-end of our guidance range. These results were on a comparable basis and the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted EPS can be found in the press release as well as on the Investor Relations portion of our website. GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was a loss of $2.52 per share, which is a direct result of the goodwill impairment. A lower effective income tax rate combined with pharmacy share gains within the Retail/Long-Term Care segment drove the increase in adjusted EPS year-over-year. Now versus our expectations, the timing of PBM operating profits, interest and taxes each performed better, driving a $0.05 beat on adjusted earnings per share. On a consolidated basis, revenues grew 2.2% in the second quarter and were about 25 basis points above the high-end of our expectations. Gross profit, operating expenses, operating profit, net interest expense and the tax rate reflect non-GAAP adjustments in both current and prior periods where applicable and have been reconciled, again, on our website. Our guidance for the second quarter also reflected these adjustments. Gross margin for the consolidated company improved approximately 25 basis points over Q2 of 2017 due to segment mix, while total enterprise gross profit dollars increased 3.9%, in line with our expectations. Total operating expense dollars increased 3.5% also in line with our expectations. As Larry mentioned, our significant progress in our enterprise streamlining efforts through process improvements and technology enhancements continues. As an example, CVS Pharmacy completed the deployment of its enhanced automated prescription process and these enhancements have saved approximately 40% of the time spent, performing data entry and edits on e-prescriptions. As a result of our ongoing efforts, we still expect to generate approximately $475 million in gross benefits this year from streamlining. Operating profit for the enterprise was $2.4 billion increasing 4.6% versus LY and nearly 140 basis points above the high-end of expectations for the quarter. Additionally, operating margin was slightly higher versus a year ago and better than expectations. Going below-the-line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter improved year-over-year and was better than expected and our effective income tax rate significantly improved year-over-year due to tax reform. Our weighted average share count was in line with our expectations for the quarter. Now turning to the PBM segment, revenues grew 2.8% to $33.2 billion exceeding the high-end of our guidance by approximately 135 basis points. This outperformance was driven by a higher mix of specialty claims, which drove a higher average script price across the book. Growth in claims volumes and brand inflation drove the year-over-year increase, partially offset by continuing pricing pressures and an increase in our generic dispensing rate. Additionally, keep in mind that we are administering rebates this year for Aetna's Medicare Part D business as part of our existing PBM contract and that is dampening revenue growth. PBM adjusted claims grew by 6.5% largely driven by our strong net new business performance and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice. Our PBM gross margin remained relatively flat compared to Q2 of 2017 while gross profit dollars grew by 2.6%, exceeding our expectations despite implementation costs related to Anthem. The outperformance is due to timing of our client contractual requirements as well as favorable specialty volume. PBM operating expense dollars increased year-over-year, while operating expenses, as a percent of sales, deteriorated slightly. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by growth in the business, including acquisitions as well as the reinstatement of the Affordable Care Act health insurance fee this year. Given the outperformance on gross profit and to a lesser extent lower operating expenses, PBM operating profit contracted 2% and operating margin declined by approximately 15 basis points, both significantly better than we expected. Recall that last quarter we guided to a decline in PBM profitability arising from the timing of certain client commitments. The timing of those commitments changed, benefiting the second quarter and that \u2013 and impacting the business later this year. Looking at the 2019 selling season, we see fewer RFP opportunities in the market than what we have seen over the past few years. With this in mind, our current gross wins stand at approximately $1.8 billion with net new business of approximately $200 million. To-date we have completed more than 70% of our client renewals roughly in line with where we were at this time last year. And our current retention rate is slightly higher than the levels that we've seen in recent years. Additionally, recall that earlier this year we extended the FEP retail and mail contracts to the end of 2019. And today I'm happy to report that recently we were able to extend these contracts through the end of 2020, one year beyond what we had announced earlier this year. Last week we previewed our 2019 formulary strategy continuing to build on the success that we've had since 2012 when we introduced our new approach. Effective January 1, we plan to remove 23 products from our standard control formulary while adding back four products that have been removed in prior years. We anticipate that the vast majority of our members, in fact, over 98% will be able to stay on their current therapy. Since 2012 our formulary strategies have helped keep costs in check for our clients despite year-over-year price increases and at the same time they've helped to improve adherence. Turning to SilverScript, our Medicare Part D PDP, we currently serve 4.8 million captive lives in our individual PDP, 1.3 million captive EGWP lives and another 7.3 million lives through our health plan clients. So in total, Caremark serves 13.4 million Medicare Part D beneficiaries. Last week, we received the preliminary benchmark results from CMS for 2019, which showed that SilverScript qualified in 32 of 34 regions, remaining under the benchmark in 28 regions and de minimis in four regions. These strong benchmark results enable us to retain all of the auto-assignees that we currently serve and qualify us to receive new auto-assignees in those 28 regions in which we are under the benchmark. All-in-all the 2019 marketplace looks to be very competitive, but we are very pleased with these results. We'll know more about the competitive positioning and auto-assignee expectations once CMS releases the landscape file in late September. Within our Retail/Long-Term Care business, revenues increased 5.7% to $20.7 billion in line with expectations. This is primarily driven by very strong script volume growth of 9.3% for the quarter. This growth was due to the continued adoption of our Patient Care Programs, success from partnering with PBMs and health plans across the industry, and our preferred position in a number of Medicare Part D networks this year. As demonstrated in our results, our efforts to expand our relationships with other PBMs and health plans has progressed well and we continue to see opportunities moving forward. In total, our initiatives are driving growth of adjusted scripts dispense and as a result our retail market share has increased by about 180 basis points in the quarter to 25.2%. Same store sales grew 5.9% in line with expectations while adjusted same store prescription growth of 9.5% came in 25 basis points above the high end of our guidance. Front store same store sales declined 1%, but were negatively impacted by about 90 basis points from the calendar shift of the Easter holiday from Q2 of last year to Q1 of this year. After adjusting for this, front store same store sales were essentially flat to LY. Gross margin in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment was down approximately 50 basis points to 28.6%. This contraction was driven by continued pressure on reimbursement rates. The decline was partially offset by an increase in GDR as well as improvements in the front store margin rate driven by strong health and beauty sales. Gross profit dollars grew in line with expectations, mainly due to increased script volume and generic introductions, as well as improvements in purchasing through Red Oak Sourcing. Retail's operating expenses were in line with expectations for the quarter. The growth in expenses year-over-year were primarily due to investments in the business to drive revenue growth as well as increases in expenses related to script volume. Operating profit dollars grew 7.3% to $1.7 billion within Retail/Long-Term Care, while operating margin increased 10 basis points to 8.2%, both in line with our expectations. Within the Corporate segment, expenses declined year-over-year and were lower than expected primarily due to the shift in timing of cost related to the enterprise streamlining effort. So we're continuing to drive success against the four-point plan that we introduced last year to return to healthy growth. We are generating script growth from our expanded relationships with PBM and health plans and we continue to innovate and we are reaping the benefits of our streamlining effort. However, we are obviously disappointed with the performance of long-term care, but we believe we have a solid management structure and a plan for improving that business. So with that, let me provide an update on our outlook for 2018 before turning it back over to Larry. I'll focus on the highlights here, but you can find additional details in the slide presentation that we posted on the website earlier today. As we have stated previously, for guidance purposes only, we are assuming that the proposed Aetna transaction closes at the end of 2018. By doing so, we are not including any expectations of results of Aetna's operations in our 2018 estimates. Also keep in mind that all financing fees, interest, transaction and integration costs related to the deal are excluded from our adjusted figures. For the full-year 2018, we are narrowing and raising the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance range to $6.98 to $7.08 per share, representing growth of 18.25% to 20%. The significant growth in adjusted EPS is largely related to the benefit received from tax reform. We are also narrowing the range for GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations and adjusting it to reflect a long-term care goodwill impairment charge. So we now expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50 per share. And you can find a reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted EPS in our press release and on the Investor Relations portion of our website. With half the year behind us we are updating our revenue and consolidated operating profit guidance. Consolidated revenue growth is now expected to be 1.5% to 2. 5%. Within the PBM segment, we are narrowing the range to 2.25% to 3.25% given an increase in our expectation of specialty revenues and maintaining our adjusted claims expectation of approximately 1.9 billion claims. For the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we now expect revenue growth of 4.75% to 5.5% and same-store sales growth of 5% to 5.75%, due to continued strong performance through the second quarter. Pharmacy same-store scripts are now expected to grow 8.25% to 9.25%, an improvement of 100 basis points over prior expectations. We continue to see a large benefit from the broader relationships we've established last year with payors as well as our expanded participation as a preferred provider in various Part D networks. Moving to operating profit, we have tightened the full-year 2018 adjusted consolidated operating profit to down 0.75%, to up 0.75%. For the segments, we continue to expect PBM adjusted operating profit in the low-to-mid-single digits and Retail/Long-Term Care operating profit to be down low-single digits. Going below the line, net interest expense of our existing portfolio debt is expected to be approximately $1 billion, slightly better than our previous estimate. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 27% for 2018. Now let me touch on the earning cadence we expect for the third and fourth quarters. As I discussed on the last earnings call, enterprise operating profit growth is expected to be weighted more to the front half of this year. There are few factors driving this. First, the $275 million investment of tax savings will be spent predominantly in the back half of the year and the vast majority of that is in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment. Second, the Retail segment has made better progress than expected on its pharmacy initiatives during the first half, while also having a very strong flu season. Third, the challenges in the Long-Term Care business weigh more heavily on our second half Retail/Long-Term Care growth expectations. And finally, we have the timing shift of the PBM client contractual commitments moving into the back half of this year. Turning to Q3, we expect adjusted EPS in the third quarter to be in the range of $1.68 to $1.73 per share, reflecting an increase of 12.5% to 15.5% versus Q3 of 2017. Tax reform will continue to be a major contributor to the increase. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.29 to $1.34. Non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter excludes certain items described in the non-GAAP reconciliation posted on our website. Consolidated revenues in Q3 are expected to grow 1% to 2.75%, while consolidated operating profit is expected to decline 2.5% to 5%. Within the Retail segment, we expect revenue growth in the range of 4.5% to 6% and the change in operating profit to be down mid-single digits. Total same store sales at Retail are expected to be 4.75% to 6.25% and adjusted script comps are expected to be 8.75% to 9.75%. Despite strong year-over-year growth in volumes for the retail pharmacy, continued reimbursement pressures, the timing of generic launches, the investment of tax reform savings and the long-term care challenges are driving the decline in profits during the third quarter. In the PBM segment, we expect third quarter revenue growth to be up 1.5% to 3.25% and operating profit growth to be flat to up low-single digits. Similar to last quarter, the year-over-year increase \u2013 the year-over-year results are being affected by investments we are making to support the Anthem implementation as well as the timing of certain client contractual commitments. We expect that the efforts we are making today to address our challenges and to invest in the advancement of new programs will place our company at the forefront of the evolving health care landscape. And with that, let me now turn it back over to Larry. Larry J. Merlo: Well, thanks, Dave. Before we open up for Q&A, I want to talk briefly about a couple of topics, because in recent discussions with shareholders, there are two broad industry themes that seem to be top of mind. One is government action on drug pricing and rebates and a second, the competitive landscape given the possibility of new entrants. So let me touch on both. And I'll begin with the conversation around drug pricing. We see the impact rising drug costs have on plan members and patients every day. And we use every innovative tool possible to bring down the cost of drugs. We do that through highly effective clinical programs, innovative purchasing and formulary design and enhanced data analytics that allow us to provide the right drug to the right patient at the right time at the lowest possible cost. Now the current debate regarding drug pricing and the role of PBMs centers on rebates and the impact of out of pocket costs on consumers at the pharmacy counter. Drug manufacturers want you to believe that increasing drug prices are a result of them having to pay rebates and that PBMs are retaining these rebates. And this is simply not true. If list prices were the result of a manufacturer's need to address rebates, then you would expect rebates and list prices to be highly correlated. And to the contrary, our data show that list price is increasing faster for drugs with small rebates than it is for medications with substantial rebates. And this makes intuitive sense as the products with small rebates are more likely to be in uncompetitive drug classes, where there is less incentive for manufacturers to compete on price. Rebates are maximized only when there are therapeutically equivalent competitor products in a drug class. And it's that dynamic that allows for formulary placement that drives lower costs. So let me be clear. The idea that rebate retention is correlated with higher drug prices is entirely false. And while some have speculated that our retained rebates represent as much as $2 billion, the simple fact is that over the last number of years, we have positioned the Caremark model and its broader value proposition to the point where in 2018, we expect retained rebates to be about $300 million, or about 3% of our annual adjusted earnings per share. Competition among PBMs means more and more rebates are going and will continue to go back to clients. And this is a good thing. It demonstrates that the market techniques used by PBMs do in fact work. And no matter what may happen to the ability to rebate, PBMs will still be needed to drive discounts and cost savings for their clients and members. And the PBM model will continue to evolve as a result. Today, we underwrite our contracts to an overall level of profitability. And there are many levers available to us depending on the preferences of the client. Nevertheless, the amount of rebates we retain is a relatively small cost for the value we provide through our formulary negotiation. Tens of billions of dollars of rebates generated, the overwhelming majority of which are passed back to clients and their members. Let's also be clear about what happens with the rebates that are passed to clients. Our clients, employers and insurers use rebates to lower the costs of providing insurance for their employees and members. And typically this means investing in insurance premiums to keep growth for all members to a minimum. As an alternative, we do offer rebates at the point of sale as an option for all clients. And in addition to helping members reduce their out-of-pocket costs, this program underscores the true cause of rising drug prices at the pharmacy counter, and that is prices set by manufacturers. For members in high deductible health plans, the availability of point of sale rebates before their deductible is met can be a key solution to help members stay adherent on their essential medications by making them more affordable. And today, we provide this service for approximately 10 million of our commercial members. This is what's getting lost in this debate, the fact that we have been able to improve adherence and keep drug cost inflation under control using key PBM techniques. Last year drug price growth for our clients was only 0.2% on a per capita basis, despite AWP inflation of nearly 10%. And improvements in member adherence actually reduced overall health care costs by some $600 million. And these statistics underscore that we are controlling costs, while promoting better health through greater adherence to medications. Now as everyone knows, the administration released American Patients First, the President's blueprint to lower drug prices. And we support the administration's goal to lower prices and reduce out-of-pocket costs for consumers. Several weeks ago, we submitted our response to the blueprint, and I encourage you to use the link in our slides to review our perspective. Because in it we highlight what we, as a company, do to help bring down drug costs and steps the government could consider. And I will tell you there are many elements in the blueprint that are extremely complementary to current PBM capabilities and in fact would enable us to do more, not less. And yesterday afternoon's announcement by CMS to allow Medicare Advantage plans to use PBM tools for Part B drugs shows that the administration recognizes that PBMs have a key role to play in lowering drug costs. And CVS Health is very well situated to help MA and MA-PD plans develop these solutions through our extensive enterprise assets, including our NovoLogix business, which currently helps our clients manage drugs under the medical benefit. So we have great confidence in the substantial role we will continue to play in driving efficiencies on behalf of our clients. Our PBM techniques for reducing costs are working as demonstrated by drug costs for our clients essentially remaining flat. We've realized that the most important thing we can do for our clients is ensure people take their medications, because doing so, improves health and it lowers costs. And we're certainly not standing still. We continue to develop and implement new initiatives to ensure that patients can get the medications they need and ultimately this is the value proposition that the administration needs to consider. And for a more in-depth discussion regarding our approaches to making drugs more affordable, I encourage you to read our white paper on this topic, which we are releasing this morning on our Payor Solutions website. And you can also find the link on the Earnings section of the IR website. Now I'd also like to take a moment to share our thoughts on the competitive landscape. We all know health care delivery is changing before our eyes. We're excited to be in the vanguard of that change and not just in light of our transaction with Aetna. Our distinctive position is the result of several longstanding core competencies that set us apart from others in fundamental and critical ways. First, we deliver quality health care to patients in more ways and in more settings than anyone else. Online and mail order pharmacy has existed for many years and CVS Health dispenses millions of scripts this way for patients each and every week. But our delivery model goes well beyond that foundation in ways that are very hard to build or replicate. Whether it's providing in person infusion services at a patient's home, placing a prescription refill through our mobile app to be picked up at any of our 9,800 locations or having your physician send a script electronically to be delivered directly to your doorstep, we offer the diversity of delivery options that patients need. You see we have the right footprint, we have the specialized supply chain and we have the right group of professionals to deliver care in a range of settings that patients and the health care system require. Second, with a physical presence in almost every community across the country, we have the unique ability to meet patients where they are and provide the care and services they need either face to face or with the unique set of virtual and physical delivery service capabilities that extends our physical presence in real time to meet their needs. You see, it's not simply about selling products it's about delivering quality care and driving superior outcomes, both of which require expertise that our clients and members have come to trust. For example, we promote medication adherence. We close gaps in care through our Pharmacy Advisor program, where we engage face to face with patients who are diagnosed with chronic conditions. We've integrated our rare disease management with our specialty pharmacy, so we now have nurses who are acting as care managers working closely with our pharmacists, providing real synergy in terms of making sure that people are taking their medications and adopting behaviors that avoid unintended medical events and related costs. Our MinuteClinics not only help diagnose and treat minor health conditions but also provide chronic care management to keep patients healthier and help reduce wasteful spending. Our PBM business has deep, longstanding relationships in the industry, it helps thousands of payors and plan sponsors design more effective plans to help keep drug trend low. So only a company with these capabilities can take the next step in care delivery, which is integrating our capabilities and services to further lower costs and improve outcomes. And to effectively compete in the future health care system, and to complement existing physician services, new capabilities will be required. New ways of identifying and engaging patients to drive beneficial behavior changes will be critical to lowering medical costs for patients and payors and Aetna helps us accomplish this. Lower cost models of care delivery will be crucial given the margin compression we see and the inevitable shift to value-based care and Aetna also helps us accomplish this. So we welcome competition. We expect more of it in the years to come and we are confident that we ourselves are key disruptors and pivotal players in helping to define that new landscape. And together, CVS Health and Aetna will help address the challenges our health care system is facing and we'll be able to offer better care and convenience at a lower cost. And that's why we are excited about CVS Health and why we believe the pending transaction will accelerate our progress towards this goal. So with that let's now go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Please proceed. Lisa C. Gill: Thanks very much. And Larry, thank you for all your comments here towards the end of the call. I just want to better understand where you stand on your conversations with the administration. Clearly, President Trump has met with CEOs from both Pfizer and Merck. I'm wondering if you've had any conversations, number one. And number two, how do we reconcile everything you said and the way the administration seems to be talking about this? And then in July your response to the RFI and the blueprint said that you return 95% of rebates to commercial clients and members. Today you're saying 97%. And I think historically you talked about returning more than 10%. Is it just that the commercial market is changing that quickly as far as contracting goes? I just want to understand how to reconcile those numbers. Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Lisa, I'll start and I know others will jump in here. Thanks for the question. But, Lisa, it is true that as we stated in our prepared remarks that more of the value of negotiated rebates are being passed back to clients. And keep in mind, we've been saying for a while now that we have different flavors of contracting where we've had clients for a while now that prefer to have 100% of that rebate value passed back. So that is a trend that has continued. And again, as we said, we underwrite our PBM contracts to an overall level of profitability. So, Lisa, if you triangulate all of the numbers that we threw out there for 2018 that rebate pass-through is closer to 98%, okay, than some of the others that we had historically talked about. Lisa, your second question around interaction with the administration, we have had productive engagement and discussions with the administration, on the Hill, at the secretary's office. And I do believe for reasons that we talked about and reasons that you see outlined in the President's blueprint, there is an acknowledgment as to the role that PBMs play. And again I think yesterday afternoon's CMS announcement is just another example of that. So I'm sure those conversations will continue. And, Lisa, I think that as we talked again in the prepared remarks, this \u00fcber focus on rebates, what we believe, Lisa, wherever we end up because the administration hasn't finished the story in terms of what their desire is on rebates, but what will not go away is the ability for PBMs to use size, scale, competition, private sector innovation to garner discounts that lower the cost of medications for clients and their members. Lisa C. Gill: And so as we think about that you brought a value-based care a number of times. And then as we've talked to people in D.C., it sounds like the administration wants to move away from this word of rebates. And this relationship, as you talked about, of the gross to net and this whole idea that the system is paid on rebates, how would you envision a value based program in government? And are you or Jon seeing this in the commercial market that what I've heard from some people is that the commercial market is actually ahead of where Medicare is. And you can take some current commercial market programs and bring it to the government and bypass this whole idea around rebates, but yet to your point, still be able to have a reasonable amount of profitability for the PBM while saving the government money. So just any thoughts you have around that would be great. And then just lastly, I want to say Dave, it's been great working with you and if the transaction closes, I really wish you all the best. David M. Denton: Thank you, Lisa. Larry J. Merlo: Well, Lisa, listen, I think there are a number of different pilots or programs around value-based care today. And I think that folks are still testing and learning. I don't \u2013 I would sit here and say as we sit here today, I don't know that there is one that has gotten any type of substantial traction in the marketplace. And we're going to continue to be part of that solution and pilot and see what we can do to push the ball up the court because we do believe that that's where the marketplace ultimately has to go. Jonathan C. Roberts: And, Lisa, this is Jon. So we have a lot of value-based contracts. I would say they're pretty comparable to the traditional contracts we have in the marketplace and there really hasn't been as much uptake as we would like to see. I do think that the market will move there. And the thing I like about it is it aligns incentives for the payors, for us and for the pharmaceutical manufacturers. And I think as Aetna comes onboard and we now own the entire life (00:51:12) combined with our data capabilities, we're going to have the ability to really advance this value-based contracting notion in the commercial space and we'll bring that to CMS and hopefully they'll learn from our results and adopt it over time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Please proceed. Ann Hynes : Hi. Good morning. Larry J. Merlo: Good morning, Ann. Ann Hynes : So, I want to thank you for disclosing rebates-only account for 3% of earnings, in fact that it's that low is probably an understatement on what the Street views the impact was. But I'm going to ask some non-rebate questions. Could we \u2013 on the federal employees' contract, congratulations on extending that, because I know it's a big contract for you and the government seems to continue to extend that with you rather than put it out for RFP. Do you have any color on why that continues to happen? Jonathan C. Roberts: Ann, this is Jon. It's just a one year extension and through 2020, we would expect them to go out to RFP at that point. So I think it's pretty typical of what we've seen with them over the years and we've got a great relationship with FEP and we hope to continue to serve them in the years to come. Larry J. Merlo: And Ann, listen, I also think it underscores the high level of service and value that FEP has come to count on us for and we expect that that will continue as we go forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please proceed. Charles Rhyee : Hey. Thanks for taking the question guys. Hey, Larry, you mentioned that the retention rate here is ahead of where you were in recent years. Obviously, that's \u2013 it's good news here despite some concern \u2013 I think there's been some concerns that with the Aetna transaction in process, you're going to have some disruption in the business. Is this a good indicator from your current customers that they're looking at the transaction in a positive light? Larry J. Merlo: Charles, as I say, it's a great question. And I think it's really a function of two factors. I think one is the point that you just made that I think there's a lot of interest in terms of what we can bring to market with CVS Health and Aetna and how that can benefit some of our existing clients, especially in the health plan space. And I think the second one is what we've talked about previously, what Dave outlined in his remarks that RFP activity has been lower this year. And I think with all of the activity in the marketplace, I do think that there are clients that want to see where everything shakes out as they think about longer term commitments that are typically associated with contracting. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Hill of RBC. Please proceed with your question. George Hill : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. And Dave, best wishes in new endeavors. It's been a lot of fun. I guess, Larry, I would start off with the proposed rule last night, or the step edit rules that it looks like we're going to get from Med B to Med D (00:54:38). I guess can you talk about how you think about the opportunity there? And how is that opportunity enhanced through the Aetna acquisition? And then, I guess I would just ask if you could comment on given that tumultuous regulatory environment, have you seen anything either in proposed rules or in announced rules that either I guess kind of makes you \u2013 do you see new opportunities or new challenges as it relates to the transaction? Would just love comments around that. Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, George, on your first question, we see the proposed rule from CMS last night as being a real opportunity for us and probably an even bigger opportunity as CVS and Aetna come together because it picks up a component of the business that largely has been isolated to the medical side of the house, if you will. And the point that I had made earlier that the NovoLogix capabilities that we have resident today that have proven to be able to bring, I'll call it, the management of that portion of pharmacy flowing through the medical spend to treat that with the same diligence that we do with the traditional pharmacy spend, we think that that is a significant opportunity, obviously first in the Medicare space. And I think it will be interesting to see if that moves into the commercial sector in terms of the pace with which that would happen. George, your second comment, I guess when you asked that question I think of some of Dr. Gottlieb's comments coming out of the FDA in terms of his focus in terms of removing what has been a significant backlog for potential drug approvals, especially generics, as well as his focus on getting more biosimilars into the marketplace. And today, we've got four in the marketplace. We currently have two of those biosimilars in our formulary and are working to add to that list. And you compare that to Europe where you have over 50 biosimilars in the market. So both of those, again, it falls under the heading of giving PBMs more bandwidth with the tools that they have to further reduce drug costs. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Michael Cherny : Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. So I want to dive in a little bit more as you think about the changes going on in Washington. You talked about the conversations you're having with various members of HHS. As you think about some of the other pieces of the blueprint and what gets you most excited for the business model, what are your clients telling you that they essentially hope comes through? Is there any feedback interaction with them on the blueprint on the drug pricing side, where they're saying, we hope there is a encouragement of this. I know value-based contracting was asked earlier, but anything else where you think that aside from the Part B conversation that there's value that you think can be unlocked as this blueprint gets put into place? Jonathan C. Roberts: Mike, this is Jon. Our clients are actually very happy with the benefit that we've been managing for them. So they saw their costs grow on average 1.9% last year. They know they're getting the majority of rebates. They understand that pharma is responsible for raising prices and we're working on their behalf to manage that down. So I think if anything, they're interested in more transparency as we move forward. And we embrace that and we think that's a great idea. And I think today is the first step as we talk about how much we're retaining in rebates is another step forward in that transparency journey. Larry J. Merlo: And, Mike, it's Larry. I think that clients rely on us to separate, to pore through the detail of all that. Obviously, they want to continue to see more opportunities. To Jon's point, they see what we're doing today. And are there opportunities beyond what we're doing today? Again, some of that goes back to how we bring them solutions. And listen, as one example, we're encouraging our clients that have high deductible plans to take a portion of those rebate dollars and pass them back to their members at the pharmacy counter, while they're in that deductible phase. Once they hit the deductible phase, then they fall into the plan design, where their out of pocket costs dramatically go down. So I think in many respects, the responsibility falls to us as we help educate them in terms of ways that we can help them reduce costs but at the same time improve satisfaction among their members. Jonathan C. Roberts: And, Mike, the only thing I would add to that is as clients talk about their highest priority, it's really around what they're seeing with specialty cost growth. So they would like to see more biosimilars get to the market much faster than what is currently occurring. That's pretty uniform as we're out in the marketplace. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi. Good morning and congrats on good results. So I have two questions here. First of all, Larry, to your point, consumer cost at point of sales is really at the core of the brand price debate. So how long do you think after closing the transaction, do you expect to be able to offer plan design that will lower consumer cost at the front end? And will really kind of like look at the benefit design from the entire life of the member that Jon referred to earlier? So is this something that we are going to start to see materializing in the 2019 selling season? So that's question one. Second question is around your script growth. I mean you've done a great job translating the preferred networks that you signed late last year with increased volume and market share. When we think ahead, SilverScript Plus remained an open network. Are you planning to move to a preferred network following the lead of what you've done with SilverScript Choice? And what other preferred network opportunities you're seeing for next year? David M. Denton: Hey, Ricky, this is Dave. Maybe I'll take the script growth perspective and Larry will come back to the first piece. Keep in mind that our script growth is really coming in three buckets, and each of those buckets is really supporting our growth in the market. One of them is our \u2013 how we're partnering with payors and health plans across the industry, so that's contributing nicely. And our relationships with Part D providers are a part of that. Secondly, organically, we're just taking share in the marketplace as our service and metrics and performance out in the marketplace have done really well. And we continue to garner share from all the participants. And then finally, we have a very robust clinical program. Our patient care initiatives are improving adherence for our members, and that's driving script utilization and share gains in the marketplace. So all three of those components are really important. So we've talked about \u2013 your question is really around one, and we'll continue to focus on that. But that's not the only contributor to our growth. Jonathan C. Roberts: And, Ricky, this is Jon. SilverScript has two plans and both plans have a preferred pharmacy network as part of their designs. So that happened in 2018 for the large SilverScript Part D plan. Larry J. Merlo: And then, Ricky, back to your first question, in terms of new products, plan designs, I think it's probably more realistic that those innovations would find their way into the market for the 2020 selling season. But give Aetna a lot of credit, because you may recall, I think, it was a few months ago they announced in \u2013 specific to your question on point of sale rebates, they had announced that in their fully insured book of business that they were going to be applying point of sale rebates to that segment of their business. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Steven J. Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning, Larry and Dave. I will also echo that the disclosure around the rebates is definitely helpful to clear the air. And the takeaway just seems to be that you're probably not losing much sleep on the notion of rebate elimination, potentially morphing beyond Medicare and into the commercial segment. That seems to be what some investors are focused on. So I guess just my quick question around that is the rebate footnote suggests that the $300 million excludes SilverScript. Maybe just to quickly clarify, is the $300 million, is it more heavily weighted to commercial related rebates? I think you said there's some MA-PD in there, but curious on the weighting of that. And also, is SilverScript being excluded because it's primarily just an intercompany number? Just curious on the thought pattern on not having SilverScript, thanks. David M. Denton: Yeah. So just to be clear, the $300 million retention is for commercial, all of our commercial rebates. All of our Medicare, think about them as 100% pass-through because they support the bid and the premium, so there's no retention on that at all. So $300 million would be the impact of both Medicare and commercial because there's no retention on Medicare. Larry J. Merlo: And, Steve, to Dave's last point, we talked about our results of the benchmarking process. But, yeah, I think what's interesting to note, obviously you have to preface this by saying it's competition in the private sector. But you look at what's happening to beneficiary costs and even government costs, okay? And the bid levels have an 11% reduction over the prior year and \u2013 both for beneficiary as well as the government. So you may point to competition, but you also have to point to the value of rebates in contributing to those numbers as well. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. Two questions here and a broader question on the PBM. I guess, at this point how would you rank, I guess, outside of rebates \u2013 and that was great color that you gave. But what those core profit drivers are for your PBM business at this point and how that kind of evolves under the new regulatory environment and what you think actually could play out? And then on Omnicare, you mentioned new leadership and other initiatives. I guess what needs to be done there, or how quickly can you address some of the challenges there? And what is that longer term growth and profit prospects for the Long-Term Care business and how those expectations changed? Thanks David M. Denton: So maybe \u2013 this is Dave. I'll talk a little bit about PBM. Obviously the growth in the PBM has been, over the last several years, we continue to see this over the next future periods, especially continues to be a nice driver into this business. Obviously the movement as has always been moving from branded drug to generic drug is a big driver of growth in our business model in the PBM, but importantly our business in totality. So we still think there's opportunities as new generics come to the market to improve our performance from a generic perspective. And then finally, we do believe that the innovative solutions and products that we have in the market that can support essentially a mail order platform with the convenience of a retail outlet i.e. CVS Pharmacy, is a big opportunity for us to continue to enhance and grow earnings over time. So with that, I'll turn it over to Jon. Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah. Erin, this is Jon. I'll talk about Omnicare. So Dave talked about our four-point plan and he talked about the new management team that's in place. So I'll focus on where we see a lot of the growth opportunity, which is assisted living and not only growing new beds, we're growing penetration. So as we have been working to grow this business what we found is that the Omnicare service model was not optimal for assisted living. It was really built to service long-term care. And long-term care is facility focused. As an example, all members for the facility are serviced on a same day except when there is a stat order. In assisted living model, think about it as being more member-centric. So these residents order their prescriptions very similar to what we see in Retail. So, not all members receive their orders on the same day in that facility, they call them in as they need them. So we needed to change the front-end of our pharmacies to service these members. And so we're building assisted living centers of excellence and we have three of these in operation and we'll complete the rollout by year-end. And I talked at our last earnings calls, how we had invested in account management resources to work directly with facility managers and their residence to improve our service and penetration of the facilities. So early results where we have this model fully in place are positive and we're confident that this service model will enable us to achieve our goals in assisted living. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe of Citi. Please proceed with your question. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. Talked a lot this morning about sort of the evolution of the PBM and you talked about value-based care, but then you also mentioned sort of not much uptake. So with that as the case, one, what would drive that uptake? And then the second piece of that, what's your interest in sort of taking more risk on the PBM side? Could you give us a sense of what percentage of the business you do that on currently? And do you ultimately think that's the biggest change from the current model sort of meeting more trend guarantees and the like? Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: Yeah. Ralph, its Larry. I think it's a great question. And as you look at where we have risk today, obviously the SilverScript is a risk-based product, okay? And we've begun to take \u2013 I'll describe it as elements of risk with our Transform Care program which started with diabetes and I think we've now expanded it to three other chronic diseases. So I do think that we have a growing appetite, okay, to move in that direction. And I believe that the combination of CVS and Aetna can serve as an enabler to doing more of that as we go forward. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of John Ransom of Raymond James. Please proceed. John W. Ransom: Hi. Sorry for the airport noise. But beyond the rebates, could you talk about the process of re-contracting if gross prices on branded drugs change? And I'm thinking about downstream with PBM and upstream with your retail drug stores, how long that would take? On a 1 to 10, how disruptive that might be? Thanks. David M. Denton: Well, John, this is Dave. We've obviously \u2013 when the industry has changed in the past, I can go back to when AWP rules changed, we went back and recontracted our entire network to conform to new standards of the industry. I would anticipate that if the market were to change in a dramatic fashion, we would have the same opportunity to do that. And I think our contractual structures at this point allow us that flexibility. Jonathan C. Roberts: Hey, John, this is Jon. So if something were to change and Medicare, as an example, those are annual bids so \u2013 and we actually recontract every year with pharmas and the retail networks. So we think we could do that within a year. I think when you think about the commercial market if things were to change, I think it would happen over a much longer period of time and I think we would have plenty of time to pivot to how the market evolves as a result of those changes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher of Nephron Research. Please proceed with your question. Eric Percher : Thank you. Thinking about the comments you made on the blueprint and squaring that with $300 million of rebates and I wonder if there was any thought to being more aggressive in your proposals and suggesting that we move towards a system where 100% of rebates must be passed back to the payor, whether it's government or commercial were fairly close. And I would think that would put the onus on pharma to address price increases and on payors to address, how much of the rebate goes toward may be plan cost versus consumer cost share or rebates. What are your thoughts on how that might be detrimental or beneficial? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Eric, listen, I think we have always worked to be as flexible as we can in terms of meeting the diverse needs that exists with our clients. And as we acknowledged earlier, today we've got many contracts with 100% value of the rebates being passed back directly to them. As you know, Medicare Part D works that way today, okay? And I do believe that one of the challenges that we need to solve for is as you think about the plan designs, okay, especially \u2013 we acknowledged earlier those with high deductible plans, okay, that how do we take care of those members, those patients customers who were in the deductible phase, okay, and are incurring costs? Because oftentimes, it's the pharmacy spend within their plan that \u2013 that's where the dollars are spent to go and meet their deductible. And that's why we advocate for at a minimum that let's apply some of those rebates at the point of sale, while people are in their deductible phase. And once they've satisfied that then the balance of those rebates can be applied by plan sponsors to buy down premiums et cetera, et cetera. So that's where our focus has been along with expanding the definition of HSAs, okay, the use and utilization of preventive drug lists that again can reduce consumer out of pocket costs. So in response to the blueprint, we've spent a tremendous amount of time on those elements as quite frankly opportunities could be brought to market sooner than later. All right, Jose, we'll take two more questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Patrick Jones : Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just two quick clarification questions. I know we spent a lot of time on rebates and the trend there, Larry, but I guess just making it a little bit more simple to think about, outside of Part D, if a client choosed a full pass-through rebate contract with you versus one that was maybe more traditional when you were keeping some of that rebate, what is the difference in operating profitability in those two types of arrangements, or are they really kind of a wash? And then just one other clarification on the retention rate. If I back out the FEP extension, it actually does look like \u2013 if my math is right here, it actually looks like the retention might have been a bit lower actually than what you've seen in recent years. So just was \u2013 want to make sure I was looking at the math right there. And if that is the case, any commonalities for why maybe some clients had choose to leave? David M. Denton: Yeah. Hey, Bob, this is Dave. Retention rate is actually higher this year, year-to-date than it has been in past with and without FEP. So I think that's \u2013 there must be something wrong with the math there. Our client retention has been extremely strong. We're very pleased with our progress at this point in time. And I can't really comment on the profit margin on those clients. Each client obviously is underwritten by \u2013 with a target margin rate and we're very focused on maintaining that rate. And we have been successful with clients who have full pass-through and clients who may have an incentive for us to do better in a rebate than a shared savings. So we've been very successful in both models. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed. John Heinbockel : So guys two questions. Just do you guys have a sense given the strategic change, right, we're seeing in a lot of these models, how long that will dampen RFP activity? And beyond that, switching, people may put out an RFP but may decide to stick with their existing PBM for a longer time to sort of feel out some of these changes. What's your sense on that time? And then secondly, specialty grew how much in the quarter? Maybe it was in there, but I didn't see it. Larry J. Merlo: Yeah John, its Larry. I'll take the first one. And John, listen, I don't know that we can sit here and answer that question, today. I think some of it is going to be based on bringing closure to the variety of activities and questions that exists in the marketplace. And I think that that's probably the key driver to people taking more of a long-term view in terms of understanding how the future marketplace lines up. And then in terms of specialty, our growth in the quarter was... David M. Denton: Just the low- to mid-single digits, in that ZIP code. Larry J. Merlo: And John, keep in mind that that would include the loss of the FEP specialty business. David M. Denton: That's right. Yeah. Larry J. Merlo: Okay and in terms of that number being somewhat depressed from prior years. John Heinbockel : Okay. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: So with that, listen, I know it's been a long call this morning. We appreciate everybody's patience. But obviously there was a lot to talk about and a lot of information to disseminate and as always, Mike McGuire is available for follow-up. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Michael P. McGuire: Good morning, everyone. I'm Mike McGuire, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for CVS Health. Thanks for standing by and thanks for joining us for our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded on Tuesday, November 6, 2018. In addition to this call and our press release, we have posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Our Form 10-Q will be filed at the end of the day today and that too will be available on our website. After prepared remarks, we'll be opening the call up for Q&A. In order to provide more people with the chance to ask their questions, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up. During this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views related to our future financial performance, future events and industry and market conditions as well as the expected consumer benefits, financial projections and synergies from the soon to be completed acquisition of Aetna. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what maybe indicated in the forward-looking statements. We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these specific risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and the cautionary statement disclosures in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings press release. Additionally, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance during this call. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and the comparable GAAP measures in the associated reconciliation document to be posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being webcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year. Now, I'll turn this over to our President and CEO, Larry Merlo. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Mike. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. We're pleased with the solid performance of our business in the third quarter, and strong revenue and adjusted earnings per share along with significant cash flow year-to-date demonstrate our success in driving value. And I would note that Aetna reported its quarterly results on October 30, which were also strong. And the performance of both companies highlights the very solid financial foundation on which we will build our revolutionary new model, which will transform the health care experience for consumers and, in the process, deliver substantial value for our shareholders. Now as most of you know, we received Department of Justice approval of the transaction on October 10 and we're now in the final stages of the state approval process. Of the 28 states, we have approvals in 23 including Connecticut, our lead regulator, and we're well down the line with the remaining five and expect to close prior to Thanksgiving. In the meantime, our integration work continues to make great progress and our teams are working extremely well together to assure that once final approvals are obtained, we can immediately begin to execute our integration plans. Both CVS and Aetna are passionate about revolutionizing the consumer health care experience and while we have been clear that the cost savings are substantial, this transaction is about the significant value creation that will be realized as a result of growth. We'll be able to share more of the specifics after our two teams come together to begin the real groundbreaking work, but we thought it would be helpful to get a bit more granular by highlighting the work streams we have underway. And our integration and innovation teams' immediate priorities in preparation for close fall into two broad categories : first, is successfully delivering on our stated goal for year-two synergies; and a second is executing on the foundational pieces of our new health care model to achieve longer-term growth and value creation. Today, we have a clear line of sight into year-two synergies that now exceed our original $750 million goal by just combining our existing assets and capabilities. The majority of these synergies will be derived from the reduction of corporate expenses and the integration of our operations, along with some reductions in medical costs. We plan to accomplish the latter through actions that increase adherence to prescription regimens and close gaps in care, along with programs that optimize the site of care either to reduce unnecessary emergency room visits or move expensive therapies such as infusion to lower cost sites of care. The longer term medical cost savings will come from new programs that are only made possible through the combination and close integration of our two companies. And we are targeting substantial savings through specific portfolio of products and services. One example is the better management of five common chronic conditions : diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, asthma and behavioral health. And we'll accomplish this by building upon our near-term medical cost savings through the tighter integration of pharmacy and medical claims, the rich clinical data set we will have, along with our community assets. Another example is the optimization and extension of primary care, by expanding the scope of services available at MinuteClinic to help with the early identification and ongoing management of chronic disease. A third example is programs and services that reduce avoidable hospital readmissions by joining Aetna's clinical programs with the CVS' community presence to better support patients during and after the discharge process. And a fourth example is the development of comprehensive programs to better manage complex chronic diseases such as kidney disease where the goal is to reduce hospitalizations and delay the progression of the disease or oncology where our objective is to align provider incentives to focus on quality and outcomes, while enhancing patient support. Importantly, our solutions will be accessible through a broad range of channels from local community-based assets, to virtual and digital solutions, all coordinated across the member's journey in order to simplify the process. And we will make these solutions not only available to our Aetna clients and their members, but also to the wide array of health care partners we work with today through an open platform model. Remaking the consumer experience will be an increasingly important competitive differentiator and we are hard at work creating a plan to differentiate CVS Health in these patient journeys with the goal of making them simpler and more personalized, while making care more accessible. As a cornerstone of this work, we will have our first concept stores up and running early next year. And through these stores, we will pilot the programs just mentioned and explore new services to better address the cost-quality-access challenges of consumers and identify the most effective and scalable solutions, so they can be rolled out more broadly across our footprint. So in summary, our year-two synergy plan is largely complete and we're ready to begin implementation upon closing. At the same time, we've developed a foundational plan that will benefit post-close from a deeper dive into Aetna's strategies and operations, leading to longer term value-creation. And in our posted material, we summarize how this integrated model comes to life through the focus areas just mentioned along with the enablers and tools necessary for implementation. And while it is early to provide detailed quantification of the foundational pieces of our plan that will drive value long-term, we can share with you the areas of value creation we're focused on, which includes substantial medical cost reductions, increased revenues through membership growth, increased customer satisfaction and retention, customer value expansion through CVS assets, and growth enabled by an open platform model. And as we look at the size of the opportunities across health care, it is defined in billions, and we expect to have much more to share in the coming weeks and months as we begin rolling out these new initiatives. So with that, let me turn the call over to Eva Boratto to focus on the financials of our standalone CVS Health operations, which obviously continue to be very important. And as announced last month, Eva will be our CFO once the transaction closes. She has been an indispensable member of our executive team during her ten years with CVS Health, most recently as Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. And prior to joining CVS, she served in senior finance roles in the pharmaceutical manufacturing and PBM industries. Eva has experience in all aspects of the financial functions of a multifaceted organization along with a deep knowledge of our organization and we welcome Eva to her new role. Eva C. Boratto: Thanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I look forward to seeing many of you in person in the weeks and months ahead. This is a transformational moment for our company and I'm excited to have the opportunity in this new role to help shape the future of our combined companies. Over the past number of months, I've been deeply involved in our integration and planning effort, and I look forward to helping lead the company in bringing this vision to life. This morning, I'll share some business and financial highlights and provide a brief update on our guidance. Additional details are included in the slide presentation we posted on our website as well as in our SEC filings. Overall, our financial performance was solid as we met or exceeded all elements of our guidance in the quarter. Let me start with a review of our capital allocation program. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we have generated approximately $4.9 billion in free cash, in line with our expectation. Our full year expectations of approximately $7 billion for the standalone business remain on track. Due to the acquisition, our share repurchase program and our shareholder dividend increases remain suspended until we achieve a leverage ratio in the low 3 times adjusted debt-to-EBITDA. In Q3, $2.25 billion of senior notes were paid at maturity, and upon the closing of the deal, we'll take on $8.2 billion of Aetna senior notes. As discussed previously, with the addition of Aetna's business and balance sheet and given the additional debt issued for the acquisition, our combined company pro forma trailing 12 months leverage ratio is expected to be approximately 4.6 times. We are committed to improving this ratio to about 3.5 times within two years after closing, utilizing the strength of our business and our strong cash-generating capabilities. Turning to the third quarter income statement, we generated adjusted EPS of $1.73 per share, an increase of 15.5% over last year and at the high-end of our guidance range. These results are on a comparable basis and the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted EPS can be found in the press release and on the Investor Relations portion of our website. GAAP diluted earnings from continuing operations was $1.36 per share. The increase year-over-year was driven by a lower effective tax rate combined with lower net interest expense. Better than expected interest and tax drove the results to the high-end of our guidance range for the quarter. Consolidated revenue grew 2.4% in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Gross profit, operating expenses, operating profit, net interest expense and the tax rate reflect non-GAAP adjustments in both the current and prior periods, where applicable, and have been reconciled and posted on our website. Our guidance for the third quarter also reflected these adjustments. Gross margin for the company improved slightly over Q3 of 2017 largely due to segment mix, while total enterprise gross profit dollars increased 2.9% year-over-year. Total operating expense dollars increased 6.4%, in line with our expectations, largely driven by investments in the business from a portion of the savings from tax reform. We continue to make progress on our enterprise streamlining efforts that are driving process improvements and technology enhancements. In the third quarter, new improvements included enhanced specialty order routing to decrease the time to dispense medications. As a result of our ongoing efforts, we still expect to generate approximately $475 million in gross benefits this year from streamlining. Looking ahead to 2019, we expect these savings to ramp in line with our original expectations. Operating profit for the enterprise declined 3.5% from last year to $2.4 billion, in line with expectations, while operating margin contracted approximately 30 basis points. The decline was primarily driven by pricing and reimbursement pressures we continue to see in both our operating segments as well as investments in the business from a portion of the savings from tax reform, offset to a large degree by growth in retail volume and improvements in purchasing. Going below-the-line, net interest expense improved as did our effective income tax rate relative to our expectations. Our weighted average share count was in line with our expectations for the quarter. Turning to the PBM segment, revenue grew 2.6% to $33.8 billion, in line with our expectations. Growth in claims volumes and brand inflation drove the year-over-year increase, partially offset by rebates, continued pricing pressure, and as we have stated previously, the administration of rebates for Aetna's Medicare Part D business, which is new this year. PBM adjusted claims grew by 5.7% largely driven by strong net new business and continued adoption of Maintenance Choice. PBM gross margin increased about 20 basis points compared to Q3 2017, while gross profit dollars grew 6.5%, in line with our expectations. The growth was primarily due to volume increases. PBM operating expenses as a percentage of sales deteriorated slightly year-over-year as operating expenses increased. The expense increase was primarily driven by the reinstatement of the ACA's health insurer fee this year and the benefit realized in 2017 of partially-reserved receivables. Given the gross profit and operating expenses results were mostly in line with expectations, PBM operating profit was also in line with expectations growing 1.4%, while operating margin remained relatively flat. The timing of client commitments discussed last quarter impacted the third quarter as expected. We continue to make progress on the implementation work for on-boarding Anthem members in 2020. The costs incurred through third quarter are in line with our expectations. Looking at the 2019 selling season, our current gross wins stand at approximately $2.6 billion with net new business of approximately $875 million, an improvement of about $675 million from our last update. Keep in mind this does not include any impact from our Medicare Part D PDP. To-date, we've completed more than 90% of our client renewals, roughly in line with where we were at this time last year and our retention rate is about 98%. As we turn our attention to a new selling season, CVS Caremark continues to innovate. Currently, we're excited about several new cost managing opportunities that allow us to demonstrate the power of our enterprise assets. For example, CMS recently announced its decision to allow the use of step therapy to help reduce costs for Medicare Advantage plan for drugs administered under Part B. The new rule which takes effect on January 1 of 2019, enables payors to direct patients who are new to treatment to the most cost effective, clinically-appropriate therapies first, before moving on to more expensive options. Our solutions, which are enabled by NovoLogix, can help bring the same precision we apply to Part D plans to drugs administered under Part B. Using NovoLogix, payors can implement core PBM cost management strategies that help ensure appropriate use for Part B drugs. Additionally, we're talking with consultants and clients about new, simpler economic models, which better reflect alignment of incentives, while accounting for the changing market trends. Although it's too early to provide details, we expect that this will be another step demonstrating CVS Health's leadership in the market to bring pricing simplicity and alignment of incentive to pharmacy benefit management contracting. Within our Retail/Long-Term Care business, revenues increased 6.4% to $20.9 billion. This increase was primarily driven by strong comp script growth from continued adoption of our Patient Care Programs, successful partnering with PBMs and health plans across the industry, including our preferred position in a number of Med D networks this year. The expanded relationships we have built with other PBMs and health plans continues to favorably impact script growth and we continue to see opportunities ahead. Our strong script growth contributed to an increase in our retail market share of about 150 basis points in the quarter to an all-time high of 25.2%. Same-store sales grew 6.7%, exceeding the high end of guidance by 45 basis points, while adjusted same-store prescription growth of 9.2% came in near the midpoint of the guidance range. Front store same-store sales increased 0.8%, driven by increased volume with continued strength in the health and beauty categories. Gross margin in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment was down approximately 120 basis points to 27.9%. This contraction was driven by continued pressure on reimbursement rates and partially offset by favorable purchasing driven by Red Oak as well as front store rate improvement. Gross profit dollars grew in line with expectations, mainly due to increased volume across the pharmacy and front store, partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure. Retail/Long-Term Care operating expenses were slightly above expectations for the quarter. The growth in expenses year-over-year was primarily due to investments in wages and benefits of savings from tax reform, also contributing to the increase were higher expenses related to script volume growth. Operating profit declined 6.3% to $1.5 billion within Retail/Long-Term Care in line with expectations, while operating margin contracted 100 basis points to 7.2%. Before moving on to Corporate, I want to touch on our long-term care pharmacy business. We continue to see challenges in the skilled nursing facility space as the market continues to experience bed loss in these facilities. Longer term, the opportunity is in the assisted and independent living markets. As we've discussed before, we have put our plan in place for growth into action and will update you with progress as we get further along. Within the Corporate segment, expenses declined year-over-year and were generally in line with our expectations. In summary, we continue to push forward on our initiatives to drive growth. We're creating new service offerings and reaping the benefits from the enterprise streamlining initiative and we are generating script growth from our expanded relationships with PBMs and health plans. Let me now provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2018, starting with the CVS Health standalone business. With third quarter results within our expectation, we remain comfortable with our outlook for consolidated revenue, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted EPS for the year. Given some moving pieces within the segments, the PBM's operating profit growth is trending at the lower end of our prior guidance range, while operating profit in Retail/Long-Term Care is expected to be solidly within the range we gave last quarter. Additionally, our revenue metrics also remain intact. The guidance is on an adjusted basis. You can find the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations portion of our website. As we approach the closing of this transaction, there are few details to keep in mind. From a non-GAAP perspective, upon closing, the net interest expense associated with the deal-related debt raised in March will be included in the non-GAAP figures. We expect to issue approximately 285 million shares. There will be a slight increase in the combined company's tax rate relative to the CVS standalone rate. There will be an increase in our revenue eliminations to reflect the elimination of Aetna's fully insured pharmacy revenue, also recorded on Caremark's books. And of course, we'll have Aetna's operating profit. Given the timing of the close, the impact of these items on adjusted EPS is expected to be dilutive in both Q4 and the year. Looking ahead to 2019, while we've done a great deal of work on integration planning, we have not had access to Aetna's detailed financials. Accordingly, we will not be providing specific earnings estimates for next year until our February earnings call. Over the past several months, CVS has been planning for the transformational changes that will take place as we combine with Aetna. 2019 will be highly focused on the integration of the businesses and executing on this new health care model. And while we understand the importance of establishing a baseline, this unique model is groundbreaking and the appropriate amount of time needs to be spent to ensure we fully comprehend how our companies combine to form our 2019 goals. After we close the transaction, we'll be in a much better position to provide you with that clarity. We're excited about the opportunities in front of us. We have a strong organization to support us in these efforts and we'll be as transparent as possible as soon as possible. This transaction is about growth. We feel great about the value we can create and I look forward to being at the forefront of the effort to realize the full potential of this transformational event. And now, I'll turn it over to Larry. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Eva. And as we near the close of the transaction, we are confident in the long-term value we believe this deal will create for shareholders and the clients and members we serve. Before I turn the call over to your questions, I'd like to ask that you reserve time in your calendars for our CVS Health Analyst Day, which will be held on Tuesday, June 4 in New York City. Again, that's Tuesday, June 4. With several months of integration planning under our belts, our senior management team will be able to provide you with a deeper dive into our short and long-term strategies for growth, updates on our integration work, and the status of our efforts to drive both short and long-term synergies and medical cost savings. In the meantime, as Eva mentioned, we won't be silent. We know how important it is that you thoroughly understand our strategy, our progress, and the benefits we expect to derive from the bold, disruptive, and truly unique model we are creating. Our companies have put in many hours of thoughtful and meaningful work to get to this point and I would like to thank both the CVS and Aetna teams for their contributions. And we certainly look forward to welcoming our new colleagues from Aetna upon closing. We know there is a lot more work ahead of us and we've got the team and the plan to get it done. So, with that, Jon Roberts, our Chief Operating Officer, is joining us today for the Q&A. And let's go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator : And our first question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Your line is open. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Yeah, hi, good morning. Thank you for all the details, and Eva, welcome, I'm looking forward to working with you in the future. A couple of questions here. I appreciate it's a little bit early to talk about 2019 and 2020, but when you announced the deal you gave us some idea also of how we should think about the accretion in year two. Do you have any updated thoughts for us or give us some context of how we should be thinking about that or any changes from what you disclosed in the past? Eva C. Boratto: So, hi, Ricky. This is Eva. I look forward to meeting you or working with you in the future. We have not changed our point of view on the value being created by the transaction. As you know, and as Larry stated earlier on the call, we have increased our synergy target to more than $750 million in year two and feel very comfortable with that. So overall, we're comfortable with our previous comments. Ricky R. Goldwasser: Okay. And when we think about the pilot program, the potential opportunity there, is the pilot really going to be focused on Aetna members? Or do you have early health plan customers that are \u2013 early adopters that are interested in participating as well? And if you can give us some more color on how we should think about the opportunity that relates both to your commercial customers but also to the faster-growing Medicare population that you manage? Larry J. Merlo: Sure. Ricky, good morning. It's Larry. Ricky, we will start obviously with the Aetna members where, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, where the integration and innovation teams are working closely around that. But as you've heard us state many times, our goal is to create an open platform model that we can partner broadly. Today, we've got more than 70 health plan clients, and I do believe that there'll be elements of innovation that will apply broadly in the marketplace. But to be clear, we'll be starting first with our Aetna members. Michael P. McGuire: Next question, operator. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please proceed. Your line is open. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to the \u2013 to exceeding the $750 million. Any way you can sort of help frame the size of that or how meaningful above the $750 million where that incremental savings is coming from, and maybe the visibility that you have on that? And then the last piece is just the pacing of it. Obviously, it's a two-year target. Is it half and half? Is the bulk of it front-end loaded? Just any consideration of timing around that capture (31:20). Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Ralph, it's Larry. Listen, we will talk more about that as we get into next year and talk more about 2019 and beyond. Obviously, the integration teams are doing a terrific job, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. And listen, we're continuing to push the teams. I don't want to say that we're done yet. And again, we've talked about the areas of opportunity as part of the initial integration work. There's really nothing that has changed beyond that. We've talked about some expense and operating savings as well as some elements of medical cost savings that are \u2013 I'll put it under the heading of low-hanging fruit from the two companies coming together. So again, we'll talk more about that as we get into next year in terms of quantifying the cadence of it as well as the dollar value. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then just to follow up, can you give any more details around the new economic models you're discussing with consultants and customers? Is that largely fee-based with risk sharing? Any detail there? And then, maybe also what the reception has been to this point in going back to those customers and consultants? Thanks. Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah. Ralph, this is Jon. So yeah, today the model that is in the marketplace is based on unit discounts off of AWP, and we feel there's an opportunity to create better alignment and reduce the complexity. So when we talk about alignment, today we align around not only unit discounts, but we think there's an opportunity to align around drug mix, which also drives overall cost to our clients. And that's not in the pricing model today. And when we think about complexity, there's 14 pricing levers, approximately, that consultants use to evaluate and compare price points. But again, there's no net cost to the client based on changes to drug mix that are driven by formularies that we have in the marketplace. So we feel like there's an opportunity to greatly simplify the model and create alignment. I would say the clients are very interested and I think the market is ripe for this type of change, and we'll have more to say about this next year. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please proceed. Michael Cherny : Good morning, and thanks for all the details as well. Thinking about the quarter, and I know, again, not trying to get to 2019 guidance, but if you think about the performance on the Retail/LTC side, you've seen the strong script growth come in over the course of the year thanks to your payer partnerships and PBMs. How do you think, especially in a future world where you own Aetna, some of those preferred or narrower networks start to develop for other payers that are not Aetna? And what is the appetite, as you've seen yourself setting up for 2019 network access, for either expansion or potentially even reductions of preferred networks? Eva C. Boratto: Hi, Mike. This is Eva. Let me try to break apart your question. Overall, from a script performance, we're very \u2013 extremely pleased with the progress that we've made achieving nearly 9% script comp growth this year. That growth came from three different key areas : our clinical program, our network arrangements beyond Caremark as a PBM with other payers, and including our strong position in Med D. So we continue to see substantial opportunity here to continue to outpace the market and continue to grow our retail share. Jonathan C. Roberts: And Michael, this is Jon. I think as CVS and Aetna comes together and with our programs, we can demonstrate the activities that pharmacies can drive around improving health and lowering overall healthcare costs. We think there's an opportunity to move the market to more performance-based networks where part of the pharmacies' reimbursement will be based on their ability to execute against clinical programs that do lower costs for our clients. So I think there's lots of opportunity here. Michael Cherny : Great. Thanks. Just one quick housekeeping question. The five states that are left, I believe New York and California are two. Can you just update us on where the other three are? Larry J. Merlo: Sure. Mike, it's Larry. Let me just talk about where we're at with the remaining states broadly. You mentioned New York, we're pretty far down the road in our engagement with the Department of Financial Services. We're in active and productive discussions. We look forward to bringing those conversations to a successful close in the very near term. California, I am pleased that after productive discussions and engagement, we have reached agreement on all the material terms with the state. And we're in the process of finalizing the form of agreement and all the appropriate paperwork. We expect that that will be done over the next couple days. As far as the remaining couple of states, what I can add is that New Jersey was the very last state to have a hearing. That took place yesterday. So the other couple of states are in the process of finalizing their orders and all of that's reflected in our earlier comments that we expect to close before Thanksgiving. Michael Cherny : Perfect. Thanks, Larry. Larry J. Merlo: All right. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please proceed. Lisa C. Gill: Great. Thanks very much. Eva, when we look at where current consensus is for 2019, I know that some people have the transaction included, some don't have it included. When we think about core CVS in 2019, is there a way to maybe think about some of the headwinds and tailwinds for the core business, so that everybody can get aligned? And then Aetna is going to be what it's going to be when you add that on top of it? Eva C. Boratto: Yes. Thanks, Lisa, for the question. Obviously, we're going to have much more to say in February, but let me try to outline for you some of the moving pieces. As I think about tailwinds we just spoke about one of them, continued strength in our retail script growth and outpacing the market due to the programs I mentioned previously. As you heard on the call, PBM had a net positive selling season albeit lower than the last few years still net positive and we continue to see specialty as a growth driver. Streamlining continues \u2013 our expectations continue to accelerate there to deliver the long term savings Dave outlined a couple of years ago. From a headwind's perspective, I would say it's going to be a lighter year from a break-open generics perspective. You can think about pricing and reimbursement pressures at comparable levels to what we've seen the last few years. And obviously we'll have the wrap of the tax reform investment that started about mid-year this year. The other thing is, there are also some unknowns with the regulatory changes. And some of those what HHS is talking about could be positive or negative. So we're going to continue to evaluate that and have our clarity on our call in February. Lisa C. Gill: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Larry, looking back at the slides where you talk about the building blocks of multiple levers being medical cost, membership, et cetera. As we think about the health plan business and growth in membership, there really hasn't been a lot of growth in membership for Aetna over the last several years. Can you talk about philosophically how you think about trading off membership growth for price in the market? Larry J. Merlo: Well, Lisa, as you've heard us mention since we announced the transaction, actually it's coming up on a year, that we really view the opportunity of the two companies coming together as a growth story. And obviously, there's \u2013 continues to be tremendous opportunity in the Medicare space. And I do believe for the reasons that we've begun to talk about, to be clear we have a lot of work ahead of us. But you look at the billions of dollars that are being spent unnecessarily they could be prevented, avoided in just the management of chronic disease. And the opportunity through this new model to meaningfully help people achieve a better health outcome at a lower cost or reduced cost we believe can create a new model that will allow for membership growth in the marketplace. So, again, we've got a lot of work ahead of us, but that's the trajectory that we're working towards. Lisa C. Gill: I appreciate the comments. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Lisa. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please proceed. Robert Patrick Jones : Great. Thanks for the questions. And it sounds like, we'll obviously get a lot more detail not only in February but in June. But Larry you guys did share a few more examples of kind of the longer-term goal of bringing these two companies together. You mentioned medical adherence, infusion, generally expanding the scope of care within the MinuteClinic the concept stores. So, I guess, it seems like we'll get more details and it's a little bit maybe down the road. But I was wondering, if you could maybe just share directionally how we should be thinking about the necessary infrastructure relative to kind of the current CVS footprint in order to accomplish some of these examples that you've laid out today? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Bob, it's Larry. Maybe I'll start, and then I'll ask Eva to jump in as well. But Bob, I think you've probably heard us talk a little bit about that. You look at the CVS community assets today. We've got 10,000 points of distribution in communities all across the country. And we envision a hub-and-spoke concept where as we've talked about the concept stores or some have referred to them as health hubs we don't know what we'll call them yet, okay. But think about those as the hubs, okay? And we would have those in a set number of stores within a given market and the balance of the stores would have a core set of offerings that would serve as a referral source to those hub stores. So from a bricks-and-mortar perspective, I think we have the assets to create that local presence in communities again across the country. And let's not forget about the role that digital plays or the fact that we're going to have almost 40,000 healthcare professionals that not just work within those bricks-and-mortar assets, but \u2013 or within a few miles of where people live. So there's the concept of, we can come to them at their doorsteps as well. Maybe I'll flip it over to Eva to talk more about how we're thinking about the CapEx component of that. Eva C. Boratto: Yeah. Hi, Bob. If you think about our capital allocations, between the two companies our CapEx is about $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion. As Larry said, what we'll be changing in the stores, think about that as a shifting of investment from our normal refreshes to investing in some of these health hub changes for which we will need. So largely, we expect to be able to do this within what you would consider normal CapEx spend. Robert Patrick Jones : Got it. And then, I guess, just one quick follow-up. If I look at the performance in the Retail gross margin, Eva you mentioned the strong script growth and how some of those programs could help carry that through to next year. The margin decline in the quarter seemed to be a little bit worse than what we saw in the first half. So I was just wondering was there anything worth calling out there? And then relative, again not looking for guidance, but just directionally relative to how script trends are going in the Retail Pharmacy segment. Anything you can share to help us think about how we should be modeling those margins going forward? Eva C. Boratto: Sure. In terms of the quarter-to-quarter impact, Bob, I would say there was really nothing unique in the third quarter. As CIR (44:23) has become an increasing component and that's performance-based, relative Q2 versus Q3, you had some timing differences there year-over-year. As we look at overall margin, things that will pressure our margins are success in Medicare Part D. We've spoken many times that those are at lower margins. Additionally, as we increase our 90-day penetration that carries a slightly lower margin as well. Robert Patrick Jones : Okay. Got it. Thanks so much. Larry J. Merlo: Thanks, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill with RBC. Your line is open. Please proceed. George Hill : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And Eva, welcome to the call. I guess my question is two parts is, I guess, Larry and Eva, number one, can you talk about how you think about synergy delivery gross versus net? So, I guess, how much gets generated by the end of year two versus how much flows to the bottom line? And then typically when you see transactions of this size, there's a significant level of investment spend that comes with executing the deal. I don't know if you've contemplated that as we think about 2019 and if there's any color that you can provide around that. Like is there either a big charge or a big investment spend number coming forward that investors should be looking towards? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, George, it's Larry. I'll start. George, in terms of what we talked about in our prepared remarks around the synergies, those are net synergy numbers reflecting investments that we would need to make, I'll say, ongoing investments that would be tied to achieving those synergy dollars. George Hill : Okay. That's all I have. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please proceed. Your line is open. Clayton Meyers : Hi. Good morning. This is actually Clayton Meyers on the line for Eric this morning. Eva, welcome to the team. Looking forward to working with you going forward. I know people have been kind of asking about the 2020 EPS number, and I want to try to come at it from a different direction. And when the time the deal was announced, it's expected to be accretive relative to consensus at that point. Is the way that we should think about it is to take that consensus number and then kind of adjust it for tax reform and then adjust it for the lines of the business that's happening, the increased operating investment that's happening in the business? Do you think that logic is kind of roughly sound as you think about where to base the accretion number as we go forward to 2020? Eva C. Boratto: So Eric (sic) [Clayton], this is Eva. Obviously you're on the mark in terms of tax reform has occurred since we jumped off of that consensus number. So that's one of the biggest things that have happened. The base is no longer valid, so it's difficult with all of the moving pieces for us at this point to update that. But what I can say is as it pertains to the transaction, there have been no changes. Clayton Meyers : Okay. Very cool. It helps. Thanks for the color. That's helpful. Then just one other question just going back to the Part B mechanisms that's coming through with step therapy. Is that an area that you think CVS's asset in Coram Infusion particularly could benefit as it comes to CVS? And how have the payers been responsive to CVS' PBM capabilities within the space, given that Part B hasn't really been a space that PBMs have played with \u2013 with in the past. And then finally, just a follow-up to that. With the new advance notice for the Part B IPI, would that impact CVS' business in any way? And how should we think about the role that CVS could potentially play as a vendor for that proposal? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, it's Larry. Let me just talk broadly about the proposals that we've seen in terms of [Part] B to [Part] D. And obviously we see a tremendous opportunity to be an important part of that solution for the reasons that I think have been well quantified in terms of there is more competition today in Part B with the various therapies from where the reimbursement model started with Part B many years ago when there were single source products and very little competition. We would sit here today and say the Part B mimicking the role that the private sector plays as part of Part D is the answer. I would sit here and say it's highly unlikely that an international price index, the other proposal, would result in net prices that are lower than what the private sector can negotiate through competition and innovation as part of the processes that exist with Part D. And we're excited by the opportunity to play a bigger role there. Michael P. McGuire: Melanie? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please proceed. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. My first question is just on your segment guidance. It appears the Retail business for the fourth quarter would be down mid-teens on an EBIT perspective with the PBM up high-single digits. So just with that divergence, if my math is correct in the first place, I was hoping you can share what is driving that seasonality and divergence versus the year-to-date results, and how we should think about that as informing our view into 2019, if at all? Eva C. Boratto: Hi, Justin. This is Eva. As it pertains to our guidance, I think your math is \u2013 we said for the year down low-single digit, so in the quarter, obviously given our year-to-date performance, you would be down in the mid- to high-single digits, depending on what point you picked. In terms of any context for 2019, it's really too early to provide as I earlier discussed some of the headwinds and tailwinds. Justin Lake : Okay. And then just a follow-up on the debt side. Is there anything you could share with us in terms of where you expect your gross and net debt to look like at year end post the deal close? Eva C. Boratto: Let me get back to you on that, Justin, if I could. Justin Lake : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please proceed. Your line is open. James Auh : Hi. It's actually James on for Charles. So, on Teladoc, recently you talked about the soft rollout of the telehealth capabilities in about 18 states and Washington D.C. Can you talk about how Teladoc affects your clinic strategy and when we should expect a full-blown rollout? Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, James, it's Larry. As you mentioned, we've been rolling it out state-by-state. There are some state processes that we're going through to turn them on. And once we get more of a critical mass, we will begin broader marketing of that. As you look at the complementary strategy to the clinics, it has the opportunity to expand our reach as well as expand our scope of practice. And those were the use cases that we've been piloting. We're pleased with how it's going and we see more opportunities there, especially with the role that it can play after-hours, the role that it can play as part of what the announcement that you saw in terms of the role that telemedicine can play with Medicare, and more to come. James Auh : Okay. Great. And so synergies are now expected to exceed $750 million by year two, which is ahead of the original expectations. Can you elaborate for us where the upside in synergies is coming from? Is it more corporate expenses, reduction in medical costs? Also can you maybe touch on the revenue synergy opportunities a little bit more? Thank you. Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, James. It's really \u2013 we're not going to break those out at this point. It's really the areas that we broadly talked about. And as I mentioned earlier, the teams are continuing to work hard in those areas. And we'll talk about the opportunities for revenue synergies as we work through our longer-term plans. And we'll get into more details around that next year. So Melanie, we'll take \u2013 I think we have time for two more questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please proceed. Your line is open. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So during the quarter, there was obviously a large expanded store-within-a-store deal announced away from you for greater lab services in the retail pharmacy setting. So I'm just curious if you can maybe just remind investors what your general preferences are in relation to that type of opportunity, or are you just kind of looking past that event in the marketplace and just focusing on the other concepts that you're talking about for your retail footprint? Thanks. Larry J. Merlo: Yeah, Steve, there are certainly opportunities in front of us as we think about the companies coming together. And you think about whether it's through integration and absolutely having aligned incentives, the value that can be created, that can't necessarily be achieved through partnerships. At the same time, I want to be clear, we are certainly not opposed to partnerships. And as I mentioned earlier, as we build out these new programs and service offerings, we intend to create an open platform for others to participate in and we'll go from there. Steven Valiquette : Okay. All right. Thanks. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Please proceed, your line is open. David Larsen : Hi. Can you talk a bit about the PBM selling season? It looks like there was a pretty good increase there, the retention rate looks pretty high, Express Scripts reported a very high retention rate and pretty good core claims growth expectations for 2019. Just how is that shaping up? And what does that leave you to think preliminarily about 2019 growth expectations and operating income? Thanks. Jonathan C. Roberts: Yeah, David, this is Jon. So, we saw less movement of business from one PBM to another this year, I think that has a lot to do with the mergers that are happening in healthcare. And yeah, our retention as Eva talked about was 98%, so very happy and a little higher than we've historically had. As far as 2020, it's too early for us to really comment on the RFP activity, it's just starting to gear up. And then, as we mentioned, we do have the Anthem contract that's coming onboard for 1/1/2020, which is a very large health plan obviously. Eva C. Boratto: And as we think about that Anthem contract, you can think about it in terms of a net accounting contract given the terms of that business. David Larsen : Okay. Has there been any sort of shift in the sort of profitability or nature of the PBM contracts that are going to roll on in 2019 and 2020, like any general thoughts there? Has it been a highly competitive selling season? Has pricing been aggressive? Or any comments there would be helpful. Jonathan C. Roberts: This is Jon. The pricing environment, it's a very competitive industry as we all know, and it typically gets a little more competitive as you go through the season. I would say it's consistent with what we've seen over the last several years, so not really a step change. We do, from time-to-time, see some PBMs get very aggressive on certain accounts based on their own strategies, and I think this year is no different than what we've seen in years past. David Larsen : Okay. And then just one more quick one for Eva. Can you talk a little bit about your streamlining effort there? And operating income sort of growth expectations in retail, retail's obviously been under a lot of pressure. Just any thoughts around cost reduction efforts and initiatives and when can that streamlining gross benefit turn into a net benefit? Any thoughts around that at a high level would be great Eva? Thanks. Eva C. Boratto: Yeah. So overall as it pertains to the streamlining, we're extremely pleased with the results we've rolled out numerous programs, we highlighted the one in specialty today. We're also looking to reduce overall call volume that comes into the retail channels through better sharing of data between the PBMs not in the Caremark, but other PBMs, not only to reduce our cost but to make the customer experience better as well. We continue to expect to see these benefits ramp in 2019 to give broader color than that we'll provide more in February. Larry J. Merlo: And Dave, listen, we have \u2013 I think you know \u2013 we have always had a cost focus in terms of how can we do things better while continuing to enhance levels of service. So it's not just about cost cutting, okay, but it's about doing things faster, better and cheaper. And that's \u2013 we believe that that's in our DNA and that work never stops. Before we round out the call we're going to \u2013 let's go back to I think Justin had asked the question about the debt, so... Eva C. Boratto: Justin, you'd asked the question about the total debt on the balance sheet post closure. It would be around $75 billion when you look at our existing debt plus bringing on Aetna steps. Larry J. Merlo: So with that, everyone, thanks again for your time this morning. And as always, if there are any follow-up questions, Mike's available. And we'll see many of you soon, and have a great Thanksgiving. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

As a reminder, this call is being recorded on Wednesday, February 20th 2019. I'm Mike McGuire, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for CVS Health. I'm joined this morning by Larry Merlo, President and CEO; and Eva Boratto, Executive Vice President and CFO. Following our prepared remarks, we'll host the question-and-answer session. In order to provide more people with the chance to ask their questions during the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up. In addition to this call and our press release, we have posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Our 10-K will be filed later this month and that too will be available on our website once filed. I have one announcement this morning. Our Annual Investor Day has been scheduled for Tuesday, June 4th in New York City. You'll have the opportunity to hear from our Senior Management Team who will provide a comprehensive update of the execution of our strategic vision and an in-depth review of our strategies for driving long-term growth and creating shareholder value. We plan to send the invitations via email with more specific details in this bring, but please state the data. Again, that's Tuesday June 4th. Please note that during this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views related to our future financial performance, future events and industry and market conditions, and forward-looking statements related to the integration of the Aetna acquisition, including the expected consumer benefits, financial projections and synergies. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what maybe indicated in the forward-looking statements. We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these specific risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and the cautionary statement disclosures in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Forward Looking Statements in our earnings press release. During this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance and financial condition. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and the comparable GAAP measures in the associated reconciliation document we posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being webcast on our website where it will be archived for one year following today's call. Now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo. Larry Merlo : Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We achieved strong performance in the fourth quarter, and in full-year 2018. And importantly with the completion of our merger with Aetna, we have positioned CVS Health to excel in a market that is undergoing profound and rapid transformation. In recent years, it has become increasingly evidence that the path to long-term growth and value creation lies in the establishment of new integrated health care models that provide consumers better care convenience at a lower cost. And since closing the Aetna merger, we are increasingly confident in the synergistic potential of this powerful combination to build and deliver shareholder value. A CVS Health is in a superior position to lead the change needed in the fragmented U.S. Health Care System with our compelling fully integrated health care offerings, our unmatched local community assets, proven pharmacy care leadership and a commitment to collaborating with health care providers to achieve the very best outcomes for the patients and clients we serve. In 2018, we've delivered on our financial expectations as set Aetna laying a strong foundation for a successful combination. We generated significant cash flows with nearly $7 billion of free cash for full-year '18, consistent with our expectations, and we returned $2 billion back to shareholders through dividends and later deployed the cash we raised in early '18 to fund the Aetna merger. So in short, 2018 was a milestone year both tactically and strategically as we successfully completed our transformational merger with Aetna. Now, we also delivered our key foundational steps for growth in health care services. This includes making more than 80% of primary care services available to consumers at MinuteClinic, while also increasing home visits by Coram for infusion services by more than 15%. Importantly, we began effective implementation of our integration strategy and took important steps toward building the integrated health care model that will bring substantial value to our various stakeholders. Now we expect 2019 to be a year of transition as we integrate Aetna, and focus on key pillars of our growth strategy, creating a more consumer-centric health care experience. As an example, our first three concept stores were unveiled earlier this month. And you probably saw press coverage last week. And there's a lot of excitement around the consumer engagement and response. Now it's still early as we're in the learning phase and working to define a hub-and-spoke approach, but it's an example of the work underway. And I'll share additional progress on achieving our vision in just a few minutes. Now, that's said, we're also fully aware of the need to address the impact of certain headwinds that are having a disproportionate impact in '19 when compared to prior years. Many of these issues we've talked about previously and most significant is the ongoing pharmacy reimbursement pressures in our businesses and the reduction in offsets to those pressures. What we're experiencing in '19 is the declining benefit from new generics, lower brand inflation and the ongoing questions around rebates, along with some structural and CVS-specific challenges in the long-term care space. And while these factors will negatively affect the business in the short-term, I want to outline the comprehensive actions we have taken in response. In our Retail business, we are continuing to develop product and service initiatives that will accelerate top line revenue and profitability. We are winning from a growth perspective and we expect to continue on those positive trends. In the front store, this includes introducing new product lines in the health and beauty areas along with the expansion of higher margin service offerings. In the Pharmacy, we will continue to deliver market leading top line growth through our network relationships and clinical care programs. Additionally, we are developing a new retail contracting strategy that better aligns reimbursement to the value our clinical products provide enabling adherence improvements and star enhancements, while saving patients' money, to name just a few. Second, in the PBM, we've created a new contracting model that provides for more transparency, simplicity for and alignment with our clients. The guaranteed net cost pricing model is an innovative way to approach the market by allowing us to maximize all cost control tools that are disposal. In this model, clients will receive 100% of rebates, while we leverage our core strengths of contracting expertise and utilization management to drive lower net costs for clients and members without compromising on the quality of care. Now this is a win-win. Clients will benefit from the simplicity of one guaranteed price per claim that's focused on lower net costs and not discounts and rebates. Now we've introduced this approach to clients and benefit consultants, and we will have a small number of clients adopting the model this year. We expect a more rapid adoption in '20 and beyond. Third, back in August, we outlined a 4-point plan to get the long-term care business back on track. And while progress is being made in the identified areas, the benefits are being offset by the external factors impacting the skilled nursing business. And work is underway to accelerate the action plan timeline to achieve the benefits more quickly. And we've already begun to see some progress realizing nearly $80 million in process improvement savings with more to come. Forth, in early January, we began planning a new cost reduction effort across the enterprise going beyond the previously announced productivity initiatives of the legacy companies and targeting opportunities that neither company would be able to accomplish as a standalone. This separate is in addition to the near-term synergy work tied to the $750 million target, which we are on track to exceed. If we look across the new combined enterprise, there are significant streamlining opportunities and member enrollment, claims processing and customer service, as well as through the use of robotics and advanced analytics. Additionally, we are focused on aggressively managing working capital, especially through the reduction of inventory and improvement of terms within our payables. And we'll have more details for you on our May earnings call. And finally, we continue to evaluate our assets and the roles they play in enabling the core strategies of our new company. So we'll provide updates to the actions we have underway as we execute our vision in a strategic and innovative yet practical, realistic, and carefully prioritize way. We understand acutely the importance of balancing near-term execution with longer-term vision, and we are confident that these actions will position us well in 2020 and beyond. Now, several key pillars that we are executing on today will drive above market growth going forward in this rapidly changing health care environment. And a few key initiatives that underlie the ongoing execution of our strategy are as follows. First, we are growing membership. We are working to expand the reach of our government business with Medicare position to lead the way. Medicare advantage top line growth is being driven by the addition of new membership and existing markets, and continued geographic expansion. Driving excellence in STAR ratings continues to be a primary focus for our business. And by enhancing our clinical model products and capabilities, we are expanding our offering to take care of higher acuity and complex members, including dual eligibles that critically important set of beneficiaries, when bending the cost curve. Our success and building the largest Medicare Part D plan SilverScript, while simultaneously becoming the partner of choice for more than 40 Health Plan Part D clients, gives us the confidence that we can further expand upon the success of both organizations. Looking ahead, we see a strong and growing pipeline of new business opportunities within Group Medicare for 2020, and we see opportunity as well within Medicaid building upon the success we've had with recent wins in Kansas and Florida. And of course, we are actively working to strengthen our commercial offerings. Now, success in all of these areas requires the use of our full breath of capabilities, comprehensive data, predictive analytics and our unparalleled intervention points with consumers to drive behavior change and improve health outcomes. And both Aetna and CVS Caremark have very successful employer businesses, and we're working on opportunities to create new products and services to meet the needs of these payers. Backend we are creating differentiated products and services at the community level, driving meaningful value for both consumers and payers, while improving the bottom line. Now this reflects our broad base of consumer facing assets that is highlighted by our nearly 10,000 CVS pharmacies. And I touched on the first concept stores earlier, but importantly, our assets extend well beyond our pharmacies, when you think about the role and the value that MinuteClinic, Coram, Accordant, and other ancillary businesses can play. And while our community assets have the power to improve outcomes and reduce costs, they also contribute to enterprise revenue and earnings growth. Third is the role of partnerships in accelerating innovation. And our recent announcement with Apple on the development and springtime rollout of Attain by Aetna is just one example. Applying new technologies will be a component of our consumer centric approach to improving health. And finally, we are establishing the optimal structure and go-to-market strategy for our health services offerings. We've been very clear about our vision of creating an open platform model that will serve the needs of all payers. And to support this goal, we are integrating existing capabilities with new products and services that will benefit all Aetna and Caremark clients and their members. And we are on track to have this in market for the 2021 selling season. So we're more excited than ever about our progress and the opportunities that lie ahead. We also have a good understanding of the factors that impact our business in the near term and are actively working to address them. We view 2019 as a bridge for the future. And we expect our businesses to strengthen meaningfully from the integration of CVS and Aetna's core capabilities. Now, I'm also pleased to introduce the leaders of our businesses. John Roberts, Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Hourican, President of CVS Pharmacy; Karen Lynch, President of Aetna; and Derica Rice, President of CVS Caremark. They'll be joining us for the Q&A after our prepared remarks. And our senior leadership team is energized by the prospects of our new company and together with all of our colleagues across the enterprise we are laser-focused and fully committed to delivering on the vast potential of this combination. So let me turn the call over to Eva to walk through key items from '18 and the details of our '19 financial outlook. Eva Boratto : Thanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the details of our results and guidance, please note there is a significant amount of information in the presentation we posted to our website this morning to help you understand the changes to our financials for both 2018 and 2019. Regarding 2018, while the face of the P&L is different, definitions of the non-GAAP are consistent with legacy CVS. However, interest income is shifting from net interest expense to revenues to conform to insurance company presentation. With that, I'll provide some key highlights for 2018. As Larry stated, CVS Health generated significant free cash of nearly $7 billion for the full-year '18. And we used it in addition to the cash on hand to repay $5.5 billion in debt, of which $3.5 billion were scheduled maturities and $2 billion was a voluntary early repayment of a 5-year term loan. We also delivered $2 billion to shareholders through our dividend. We delivered adjusted EPS of $7.08 at the high end of our guidance range, reflecting the addition of Aetna, with all of our businesses performing at our expectations. On a standalone basis, CVS Health's adjusted revenue grew 2.3% in 2018, at the top end of our full-year guidance range. With the addition of 34 days of Aetna's operations, which are now embedded in our new Health Care Benefits segment, adjusted revenues grew 5% to $194 billion, with HCB contributing an additional $5.1 billion after considering elimination. In 2018, the Retail/Long Term Care segment delivered adjusted script growth of 8.8%, driven by our pharmacy clinical programs comprised of increased adoption of 90-day program, as well as the successful partnering with PBMs and health plans via network relationships, including additional preferred positions in a number of Med D networks. Adjusted operating income declined by 1.2%, driven by our decision to invest a portion of the benefits we've realized from tax reform into wages and benefits. Additionally, we continue to experience underperformance in the long-term care pharmacy business. Excluding those two items, standalone retail pharmacy adjusted operating income grew solidly by about 5% over full-year 2017. Notably, our market leading script growth increased our pharmacy market share to a record 26% in December. In the PBM, adjusted claims increased 6.1% over full-year 2017, driven by net new business wins and continued adoption of maintenance choice. PBM operating income was up nearly 1%, as expected. The formulary and cost management strategies, Caremark has developed effectively mitigated drug costs increases in 2018. Prices for non-specialty medications decreased 4.2% for commercial clients, while we also held price growth on specialty products to just 1.7%, despite even higher list price increases. We also worked to improve health outcomes and reduce member costs successfully driving the average cost per script for plan members down for a third year in a row. And finally, the Health Care Benefits medical membership was 22.1 million. Government programs represented approximately half of HCB's insured membership at year end '18 positioning the segment to drive future growth. Overall, HCB operations performed as we expected. Medicare advantage membership growth materially outpaced the market fuelled in part by our strong STAR's performance. Our clinical care and service programs expanded their reach in 2018, resonating in the marketplace and strengthening the value proposition of our commercial offerings. Adjusted gross margin for legacy CVS Health was 15.6%, up 20 basis points compared to full-year 2017. This was due to mix given that the higher margin retail business grew faster than the PBM. Total adjusted operating expense dollars increased 12%, largely driven by the addition of Aetna's business as well as investments from a portion of the tax reform benefits into the retail business and cost to support pharmacy growth. As noted in our press release this morning, due to continued industry-wide and operational challenges, in Q4, we've recorded a $2.2 billion goodwill impairment charge on the long-term care business. Transitioning to our 2019 guidance, there are a few key changes to note. Beginning in '19, we are realigning or segments for changes to our operating model that I'll detail shortly. And our adjusted operating income guidance reflects the adoption of Aetna's legacy definition, which excludes intangible amortization. We maintain the same definition for adjusted EPS, which excludes intangible amortization and transaction and integration costs, which were consistent across both companies. A summary of the changes is included in the slides we posted to our website along with the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. 2018 has been adjusted for comparability as appropriate. As stated in our press release, consolidated full-year adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.68 to $6.88, down from the $7.08 we reported in 2018. We expect consolidated full-year 2019 adjusted operating income between $14.8 billion to $15.2 billion with consolidated revenue in the range of $249.9 billion to $254.3 billion. For the segments, we expect operating income in the Retail/Long Term Care segment to be in the range of $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion and Pharmacy Services segment in the range of $4.8 billion to$ 4.9 billion. We expect that HCB segment operating income to be in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. Significant synergies will be generated by the combined business this year stemming from elimination of duplicative corporate and operational functions, purchasing efficiencies, and some medical cost savings including formulary alignment. These synergies are expected to be between $300 million and $350 million in 2019, and we are on track to exceed our goal of $750 million in 2020. Additionally, there will be investments and initiatives designed to set the foundation for future new product offerings. Investments are being made to further our analytics and digital capabilities develop new programs such as chronic kidney care, and enhance Aetna's clinical platform. We expect our incremental investment spending to be between $325 million and $350 million in 2019. Integration costs of approximately $550 million are excluded from our non-GAAP guidance. We expect to deliver between $9.8 billion to $10.3 billion of cash flow from operations. We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities. After the payment of our shareholder dividend, capital retention to support our insurance operation and growth capital expenditures of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion, we will use the remaining cash available to continue to pay down debt. As we stated, when we announced the Aetna acquisition, while we intend to maintain our shareholder dividend, we will not restart share repurchases or engage in large M&A transactions until we achieve our leverage targets. We expect to pay down our maturities this year as they come to and have other sources of pre-payable debt available to us. We expect leverage to modestly improve, and we will pay down debt in line with previous expectations. Moving on to the segments, for the year, we expect Retail/Long Term of revenue to be between $85.3 billion and $86.8 billion with adjusted operating income down about 10%. Retail is expected to continue to deliver strong adjusted script growth in the range of 4.5% and 6.8% due to continued successful execution of our pharmacy clinical care program that drive improved adherence and patient retention. Additionally, we will experience growth in the Medicare partnerships we formed in 2018, as well as a few new regional preferred relationships in 2019. The contraction and adjusted operating income reflects the annualization of tax reform investments and expected performance of long term care. These factors are expected to contribute nearly half of the contraction. Continued reimbursement pressure without the full benefits of traditional offsets is also causing contraction. Historically, reimbursement pressure has been primarily offset by growth in generics as well as inflation on branded pharmaceuticals. We will experience a larger year-over-year headwind from a lower contribution from break-open generics and diminished return on generic dispensing increases. The front of store is expected to drive margin with a focus on winning in our health and beauty businesses through improved customer personalization and consumer engagement. Front store margin rate and dollars are expected to expand year-over-year. As we look to the future, we believe CVS Retail is best position in the market to deal with the challenges we see. Our best-in-class clinical programs will allow us to continue to gain market share. We have strong partnerships with payers, including incentives to drive dispensing into our CVS channel. And finally, we will continue to drive efficiencies in our pharmacies through the use of technology and productivity improvements. Now, let me turn to the PBM. This segment's 2019 reported figures will be affected by two important reporting changes. First, our Individual SilverScript PDP will move from the PBM segment to the Health Care Benefits segment enabling us to rapidly create the best products for seniors in advance of the 2020 bid season, in this important part of our business. We have restated 2018 results for comparability. And this information is also available on our website. Second, we will consolidate the pharmacy operations of Aetna into the PBM to enable us to rapidly drive efficiencies. For the PBM segment, in 2019, we expect revenue to be in the range of $136.5 billion to $139 billion with adjusted operating income down low-single-digits. There are a few key elements driving 2019 PBM performance to note. As we have stated previously, price compression continues to be a factor in the marketplace, exacerbating the impact is the cumulative effect on rebate guarantees due to lower branded inflation. Second, the net benefits from the 2019 selling season are expected to be modest. And we expect Anthem to remain a stronger headwind given the investments required to onboard the business on its accelerated timeline. The on-boarding is expected to begin in the second quarter of this year. As a reminder, the revenue for this contract will be recorded on a net basis. Our retention rate stands at a strong 98% for 2019. In addition, Centene has notified us of their intent to move their business to their PBM partner RxAdvance. It is expected to begin in 2019, although the exact timing is not clear at this point. The retention rate I mentioned, excludes any impact from this transition. Additionally, the PBM will benefit from the segment's shift. On a like-for-like basis, operating income will be down mid-single digits versus 2018. It is clear that the PBM industry is in the middle of an environmental change given the dialogue around rebate. However, it is also clear that the PBM brings tremendous savings and value to the clients we serve. The importance of size, scale and customer relationships will continue to be paramount, and we remain focused on delivering the value our clients expect. Finally, in the Health Care Benefits segment, we expect revenue between $67.7 billion and $68.7 billion in 2019. We expect continued strength in our government programs with top line increases, driven by industry-leading Medicare growth as well as the key Medicaid wins in Kansas and Florida. We expect to end the year between 22.7 million and 23 million medical members as we expect strong commercial ASC membership teams to complement our government program growth. A handful of other dynamics will impact HCB results, including: year one deal synergies will disproportionately benefit the HCB segment; second, incremental investments will be deployed in 2019 to accelerate growth, enhance infrastructure and drive market differentiation; third, the suspension of the Health Insurer Fee in 2019 will impact certain operating ratios, while the after-tax impact of this suspension versus 2018 is immaterial. And finally, certain onetime benefits realized by Aetna in 2018 are not expected to repeat in 2019, and the HCB segment will be negatively affected by the segment movements discussed earlier. Excluding the segment news, the incremental investments we're making in 2019 to accelerate growth and the impact of the HIF suspension, HCB operating income is expected to grow modestly. Turning to operating efficiencies, both CVS and Aetna have had a strong history of successful cost productivity initiatives. And as we begin integrating the two companies, we are seeing the opportunity to accelerate our cost savings across the enterprise even further than originally expected. As Larry stated, we are embarking upon an aggressive cost reduction initiative. The savings this will generate will help offset the competitive dynamics we have experienced, drive the creation of more affordable products for our customers and provide capacity that will help us achieve our financial targets as we continue to invest in our strategic and transformational initiatives. We are confident that these initiatives will help drive longer-term growth in the combined business beyond 2019. Before I wrap up, I want to touch on expectations for the first quarter and the remainder of the year. In Q1, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $1.49 to $1.53, and GAAP EPS of $1.4 to $1.8. As you look at the spreads for the remainder of the year, you can assume that the seasonality of our expected results this year will closely resemble that of our reported results in 2018. Year-over-year growth of consolidated adjusted operating income will be highest through the first three quarters as we wrap the addition of Aetna. In the legacy CVS business, Retail, Long Term Care and PBM, we expect to see our greatest level of year-over-year deterioration in Q1 with operating income growth in those segments improving as we move throughout the year. Adjusted operating income within HCB is expected to be greatest in Q1 and lowest in Q4. At our Investor Day in June, we will provide you a more detailed roadmap to long-term growth. We will provide you with our long-term targets, including more specifics around the innovative products and services we plan to bring to market. We'll also layout our capital structure and allocation plan to provide you with more visibility into the timeline for returning more capital to shareholders, while also continuing to invest in the business. With that, I'll turn the call back to Larry. Larry Merlo : All right. Thanks, Eva. Well, CVS is much better position to provide value to our customers and the broader community through our new enterprise model. And our diversified company is providing our stakeholders with a highly effective ability to make health care more local, more simple, and less costly, while reducing our dependencies on dispensing revenue and maximizing the benefits from value added services. We have a number of unique offerings being piloted or launched in the coming months. And those capabilities utilize enterprise assets in a differentiated way with the goal of increasing consumer engagement, while improving health outcomes and lowering costs. As an example, expanding MinuteClinic services and incorporating CVS community assets in conjunction with Aetna analytics around the member's next best action will allow us to help individuals achieve a better health outcome. And we see tremendous opportunities ahead, whether it's improving adherence, close the gaps in care, engaging high risk members through care managers or providing new approaches to complex disease management. Just take the mitigation of hospital readmissions. We understand the contributing factors to readmission and we can now bring solutions to those factors. Aetna had about 470,000 hospital discharges in 2017, and about 47,000 of those were readmitted at an average cost of $14,000. If we're successful cutting that number in half, we remove more than $300 million of costs, while creating a better patient experience. Again, the list of opportunities goes well beyond the few examples mentioned. Importantly, many of these unique service offerings will ultimately be available to our health plan clients creating value across the health care system. And it's this combination of assets and capabilities that will ultimately drive enterprise growth and create significant shareholder value. So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Cherny from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Larry, Eva, if we think about all the headwinds, in particular, that you outlined going back to the -- your conference presentation last month, I guess, relative to then, what was bigger than you expected? And I guess, most importantly, as you think about all of the big ones, whether it's, Omnicare, Anthem, Centene transition, et cetera, what do you view as the most transitory, in particular, what you have the most confidence in their transitory that'll be able to reverse itself or at least improve in '20 and beyond? Larry Merlo : Yes, Mike, it's Larry. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Mike, as you look at the transitory nature of the headwinds, you think about the impact of the investments in tax reform. That rolls off midyear of this year. You look at the inflation impact on our rebate guarantees. That peaks in 2019 and rolls off at the end of 2020. We certainly expected Omnicare performance to stabilize and improve. And as you think about the contribution of generics, as we've talked many times, they're going to be peaks and valleys that can occur in any given year. As we sit here today and look at what that looks like for 2020, we expect that to improve, so many of these headwinds are transitory in nature. And also keep in mind that there are parts of the business that have momentum, growth in Medicare, growth in the commercial business. We've got momentum at retail much just in front store growth and pharmacy growth as well. And we're really pleased with the speed with which we're executing the integration activities. Eva Boratto : And, Larry -- again seeing that that I would add there, as Larry outlined, we also see additional opportunities to continue to manage our call space and reduce our core to help mitigate these headwinds as we go forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Gill from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Let me just -- first, just go back to the guidance, again. And just looking at the different segments versus our numbers in the street, it looks like the biggest headwind year-over-year is clearly on the Retail side. Larry, when you talked about things that were transitory, not, obviously, --Omnicare, being one of them. Is that the biggest driver, one within Retail, you talked about a new type of model around reimbursement? It says something that you believe will take hold in 2020 and reimbursement will start looking better. I just really want to understand how we think about how retail really turns around would be the first part of my question. And then secondly, how do we think about that $3 billion cost cutting initiative that you talked about a couple of years ago? Where do we see that in the numbers? And how is that coming along? Eva Boratto : Hi, Lisa, this is Eva. I'll start, okay. As you think about the performance in Retail, contracting about 10%, the impact of Omnicare as well as the tax reform investment that it represents about half of the contraction. And clearly, the next most significant driver is what Larry described around lower benefit from generics in 2019. In terms of the streamlining efforts, that is on track, and we're delivering in line with our expectation. It's reflected in both the PBM and the Retail segments. Kevin Hourican : Good morning, Lisa, this is Kevin. I can also talk about the longer-term component. Our plan to improve profit outlook in Retail is focused on three very important things. First is to grow the top line. Increasing the script volumes enables us to leverage the highly fixed-cost nature of retail pharmacy fulfillment. That's the first. The second is to lower our fixed and variable costs. As Eva just spoke through, there is significant productivity improvement, namely automation within the pharmacy fulfillment process as well as continued reduction in cost of goods sold through Red Oak. The third, and Larry mentioned this in his prepared remarks, is the migration to a new and improved third-party peer contracting model. We will align incentives with payers to lower overall health care costs and begin to reduce the pressure over time on the actual core pharmacy reimbursement rates. Lisa Gill : And then, just as a follow-up to that, is Omnicare strategic to the company going forward? I mean, if I listen to you, Omnicare has been a headwind last year. Even you just talked about it being half of the headwind for 2019. Is this a strategic asset for CVS going forward? Larry Merlo : Lisa, it's Larry. The growth opportunity with Omnicare was always focused on the independent and assisted living spaces. And those opportunities still exist. And they're consistent with our strategy of putting the customer at the new place of transforming care. The challenges that we have in that business are really around the skilled nursing facilities, which happen worse than we originally expected. Operator : Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Just going back, I was hoping to -- and I can certainly understand the directional commentary. But are you guys willing actually sort of quantify the drags in each of the buckets, as you sort of laid out the headwinds just gives more clarity on kind of the numbers and the size of each of the drags? Eva Boratto : Yes, Ralph, this is this Eva. In terms of -- I tried to quantify the pieces of it. As you look at Retail, which has the most significant impact. The impact of Omnicare, as well as the annualized impact of the tax reform investment, is driving nearly half of the contraction on the Retail business. And think about the remainder, clearly the lack of generics as the biggest driver there. Certainly on the PBM side, the impact of the cumulative nature of the rebate guarantees affected by the lower inflation is a pretty significant driver on the PBM business. Additionally, we said it'll keep in '19. We had some impact in '18. It's what new is that the key element moving us to the lower end of our guidance rage. And we do expect that to move through 2020. Ralph Giacobbe : And then just maybe a quick follow-up, you had a little more time to digest the HHS rebate proposal. Any updated thoughts there, and particularly, if it gets implemented for 1120? And then more broadly, you mentioned the new PBM sort of net pricing model. You expect, I think, you expect to see a small number initially and more rapid adoption beyond 2022. I guess, how do you drive that change, particularly if employees like the legacy model? And do you see yourselves perhaps moving to just that net pricing model and just moving away from rebates altogether? Thanks. Larry Merlo : Yes, Ralph, it's Larry. Maybe I'll take the first part and flip it over to Derek and talk about the new pricing model. But as you look at the rebate role, we fully support the administration's objectives where were drug prices and out-of-pocket costs for consumers. And CVS has pioneered a number of innovative solutions that hit delivered against that goal. Unfortunately, we see the rebate role taking us backwards, not forwards. And we've been very public about the fact that 100% of rebates are turned over in the Medicare business, and have been utilized by down premiums. You look at that dynamic, premiums will increase in some actuarial report have it, growing as much as 52%. We actually took a step back and looked at today's Part B program. We went back to 2009, we looked at monthly premiums, 10 years ago, we were $29, 10 years later, $32. At the same time you look at generics, they represent about 90% of all Part D scripts that are dispensed. So those are two important data points that absolutely point to premiums increasing for everyone. And the reality that, yes, a small percentage of seniors may not have favorably, but again, the actuaries are estimating as many as 70% of beneficiaries are going to be worse off. So one of the concerns that we have is that we'll -- fewer beneficiaries' sign up for Part D, and then you look at the estimated cost that $200 billion over 10 years. And it put taxpayers on the hook and branded pharma ends up with a profit windfall. There are certainly readily available solutions in the commercial space that can be applied to Medicare. And you look at what those potentially could be. We work with commercial clients today to reduce out-of-pocket costs with Point of Sale rebates and the utilization of a preventive drug list. We think programs like that are far better solutions than the proposed role. And we also have -- we've talked about the real-time benefits tool in Caremark. Kevin's got a similar program in our retail pharmacies. And both of those tools have reduced out-of-pocket costs for consumers. So we're certainly laying in during the comment period, with our concerns with the rebate role, but more importantly, what we believe the appropriate solutions are to address the root cost of what we're trying to solve for. Derica? Derica Rice : Good morning, Ralph, this is Derica. In regards to our new pricing model, what we're calling the guarantee net cost model, we've had two clients who adopted for 2019. In addition to that, we've already provided to all of the benefit consultants draft contract language. So they've been able to walk through and see all of the elements in terms of the fine print and the details. The feedback thus far has been very positive. So we will look to continue to drive a more rapid adoption through the remainder of '19 and more specifically for the 2020 period. In terms of rebates, whether we have rebates or discounts, what we really want is still the opportunity and this is kind of piggybacking on HHS rule question. Our ability to execute formulary management, which is the methodology we've been able -- as a tool, we've been able to use historically to be able to free rebate or discounts from manufacturers to create value for our clients and our members. So as long as we have access to that where we have to be able to do that with the manufacturers, we will be able to execute the GNC model. And really what this means is getting to the lowest net costs. It is not a focus on aggregate rebate value. Eva Boratto : Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : First, I wanted to discuss rebate guarantees and the break-over generics. I'm just trying to understand and make the 2020. So it sounded like, Larry, you said, break-over generics get better in 2020 versus 2019. You give us any order of magnitude there and then same thing on rebate generic views. It sounds like it peak in '19. Does it get better in 2020 in your mind? And maybe you could tell us about some of the remediation that you've assumed in these -- in your guidance about rebate guarantees? Jonathan Roberts : Yes, Justin, this is John. I'll take the generic question for. So, the overall dollar amount of generic launches in '19 is similar to what we saw in '18, but there are some key differences. So you heard us talk about less value from break-open generics in '19 compared to '18. And that's primarily due to the timing of the launches leading to slower progress in '19 to the break-open status. But there are also more generics launching in '19 compared to '18 that are single source generics, where we're unable to optimize our profitability during that exclusivity period. And as a result, these generics for the most part are headwinds in '19. And finally, in '19, we're seeing generics that launch with limited competition stay with limited competition even after the exclusivity period expires. And this is driven by many factors, including manufacturing, complexity and regulatory approval timelines. But as we look forward into 2020, based on what we know today, we see 2020 improving from where we were in '19. Derek Gorney : And Justin, this is Derek. In regards to the rebate guarantees exposure, just recall from both Eva and Larry's remarks that we anticipate that the rebate exposure peeks in 2019. And we anticipate that it will anticipate over the '20-2021 period. And we've also been able to go back and adjust our underwriting models to now we're assuming a mid-single digit inflation rate. Justin Lake : So if I could just sneak in a follow-up, the last number you gave us on rebates retention was $300 million, I believe. And that's net of payouts for rebate guarantees. Given the rebate guarantees have gone up, can you give us an updated number there? Eva Boratto : Justin, this is Eva. That was a standalone legacy CVS, PBM. And I would say it's in the same zip code if you will, in terms of that overall two to three percentage points. Operator : Our next question comes from Ana Gupte from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Ana Gupte : My question was about on the health benefits side. The medical loss ratio you had said that the experience rated book would create a reset. It's a bit more than we had anticipated. Wanted to know if this is kind of a one-time thing? And can you talk about, on the commercial side, what the implications were there for membership on either retention and/or new growth? And also if you are -- when you're planning to go-to-market with Aetna and Caremark books together? Is that going to be mid-year this year and one month training, maybe later? Eva Boratto : Ana, this is Eva. I'll start. As you look at our guidance for the MBR, it's about 84%, there are couple of things that I would call out. First, obviously, the mechanics of the HIF, as well as if you look at the mix of our business, we have very material growth in the government services business, which, obviously, also increases that MBR. And it's early in the year, and we feel it's important to be proven as we look at these estimates. Karen Lynch : And Ana, just to answer your question on when we'll go-to-market with Caremark, look, obviously, we're in the process of evaluating where we have opportunities. We are rapidly looking at where we have medical and pharmacy and vice versa, working very closely with Derica. We're building products and service capabilities so that we can go to market. And you should expect us to see go to market later this year early in '20. Ana Gupte : If I could just sneak in a follow-up on that, so also on the tax reform, Aetna had seen some pressure on MLR rebates. I mean, will this combination help you on that might that's start in 2020. And I think you also had talked about enterprise value in your last communications both closed. And is that going to impact how you price your Aetna book because you do have value that's created now from the PBM and Retail that wasn't there earlier? Karen Lynch : Yes, relative to pricing we will factor all that and consider that in our pricing. But, Ana, what I would tell you is, we'll continue to maintain pricing discipline on our commercial book, but we'll take the value of a combined organization or the value that we expect to capture some additional services in consideration when we do price our book. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : So for the HCB segment, the slides include their comment that excluding segment shift impacts, incremental investments and the impact of the HIF, the operating income is expected to grow modestly over 2018. I think some investors might have been expecting that profit growth to be a little bit stronger in '19, just given the robust Medicare Advantage membership growth for Aetna, actually both last year and this year. I know there's a general notion that new MA lives aren't that profitable in year one. Maybe you can just give a little more color high level around the Medicare Advantage membership growth in 2019. Maybe just frame it in terms of top line growth versus profit growth within HCB? Thanks. Eva Boratto : Yes, Steve, this is Eva. I think a key aspect is we noted in our prepared remarks that we're making significant investments in terms of transformation. There's some of that affecting the HCB segment. So the modest growth is obviously taking into account that that impact. Karen Lynch : Let me just comment on general Medicare growth in '19 and '20 -- both years. We are above industry growth. You have to consider when you look at our Medicare business to split the mix between individual and group. Obviously, there are different margin profiles on those books. If you think about 2020, we are exceptionally pleased with the growth that we have for one-one. As you've seen, we're above industry growth. It is really, truly reflecting the number of years that we've been investing in Medicare, it's reflecting our starts performance, it's reflecting our expansion into different geographic counties, and really tight management of our benefit products. What I would also say to you is the way to think about our growth for 1/1 -- think about it half group and half individual. Operator : Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Larry, going back to the HHS rebate rule, I understand the questions that you raised, but assuming that the rule is finalized effective 1/1/20, it seems that there's going to be a change to the business model as we know it today. So, one, can you fully offset with premium increase an impact on the PDP business; two, what would be the implications for your commercial, that is based on past experience, how long does it take before we see the spillover effect to commercial changes; and three, you're in the hole on the commercial book on rebate guarantees. Is the new role a material enough change that will allow you to go back to your commercial customers and trigger a change in current contractual terms that can help offset that? Larry Merlo : Ricky, it's Larry. In terms of your first question around the offsets, yes, we would underwrite that with a different set of assumptions, Ricky, and some of that goes back to my earlier comments. The concern would be will people deselect from a Part D program because of the increase in monthly premiums? We know from all the research we've done over the years that beneficiaries -- that's the first thing they look at, and SilverScript has been successful growing with holding down that monthly premium level for the reasons that I touched on earlier. Your second point, Ricky, around commercial -- our sense is -- what is it that our clients want and value? I would sit here today and say broadly, our commercial clients value the same elements that the Medicare Part D program works. They want to use the rebates and discounts to buy down the monthly premium. So, I'm not sure that I see a rapid adoption in the commercial space for that reason, and Ricky, the other thing that I would point out is I think many people are aware that Caremark introduced a new plan this year -- it was called Allure -- where it priced...it took the rebates and applied point-of-sale. We had a very small number of seniors enroll in that program -- it was around 20,000 -- and we think one of the barriers to that was the increase that we saw in the monthly premium. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. So, a follow-up question here. If you can refer to -- if the change happens, can you go back and change some contractual terms? And then second follow-up is obviously, 2019 is a transition year, and you're going to give long-term guidance on your Analyst Day, but it's been over a year since you gave us a year two accretion goal. Can you give us any update there, or what type of growth should we expect next year? Larry Merlo : Ricky, in terms of the other question on can we go back to clients -- should there be a material change in how the programs are written, the answer to that question is yes. And, in terms, Ricky, for 2020 outlook, we're not going to provide that today. We're working diligently, recognizing that we have made great progress on the integration work that was tied to the synergy goals that we talked about, and as you think about the regulatory pathway, quite frankly, it was very late in that process that we were able to begin the transformation work in earnest. So, we're pretty pleased that we've got concept stores up and running, we've got a number of pilots in market, and a whole other series ready to go to market to learn and understand, and that is our primary objective -- to complete more of that work so that when we get to June, we will be able to provide more of a long-term outlook. Operator : Our next question comes from Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Ann Hynes : I actually just want to follow up on Ricky's question because I do think 2020 is important because when you closed the deal, you did give some directional guidance of mid-single digits, and if you adjust for tax reform, it would suggest a mid-$8.00 range. And, the reason I bring it up is because that's where your consensus estimate is now, so I know you don't want to comment on it, but what do you think that we should consider in our models as the biggest change to your business model since you gave that guidance in December of 2017, I believe? So, that's one. Secondly, on the Retail operating profit decline, if you ex the Omnicare and, I think you said, the tax reform investment is down 5% -- I know you say it's because break-open generic is less of an offset, but I still think that's very low. Can you give us some more detail on what's happening there so we put it in our models going forward? Because it just seems a bigger decline that I would think. Thanks. Kevin Hourican : This is Kevin. I'll take the Retail question, and then Eva will talk about 2020. The primary headwind in the Retail profitability excluding Long-Term Care and the tax investment is in pharmacy reimbursement. It's impacting small operators and big operators. It's a secular headwind impacting everyone. What we talked about is a tailwind that typically is utilized to help us blunt that reduction is the generic wave, and John covered well that that value year over year is down. Eva also mentioned in her prepared remarks that there's benefit from branded inflation that helps that blunting as well, and that number is down year over year. So, we're seeing a consistent headwind. It's the two tailwinds themselves that reduced in value year over year, and as I mentioned a few moments ago, our plan to address that for 2020 and beyond is to accelerate our top-line growth. The good news in our retail business is we are winning in the top line. We're taking market share in both the front and pharmacy business, we're resonating with consumers, growing share of vault with consumers, and taking market share. What we need to do more of for 2020 and beyond is increase the year-over-year value of productivity improvement. We have some compelling innovations coming in technology improvement that can help automate things that are currently done manually within the pharmacies, and I'll just repeat : The most important thing we need to do is make a pivot in our third-party payer contracting. We are going to lead the change there to migrate to a new method of doing pharmacy contracting. We're going to start with ourselves. So, by owning a large insurer and owning the largest PBM, we can lead that change by structuring a contracting relationship that if we can lower overall healthcare costs, we can take some of the burden off of the annual reimbursement reform, and where that will come from -- this is the last thing I'll say -- is we can prove through technology and clinical care programs that we can improve medication adherence, we can maximize the formulary compliance that Derica spoke to in his remarks, we can do things that are net new -- like reduce hospitalization -- through our clinical outreach program, saving Aetna money, and then we can share in the benefit of that from our Retail segment. We intend to bring that model to the other payers, and two of the other payers also own an insurance company. Larry Merlo : And, I just want to emphasize the last point that Kevin just mentioned because I've come to appreciate -- when you look at the Aetna business today, more than 50% of their claims have some type of outcomes-based reimbursement tied to that, and it's all on the medical side, with providers. Pharmacy has not penetrated that, and this new model is going to demonstrate the role that Pharmacy can play in terms of affecting and improving outcomes, and I think it's one of the big unlocks as you think about an open-platform concepts that we could make elements of broadly available in the market. Eva Boratto : Ann, this is Eva. I'll go back to your 2020 question. As Larry said, it's still really early to give 2020 guidance or expectations, but let me try to provide you some color. In terms of the accretion numbers that were provided back when the deal was announced, it's really difficult at this point in time to speak to those. Given the timing of the deal close, you'd have to mix and match periods as well as changes related to tax reform. But, what is 100% clear is that Aetna is performing at or better than our expectations. We absolutely stand behind the estimates of the value being created by the deal, and as we've said, we're tracking ahead of our year two synergy number of 2020. The factors affecting what I'll say the legacy CVS business is -- as you think about 2020, all of those factors will either improve or phase out, the tax reform investment, obviously, is complete, the impact of the rebate guarantee peaks in '19 and is reduced in 2020, and we expect those Omnicare and generics to improve in 2020. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Jones : Just to follow up there on the synergies, it clearly sounds like you're still on track. Maybe one of the other sides of it that was a little bit larger than I think we would have expected was the incremental spending in order to achieve those synergies. So, just on the numbers that you provided for this year, could you talk a little bit about what that spend is, exactly? Eva, I know you said that HCB would disproportionately benefit from the synergies this year. Is that safe to assume where the incremental spend would also come? Eva Boratto : So as we think about the additional investment spending, it's in the $325-350 million range. I would put that spending into two large buckets. Supporting transformation -- it includes investment in our clinical platform to more effectively engage members, our chronic care initiatives, and other initiatives aimed at improving outcomes and lowering costs. The other area that we're continuing to invest in and expand our investment is digital, and improving the digital and mobile experience for members and customers across all of our businesses, and we're making investments in our Health Cloud software platform. So, a large amount of these investments do affect the businesses. There was zero in 2019, if you will, in the denominator for which we're comparing. Robert Jones : Okay. And it's safe to assume, Eva, that as we roll beyond 2019, these costs should reduce? That would just be the quick follow-up. And then, the other question I had was just more housekeeping. As we look at the guide for HCB housekeeping, is prior-period development included or excluded from that guidance? Thanks. Eva Boratto : Bob, I'll take your last question first. There is no -- consistent with Aetna's legacy practices, there is no prior-period development included in our guidance. In terms of investments in the business, yeah, I do think as -- the investments will step down over time, but we will continue to invest in our business as we're evolving to our new model, with the consumer at the center. Larry Merlo : Bob, also just keep in mind -- to that point -- as you've heard us talk on the Retail side -- more on the CapEx side -- we have the opportunity to repurpose capital that we would have spent in areas that can be dedicated to our activities here, so that's one of the reasons why you don't hear us talking about it in that regard. Eva Boratto : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : I just want to go back to Omnicare real quickly here. You've kind of written off maybe upwards of half of the value of what you put into it initially when you consider the debt you took on as well. It's also just two pieces you're talking about -- it's the piece that you're interested in, which was the independent assisted living market versus the SNF market. When you talk about the turnaround here, is it that you expect initiatives to grow the business in assisted living -- that's going to take off, or is that you think the declines in the SNF business are going to slow? You've been talking about this for a little bit -- what gives you the confidence here that you would expect that to turn as you get into '20? Larry Merlo : Charles, it's Larry. Just one quick comment on that, and then I want to flip it over to John. As you look at the Omnicare business, don't lose sight of -- there was a specialty component of that business, which has been fully integrated and quite successful for the business. So, I don't want to lose that element of the acquisition. Jonathan Roberts : Charles, this is John. So, what gives us the confidence that we can stabilize the long-term care -- that's the SNF. We have to think about stabilizing that. We've invested in account management personnel so that they're providing higher levels of service to the facilities. We've seen significant improvements in our service levels, and our retention rates are improving pretty significantly, and we're putting technology in that assists these facilities in communicating with the pharmacy. So, we think service ties directly to retention, and we've made significant improvements there. And then, we still are very bullish on our ability grow in assisted living. We've implemented a new service model -- we call them \"community care centers\" so that there's a single point of contact with that community staff for senior living. That was not the case prior to this past year. And then, we introduced some tools that we think are going to be very attractive to these facilities, like multi-dose packaging that is better than what's available generally in the market with barcode scanning. And then, we're also leveraging our CVS retail pharmacies for staff deliveries to these facilities, so these pharmacies are closer than the Omnicare pharmacies; they can respond more rapidly and actually develop a local relationship with these facilities along with the Omnicare pharmacy. So, we think we'll be able to not only grow our penetration rate in these assisted living facilities, but we're seeing existing clients where we didn't have all of the existed living facilities actually give us more of their facilities because of the services and changes and enhancements that we've made. Charles Rhyee : Just to follow up with that, my understanding is that assisted living -- part of the problem with that market was that the facilities themselves didn't think of themselves as healthcare providers, more as residential communities. Is that behavior starting to change? It seems like a lot of the issues that you're discussing here are actually issues, probably, that Omnicare dealt with years ago as well, and so, placing more of a structural issue, particularly in the SNF market. Any structural changes you're seeing that you think of as being positive as you move forward here? Thanks. Jonathan Roberts : I think the structural changes we're seeing -- with senior living or independent living, they're trying to be able to provide continuity of care as people progress through the different phases of aging and they move from independent living to assisted living, and so, we think our value proposition will resonate even more based on these changing dynamics and what we've seen historically. Michael McGuire : We'll take one more question, please. Operator : Our final question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : One question I had on the Aetna business -- the Health Benefits business -- if you could just tell us on an apples-to-apples basis -- any of the shifts between the segments and the like -- what Aetna would have looked like excluding any cost shifts that you may have done into that segment and the like. What would we be looking at? That's the first question. The second question -- can you talk about the magnitude of the Centene loss? Should we expect to see that revenue loss and how it would roll -- impact the PBM margins positively or negatively going forward? Eva Boratto : Kevin, this is Eva. I'll take the first question regarding Aetna's performance without the shifts. What we're seeing -- the most clarity I can give you here is without the shifts and some of the things we've called out, we expect to see modest growth. The business has tailwinds behind it with the growth on membership in both commercial and government space, benefiting nicely from the synergies, but we're also making investments. So the best on a same-same basis, modest growth on the bottom line, obviously, normalizing for the health insurance fee impact. Kevin Caliendo : Right, OK. And then, on Centene? Derica Rice : Hi, Kevin. This is Derica. In regard to Centene, keep in mind that it will be a multiyear migration. We anticipate that it will start in 2019, likely hit the peak in 2020, and there will probably be a residual in 2021. And, as Centene is migrating, they're looking to move to their own PBM platform, RxAdvance. Eva Boratto : And, Kevin, just to add one thing to Derica's point, while the exact timing with these large changes -- you don't know exactly how the rollout will go -- in our guidance range, we have made estimates within the range around our expected migration. Kevin Caliendo : Got it. And, just one more -- on the well care, the PDP business that you sold the WellCare -- how is that incorporated into the numbers now, and what's the magnitude? Eva Boratto : So, WellCare -- it's a transition year. The economics still continue to benefit \u2026 Karen Lynch : Yes, they benefit Aetna. They're still in the Aetna results as we're transitioning it out. Kevin Caliendo : Okay, great. I just wanted to make sure they were still included in there. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Larry Merlo : So, we know this was a long call, we know there was a lot of information, a lot of questions, and as is always the case, Mike and his team will be available for any follow-ups, and I'm sure we'll see many of you soon. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CVS Health Q1 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Joe Krocheski : Good morning everyone and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the conference call to discuss CVS Health's first quarter 2019 results and outlook for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, this call is being recorded on Wednesday, May 1st, 2019. I'm Joe Krocheski, Vice President of Investor Relations for CVS Health. I'm joined this morning by Larry Merlo, President and CEO; and Eva Boratto Executive Vice President and CFO. Following our prepared remarks, we'll host a question-and-answer session. Jon Roberts, COO; Karen Lynch, President of Aetna; Derica Rice, President of Caremark; and Kevin Hourican, President of CVS Pharmacy will also be joining us for the question-and-answer section. In order to provide more people with a chance to ask their questions during the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up. In addition to this call and our press release, we will have posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Our Form 10-Q will be filed later today and that too will be available on our website once filed. Please note, during this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views related to our future financial performance, future events, and industry and market conditions, and forward-looking statements related to the integration of the Aetna acquisition including the expected consumer benefits, financial projections, and synergies. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what may be indicated in the forward-looking statements. We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these specific risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and the cautionary statement disclosures in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in this morning's earnings press release. During this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance and financial condition. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and the comparable GAAP measures in this morning's earnings press release and the reconciliation document posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being broadcast on our website where it will be archived for one year following today's call. Larry Merlo : Thanks Joe. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Today I'm pleased to report that we are off to a strong start to the year as evidenced by our first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.62 which exceeds our initial expectations. The strong performance was driven by all businesses achieving or exceeding what was contemplated at the high end of our guidance ranges with the Health Care Benefits segment leading the favorability. Now, earlier this year, we provided 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $6.68 to $6.88 and as a result of our Q1 performance, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $6.75 to $6.90. This reflects the positive momentum in the business, while acknowledging it's early in the year. We remain singularly focused on driving both near and longer term value for our shareholders. And our first full quarter as a combined entity with Aetna was a success on many fronts. We executed smooth January 1 implementations and both the Pharmacy Services and Health Care Benefits segments posted significant Medicare Advantage membership growth, continued to grow share in our Retail Pharmacy, and we realigned some of our operations to drive greater value. In addition to highlighting these operational achievements, I'll provide updates on important operational initiatives that we called out during our fourth quarter call, progress on our integration and transformation initiatives, the 2020 PBM selling season, and potential policy changes impacting the Medicare Part D program. So, let me start with the notable progress we made on actions to mitigate the near-term headwinds impacting our business. First, our retail sales momentum remains strong, supported by continued focus on our clinical care programs and network relationships. Adjusted prescription volume for the Retail/Long-Term Care segment increased a healthy 5.5% for the quarter. Additionally, our Long-Term Care business is on track to achieve our targeted margin improvements given our cost management efforts and we continue to work diligently in driving growth for the assisted living space. In the PBM, our new guaranteed net cost pricing model continues to garner interest from clients and benefit consultants and will have a small number of clients adopting it this year and we expect higher adoption in 2020 and beyond. We also embarked on a new effort to reduce costs across our enterprise through improvements in productivity and driving efficiencies across our operations. And Eva will provide details on that initiative shortly. Eva Boratto : Thanks, Larry and good morning, everyone. Consistent with prior quarters you can find a slide presentation posted to our website this morning that provides the details of our first quarter results and the financial statements changes we discussed back in February. First quarter results are reported on a comparable basis and the reconciliations to GAAP measures can be found in the press release and on the Investor Relations portion of our website. For non-GAAP, keep in mind that we are now excluding amortization of intangibles from our operating income numbers. I want to reiterate what Larry said. We exceeded the projections we laid out for this quarter and we're pleased with our 2019 results thus far. Our adjusted EPS was above the high end of our guidance range at $1.62 with all segments performing at or above our expectations and Health Care Benefits leading the way. Consolidated revenue grew 34.9% in Q1 2019 above the top end of our guidance range. This year-over-year increase was largely driven by a full quarter of managed care operation included this year versus last. Health Care Benefits which includes our SilverScript Medicare Part D business contributed $17.9 billion of revenue for the quarter. Larry Merlo : Thanks, Eva. We are pleased with the progress and momentum we demonstrated in the quarter as we position ourselves to win in this evolving health care landscape. The breadth of our assets capabilities and experience meaningfully differentiate us from others in the market and provide us unique opportunities to create a company that generates superior value for shareholders and all the constituencies we serve. Next month, we plan on sharing our long-term targets including more specific details on the innovative products and services we plan to bring to market to achieve those goals as well as our earnings, cash flows and debt targets. And we look forward to seeing many of you in New York City on June 4. So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you.  Your first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much and congratulations on the first combined quarter. Larry, let me start with the selling season. I know you said that, there wasn't anything specific to the losses that you've seen thus far for 2020. But if I look at, at least what The Street knows about it looks like they're primarily coming on the health plan side. So do you think that now that you own Aetna that's playing anything into those decisions around health plans doing business with CVS? That would be my first question. And then secondly, as we think about that health plan business as it relates to your retail business can you just talk about utilization as far as script goes? Do you \u2013 are you seeing a lot of those scripts coming through CVS? Or will we see a combined loss of both of those going into 2020? Larry Merlo : Yeah, Lisa, good morning, and I'll take the first part of the question. Lisa, what's interesting is we've just had our Caremark Client Forum a few weeks back. Several of us were there. We spent time with the broader audience as well as our advisory groups, which we have that for each discipline within Caremark. And I would describe the health plans as having an ongoing tremendous amount of interest in terms of what it is that we're doing around transformation and interest in terms of how that can create value for them. So I did not get any sense whatsoever that this notion of channel conflict is entering into the selling season or entering in as a concern. And actually, quite the opposite, wanting to understand where we're at with the transformation and when and how they can benefit from those innovative products and services. Eva Boratto : And Lisa, this is Eva. On your second part of your question I would say, as you know our retail business has worked very strong over the last couple of years to improve our relationships, with other payers and have constructive network offerings. So we'll continue to work on and develop those relationships and don't see anything meaningfully step back there. Lisa Gill : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore. Your line is open. Ross Muken : Good morning, guys. Congrats. So I guess maybe on the retail side, I mean, it seems like the HealthHUBs and I recently saw one myself down in Houston are pretty impressive new institutions. I'm trying to get a sense \u2013 and I don't want to steal too much from the Analyst Day, but just in terms of the progress you've made there and the feedback the sort of loop of figuring out what models work what don't the sort of traffic uptick. So I guess when \u2013 maybe less on sort of anything numerical, but when do you think you'll be able to give us sort of updates on rollout sell-through to sort of the Aetna member base other creative sort of solutions you can come up with if any on the Medicaid side? Just a better sense of how that sort of plan is going to evolve and then how you're able to sort of incorporate that with some of the other omnichannel things you're doing as well as some of the front-end refresh overall? Larry Merlo : Yea, Ross, it's Larry. Great question and I'll take the first part and then I'll ask Kevin to comment perhaps to your point about \u2013 it's difficult to talk quantitatively at this point because we still have a limited amount of time, but I'll ask Kevin to talk qualitatively in terms of what we're seeing, what we're hearing from those that we're serving. Ross, I would describe where we're at today as we got more things right in our concept of what a HealthHUB is then things that we missed. And there are some things that we're tweaking, but as you heard in our prepared remarks, we're ready to complete the Houston market in the coming weeks. And to your other question, we will have a more detailed view of the rollout strategy beyond Houston as it relates to this year as well as 2020. So bottom line as you heard in our remarks we are excited about the opportunity. Kevin Hourican : Yes, Larry. And I \u2013 sorry, It's Kevin. I appreciate the question. We call it creating a compelling place to shop, a reason for the consumer to want to come into the store. And that HealthHUB format is achieving that objective. The consumer reaction has been quite strong. We've added thousands of net new items to the front store in the self-care and wellness arena, expanded MinuteClinic services. We've expanded the pharmacists' interactions with patients with greatest needs. And last but not least, we're really intrigued by the addition of a new position in our store called the care concierge, which is the glue that's kind of pulling together these ecosystems that can help answer consumers' questions about any and all health care needs that they have, including health care benefits in partnership with Aetna and other health plans in the future. And as Larry said at our Analyst Day, we'll talk in more detail about the expansion plans. We're working aggressively on that as we speak and can share those details on June 4. Larry Merlo : Ross, the -- maybe just wrapping up this topic. One of the things that we are learning, that I know is of interest is, out of the gate we've talked about our hub-and-spoke concept. So if you look at what does it take to complete the Houston market, we needed about another 20 stores, which would represent about 15% of the stores in that metroplex, if you will. So we are learning how to build out this hub-and-spoke concept, acknowledging that there are things that we're learning in these stores that we will apply broadly to the stores that aren't hubs in the market. And again, as Kevin mentioned, we'll talk more about that at -- on June 4. But again, the things that we are measuring, the metrics that we're using internally, we're very pleased. They're all meeting the objective or ahead of our target. Kevin Hourican : So just last comment. This is Kevin, again. You asked about omnichannel. We recently announced that we expanded home delivery same day to over 6,000 stores in partnership with Shipt and we're pleased to see consumer adoption to even more convenient home delivery. Ross Muken : And, I guess, maybe on the benefits business, I mean, it seems like you've done, obviously, quite well coming into this year on membership. You had momentum there. As you think about other types of places to integrate the asset base and maybe deeply tie in also, sort of, what you're doing on Caremark. I guess, is there anything like anecdotal, as you've integrated and as you've sort of game-planned, again, maybe at a very high level and you'll share more detail at the Analyst Day, but things where, well, we wouldn't have thought we can do that, or an area of focus where you think you can really sort of move the needle, as you start to laser in on maybe some of these bigger cost opportunities that exist within that sort of cost base? Larry Merlo : Well, Ross, two points on -- to that question. Kevin mentioned the care concierge. And we're gaining a tremendous amount of learnings in terms of what exactly our customers are looking for, based on the interactions this position is having with them. And it covers a wide range of topics. I think the second thing is, there is certainly a lot more that we can do around specialty, based on some of the things that we're seeing and learning. And the third thing, Ross, that I would mention is that, we've got -- you've seen one of the concept stores, but as you think about the various segments that we serve, we could see a HealthHUB that is modified from what you may have seen in Texas, that would play to that segment of beneficiaries, but recognizing that they have different needs than what we may see more broadly in a market. So those are some things that we're working on as well. Ross Muken : Thanks, Larry. Appreciate the commentary. Larry Merlo : Thanks, Ross. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Ana Gupte : Yes. Hey, thanks. Good morning. Glad that you had a good quarter. I wanted to get some color on what the potential would be for growth in 2020. And I, obviously, am not looking for guidance or anything. But if you take a look at your synergy guidance, which you're saying confidently, is above $750 million and it sounds like there's some enterprise savings building on top of Aetna. The Anthem story should become positive, offsetting some of the standard G&A pressures. And even though you have Centene, maybe, they kind of cancel out, maybe net positive. The PBM brand inflation guarantee sounds like that is tapering off and the Omnicare headwind should get better. So when I look at the headwinds offsetting that that could be retail margin pressure, PBM margin pressure. But on balance, where do you see -- I mean, do you think around this close to $7 EPS handle now in 2019, you can go into 2020? Larry Merlo : Yes. Ana, it's Larry and first I -- we appreciate the question. And as you were just ticking off, there are certainly a lot of moving parts as it relates to 2020. And as you heard in our prepared remarks, the point of today's discussion, in light of Investor Day that is a month away, is really to zero in on our Q1 results, our outlook for 2019. We understand and appreciate the questions that are out there beyond 2019 and I can assure you that next month we'll share our near or long-term targets including the details on how we achieve those targets on June 4th. Ana Gupte : Okay. Then maybe just if I can ask on the quarter and follow-up on the margins in retail. I mean, you've come now in line. You've exceeded your original guidance at least on the revenue. And then on the PBM margins, how do you see that shaping up for the industry as a whole into the selling season for the PBM? And in retail with your ability to steer Aetna into your CVS network, does that give you an edge that can offset some of the secular pressures? Eva Boratto : Hi, Ana. This is Eva. I'll try to break apart your questions there. Overall for both of the legacy businesses retail and PBM, our margins, our performance came in at or better than expected. And some of the headwinds that we outlined, whether it was inflation the rebate guarantees, some of the challenges with long-term care, we performed certainly within our expectation. As we said, longer-term, as we think about the store right moving toward providing more services and greater opportunities, higher value, we see those as the opportunities to improve our margins and our performance in that business. Ana Gupte : Great. Thanks for the question. Good luck in the quarter. Eva Boratto : Thanks Ana. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. And congrats for a good start for the year. My question is around the cost savings that you identified $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Should we think about these as net cost savings or gross? And how should we think about the cadence to 2022? And are most of these cost savings coming from the retail segment? Or are they more broadly achievable throughout the enterprise? Jon Roberts : So Ricky, this is Jon. So yes, this modernization effort that we're talking about is -- it's a transformative program that's comprised of initiatives including the work already underway for integration, the business unit productivity programs that we traditionally work on, and then initiatives that are enterprise-wide as our companies have come together. And we're calling that long-term value or LTV initiatives. And there's four core pillars of this program, and I'll just give you a couple of examples. First is, we want to share simplicity and at the same time deliver cost -- substantial cost benefits, and we want to do that while improving our consumer experiences. So within that broader effort, these enterprise initiatives take advantage of the combined company's unique capabilities and assets, while helping us accelerate our savings goals. So some examples of these opportunities include call centers, digitalization of shared services, demand management and rationalization of our IT infrastructure. So this is a multi-year effort. These are net savings numbers. And we'll talk more specifically about this at our Analyst Day on June 4th. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citigroup. Your line is open. Joe Krocheski : Ralph. Ralph Giacobbe : Sorry about that. Yes. Thanks for the question. You called out a favorable prior year and specifically 4Q and then provider recoveries. I was just wondering what the provider recoveries relate to the size of those and over what period of time? Thanks. Eva Boratto : Hi, Ralph. This is Eva. In terms of the prior period development consistent with Aetna legacy practices there was no prior period development included in our guidance. Overall, we experienced favorable development across all of the core businesses as I said in the prepared remarks. And from a magnitude perspective, you can think about it as consistent year-on-year with development last year. Was there another question Ralph? In terms of I think your question also maybe around the settlement with HCA that was taken into account in some of our initial accounting with the acquisition and is not reflected in our results. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Ann Hynes : Hi. Good morning. So since last earnings I think the question I get most from investors is on the retail operating profit. Walgreens reported obviously since you reported and they had similar results. And a lot of investors ask me, if this is the new norm. So can you just talk about what you think can happen in the market or what headwinds will ease over the next couple of years to stabilize the operating profit trajectory of this business? Thanks. Eva Boratto : Hi, Ann. It's Eva. I'll start and Kevin will jump in, in terms of longer term. As you look at our Q1 results, the headwinds are very consistent with what we described as we provided our guidance. Over half of the contraction was attributable to the tax reform investments, our long-term care as well as the incremental tax expense that we cited in this quarter. As you think about the tax reform investments those subside. We are -- those are completed and in the run rate as we get to the back part of the year. We do expect Omnicare performance to improve as we go forward and we do expect generics to improve next year in the near term, although won't be a tailwind as you think about longer term. And we continue to see opportunities to drive services in our stores and increase products as an opportunity to mitigate the traditional headwinds. Kevin Hourican : And Eva Kevin -- thank you. This is Kevin. I'll just build on that on the longer term. We will talk about this more on June 4. But if you think about the opportunities to improve profitability in the upcoming years think about it in a five-part plan. First is drive industry-leading comp store script growth through our clinical adherence programs and increased medication adherence in script drug. Second is cost of goods sold improvement through Red Oak Sourcing. Third is to improve retail productivity through automation and process improvement. Fourth as we talked about briefly on the last call, a new contracting approach that aligns our incentives for reimbursement through lower overall Medicare costs and sharing those savings. And lastly, we're seeing optimistic things in our front store business through health and beauty, sales and profit growth that are drawing more customers into our store. Eva Boratto : And I'll just wrap up with one more thing. Obviously the costs the enterprise modernization initiative that Jon spoke to will benefit all aspects of our business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. First just last quarter you gave us some color on rebate guarantees. Wanted to come back to that just in terms of I think there was a little confusion around whether -- or do rebate guarantees actually get better year-over-year? I know eventually they'll unwind and you'll renegotiate these contracts with less guarantees in them. But does it get better next year meaning positive year-over-year? Or is it just less negative year-over-year? Derica Rice : Justin. Hi, Justin, this is Derica. What we stated was that the rebate exposure will peak in 2019 and then that exposure will begin to dissipate over the ensuing years. So we expect that exposure to get less in 2020 and 2021. And so far this year, it's pretty well within our expectations that we laid out within our guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning, Larry and Eva. So maybe somewhat similar to a couple of the other questions. For the PBM business, just given all the discussion around rebate minimum guarantees, cost guarantees et cetera I was kind of curious at a high level just around the Anthem customer contract. Without getting any numbers just qualitatively only does CVS already have strong visibility internally on what the profit contribution is likely to be from this contract in 2020? Or conversely, just given all of the discussion around guarantees that are baked into many contracts now, could there still be high volatility either up or down for CVS' profits from this large contract in 2020? Thanks. Derica Rice : Hi. This is Derica again. That's a great question. We appreciate it. When we provided our color commentary regarding rebate guarantees and our exposure that included Anthem as well. So when I talked about it our exposure peaking in 2019 and then subsiding in ensuing years that factored in our Anthem contract as well. Larry Merlo : The other thing Steve to keep in mind and I think you heard this on Anthem's call last week that the vast majority of that conversion takes place in the second half of this year to include the Medicare business converting on 1/1/20. Eva Boratto : And Steve the only additional piece I'll add on that as you think about when we onboard large health plans, the margins tend to be thinner earlier in the contract period as we execute on our programs and initiatives to drive improvements in the overall margins and profitability. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just two quick ones, one on the PBM side. Of the $47 billion I think you guys highlighted that was up for renewal this year, how much is left to still be renewed? And then just on the Aetna side of the business I'm curious if you would just share how the performance would have compared to internal expectations, if not for the prior period development in the quarter? Thanks. Larry Merlo : Bob, it's Larry. I'll take the first part. And Bob, we had said we have $47 billion up for renewal. We're just over halfway through the renewal season. It's pretty consistent with where we would have been at this point in time with prior years. Eva Boratto : And in terms of Aetna overall, underlying, the business performed well, including the prior period development. It's early in the year. We -- recall, we onboard a lot of new memberships, so we're monitoring that claim activity very, very closely. But I would say on all fronts, we're pleased with Aetna's performance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Glen Santangelo : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Larry, just wanted to shift gears a little bit and go back to the Retail/Long-Term Care segment. Your scripts in that segment were up 5.5%, which is a little bit stronger than expected, particularly given we had a weaker-than-expected flu season. And so, I'm kind of curious if you could dive into that a little bit more and give us a sense for maybe what drove that trend. I'm guessing it's kind of too early that it's related to the benefits from the acquisition, but anything you can give us on the sustainability of that trend and what drove that will be helpful. Thanks. Kevin Hourican : This is Kevin. It's a good -- appreciate the question. Think about our script growth coming from three components. One is network relationships the third-party payer contracts which are contributing to growth. The second is organic growth through our clinical adherence programs. So by keeping a patient adherent to their medication therapy, it helps them on their path to better health and it drives our business. We're doing very well on those clinical programs and we see sustainability of that growth.  And then the third piece would be new services. We've introduced some compelling new unique services like our Saving Patients Money program, multi-dose packaging and home delivery, as I spoke to earlier. And we're seeing some nice growth in those newer services that we've brought to the market. Operator : Your next question \u2026 Larry Merlo : I was just going to say, Glen, we see those in terms of being foundational and not episodic in nature. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Your line is open. Charles Rhyee : Yeah. Thanks for taking question. Just staying with the Retail segment for a second here. One of your competitors on their call a couple of weeks ago kind of cited generic deflation or the moderating effect of generic deflation as a factor in some of their results. I haven't really heard you guys talk about that. Can you talk about sort of the -- what you're seeing in terms of moderating generic deflation? Because it looks like that trend has been continuing to moderate through March. And how are you kind of thinking about the environment here as we move forward for that? And is that -- and I guess related to that is that already baked into your guidance when you talked about sort of you look at the 10% down with half of it being from -- partly from generics. My assumption had -- my thought had been that you would really be referring more to the prevalence of the break-open generics and not necessarily generic deflation. If you could just provide some color on that, that would be great. Thanks. Eva Boratto : Yeah. This -- Charles, this is Eva. In terms of what we're seeing as it pertains to generics, it is all included in our guidance. And as we outlined back in February, what we're seeing is overall fewer opportunities with break-open generics this year. It is a lighter year relative to the prior years than what we've seen and we see it improving in 2020. Jon Roberts : And then Charles, the only thing I would add is -- you've heard a lot of talk about the improvements in the FDA process that allows suppliers to more rapidly get to the market. That gives us more flexibility. And so, we are seeing less opportunity in 2019 as Eva said, but we think Red Oak continues to deliver value for us -- significant value for us and we expect that to be even better as we move forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. Obviously, the last few years one of the bright spots for Aetna was the growth in MA. And as it's come on board with you guys, Medicare Advantage enrollments accelerated. I wonder if you could just parse out a little bit how you're seeing that growth this year. Is that expanding geographies which was part of the story the last few years? Or is it market share gains? And I know the rule of thumb on Medicare Advantage. In the first year those members typically come on at sort of a breakeven level. Is that what you're assuming? Or is there any reason to think you guys might be able to bring them on more profitably or not? Karen Lynch : Hi, A.J. It's Karen. I would characterize our Medicare Advantage growth coming from a number of places. One, yes, our services area expansion has generated a fair amount of growth for us. But I would also say that we are continuing to grow in our existing footprint and that our same-store growth has generated good Medicare Advantage growth for us. I would also tell you our continued excellence in Star is helping the performance of this product. And we've also been strengthening our clinical management activities, which I think has been resonating in the marketplace. I would also look to the product and product flexibility and our zero-premium plan which has allowed us to grow this year as well. And then we have been very strongly managing our distribution channels. And I would say it's the combination of all those factors that are really driving it. Relative to the margin what I would say is, we are tracking in line with our expectations. We typically expect to see lower margins on first year business, but there's nothing in our metrics that give us any pause for any deterioration. And I would just say that we're in line with what we expected on margins. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Percher from Nephron. Your line is open. Eric Percher : Thank you, Eric Percher and Josh Raskin from Nephron. Larry, you sound more constructive on the safe harbor proposal after the CMS guidance and the demo announcement. Obviously, there is a lot of potential unintended consequences. As we looked at your comments there was a comment toward the end around disallowing of pharmacy purchase discounts which would appear to impact you as a buyer and dispensing pharmacy. So I wanted to ask is that material in your view? And what action do you take to try to offset that if it occurs? Larry Merlo : Well, Eric let me make sure I'm following your question because as we have talked about rebates, we have always provided an all-in number as it relates to rebates. And so we don't see any issues there or misalignments. If I'm following your question what we have talked about is we see rebates as a form of discounting. And we can get into a lot of discussion around how that has brought the net price of pharmaceuticals down for the clients and members that we serve. And if you look at rebates as discounts what we emphasize is through the private sector there has been a lot of good things happen in that regard. And rebates can take some other form, but we must make sure that the private sector competition that results from that that drives down price that the ability to -- for that to continue in the form of some type of discounts doesn't go away. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is open. Kevin Caliendo : Hi. Good morning. One quick question on the prior year development. I just -- I know it wasn't contemplated in the original guidance, but in the updated guidance is there any incremental prior year development built into those numbers? That was the first one. And then the second one on the PBM side historically when we've seen companies with low retention a lot of times they've been able to offset some of the losses by dipping down into the mid-market and maybe taking some share there. Is there a similar strategy or something you can do to offset the headwinds for 2020 on the PBM side strategically? Eva Boratto : So I'll take the first question, Kevin regarding prior period development. The only thing that is reflected in the numbers we presented today was the prior period development realized in Q1. No projections go forward consistent with our initial guide and legacy Aetna practices. A \u2013 Larry Merlo : And Kevin, it's Larry. In terms of the second question \u2013 Kevin, while we provided an update on the selling season as it stands today obviously there's still a lot of runway remaining for the 2020 selling season. And we'll continue to provide updates. So we still have a long way to go before we complete the season. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Peter Costa : Good morning. Question on the Health Care Benefits business and your maintained guidance on medical benefits ratio of 84%. Given the favorable prior period development, you'd think you'd be sort of on the lower end of that range at this point in time. Can you -- would you say that you're at the lower end of the range at this point? Or do you think really it's the full range that you're thinking about? And then will you not have the seasonal pattern that Aetna typically had which was a rising medical loss ratio through the year because of all the deal synergies? Eva Boratto : Hi, Peter. It's Eva. It's early in the year, so we provided the range and we'll stick with that range. Obviously as we progress throughout the year we'll provide additional updates. There was a lot of membership growth as Karen cited which we'll continue to monitor their utilization. In terms of the progression throughout the year, as we stated we moved SilverScript over to the Health Care Benefits segment which carries a different quarterly pattern than the traditional Aetna pattern where on the SilverScript it's highest in the first quarter and reduces as you go throughout the year given the risk corridor sharing. So that's a key driver of why you see maybe a little bit of a higher-than-expected Q1 MBR. A \u2013 Larry Merlo : I think we have time for two more questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Michael Cherny : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Larry, I want to go back to a comment you made earlier regarding your recent PBM user meeting and the conversations you were having with health plans and the engagement level. I guess as they think about what you're becoming as an integrated entity now that you own Aetna, what are they looking for you, the new CVS qualitatively to provide for them? And that engagement push is there a realization or understanding of what you're doing with the store base and with the HealthHUB initial push that can help them drive potential value going forward? A \u2013 Larry Merlo : Yes Mike. First of all we -- as part of that meeting, we did provide an update as to the work today to include the HealthHUBs. And I would say that there's a growing realization that if we describe this as consumerism in health care is here to stay. So the fact that we have these customer-facing assets is I think what is gaining a lot of interest and attention in terms of what that potentially can mean. And it reflects some of our earlier discussions, some of the points that Kevin made that as you think about -- if I just focused on the bricks-and-mortar retail store for a minute that we're beginning to see this evolution through the HealthHUBs of it's not just selling thousands of products. It's a combination of products and services that the dynamic in health care at some point, even though, we're seeing more and more health care in the palm of your hand and that's an important part of our strategy, at some point that consumer has to be touched. And we have the unique way to do that in a surround-sound way. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Hima Inguva from Bank of America. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Hima Inguva : Thank you. Congrats on a good quarter. Eva just wanted a little bit of clarification on the pace and cadence of delevering that you expect. Maybe if you could share the timing on when you see getting to the three times leverage target and then also any color on your recent conversations with the credit rating agencies would be great. Thank you. A \u2013 Eva Boratto : Yes. Thanks for the question, Hima. As we said consistently, our top priority is to deleveraging get to our low three times rating. We're pleased with our paying down the term loan early, $500 million we paid in Q1 and we expect to pay that full term loan down by the end of the year. And at this point, I -- we're not going to provide our longer-term leverage road map there. We'll provide that at Analyst Day. That said, as we continue to look for opportunities to generate cash to pay down this debt and we're working on initiatives on working -- improving working capital, a full review of our portfolio as well as the cost initiatives that Jon spoke about, we believe, in addition to driving growth in our business will enable us to continue to improve our leverage. Larry Merlo : So just wrapping up here, there were a lot of questions. We appreciate all the questions. We're trying to track to make sure we've answered everything, recognizing there were multiple pieces to questions. One of the things that I do want to clarify, I think Ricky had asked the question about the enterprise modernization, the cost reduction, were the numbers gross or net. And we want to be clear that those numbers that Eva provided were after any expenses incurred to execute that. So those were net improvement numbers. And listen obviously Joe and his team are available for follow-up. And we look forward to hopefully seeing all of you on June 4. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CVS Health Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Larry Merlo : Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before we get started, I'd like to introduce our new Senior VP of Investor Relations, Valerie Haertel, and Valerie brings more than two decades of investor relations experience in the healthcare and financial services sectors and we're excited to have her on board. So with that, let me pass the call to Valerie to get us started. Valerie Haertel : Thank you, Larry and good morning. I'm excited to join the CVS Health chain and look forward to working with all of you. I would like to welcome you to the conference call to discuss CVS Health's second quarter 2019 results and outlook for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. In addition to Larry, I'm joined this morning by Eva Boratto, Executive Vice President and CFO. Following our prepared remarks we'll host a question-and-answer session. I'm Joe Krocheski, Vice President of Investor Relations for CVS Health. I'm joined this morning by Larry Merlo, President and CEO; and  Following our prepared remarks, we'll host a question-and-answer session. Jon Roberts, Chief Operating Officer; Karen Lynch, President of Aetna; Derica Rice, President of Caremark; and Kevin Hourican, President of CVS Pharmacy will also be joining us for the question-and-answer session. In order to provide more people with a chance to ask their questions during the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up. In addition to this call and our press release, we have posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Our Form 10-Q will be filed later today and that too will be available on our website once filed. Please note, that during this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views related to our future financial performance, future events, and industry and market conditions, and forward-looking statements related to the integration of the Aetna acquisition including the expected consumer benefits, financial projections, and synergies. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what may be indicated in the forward-looking statements. We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these specific risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and the cautionary statement disclosures in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in this morning's earnings press release. Larry Merlo : Well, thanks Valerie, and welcome to our team. Well Q2 is a very strong quarter where we continue to execute against our objectives and build on our positive momentum, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.89 exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Now this performance was driven by strong operating results across the enterprise with Retail/Long-Term Care and Pharmacy Services performing above expectations. Importantly, these results reflect strong revenue and share gains across the enterprise. Given our results to date as well as our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $6.89 to $7 and Eva will provide a more in-depth review of our results and our updated guidance in her remarks. We are highly encouraged by our strong results through the first half of the year, demonstrating our continued focus on executing strategic priorities we outlined at our June Investor Day. We are transforming our company and the healthcare industry and accelerating enterprise growth as we move forward. Our first priority is to continue to grow and differentiate our businesses and nowhere is this differentiation more apparent than in our retail stores through the conversion of our HealthHUBs. At our June Investor Day we announced plans to convert 1500 locations to hubs by the end of 2021. As part of this plan we will be expanding to three more Metropolitan areas later this year and we'll add an additional 10 areas in the first half of 2020. Our expansion strategy is reinforced by the strong results we are seeing in our initial hub locations, including increased customer traffic and incremental sales in pharmacy front store and MinuteClinics. We've also received strong consumer feedback reflected in net promoter scores at the HealthHUBs outpacing our broader chain by about 900 basis points. So we're extremely excited with reception to our innovative offering that will allow us to engage with consumers in a differentiated manner in the communities where they live and importantly improve health outcomes. Eva Boratto : Thanks Larry, and good morning, everyone. As Larry said, Q2's performance exceeded our expectation with broad-based strength across the enterprise, and as such we're raising our outlook for the full year to reflect this outperformance. Adjusted earnings per share of a $1.89 was above the high end of our guidance range by $0.17. The quarter benefited by approximately $0.06 from nonrecurring items including realized investment portfolio gains and prior year's development. Health Care Benefits performed in line with expectations and Pharmacy Services are our PBMs and retail Long Term Care outperformed our expectations. The quarter also benefited from a lower effective tax rate due to timing and lower interest expense primarily due to the early repayment of the outstanding term loan. Consolidated adjusted revenue grew 35.8% in Q2 2019 also exceeding our expectations. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by the addition of Aetna as well as higher volume in both the PBM and retail Long Term Care segments. Health Care Benefits, which includes our SilverScript Medicare Part D business contributed $17.4 billion of revenue for the quarter. Adjusted consolidated operating income grew 55.1% primarily due to the addition of the Aetna business and growth in the PBM, partially offset by a decline in Retail/Long-Term Care. The Health Care Benefits segment contributed $1.4 billion to adjusted operating income. Now let me through the results of our segments. In our PBM revenue increased 4.2% with adjusted claim volume up 4% versus Q2 2018. The increased was driven by net new business and the continued adoption of our Maintenance Choice offering. PBM adjusted operating income increased 9.7% as operating margins expanded by about 20 basis points due to increased claims volume and favorable purchasing economics. Drug price inflation remains consistent with our expectations. Our Retail/Long-Term Care segment also performed better than expected with revenue up 3.7% driven by higher prescription volumes. We delivered strong adjusted script growth of 5.9% with cost scripts up 7.2%. This was driven by the continued adoption of our Patient Care programs, collaborations with other PBMs and our preferred status in a number of Medicare Part D network, as well as a prolonged allergy season. As the result of our strong script growth, our market share in Q2 increased 120 basis points to 26.5% versus Q2 of 2018. Additionally, front store comp sales increased 2.9% driven by continued growth in health and beauty, a longer cough and cold season, and an approximate 80 basis points benefit from the shift of Easter shopping season to Q2. Second quarter Retail/Long-Term Care adjusted operating income declined 8.3% year-over-year. This represents an improvement from our expectations due to increased pharmacy volume and front store performance. The drivers of the year-over-year decline are consistent with what we had discussed previously. And finally, Health Care Benefits continued to perform well. Revenue exceeded our expectations in the quarter driven by strong growth in Medicare products. As a reminder, year-over-year results for the Health Care Benefits segment are not comparable to either legacy CVS or legacy Aetna results due to a variety of factors including the acquisition of Aetna, inclusion of SilverScript in our 2019 Health Care Benefits results, and a temporary suspension of the health insurance fee in 2019. Our total health MBR was 84% for the quarter, a result that benefited from favorable prior period reserve development across all of our core products. Our MBR reflects overall moderate medical cost trends. However, we did experience modest pressure in a specific portion of our middle market commercial book. We have taken appropriate action to mitigate the impact. Despite this modest pressure we continue to expect our MBR for the full year to be within our initial guidance range with a bias towards the upper half. Our days claims payable was 48 days for Q2. Compared to Q1 days claims payable increased by three days due to the seasonality that is typical of our PDP business. We remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves and our reserving process. As I mentioned earlier, the Corporate segment benefited from $57 million of realized investment portfolio gains, which contributed to the outperformance in the quarter. Turning to cash flow and our use of capital, this quarter regenerated strong cash from operations of $5.3 billion due to improved working capital and earnings performance. We also returned more than $6 million to shareholders through dividends. We repaid $1 billion of long-term debt in May representing a portion of the term loan outstanding, and in July we repaid the balance of the term loan of $1.5 billion. Taking all of this into account, since the close of the transaction, we repaid approximately $6.6 billion of debt and we are focused on continuing to delever and remain on track with the plans we outlined at our Investor Day in June. With that, let me turn to an update of our guidance for the remainder of the year. As Larry said, we are raising and narrowing our 2019 guidance range to reflect the favorable performance. We now expect our consolidated full-year adjusted earnings per share to be $6.89 to $7. We now expect consolidated full-year 2019 revenue in the range of $251.4 billion to $254.2 billion and adjusted operating income between $15.2 billion and $15.4 billion. For the segments we expect full year 2019 adjusted operating income in the Pharmacy Services segment to be in the range of $5.06 billion to $5.12 billion, the Retail/Long-Term Care segment to be in the range of $6.68 billion to $6.76 billion and the Health Care Benefits segment to be in the range of $5.18 billion to $5.24 billion. The increase in guidance reflects the outperformance in the segments including the acceleration of synergies primarily benefiting Pharmacy Services. It also reflects the investment portfolio gains and prior period development within HCB in our Q2 results. Our full year 2019 GAAP EPS guidance is now in the range of $4.93 to $5.04. This reflects the improvements across our business partially offset by a loss of approximately $200 million on the sale of our Brazilian subsidiary Onofre. This loss primarily reflects the elimination of the cumulative foreign currency translation losses from shareholders equity. The transaction closed in the third quarter and is consistent with our strategy of optimizing our portfolio of assets. We are also raising our cash flow guidance and now expect to deliver strong cash from operations between $10.1 billion and $10.6 billion of which $4.5 billion to $4.9 billion will be available for debt paydown this year. Our strong cash projections include the improvement to our underlying business performance, as well as early benefits from our initiative to reduce pharmacy inventory in our retail stores by $1.5 billion. We continue to expect capital spending of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion. Our earnings progression for the year is expected to be consistent with the cadence discussed on our May earnings call. The first three quarters will have the highest year-over-year growth as we wrap the addition of Aetna, and we expect Health Care Benefits adjusted operating income to be the lowest in Q4 due to the cyclical nature of that business. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.79. In summary, we delivered a strong quarter of performance exceeding our expectations. We remain confident we will be able to achieve our financial and operating goals for the full-year and over the longer term. With that, we would like to open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you.  And our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Robert Jones : Great, thanks for the questions. I guess maybe just on synergies and the execution there, clearly, things seem to be going well with the expectation now for $400 million, Eva if I heard you correctly, versus the previous communication of $300 million to $350 million. It sounds like the $800 million is still intact for next year. So, I was wondering if maybe you could just share a little bit on where you're realizing synergies ahead of the previous expectation on a segment level. And then any sense you can give us on what those synergies might have contributed to the quarter would be helpful? Larry Merlo : Yes, Bob, it's Larry. I'll start, and then I think Eva will jump in terms of your second question. But to your point, we're really pleased with how the integration is going. The over delivery to our initial guidance is largely in two areas, one is the formulary optimization, and the second one is, we're just being able to transition functions a bit faster than we had modeled and probably the biggest example is the consolidation of our mail operations and pharmacy. Eva Boratto : And Bob, the only thing I would add is, you're exactly right, our $800 million for next year remains intact, $400 million for this year, with the largest benefit accruing to the PBM. I would say the other impacts are pretty consistent with what we had previously and it was a contributor to the PBM outperformance. Larry Merlo : And Bob, just going back to Analyst Day, recall we said $800 million in 2020 with a goal now of $900 million in 2021. Robert Jones : Got it. No, no, thanks for that clarification Larry, and then I guess just one quick follow-up on the Rx comp really strong in the quarter, better than we expected, probably better than we've seen for a few quarters. Could you maybe just talk about where you're seeing growth there? Is it really coming more from a share shift from the other large retail players or is this more maybe share gains from some of the smaller independent players out there, because I don't necessarily think there has been an increase in just overall script volume and yet, obviously you guys saw a nice pickup in the quarter. So, just any clarity there would be really helpful. Thanks. Kevin Hourican : Yes, hi Bob, this is Kevin. And I'll answer that question. So yes, we're really pleased with our top line script growth. We're growing at two times the market. The vast majority of our script growth is coming from our clinical programs, which are intended to increased medication adherence for the patients that we serve, so those are existing customers of ours. And if we can keep them more adherent on taking their medications to keep them healthier and it also drives our business. As Eva mentioned, we also have strong strategic partnerships with third-party payers, and we're seeing growth with the major payers being able to ship share to us based on our preferred relationships. Those are the two primary drivers. Robert Jones : Great, thanks so much. Larry Merlo : Thanks, Bob. Eva Boratto : Thanks, Bob. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. You talked about the PBM seeing benefit in the quarter from increased synergies, but even beyond that, it looks like a pretty dramatic improvement versus the trends you saw in the first quarter. So, you can walk us through the drivers of this improvement and talk about sustainability? Because it doesn't look like you're projecting similar year-over-year performance of the back half of the year within the updated guidance range? Eva Boratto : Yes. Thanks, Justin. It's Eva, I'll start and then Derica will jump in. As we look at the beat on the PBM, I would say it came from a couple of key areas. First, we had strong performance on overall script and continued growth in Mail Choice with Maintenance Choice being a contributor, as well as what we just spoke about, around the acceleration of synergies. We also had higher rebates earned in the quarter, and this is a function of our procurement activities with pharma that we do on an ongoing basis as well as improvements in formulary compliance, which helps us mitigate some of the liability issues that we spoke about earlier in the year. So overall, we're pleased with the performance here. Specialty continues to perform well, and I'll hand it over to Derica. Derica Rice : Hi, Justin, this is Derica. I think Eva captured it very well. The team has done a good job of driving formulary compliance with our clients and that's allowed us to improve our earned rebates and cover that rebate exposure. So we are tracking very well to mitigating the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year and we fully do expect that it will peak this year in terms of our rebate exposure and you should absolutely expect dissipation of that exposure, as we look forward to 2020 and 2021. Justin Lake : All right, thanks. And just a quick follow-up. Eva, you talked about modest pressure in the middle market commercial book, as you might imagine the managed care side of the world beats their interest when you start talking about pressure on the commercial side. Can you just give us some more color whether it was price or cost and as much detail as you can behind the drivers of that and what you're doing to mitigate it? Karen Lynch : Hey, Justin, it's Karen. I'll take that one. What I would say is, I think that it's a very specific portion at the low end of our middle market and we are seeing pressure in very specific regions. We are seeing a little bit of pressure in utilization across the medical cost categories. But what I would emphasize it is not across our entire commercial book, it is a very specific \u2013 it is in our 51 to 100 and it is in very select geographies. And what we're doing about it, we took very specific actions, we are intensifying our medical management in those geographies. Justin Lake : And Karen, can you tell us the magnitude? Is it 10 bps, the 25 bps or 200 bps? Eva Boratto : Yes, Justin. We're not going to call that out exactly, but I would say, as you look at our overall MBRs, what we're expecting overall, we're still well within our guidance range and the other areas are performing well. Larry Merlo : One of the things that I would point out to keep in the back of your mind, as we go forward that, we are building natural hedges in our business now, when you look at this business model. So to the extent that we see utilization trends and you can go beyond what Karen was talking about and just look at something like a flu season. It's easy to get your head around that. To the extent we have an extreme flu season, that is a headwind for our insurance business. It becomes a tailwind for our retail and PBM business. So we will have some elements of those natural hedges as we move forward. Justin Lake : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Thanks, good morning. Larry, you talked a little bit about the HealthHUBs and talked about the trends in traffic, Rx, MinuteClinics, front-end, et cetera. I know you're going to say it's probably pretty early on, but is there any way to put numbers around this. So, as we start to think about this story over the next several years and we start to think about 1,500 HealthHUBs, what this could look like for the Company? Larry Merlo : Yes. Lisa, it's a great question and Lisa, as we go forward, we want to -- we do want to get more stores under our belt to move from qualitative definition to more quantitative definition. We have talked about the fact that we are really pleased with the feedback that we're seeing from customers from a service performance point of view. Net promoter score is up 900 basis points over the chain average, and we are seeing additional traffic, and we're seeing that translate into sales momentum, additional sales in the front store in the pharmacy as well as MinuteClinics. Eva Boratto : And Lisa, if we were to just contextualize where the value is going to come from, I'd highlight three areas. As Larry said, first the store traffic, just the underlying dimensionally of our retail stores. Second, the value we can bring to Aetna and the Health Insurance business around medical cost savings. And third, opportunities in the PBM in our open-source model to deliver to deliver value there. Lisa Gill : Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up to that, you talked about 9,900 stores today, 1,500 ultimately having HealthHUBs in them. And any updated thoughts post the Analyst Day on what the right number of stores is, is it the 9,900 or do you think that it will be lesser number as we think about the next several years? Kevin Hourican : Hi Lisa, this is Kevin, I'll take that one. So we don't have a targeted store count. But what I'll do is I'll come back to our Investor Day presentation, where we talked about the fact that we continuously evaluate our real estate portfolio. A couple of key points I'd like to highlight on today's call. First is our portfolio of stores is robust and highly productive. We view it as a competitive strength. It's important to note that we've reduced the number of new store openings per year. So if you go back a few years ago that would have been 300 per year, this year 2019 we opened 100 new stores, so obviously a reduction. 2020, I would project that we will open approximately 50 new stores, so that does telegraph or reducing the number of new stores that we are opening. Our focus currently as Larry mentioned is on our HealthHUBs expansion. In order to increase the productivity of our retail stores through the new services and the traffic that we can drive to our stores through those services and to enable Karen and Derica's business to lower medical cost through being in that local community setting and providing improved care. Our new store openings will focus in the future on markets like the Pacific Northwest, where we're under-stored, in high-growth areas, like New York City in places like Texas, where we can definitely fill in. And lastly, we will continue to aggressively evaluate our store portfolio to ensure we're delivering the highest level of financial returns. Larry Merlo : And I think just -- maybe just a couple of other quick points. I think underlying Kevin's comments are, we have extreme flexibility in our portfolio. And with the number of leases that come up on an annual basis and we review the productivity of the entire fleet and have flexibility for probably on average about 500 locations every year. The other point also to keep in mind Lisa, your questions started with the HealthHUBs and we are continuing with our thought process around a hub-and-spoke model. So we are in the process of finalizing what that spoke, how that supports the hub concept in the fact that there will be more subtle changes in spokes across a geographic area. Lisa Gill : Very helpful. Thank you, Larry. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes, hi, good morning. Larry, in the prepared remarks you talked a little bit about the MA strategy for next year. Can you expand on that kind of like in how you talked a little bit about kind of a potential decline in SilverScript, which could benefit the dual business, if you can help quantify kind of like the potential opportunity there? Karen Lynch : Hi. Ricky. It's Karen. Let me comment on the Part D. What I would say is as a result of the combined Company and some of the successes that we both had relative to our Part D market, what we've done is, we've modified our product designed to better reposition our portfolio to support a broader consumer appeal, and then continuity for MA-PD conversions. And so, the report that what we're doing with the portfolio this year is, it's a multi-year strategy and we are ensuring that our consumers will have choices that will better meet their specific needs. And what we're really very happy about where our preliminary benchmarks came in as Larry said, we're at 30 what we call site 31 out of 4 regions. So we feel good about where we're positioned relative to Part D next year. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And follow-up on the selling season, obviously the, you've won some business since Analyst Day. Can you give us a little bit more detail on what parts of the market you're winning in and also where are we in the selling season, so how much of the book is left at this point? Derica Rice : Sure. Hi Ricky. This is Derica, I'll take that question. We're about 90% to 91% of our way through the selling season. So we are off to -- we're closing the end and we're actually beginning to get bids for 2021, if you can imagine. But in terms of the update since our Analyst Day discussion, as you heard from Eva earlier this morning, we were able to improve our gross new business by about $600 million, and we improved on a net basis, about 1.4 total. And that was driven by both, one we've been able to retain some business at a higher level than we thought, business that we initially lost, both in the collective and at the state level and then secondly, we've also seen further delay in the Centene migration and so that's helping us a bit as well in terms of contributing to that number. And operationally, we've continued to have very, very high service levels. So those gross new wins I highlighted earlier, the majority of those were taking place in the employer segment and on the government side. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open. Steve Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning everybody. So with the large EPS beat in 2Q relative to guidance by almost $0.20 and then 3Q '19 also coming in well above the Street by almost $0.15, it does seem that the full year 2019 EPS guide could have been raised by maybe even more than $0.10 to $0.14 that you're raising it by. And maybe it's just conservatism, but the question really is, just regarding the implied 4Q guidance, and you mentioned Aetna or the HCB segment having seasonally lower profits in 4Q versus the rest of the year. I'm just curious if there's anything else worth calling out regarding different seasonality for either the retail segment or the PBM for 4Q that's different this year or did the Street just mis-model at the back half of the year from your view? Thanks. Eva Boratto : Hi, Steve, it's Eva. Overall what I'll say is, we're really pleased with how we're executing in the results in the quarter and the raise to our guidance. I think, as you think about quarter-in, quarter-out some of the headwinds that we spoke about how generics can affect us the rebate guarantees, you can have some seasonality of that one quarter to another. You called out the lower profitability of that and then in the fourth quarter with their typical seasonality, you can get some lumpiness with the PDP between Q3 and Q4, that's always been something that depending on where you are on the curve there that that can change. So there are the key items I would call out and overall, we're pleased with our performance thus far relative to our expectations. Steve Valiquette : Okay. Larry Merlo : Steve, it's Larry. I'd just emphasize or underscore couple of Eva's points and remind everyone that we did move the SilverScript business out of the gate over to the Aetna business and we're really happy that that we made that move out of the gate, because I think it gives us the flexibility that Karen had alluded to earlier, and I'm confident that that will pay dividends next year. Keep in mind that when you look at the quarterly cadence of the PDP business, it doesn't follow the quarterly cadence of the Health Care Benefits business broadly, it's kind of backwards in terms of the roll to Q1-Q4 in play. So that -- we're doing our best to provide that level of transparency in terms of the moving parts from a comparison point of view, but certainly the IR team would be happy to follow up with you on that. Steve Valiquette : Okay. No, I appreciate the color and congrats on the results. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore. Your line is open. Ross Muken : Hi. Good morning, guys and congrats. In the beginning, Larry you highlighted a couple of kind of interesting new endeavors for the business that's sort of built off the Analyst Day. You talked about hemodialysis and some of what you're doing in oncology and then the hospital to home. I guess as you think about the number of these new programs that Alan and others are sort of working on across the business, what sort of the customer response in terms of the consumer, as well as sort of other plans? And then what other types of entities are now also coming to you, looking to sort of partner -- because obviously you have a very unique sort of footprint across sort of the healthcare landscape it now with sort of a lot of these new efforts and endeavors, it may attract kind of others to want to work more closely with you to bring their sort of technology, et cetera, to your member base. So just give us a feel for kind of how that's all developing and the inbounds that are coming into you? Larry Merlo : Yes, Ross. Thanks for the question, because it is a great question and it really does speak to the opportunities in front of us. From a customer point of view and I'll define the customer as the user now, okay? The feedback has been very good and quite frankly it's validating our beliefs and our strategy that there is a growing emergence of the retail health consumer, and it's also giving us the confidence to move forward as we outlined where we're going with the products and services, not just in pilot, but the broader rollout of things that we've discussed. The flip side of that is, there is also a growing interest from our health plan partners in terms of how we can partner. Eva alluded a bit to that in terms of the want to one of the potential value drivers, and certainly those inbounds are -- there are robust discussions with Derica and his team in terms of the opportunities there. And then, the third bucket of opportunity is just the inbounds coming from other potential partners in terms of how we can work together to be part of the solution that leads to additional innovation. So, Ross, I would say that is probably something that we underestimated in terms of the potential for those opportunities and what that could mean and we certainly got a team exploring those and we'll talk more about that as they come to fruition. Eva Boratto : And Ross, this is Eva, if I could just add one thing to Larry. We wrap it all up, it just speaks to the power of our ability to touch the consumer through our retail, through our retail footprint and bring all of this together and just the complementary nature of our business to others who are in the healthcare system. Ross Muken : And maybe just on retail, I mean I think a previous question sort of touched on front-end, but it feels like it's actually even excluding the Easter shift, sort of gotten a bit better or at least you're executing well there. I know, you also recently sort of rolled out kind of the CarePass subscription more nationwide. I guess, how are you feeling in general, just about sort of the comp trajectory there and some of the things that you're changing and shifting in terms of being able to sustain not just gross profits in that part of the business but actually continue to comp? Kevin Hourican : Yes. Hi, Ross, it's Kevin, and thanks for the question. And, we're really pleased with our front store business and the Easter shift did contribute positively. But that was the reason to be small percentage. The growth in our business is coming from our health and beauty strategies that are taking share from the market and growing share of wallet with the customers that we continue to serve. So it comes from a couple of key components. Our store remodels are increasing comp store sales in the locations where we remodeled, renewed focus on improving the customer experience within our stores, which is increasing NPS. And if you know, the retail equation, improving customer service does pay forward improved sales in the future and we're improving our ExtraCare program through targeted personalization which is increasing the reach and relevance of the offers to our customers and we're seeing dividend from those investments in technology that are fueling those capabilities. I'll just touch on the CarePass question that you asked at the end. Yes, we did announce earlier this week, the expansion of CarePass nationwide, I'll just say a couple of points on that. You know CarePass starts with the customer. Our customers increasingly are looking for time saving activities. They are time-starved and they're looking for increased value. We view CarePass is extending that convenience advantage of CBS by offering free delivery 24 access to a pharmacists in the 20% every day discount. We're seeing very positive results from the enrolled members that we have in our pilot markets. The $10 promotional reward in particular is what's increasing trips to our stores into our digital properties and that increased visit frequency is what's driving the return positive for CVS. So therefore, we are confident to roll it out nationwide and now it's a matter of how many members we can enroll and in what pace we can enroll them. Ross Muken : Great, thanks. Operator : The next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Just first your Medicare Advantage enrollment obviously this year has been a big bright spot for you. I wonder, now we got two quarters of claims under your belt. Do you have a call that out, so I'm assuming you're claims experience with those new labs has been about as expectations, and I know you're bids for 2020 and have already been submitted you guys some changing landscape there. I think the opportunity for expansions maybe is mitigated a little bit in the hip coming back. Any early commentary on how you think about the opportunity for 2020 in MA? Karen Lynch : Hi, AJ, it's Karen. So yes, we're very pleased with our Medicare growth. And I'll just remind you that as we grew substantial amount of members, both in our individual and group membership. Our growth in individual came from service area expansion that was about 25% of our growth and then the remainder came from the existing footprint. Our claims and our first year business, as you would expect is performing exactly where we thought it would be. So we feel good about the performance of the Medicare business, as it stands today. As you know, we're halfway through the year, so the claims are still maturing. But everything, all the metrics and everything looks in line with where we would have expected. Relative to our 2020 bid, we took a very balanced approach to 2020. Our go-to-market strategy included a broad portfolio of remaining at zero premium PPL and HMO plans, we feel good of our ability to further build plans. We also were able to offer new supplemental benefits and we are also able to leverage the enterprise MinuteClinics by offering zero co-pay or lower co-pays at MinuteClinics. And we also were able to use some or incorporate some of our new differentiated capabilities within CVS. So we will be offering the HealthHUBs in Houston. We are offering, as you might recall, Investor Day, I talked about the hospital-to-home benefit, we are offering that across the portfolio. We're now calling that Healing Better. We also are offering over-the-counter and durable medical equipment benefits through our retail store and then leveraging the pharmacists' through Pharmacy panels. So we are -- we'll look forward to telling you more about Medicare in the fall when more of the information is publicly available. A.J. Rice: Okay. If I could just quickly pivot, obviously the public press is talking a lot about the situation with China. You guys haven't talked much about that. I don't know whether the front end you source much from China, but I'd be interested. I know some in the Retail Pharmacy segment do, I'd be interested to know how you're dealing with it. If it's an issue at all for you, and maybe you source better than others, and maybe it even could be an opportunity for market share gains. Any comment on that? Larry Merlo : Yes, AJ it's Larry. I mean as you think about our overall portfolio, we do not have any sizable business that would go outside domestic. So the impact in terms of the current trade issues, we haven't seen materialize in our business. It's something that we continue to monitor as you think about our suppliers, but it's not something that is commanding a lot of our attention at this point. A.J. Rice: Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Your line is open. Lance Wilkes : Yes, good morning. Could you talk a little bit about performance in the Medicaid line? And in particular, are you seeing any sort of cost pressures in that how are claims progressing? And then what steps are underway to kind of work on the pipeline and conversion of that pipeline going forward? Karen Lynch : Lance, it's Karen again. So, I just want to remind everyone that we manage our Medicaid book of business through a diversified set of contracts, whose performance as you know vary state by state and program by program and we're currently in 16 states serving various programs. Right now, what I would say is our Medicaid MBR is performing in line with expectations and performed where we thought it would perform. As you would imagine, we are working through pulling various plants operate at different levels of performance and we feel that we've got the right actions across the board. So we feel good about relative to Medicaid. I would also comment Lance that I'd remind you that we have a new contract in Kansas that is performing where we thought it would be. We've had some operational challenges out of the gate, but we feel that we've got those covered through operational execution and remediation plans. Lance Wilkes : Great, and just related to your comment earlier on SilverScript to MA opportunities for conversion, could you talk a little bit about with your Aetna experience, what have you seen historically as far as conversion rates from PDP to an MA product and then what do you see as an outlook for that now that you've got the bigger and more sizable SilverScript pool there? Karen Lynch : Lance, we were having very good success in the conversions prior to the acquisition and we obviously had to put it on hold, on halt when we divested the business. So, I feel given that we have the largest PDP now and given some of the repositioning of the portfolio that we will be doing, I view this as a good opportunity, as I mentioned at our Investor Day for continued growth in our Medicare business and we'll be actively working on those conversions and our product positioning, the PDP will help assist that and we're very excited about the possibilities for growth there. Eva Boratto : And Lance, just to remind you Karen has shared at our Investor Day that Aetna as a standalone company between the years 2015 and 2019 was able to convert more than 82,000, and I think to the point Karen made, that was skewed to the earlier years in that range given the transactions going on and the focus of the business. Lance Wilkes : Great, thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Cherny : Good morning and thanks for all the color so far. I want to dive a little bit back into some of the cost trend comments. You kind of talked Karen about the very narrow book of business within middle market commercial, you gave some color on Medicare and Medicaid. I guess just more broadly across your business, to just get a little more clarity on some of the moving pieces, whether it's the elongated flu season in the camp and retail, just like how to think about what you've seen so far from overall broader perspective in some of the commercial markets or some other areas? Karen Lynch : Yes, what I would say is, generally medical cost trends are performing in line across the board, what I mentioned earlier, with the small end of the middle market, that's very specific in geographies. We're seeing -- we're not seeing significant inpatient, we're seeing more broadly cost trends and more in the specialty pharmacy area than most, but that's trending in line with prior years at the same level. So there is nothing in medical cost trends that are really out of performing and what we've seen in the past. So we feel like, like every year we are doing the things that we need to do relative to medical cost management, but nothing stands out in medical cost performance to really speak of other than those four markets that I talked about earlier. Eva Boratto : Yes, and Mike, I just want to reiterate, we are still comfortably within the range of the initial guidance we had provided albeit at the upper half at this juncture. Michael Cherny : That's definitely helpful. And then Eva, just a question for you, if we look at the new high-end of the guidance range, you're essentially at where you had thought about for the at least number for 2020. How should we think about the new guidance relative to the base level heading into 2020 beyond relative to the Analyst Day targets? Eva Boratto : Yes, thanks for that Mike. Overall, obviously we feel really good about the momentum of our business and our execution here as we've continue to progress through '19. And what I'd say at this point is, we remain confident in the low single-digit growth that we provided at our Investor Day. That said, I just want to go back to a couple of the comments that I made in my prepared remarks, to contextualize some of the nature of the beat as well as the range I'd remind you that about $0.06 of that was distinctly 2019 items, such as capital gains and prior years development, and there are things that I wouldn't think about is the run rate or annualizing, if you will. Michael Cherny : Perfect, Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Your line is open. Charles Rhyee : Yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about, if we think about the HealthHUBs strategy here and sort of we're basically trying to sort of redesign sort of the healthcare delivery experience for consumers here in this case. But that's the trend that we're seeing elsewhere and out there, and we have a number of private companies that have redesigned the primary care experience for employers and their members and their employees basically. And when we think about the CVS strategy here, is this something where we're going to have to invest more heavily in terms of the internal sort of infrastructure basically to make more higher end experience or do you think in the future as we think about different types of people who will be going to the HealthHUBs will be stratifying sort of population and types that will want to go to a CVS versus want to have a different experience? Trying to think about how we should think about the market sizing and the opportunity here. Larry Merlo : Yes. Charles, it's Larry. And I guess, a couple of points around that. First from a CapEx point of view in terms of the build out is, as we've said in the past, we're able to repurpose. I'll call it retail real estate capital that we've used in the past to the growth of the HealthHUB concept. So that is not of a concern in terms of an additional cost point of view. The second point embedded in your question is, if you think about the assets that we have assimilated, we're going to be able to create a more seamless experience than what may exist out in the marketplace, when you think about the role that a Health Care Benefits place from a plan design, and the role that the PBM plays, and then obviously that all comes together in the community. So, we think that will create an advantage for us against potential standalone competitors, and it goes back to the earlier point where I think that's where there is growing interest in terms of how we can work together in terms of the inbounds that are coming in from other potential partners. I think your third point is, look, as we think about the economics of that model beyond the build out obviously, we'll do that with the same financial discipline that we've done with anything else acknowledging that as Eva pointed out, you have three value drivers in there. You have the value of the HealthHUBs as a standalone business entity, you have the value that's created in terms of reducing medical costs that accrues to Health Care Benefits. And then the value that's created in an open platform, I'll call it reseller model where we can partner broadly with others. Charles Rhyee : That's helpful. And if I could just one follow-up. I'm not sure you touched on it, but obviously the Senate Finance Committee passed  their version of a bill with some proposed some significant changes in the Part D program. Just trying to get your thoughts on, how you view those changes? Do you think that that will create savings for seniors who are struggling with out-of-pocket costs? Thanks. And sort of the impact for you guys, as you think about the plan to - the program design change? Thanks. Larry Merlo : Yes, Charles. Look, there are a lot of proposals across both chambers of Congress, if you will, at this point. And first of all, we share the goals and objectives of reducing healthcare costs, reducing drug costs further, okay and reducing consumers out-of-pocket costs, and we certainly advocate for those that we believe will in fact enable that. To your point, there absolutely are tools that have been used in the private sector in the commercial business as well as Medicare Part D that can be applied more broadly in the market, and I would say that -- as it relates to drug pricing, it validates the role of the PBM and actually expands the tools that have been demonstrated to reduce drug costs. So I would say, on balance, we're encouraged by the proposals that we're seeing in terms of helping us do more not less. Charles Rhyee : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is open. Kevin Caliendo : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Are you -- do you have any expectations for Pharma or what are your expectations for pharmacy reimbursement in the second half of the year? Do you expect it to remain sort of stagnant or flat, are you expecting any changes to that? Eva Boratto : Hi, Kevin, this is Eva. I would say, we expect no changes from what we've communicated previously and as we've been trending through the year. Kevin Caliendo : There's a question earlier about flu and I was thinking about this. In terms of, if we were to have a very severe flu season, when we think about the entire enterprise of CVS, would it be a positive or a negative given maybe the increased costs, but at the same time potentially increased sales through the pharmacy PBM, whatever? But how would you, when you think about that, how would you think about it in terms of the enterprise? Larry Merlo : Kevin, I think it becomes - there becomes degrees of relativity in that question. And I would say, that it could end up falling both ways depending on where you put that on the relative scale. My point earlier is perhaps different than standalone competitors. We've got a natural hedge in our enterprise recognizing that we could have a headwind in one area and it's a tailwind in another area, and that provides a point of differentiation. Eva Boratto : Yes the other way to think about it too is it would depend on hospitalizations, because if they are significant hospitalizations then it would tend to be higher medical costs which would outweigh the pharmacy script. But I think if it wasn't hospitalizations it might be, it could be potential like Larry said net neutral. Kevin Caliendo : Great. Well, thank you so much, guys. Larry Merlo : All right, thanks. We'll take two more questions, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Market. Your line is open. Matthew Borsch : Yes, thank you. I was hoping you could look -- I realize it's which too early for guidance for 2020, but when we think directionally about script volumes and the strike that you've been able to generate over at least the last couple of years, do you think you can continue that in 2020? I mean, you tapped a number of wells in particular getting on more networks and yield of the a lot from that and also medication adherence, do you have further to go that you think you can continue at this sort of rate? Eva Boratto : Matt, this is Eva. I'll start, I'll go back to the comments that that we made at our Investor Day, and we do continue to see script growth as the key driver of our expected performance. And with our clinical services, we've been gaining market share with our rollout of the HealthHUBs  We continue to expect to see that as an overall tailwind. Kevin Hourican : Now, this is Kevin. I just have one piece of color, just the adherence opportunity is still very large for us and for the industry. Reports are that up to half of the people who begin maintenance medication will not actually beyond that medication a year later, due to a host of reasons, carefulness cost for some, and we're doing a lot to help save money for our customers to address the cost barrier and helping them with the forgetfulness piece through programs like home delivery and our script path program. So we see continued strength in here. Matthew Borsch : And if I could ask one sub-question, I think your largest competitor is closing 200 stores in the U.S., do you know those locations, is that something that you could benefit from in any material way? Larry Merlo : Yes. Matt, we saw the announcement this morning and we saw as part of that announcement the locations, were not disclosed. Matthew Borsch : Okay, thank you. Operator : And our final question today comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Your line is open. Ralph Giacobbe : Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, the enrollment numbers specifically on kind of the commercial risk market have been, are under pressure for a little while. As we head into, and maybe get more clarity on sort of the selling season on the medical side for 2020, could you just give us any color on whether or not you expect that trend to sort of stabilize or maybe improve? And then how much of the value prop of the combined entity is sort of resonating or if it's just too early to tell at this point? Eva Boratto : So I'll talk to the 2020 selling season. In the national accounts space, it's been a long season this year. We sell interestingly enough have, we're in active discussions with some very large customers on new business. We still have some large renewals. So it's really hard to predict what national accounts will look like for 2020 at this point. I would say the same thing about our Group Medicare business, our pipeline is still active, it's a very late season. We have had some wins in our Group Medicare business and we also were able to successfully retain one of our largest, out to bid retiree medical account, and we were able to do a full replacement there, so we feel good about that. And we don't anticipate any significant terminations in our Group Medicare business. So that's what I'd comment on the 2020 season right now. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay, thanks. And just one more quick one, could you give us just more of a sense of how the Long-Term Care business performed in the quarter and any detail on sort of underlying earnings power I guess in that business at this point? And just how you're thinking about that segment relative to the Board strategy? Thanks. Jonathan Roberts : Yes. So this is Jon, I'll take that question. So we continue to make progress with Omnicare. As Eva said, we are ahead of plan. Our service is improving. That was a big opportunity and our clients see it and are pleased with our progress. As we're out competing for new business in the marketplace, I would say we are winning more than we have historically won over the last few years. And our retention of our existing business is improving, and that's primarily due to our improved service, but it's not where we want it to be and we're continuing to work on that. And we're also finally making good progress on managing our costs. So we have more work to do. We continue to see opportunity to grow in independent and assisted living and our differentiated offerings in that space are helping us win in that part of the market. Larry Merlo : Okay, so thanks Jon and look, just as a recap, we're at the midpoint of 2019 and first, we're very pleased with the strong financial results we've delivered in the first half of the year. They are demonstrating our ability to successfully execute on the priorities that we established in response to industry headwinds. Second, it is still very early in our transformational journey, but I think you can see we're working quickly in the development of new products and services that will transform the consumer health experience and you're seeing tangible signs of those efforts. We've talked about that this morning. It's summarized in our slides. And finally, all of this provides and gives us the confidence that we will be able to realize the potential of our innovative and powerful new business model delivering enhanced value to our clients, the consumers we serve and certainly our shareholders, and we'll look forward to talking more about that in the quarters to come. So with that, thanks again for joining us today and have a great rest of the summer. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Valerie Haertel : Thank you. And good morning everyone. Welcome to the CVS Health third quarter 2019 earnings call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I am Valerie Haertel, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for CVS Health. I am joined this morning by Larry Merlo, President and CEO; Eva Boratto, Executive Vice President and CFO. Following our prepared remarks, we'll host a question-and-answer session when Jon Roberts, Chief Operating Officer; Karen Lynch, President of Aetna; Derica Rice, President of Caremark; and Kevin Hourican, President of CVS Pharmacy will also join us. In order to provide more people with the chance to ask their questions during the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up. In addition to this call and our press release consistent with our practice, we have posted a slide presentation on our website. Our Form 10-Q was filed this morning and is available. Please note during this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views related to our future financial performance, future events, and industry and market conditions, and forward-looking statements related to the integration of the Aetna acquisition including the expected consumer benefits, financial projections, and synergies. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what may be indicated in the forward-looking statements. We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties in particular those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and the cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements disclosures in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings press release. During this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance and financial condition. In accordance with SEC regulations you can find a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and the comparable GAAP measures in the earnings press release and the reconciliation document posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today\u2019s call is being broadcast on our website where it will be archived for one year following the call. Larry Merlo : Well. Thanks, Valerie. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. In the third quarter, we continued building on our positive business momentum delivering adjusted earnings per share of $1.84, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Importantly, this performance was driven by strong operational execution across our enterprise with all three segments performing in line with or above our expectations. And I'll note that $0.04 of our Q3 performance was the result of net realized capital gains and favorable prior year\u2019s development. We generated strong cash flow from operations which enabled us to continue to make progress on deleveraging, all while investing in our core businesses and returning capital to our shareholders through dividends. Given our year-to-date success in executing against our strategic plan, we are raising and narrowing our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $6.97 to $7.05. And Eva will provide a more in-depth review of our results and increased guidance in her remarks. Now, as we continue to transform CBS into the country\u2019s leading consumer health company, we are successfully executing on our long-term growth strategy across the four-key enterprise-wide priorities we shared at our June Investor Day. Importantly, our teams are working together across the enterprise to maximize value to our members, consumers, patients, and shareholders, and our operational and financial performance this year reflects their efforts. We continue to use our unmatched combination of assets by enhancing and creating products and services to further grow and differentiate our businesses, our first strategic priority. In our Retail, Long-Term Care segment, we continued to drive strong prescription growth using our data and analytics capabilities through targeted proactive member communication. A key differentiator of our retail stores is our ability to meet members and consumers where they are to deliver local personalized care through our MinuteClinics and now our HealthHUBs making healthcare more accessible and affordable. And our approach is clearly resonating in the marketplace and is exemplified both by our continued share gains at retail and the early success of the HealthHUBs. Now in terms of early impact, our HealthHUBs in Houston, which now have about eight months of performance have continued to outperform their control group with higher script volume and Minuteclinic visits along with higher front store sales, traffic, and store margin. Eva Boratto : Thanks, Larry. And good morning, everyone. As Larry said, strong performance across the enterprise drove our third quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.84 was above the high end of our guidance, including $0.04 attributable to non-recurring items, generated by net realized capital gains in prior years development. Health Care Benefits exceeded our expectations while Pharmacy Services and Retail/Long-Term Care were in line. The quarter also benefited from lower interest expense. Consolidated adjusted revenues grew 37.1% in Q3 of 2019, also exceeding our expectations. This year-over-year increase was largely driven by the addition of Aetna as well as higher volume in both the PBM and Retail/Long-Term Care segment. The Health Care Benefits segment, which includes our SilverScript PDP business contributed $17.2 billion of revenues for the quarter. Adjusted consolidated operating income grew 48.9% compared to last year, primarily due to the addition of the Aetna business. Health Care Benefits contributed $1.4 billion and we experienced growth in the PBM, which was partially offset by a decline in Retail/Long-Term Care. Looking at our results by segment and starting with Pharmacy Services. Total revenues increased 6.4% with adjusted claims volume up 9.3% year-over-year. Drivers included net new business, particularly in specialty related to the IngenioRx onboarding and the continued adoption of our Maintenance Choice offerings. PBM adjusted operating income increased 5.7% versus Q3 of 2018, due to increased claims volume the shift of Aetna Mail order and specialty operations into our Pharmacy Services segment and improved purchasing economics. We continue to mitigate our rebate guarantee exposure through formulary compliance and have experienced a larger-than-expected benefit from generic launches primarily in specialty. These improvements are partially offset by continued price compression. Brand drug inflation remains consistent with our previous expectations. Moving to Retail, Long-Term Care, the segment performed in line with our expectations with total revenues up 2.9%, driven by higher prescription volume. We delivered strong adjusted script growth of 6.4% with comp scripts up 7.8%, primarily driven by the continued adoption of our patient care programs. Our share of retail scripts increased approximately 110 basis points to 26.6% in Q3 versus the same period last year. Additionally, front store comp sales increased 60 basis points, driven primarily by continued growth in health and beauty sales including cough and cold. Retail/Long-Term Care third quarter adjusted operating income declined 6.5% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued reimbursement pressure, partially offsetting the decline with continued script growth and front-store margin improvement as well as the benefit of generics, where we have seen some improvement. As part of our ongoing review of our asset portfolio and focus on driving greater returns, in the quarter we made the decision to close approximately 75 retail pharmacy stores during 2020, the majority of which are nearing the end of their lease term. This resulted in a $96 million GAAP charge in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment. We believe these decisions will generate enhanced longer-term performance. Our real estate footprint remains very productive and we will continue to look for opportunities to further improve the performance in our portfolio. Lastly, our Health Care Benefits segment delivered better-than-expected results for the quarter due to prior year's development and net realized capital gains. Total revenues of $17.2 billion continued to benefit from strong growth in government business. Total health MBR of 83.3% benefited from favorable prior period development across all our core products. Last quarter, we highlighted modest pressure in a specific portion of the lower end of our middle market commercial book. During this quarter, we saw modest improvement in this business and we continue to expect our MBR for the full year to be above the midpoint of our guidance range of 84% plus or minus 50 basis points. Our days claims payable was 51 days for Q3, compared to Q2, days claims payable increased by three days due to the seasonality that is typical of our PDP business. We remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves and our ongoing reserving process. Within our Corporate segment, we realized $32 million of net realized capital gains in the quarter. Corporate segment expenses increased sequentially and year-over-year primarily due to investments in our transformation and modernization programs. Moving to capital management. During the third quarter, we continued to make progress on our deleveraging efforts which resulted in a net debt reduction of approximately $2.9 billion. In addition to paying off over $1.5 billion term loan $850 million of scheduled maturities, we completed a $4 billion tender offer for our outstanding senior debt and issued $3.5 billion of senior debt at favorable rates during the quarter. We have now repaid approximately $8 billion of net debt since the close of the Aetna transaction. And we remain focused on deleveraging and achieving our leverage target of below three times in 2022. Turning to cash flows and dividends. This quarter, we generated strong cash from operations of $2.9 billion from improved working capital and earnings performance. We also returned more than $600 million to shareholders through dividends. With that let me turn to our revised guidance for 2019. As Larry mentioned in light of our third quarter performance, we are narrowing and raising our consolidated full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $6.97 to $7.05 million compared to prior guidance of $6.89 to $7. Our full year guidance reflects an aggregate of approximately $0.20 of prior year's development and net realized capital gains that we have recorded in the first nine months of this year. We are also raising our consolidated full year total revenues expectations to $251.6 billion to $254.2 billion and raising and narrowing our adjusted operating income expectations to $15.22 billion to $15.40 billion. Additionally, we're on track to deliver at least $400 million of integration synergies this year. Now a few highlights on our segment. There is additional detail in the slide presentation we posted on our website. We are increasing our expectations for the Pharmacy Services segment with adjusted operating income now in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.16 billion reflecting the momentum in the business. We're maintaining our full year adjusted operating income range for the Health Care Benefits segment of $5.18 billion to $5.24 billion reflecting year-to-date performance including favorable prior year's development and net realized capital gains as well as our latest projection of investments required to onboard 2020 new business. We are narrowing our full year adjusted operating income range for our Retail/Long-Term Care segment to $6.68 billion to $6.74 billion. And we are lowering our interest expense estimates to our strong cash flow and impact from the net pay down of debt. Our updated full year 2019 GAAP EPS guidance range is $4.90 to $4.98, reflecting our year-to-date performance the negative impact of store closures and the loss on the early extinguishment of debt. We're maintaining our full year 2019 cash flow guidance expecting to deliver strong cash from operations between $10.1 billion and $10.6 billion and have increased our projected cash available to pay down debt to $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion of which $4.7 billion has been used to pay down debt year-to-date. Our cash flow projections include the improvements to our underlying business performance as well as early benefit from our initiative to reduce pharmacy inventory in our retail stores by $1.5 billion in 2022. We continue to expect 2019 net capital expenditures of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion. In terms of the fourth quarter, there are a few things to keep in mind. For Health Care Benefits, the last quarter of the year is typically lowest adjusted operating income quarter due to the seasonality of the business including spending to support January 1 readiness for our Medicare business. Fourth quarter will also include higher sequential spending for our transformation programs. Finally, given the timing of the close of the Aetna transaction, prior year fourth quarter does not include the full impact of share dilution and interest expense resulting from the transaction. These differences affect the year-over-year adjusted EPS comparability. As we look ahead to 2020, we feel very good about the momentum in our business and we are even more confident in generating at least $7 of adjusted earnings per share with low single-digit growth off our 2019 baseline, which excludes the non-recurring items of approximately $0.20 I mentioned earlier. These items will not be included in our 2020 guidance consistent with the legacy Aetna practice. As we have stated previously, we will provide full 2020 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. In summary, we continue to execute against our plan and we are confident that we will be able to achieve our financial and operating goal for the full year and over the longer-term. We remain focused on strengthening our business to deliver sustainable long-term growth and create value for all stakeholders through our transformation into the most consumer-centric health company. With that, I would like to open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Your first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa, your line is open. Lisa Gill : Great. Good morning, everyone. Larry, I want to start with your comments around the HealthHUBs. You talked about the outperformance versus the control group. I really have three questions here. One, any numbers that you can share around that? Two, as we think about the impact of rolling out another 50 this year and as we get into 2020 will it have any impact on your 2020 numbers? And then thirdly, as we think about additional services that will go into the HealthHUBs, have you thought more about primary care versus episodic care. And as you think about that integrated model with the medical side, are you learning anything from those Aetna members of incremental services that you think you need to bring to the HealthHUB? Larry Merlo : Yes, Lisa. Good morning. And I'll start and then I'll flip it over to Kevin. Yeah, Lisa in terms of the numbers themselves as you know we have been qualitative in our definition of performance, and we've done that, it's a very small subset of stores at this point. But as you've heard us say countless times, it absolutely has given us the confidence in the belief in our strategy and the need for a rapid rollout. So, as we get more of a critical mass of stores, you will see us move from qualitative definition to more quantitative definition. And you can think about that sometime in the \u2013 probably in the second quarter timeframe, in the spring time frame, where we think we'll have enough of a critical mass and multiple geographies across the country. And Lisa, in terms of 2020 impact, as we've talked, the rollout will go through 2020 as well as 2021. And you really have two dynamics in play here. You've got gaining that critical mass of HealthHUBs as well as the opportunities for client adoption. So, I do believe that that will take some time. I wouldn't expect that we will see a material impact in 2020. I think it's more 2021 that we'll see that happening. But again, we're extremely excited in terms of what we have seen and what we've learned in Houston, and I'll flip it over to Kevin to pick-up on that third question. Kevin Hourican : Thanks, Larry. Good morning, Lisa. Thanks for the question. I'll just build on the second part of your question which was the services provided. The new wellness product that we've added to the front store continues to do well, including the products that we're selling in the sleep apnea space helping fill white space in an unmet consumer demand. We're bullish on the MinuteClinic expanded services getting into chronic disease management in a more coordinated way. We believe it's in collaboration with primary care to answer your question in replacement of primary care. In the pharmacy space, we're excited about what our pharmacists are doing in partnership with data coming to us from the Aetna business unit on which patients need our greatest help on a longitudinal way. So it's not one phone call and one specific day. It's over a course of time working with those patients to help introduce them to care coordination services that are available through Aetna and also working with the PBM sales team on what the members of our Caremark business units are looking for. And just an important point to note as it relates to your provider question, 80% of the services that can be provided by a primary care physician can in fact be provided by our nurse practitioners in our pharmacies \u2013 excuse me, in our MinuteClinics. And again, we view it as complementary to primary care. Lisa Gill : Okay. And then just as a follow-up, you brought up Caremark, are you seeing either Jon or Karen, are you seeing anything as far as the selling season having an impact. I know Larry, it's still a small market. But as we think about the number of MinuteClinics you have today, the services that you're providing, any impact at all in the 2020 selling season around having these offerings or again is that more of 2021? And I'll stop there. Thanks. Karen Lynch : Hi, Lisa. It's, Karen. Yes, we\u2019ve been \u2013 a couple of things on this topic. We've been talking to our clients throughout the 2020 selling season about how we can deliver that more personal, integrated, cost-effective, and holistic care approach -- response from our customers has been very positive to date. And I think we're seeing a fair amount of activity and pipeline build for 2021. And as we talked about previously, our focus for 2020 was to go to market with a more integrated medical pharmacy offering, and what we've done for the 2020 selling season, I'm very pleased to tell you that we are seeing increased traction in overall pharmacy penetration for our employer sponsor business, particularly where Aetna had the medical business and we're now winning significantly greater percentage of pharmacy business. So there's a lot going on and we're \u2013 I can talk later relative to the \u2013 some of the pilots that we have but I'll let Jon cover where we're headed. Derica Rice : Lisa this is Derica. In regards to you on the Caremark side, we've had the opportunity to introduce the HealthHUBs to a number of our clients both on the health plan side as well as on the employer side, and we've had a great deal of excitement and interest, and it's clearly playing out not only in our 2020 selling season, we look to wrap that up, but also to 2021. And I know there was always \u2013 with the announcement of the deal between CVS and Aetna, there was some concern amongst investors about potential for channel conflict. We \u2013 with the interest that we have from some of the health plan clients, we've actually now listed two that are actually performing some pilots with us that was related to the HealthHUB itself. So that gives you some idea to the type of traction we're getting in that space. Jonathan Roberts : And Lisa this is Jon. If you remember back when Caremark rolled out Maintenance Choice and the excitement in the market and the momentum that gave us, we're seeing a similar reaction in the market to HealthHUBs from the clients. Lisa Gill : Thank you very much. Jonathan Roberts : Thanks, Lisa. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Lance your line is open. Lance Wilkes : Yes. My question is on the PBM and it looks like a strong performance. I was wondering in 2019 how much cross-sale you're seeing in the Aetna book of business for this year as contrasted with maybe some sort of metric related to how much progress you're going to see for the beginning of 2020, given the selling season that Karen just mentioned. And then what do you see as sort of the upside possibility with that? And I guess related to the PBM also is for those additional wins you got over the last quarter, what segments are those in? Is that a health plan or employer business/ Karen Lynch : Lance it's Karen. Let me just talk about where I see the opportunities on PBM. As I mentioned, we're having a good 2020 selling season. And what we're measuring is really penetration of the book. So we're looking at a number of ways. We're looking at where we have medical and we want to drive pharmacy integration. We're looking at the \u2013 Derica and I are jointly looking at the pharmacy book and looking at where we want to potentially sell medical opportunities. And then we're looking together holistically to say, 'Hey where are the opportunities that neither one of us have business? And that's where I think we're starting to see that growing pipeline in 2021 and bringing all the capabilities of the company together. And we've just recently had a lot of customer interactions, we've been out in the market with our brokers talking about this integrated story, and we are seeing very positive response. Kevin Hourican : And Lance just to build upon Karen's comments. In regards to the impact on the PBM, you've seen here off the late that we -- at least since the Q2 call that we've improved our net wins by $1 billion. The vast majority of that came in the employer segment and call it the kind of the middle market and that plays very well with the integration efforts that Karen laid out also. And then as you can think about what I talked about earlier about being able to introduce the HealthHUBs and some of the broad array of services to that client group, that's -- they've been very receptive to that and absolutely is playing into the outlook and the expectations we're establishing in the marketplace. Lance Wilkes : Great. And just a quick follow-up. Karen, previously, you'd talked standalone Aetna about efforts in the kind of down-market employer segment to do more cross-selling, more bundled sales and kind of go after that self-insured market more. I'm just wondering what was the status of progress on that for you guys looking at 2020. Karen Lynch : Yes. It's obviously early for 2020 for that end of the market. Now, we've been very focused on national account higher end of middle. So, it's a bit early, but we have the teams out talking about our new capabilities relative to the HealthHUBs which people are excited about. We've introduced our NovoLogix capabilities that people are introduced about. And then we're -- people are excited about our new digital capabilities. So, we are pushing our integrated message throughout all of our segments and we are seeing some good interest, but it's really too early to tell you about 2020 at this point. Lance Wilkes : Okay. Thanks. Larry Merlo : Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles, your line is open. Charles Rhyee : Yes. Hey thanks for taking the question. When I look at the full year guidance for the rest of this year, you kind of talked about year-to-date product development and net realized capital gains of $0.20. When we're thinking about next year and 2020 and sort of like when you initially kind of had said better than $7 a share, should we be looking at this number including the capital -- this kind of number assuming that we probably have similar types next year or should we be thinking about it without? Eva Boratto : Yes, Charles, this is Eva. Thanks for the question. I think, as I outlined in my prepared remarks, right, where we're sitting today versus where we sat back in June, we're even more confident with our low single-digit growth. We provided the transparency and the color around the $0.20. As we've said consistently, we don't guide to that. So, think about that growth off -- after you remove that from your baseline. Charles Rhyee : Okay. And is there any kind of -- as we think about the fourth quarter, is there -- I think, typically, prior period development is really more of a second and third quarter kind of impact typically. Is that -- would you expect more than anything in the fourth quarter? Eva Boratto : Typically, Charles, as you think about the fourth quarter, there's de minimis prior year development if you look at historical patterns. We'll continue to provide the transparency on this and the realized capital gains as we go forward. Charles Rhyee : Okay, that's helpful. If I could just sneak one other on the HealthHUB, going back to Lisa's question. You talked about 50 stores by year-end. 1,500 stores by 2021. Is there a good interim target as we think about 2020 number of stores? Larry Merlo : Yeah. Hey, Charles, it's Larry. You can think about that, we'll probably be in the zip code next year of 600 to 650 stores by year-end. Charles Rhyee : Okay. Awesome. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky, your line is open. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you and good morning. So firstly, just to clarify on the EPS guidance question. So Eva, if we think about the new 2019 base of $6.97 to $7.05, and we excluded $0.20, and we grow it by low single-digit, we get to a range of $6.84 to $7.12. I know that you answered before above $7. So should we think about would you say that you're comfortable with kind of like that high low single-digit range? Eva Boratto : Yeah, Ricky, as we said, we'll provide our more fulsome guidance in February, but we've reiterated we're comfortable with at least $7 and the low single-digit growth, and we'll have more to provide\u2026 Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. That's helpful. And then my question is focused on specialty. And Karen, maybe this one is for you. When we think about the opportunity in specialty, what's the specialty penetration within the Aetna book of business? And how do you think that kind of like growing over time? Larry Merlo : Ricky let me just ask a point of clarification. When you're talking specialty, are you talking about specialty pharmacy or just the specialty businesses within Aetna that includes pharmacy and others? Ricky Goldwasser : Specialty pharmacy. Larry Merlo : So Ricky, as you know that's one of the highest-trending medical cost categories that we have. And we've been working very closely with Derica's team on managing those specialty drugs and that specialty costs. And we are introducing some new capabilities into the market relative to 2020. It's a critically important concern for our customers, particularly with the new drugs that are coming out that have very high cost. So we are looking at innovative capabilities around stop-loss potentially. And again, we've introduced our NovoLogix capabilities across our portfolio, which I think will bring those costs -- we're hoping to bring those costs down and in line. So we're really excited. And as we've been talking to our customers they're excited about the possibilities there as well. Karen Lynch : And Ricky just to emphasize the point that Karen was alluding to we would sit here today and say that there is a large portion of specialty that flows through the medical benefit that has been largely unmanaged and that becomes a big opportunity here. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah. And that's really where the question was what's the incremental opportunity, where you're currently not managing. And then if I may just one follow-up, because you talked about long-term care in Omnicare. How do you think about the progression of Omnicare first half versus second half? And how is it performing against your targets and kind of like that opportunity to have Omnicare being a positive -- contributing positively to next year. Jonathan Roberts : Yeah, Ricky, this is Jon. So long-term care is performing slightly better than expected in 2019 and we've started to see improvement in our new sales and retention given our service improvements. And at the same time we also continue to improve our cost structure. I will say this market continues to be challenging as our clients have continued to divest facilities in 2019. And we'll have more to say about it on our fourth quarter call. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Michael, your line is open. Michael Cherny : Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I want to dive a little bit into the retail TC segment particularly profit growth in particular. You pointed to a lot of the moving pieces in the quarter and where things shook out on the positive versus negative side. Also, I know at the Investor Day you did talk about that segment being up at least some preliminary expectations low single-digit on EBIT. I guess, based on what you've seen so far year-to-date, having just obviously addressed the long-term care question, how was everything tracking relative to the moving pieces within retail that will allow you to drive towards EBIT growth of that low single-digit rate into next year? Eva Boratto : Hi, Michael. This is Eva. I'll start and perhaps Kevin will jump-in. As we look at Q3, Q3 performed right in line with our expectations. Q2 performed above our expectations. So we're pleased with how the business is performing and the initiatives which are underway to enable us to return to growth in the segment. Kevin Hourican : I'll just build on that. Your second part was our confidence and not being able to hit the guidance that we provided back on Investor Day for 2020. As Eva just said, we're on track to be able to deliver against that guidance. In fact, we're more confident now than we were then. The key tenants of that strategy to enable that growth we'll grow our pharmacy business faster than the industry and continue to take market share and grow organically, which we've been doing this year and that will continue. We will continue to grow both the top line and bottom line within our pharmacy \u2013 excuse me, front store business, specific focus on health and beauty. The biggest year-over-year difference is a meaningful cost takeout through the modernization efforts that Jon Roberts covered back in June. Those efforts are on track. We will take a significant amount of cost out of both our pharmacy and front store businesses. Those three things working in concert will enable that low single-digit growth that we guided back in June. Michael Cherny : Great. And then just one quick point of clarification to make sure we got this based on keeping the guide for the MBR it seems like there's a pretty implied high number for 4Q. Aside from seasonality, is there anything else that we should think about in there that drives that number higher than where it's been trending over the course of the year? Eva Boratto : No, there's \u2013 Michael this is Eva again. There's nothing that we would call out. Michael Cherny : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George, your line is open. George Hill : Yeah. Good morning, team CVS. And I kind of want to dovetail right off of Mike's question which is, I guess are you able to quantify maybe the cost takeout that you're looking for in retail pharmacy next year? And I guess just given \u2013 looking at the pharmacy results for this year. And I don't think there's any reason to think the reimbursement next year is going to meaningfully improve. I'm also just trying to bridge the gap between kind of putting the retail pharmacy results this year and how we get that low single-digit EBIT growth in the segment next year. So quantification on the cost takeouts and maybe the outlook for reimbursement or the year-over-year change in reimbursement and how it impacts results would be helpful. Thank you. Larry Merlo : Yeah. George, it's Larry. Good morning. Maybe just a couple of things to be reminded of as we went through the first half of this year, keep in mind we have the additional investments that we made back in 2018 that cycled through the first half. Largely, the investments in tax reform as it rolled back into our retail business for our colleagues. And then George, I would take us back to the Analyst Day in terms of -- we provided the headwinds, tailwinds as we looked at next year. And there's nothing different that we see today from what we had talked about back in June. And as you pointed out, we don't see reimbursement pressure abating, but the offsets to that reimbursement pressure have some dynamics in 2020 that we did not face in 2019. When you look at the contribution of generics as one example. George Hill : Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-up for Eva. On the PPD in the quarter was that -- and you kind of related that it was -- was it -- I guess was the positive PPD in the quarter was it in response to the cost pressure that you saw in Q2? Or is it separate from the cost pressure you saw in Q2? Eva Boratto : No. I would say, overall we had about $0.04 of PYD prior year development as well as net realized capital gains in totality. And the development that we saw was across all of our four core businesses. George Hill : Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Ann, your line is open. Ann Hynes : Hi, good morning. Just going to the PBM, I know there was a lot of discussion earlier this year about the future of rebates and has become more quiet since the White House -- the rebate rule. But so could we assume when it comes to rebates, it's business as usual going forward. That would be my first question. And my second question is with the federal employees contract, it looks like you extended another year. Do you ever anticipate that going to full RFP. I guess what was the decision behind them, I guess keep on renewing it. So how do you view that contract going forward? Thanks. Larry Merlo : Ann, good morning. I'll take your first question and flip it over to Derica. Ann your first question on rebates, look if you go back what the last year, 1.5 years the debate was roll the PBMs what happens to the rebate dollars. And as we sit here today I think the debate has now shifted not on the PBMs, but to the manufacturers in terms of why are the list prices what they are and the data has proven the value that PBMs have brought to the marketplace in terms of reducing the net price of pharmaceuticals through formulary management et cetera. So we don't see that dynamic changing. And as a matter of fact, some of the various bills that are currently in committees today broaden the tools that have been proven to be successful for the PBMs in terms of introducing more competition across therapeutic classes to include biosimilars and some of the things that have delayed competition from entering the marketplace. Derica Rice : Ann, this is Derica. We've been able to take advantage of that. And as we also shared back in June that we would be able to manage or rebate exposure very efficiently. And we've seen the peak this year. And in fact, we're doing slightly better than anticipated and that will mitigate over time and continue to dissipate as we think about 2020. And then to your second question regarding FEP along those lines we're very pleased that we were able to extend our relationship with them. We have a very strong partnership and history with FEP. I would anticipate at some point it will go to RFP, but the fact that we've been able to continue that relationship I think bodes very well for us and speaks very strongly to how we've been able to create a partnership that's lasted for a number of years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert, your line is open. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess just a couple of more detailed follow-ups. I mean one, Eva I think you mentioned a larger-than-expected benefit from generic launches, particularly in specialty. So I was just wondering if you could expand on that dynamic a little bit. And was this an area that you guys were expecting? Or is this actually something that could be trending more meaningfully in your favor as far as follow-on biologics or generic biologics? Eva Boratto : So Bob I'll take the first part. I think Jon will provide some more color. Overall, the timing of the launches and when they come to market can vary. So this was something we were expecting albeit it came early for us. And as we continue to focus to execute and deliver value and savings right driving the penetration of generics is an important priority for us. Jonathan Roberts : Bob, this is Jon. So for 2019 we continue to improve our purchasing economics on mature products. And then when they \u2013 we looked at some of the new generic launches that were coming to market, we actually were able to get more favorable rates than what we historically had. So that was a positive. And then we had some new generic launches that we did not expect that were favorable. And then as we look forward into 2020 and beyond, we still see significant generic launches and launches of biosimilars. And between 2020 and 2023, there'll be $41 billion of generics and biosimilars that will come to the market. And in addition to that we see opportunities to improve how we purchase complex generics, generics where there's only one manufacturer and also again a great opportunity around biosimilars. So we still see this as a very attractive area for us. Robert Jones : Got it. And then just one quick follow-up maybe for Karen. We've gotten some questions on disclosure from WellCare related to Aetna's PDP. I think it generated around $300 million in gross profit in the first three quarters of this year. Is that the right way we should think about the impact to Aetna CVS, when that PDP business eventually rolls off next year? Karen Lynch : So Bob, we haven't provided that level of detail on specific parts of the business. Obviously, there will be an earnings hit related to the roll-off of the business, as well as our need to work through some stranded costs Karen's team is focused on. And when we give guidance in February, we'll try to provide some more color. Robert Jones : Okay. Great. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Ralph, your line is open. Ralph Giacobbe : Great. Thanks. Just wanted to go to Health Benefits segment. Obviously last quarter you had noted the pressure in commercial and middle markets in the specific geography. It sounds like you've made some improvements there. So if you can help with sort of the deals and what sort of got better. But at the same time you're still expecting MLR above midpoint. So maybe just help on that more broadly. And then if you could just help us with cost trend by segment just commercial Medicare and Medicaid and within Medicaid. Specifically there's been a lot around reverification issues, we've heard from some of your peers. Is that hampering your margins in the segment? And is that driving up the MLR as well? Thanks. Eva Boratto : So a lot of questions there. I'll start with the commercial medical cost question. Yes we mentioned in the second quarter that we had some pressure in utilization in our lower end of the middle market. During the second quarter, we noted that we took appropriate actions to address those elevated medical costs. And I would tell you with an additional three months of claims experience, we feel comfortable that the actions that we took have mitigated the elevated pressures that we thought we saw in the second quarter. Specifically, what we did was we had intensified our medical management in those geographies, the claims activity that we now have seen, we believe that we've identified the right products, the right segment and the right geographies where that business had what we thought was elevated utilization. We feel that we've effectively addressed it. Relative to medical cost by segment, we have not disclosed that. I'll let Eva take that question. Larry Merlo : Yes. I think as you look -- listen, we've indicated all of our businesses are performing well. As you look at the mix of our business and its government has really grown, we look at the overall MBR as an indicator around the health of our business. The other thing that I would highlight is just recall SilverScript is now part of the MBR related to the healthcare benefits segment which is larger than the legacy Aetna PDP and it performs differently within the MBR essentially reverse of the typical managed care. Karen Lynch : Yes. And just a follow-up, I think you were asking a question on Medicaid redetermination. They've always been and continue to be something that we monitor very closely. There's really two impacts on redeterminations. The first and most obvious one is enrollment. The second one is on experience. Both impacts have been and continue to be immaterial for us. But as I said, we closely monitor it. But it isn't having any material impact on our Medicaid business. Larry Merlo : Okay. So, thanks Ralph. Amy, we'll take two more questions please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. A.J., your line is open. A.J. Rice: All right. Thanks. Hi everybody. First of all, just maybe get you guys at this point we've got more information about the lay of the land going into 2020 around the Medicare Advantage product offering and competitive offerings are visible to you. We're in the early stages of the open enrollment period. I know at the Investor Day you guys had said you thought you could grow above market even, obviously with the hip and other things coming back. Any updated thoughts on how that looks, how much geographic expansion things like that will drive your performance next year might be a general range on growth and enrollment in the business? Karen Lynch : Hi A.J., its Karen. Let me just comment on the competitive landscape and what our go-to-market strategy is. As you know, and as you've seen, the competitive landscape appears to be competitive in 2020. However, as you have seen CMS is estimating market growth to be about 10%. We think it will be a little bit lower than that, but we are still optimistic that we can outpace our industry growth despite the headwinds. And we -- there's a couple of reasons why we're optimistic. One, I would just say, we continue our efforts around geographic expansion. We're at 81% of Medicare eligible. We continue to make investments in our growth and retention of our existing service areas. Our stars performance is incredibly helpful to helping us in our optimism relative to Medicare growth. We have -- we maintained our zero premium plans and we're the top health plan with respect to zero premium plans. We also had expansion of our DSIT markets. And we are also focused as I've mentioned at Investor Day of converting our PDP business as well as our commercial business as our commercial business ages into retirement age. And we believe that we can be successful relative to all those factors. I also would comment A.J., that we have incorporated some of our new and differentiated capabilities at the combined company. So we are offering the HealthHUB in our Houston market. We have zero cost share benefit coverage in our MinuteClinics. We introduced our Healing Better program in select markets. We also offered a fall prevention benefit that provides members with an annual allowance for fall safety items that that if you've curated by CVS. And then our over-the-counter benefits provide members with an allowance at our CVS retail stores. So, all those factors give us optimism that we will have above-industry growth. A.J. Rice: All right. And maybe one quick follow-up on the Pharmacy Services. I know throughout this year you've talked about the investment you're making to helping Anthem stand up its IngenioRx. It sounds like perhaps there is -- that may swing to the positive. Is there any way to talk about the order of magnitude of that headwind that now becomes hopefully a little bit of a tailwind heading into 2020? Derica Rice : Hi, A.J., this is Derica. We haven't quantified in terms of putting this specifics. What we've stated is that clearly 2019 at least the first half was an investment year for us as we were looking to stand up that business. Now that we are far into the implementation of IngenioRx, which has gone really, really very well. We obviously now have transitioned to operating costs many of those expenses. We do expect that it will \u2013 while, it will be investment this year. We will turn profitable in 2020. And that's what we've stated. A.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven, your line is open. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Great. Good morning, everybody. So a lot of the juicy topics have been covered already. So I guess for us just for Medicaid obviously the Texas Star plus was pretty positive for the company. Is there any additional color you can provide on what you think drove some of your success there either qualitatively or quantitatively just in terms of your ability to analyze the full outcomes for yourself relative to the other players? Thanks. Larry Merlo : Yeah. So thank you. And we're really excited about being awarded the Texas program. We believe that some of the reasons why we won, we really believe we had a compelling RFP response. We have very strong existing value-based provider contracts in Texas. We had a very unique partnership with Texi Healthy Home area age -- aging agencies. We made a commitment to the DNT plan. We offered our Texas HealthHUB in that we believe helped us and we believe that our NCQA ratings helped us as well. Steven Valiquette : Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks. Larry Merlo : Thanks Steve. So look let me just wrap up. It's really hard to believe that at the end of the month, we're going to celebrate our first anniversary as one company. And I could not be more pleased and proud of the commitment and engagement of our nearly 300,000 colleagues all across the country. And as you've heard us talk this morning, our integrated model is designed to drive higher engagement, enhancing access to high-quality health care and reduce costs and create better health outcomes. And ultimately, that's going to feel and accelerate our revenue and EPS growth over the long-term. And I think again as you heard this morning our entire organization is laser-focused on executing the plan that brings that strategy to life. So let me thank everyone for their time this morning and we'll talk to all of you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Valerie Haertel, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for CVS Health. Thank you. Please go ahead, madam. Valerie Haertel : Thank you, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the CVS Health fourth quarter and full-year 2019 earnings call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I\u2019m Valerie Haertel, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for CVS Health. I\u2019m joined this morning by Larry Merlo, President and CEO, Eva Boratto, Executive Vice President and CFO. Following our prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session that will include Jon Roberts, Chief Operating Officer, Karen Lynch, President of Aetna, and Derica Rice, President of Caremark. In order to provide more people with the chance to ask a question during the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up. Consistent with our practice, in addition to this call and our press release, we have posted a slide presentation on our website. Our Form 10-K will be filed next week and will be available on our website at that time. Please note that during this call, we will make certain Forward-Looking Statements that reflect our current views related to our future financial performance, future events and industry and market conditions, as well as expected consumer benefits of our products and services, and our financial projections including synergies from the Aetna Acquisition. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what may be indicated in them. We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements disclosures in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements in this morning\u2019s earnings press release. During this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company\u2019s performance and financial condition. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures in this morning\u2019s earnings press release and the reconciliation document posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today\u2019s call is being broadcast on our website where it will be archived for one year. Now, I will turn the call over to Larry. Larry Merlo : Thanks, Valerie. And good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. Eva Boratto : Thanks, Larry, and good morning everyone. As Larry stated, our strong performance across the enterprise continued in the fourth quarter, capping off a successful year across all of our businesses. In the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.73 and our consolidated adjusted revenues grew 23.1% year-over-year. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by the addition of Aetna in the Health Care Benefits segment, followed by higher volume in both the Pharmacy Services and Retail/Long-Term Care segments. The fourth quarter also benefited from a lower-than-anticipated tax rate. Looking at our fourth quarter results by segment. Within Pharmacy Services, total revenues increased 6.2% year-over-year, exceeding our expectations. Our growth was driven by increased volume, specialty including the on-boarding of IngenioRx and brand inflation. Pharmacy Services adjusted operating income increased 1.5% versus last year, in line with expectations, primarily due to increased claims volume, the shift of Aetna\u2019s mail order and specialty operations into our Pharmacy Services segment, and improved purchasing economics, including the benefit from synergies. This was partially offset by continued price compression. Moving to our Retail/Long-Term Care segment. Performance was in line with our expectations with total revenues up 2.5% year-over-year. We delivered strong adjusted script growth of 5.6% with comp scripts up 6.9%, primarily driven by the continued adoption of our patient care programs. Our fourth quarter share of retail scripts was 26.8%, up 80 basis points. Front store sales and operating income continued to be a positive driver in the fourth quarter. Same-store front store sales increased 0.7%, primarily driven by increases in health and beauty, including strength in cough and cold sales. Adjusted operating income for Retail/Long-Term Care declined 4.4% as expected, primarily due to continued reimbursement pressure. Throughout the year, Retail/Long-Term Care adjusted operating income benefited from increased volume and higher generic dispensing rate. Operator : The first question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. George Hill : Hey, good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I think I want to start in the PBM segment, Larry and Eva. I guess if we look at the 2020 guide versus 2019, the revenue numbers are very close, the claims numbers are very close, but profitability seems markedly improved. So I guess could you talk about the dynamic of what is going on in that segment, where kind of a similar claims number and a similar revenue number is driving kind of better than expected profitability? Eva Boratto : Yes, George, this is Eva. I will start and then if Larry or Derica want to jump in. Overall, we are quite pleased with the expectations for the PBM segment that we laid out today. Clearly, it is a significant improvement from what we gave at our Investor Day. And as you look at that business, there are two key drivers from the results we provided previously. A, improvement in the selling season that we outlined. And B, what I will call continued purchasing economics. We have worked hard in improving our underlying cost of goods, thinking about our rebates, working through our rebate challenges, improvements in the network generics. And as we look at all of those factors, it is yielding the results. Additionally, I don\u2019t want to lose our modernization effort, it is also contributing to the expectations for the PBM. Derica Rice : George, this is Derica. I would also say -- I also recall that 2019 was an investment year for us in terms of the Anthem on IngenioRx implementation, and we have stated that in 2020 that become very profitable proposition for us. And as Eva said, we have obviously been working hard to reverse our rebate exposure and we have seen that that exposure has lessened in our outlook for 2020 versus the peak that we realized in 2019. So we are on track, and in fact ahead of where we thought we would be in terms of reducing that exposure and mitigating that over time. Eva Boratto : And recall, as you think about our claims in year-over-year, in the claims, you will see the benefit of the ramp of the on-boarding the Anthem contract on the network perspective. And that does not flow through to revenue as that account is on a net basis. George Hill : Okay, that is helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up is, you brought up enterprise modernization. It seems like you guys narrowed the range on that a little bit. I guess I would just ask, kind of what drove the narrowing versus the top-end? And I guess, did you feel like there were any opportunities that you saw before that you are not able to capitalize on, or just any comments on there? I think that would be helpful. Thank you. Eva Boratto : No, George. From an overall financial perspective, we are really confident in that program. As we got closer, we just wanted to tighten the range a bit as we look out in 2020. And Jon can provide some color on some of the initiatives. Jonathan Roberts : Yes. George, so we are well under way with our modernization efforts and very happy with where we are. And as you recall, we are focused on working smarter to deliver substantial cost benefits, while at the same time delivering an unmatched consumer experience. So some key focus areas are technology modernization, so rationalizing the number of applications that we use across our enterprise, developing centers of excellence that will deliver higher levels of service at lower cost. Examples data, robotics are centers of excellence for us. We are also moving to a hybrid cloud environment that will not only lower cost, but significantly reduce the time to build and deploy new capabilities. We are also working on productivity improvements, optimizing our call centers by taking calls out, by leveraging artificial intelligence, natural language processing and robotics along with other technologies. We are rationalizing the vendors and optimizing those, and then there are business initiatives that will focus on the digitization of manual processes across our company. And finally, we are leveraging and advancing our integrated data and analytics capabilities. And as an example, that will allow us to implement enhanced workforce management tools that allows us to schedule to better serve our customers. So those are some examples. I think we actually see the opportunity we originally envisioned, and this is a multi-year effort that will deliver substantial savings while at the same time improving service to both our customers and our own employees. Operator : Your next question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Wanted to first follow-up on the question and Derica\u2019s comments on rebate guarantees. Just quickly, have we kind of seen the bottom there, I know you were expecting another level of improvement into 2021, that kind of recapture happen faster or should we still see a meaningful change in 2021 on rebate guarantees in terms of improvement? Eva Boratto : Yes, I think, Justin, on the rebate guarantee, as we said, the impact was greatest in 2019. It is still a headwind in 2020, albeit less of a headwind. And we do see the issue essentially immaterial as you head into 2021. Larry Merlo : And Justin, keep in mind as you heard us talk throughout 2019, we were able to mitigate a portion of those headwinds working with clients, and clients adopting a more complete formulary, which created a win-win. There was value for them and that helped us offset some of the potential headwind associated with that. Justin Lake : Thanks. And then my core question was just around the intercompany numbers. Your intercompany number, if I\u2019m backing into it correctly, looks like it is down a few billion dollars year-over-year on revenue, which makes sense, I think given the divestiture of those Aetna PDP lives. But the intercompany actual profitability, which I thought also might have went down instead got worse, instead of getting better. So the drag on intercompany looks like it is actually a bigger negative EBIT year-over-year, which I thought a little bit strange. So I was wondering if you could flush out what happened whatever intercompany, especially the increased drag on intercompany at the corporate -- from an EBIT perspective. Thanks. Eva Boratto : Yes. I think, Justin, as you look at the intercompany, clearly, with the net new business selling season being down, that that can affect that elimination of those clients had Maintenance Choice and what have you. And as you look at the margin that we record there, right, that reflects the underlying margin of that business, for which that has adopted Maintenance Choice. So there is an aspect of price compression that that flows through there. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Robert Jones : Great. Yes, thanks for the questions. I guess maybe over on the retail guidance. We have the specific guidance now, which seems largely in line with your previous communications for low-single-digit growth. But now we are a quarter closer, I\u2019m wondering if maybe you could just walk through the major building blocks coming off a year clearly that you saw high-single-digit declines in EBIT growth in 2019. So just wondering if you could give us the major blocks again now probably having a little bit more clarity than you did at the time of the last communication that helps get us from the down high-single to the up low-single will be really helpful. Eva Boratto : Yes. This is Eva. I will take that. So as you look at returning to low-single-digit growth, I think there are four things that I will highlight. Right. It is the result of continued solid script growth, improvement from generics, and a meaningful impact from modernization. As we have said, the modernization initiative I think disproportionately benefit the retail segment versus our other segments as we look at 2020. I will remind you that we no longer have the headwind of the tax reform investment that we were wrapping through in the first half of 2019. Jonathan Roberts : And this is Jon Roberts. The only other thing I would say is, we are also working to reposition the front store with a focus on health and beauty. We are pivoting to the HealthHUBs. And then we are growing in the front, growing margin in the front, growing the top line a little bit through our focus on execution around personalization. Robert Jones : No, that is helpful. And then I guess the follow-up to that would be something as you guys are now closer to transitioning a lot of these stores. Is there any contemplation around what the drag or setback could be on comps? I know when you go through these transitions, obviously there is usually a bit of a one-step backwards before two steps forward. Is that contemplated as you think about the growth in the retail segment overall, in 2020? Larry Merlo : Yes, Bob, it is Larry. It is. And as you have heard us talk late last year, as we get a bigger critical mass of the hubs operational, we will provide more quantitative guidance and you can expect that we will be in the spring, mid-year time frame. Operator : Your next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Hi, good morning. So, one follow-up, and then another question. On the follow-up, you highlighted the HIF headwind is $0.13. When we think about what is changed in terms of HIF impact, what would be the impact from mid-year renewals on the commercial side due to the HIF repeal? Karen Lynch : Hey Ricky, it is Karen. Obviously, we would factor that into our overall pricing as we move forward in our renewals with the commercial business that would be factored in. And it should be overall - we will balance the reduction with our margin expectations. Eva Boratto : And Ricky, this is. Eva. So as we spoke about the HIF back in June, really that is the only change the repeal for 2021 relative to what we had discussed back in June. Larry Merlo : And Ricky, just to make sure we are all on the same page. The $0.13 comprehends the question that you are asking. Ricky Goldwasser : Understood. My question was, was it $0.10 before and now there is an incremental $0.03? Or we just get a sense of how much your head versus your original guide? That was the purpose of the question. Eva Boratto : Yes. I think, Ricky, the repeal - we haven\u2019t broken that out, but it was a modest change to us adding a couple of pennies. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay, understood. And then for my primary question, Larry, obviously you are expanding on the HealthHUBs. And one of the key questions that we are getting from investors is whether at some point we are going to see you adding a primary care function to the HealthHUB strategy. Obviously, primary care has become an important part of our vertical strategy for others in the industry. And wanted to get kind of like your view on whether this is something that you are considering in the future. I know that you have the relation with Teladoc, but Teladoc assumes to address kind of like the acute needs of the population versus primary care that could create greater stickiness over time. Larry Merlo : Yes. Ricky, it is a great question. And as we sit today, we have talked a lot about utilization of Teladoc, okay, our technology capabilities there, as well as the opportunities that we have across the Aetna provider network. And Ricky, you heard in our prepared comments that today our nurse practitioners can treat about 80% of what is treated in a PCP office. The one element that I want to emphasize that I want to make sure it doesn\u2019t get lost in all of this because we talk about being a complement to the role of the primary care physician. And as we talk to our Aetna members, our consumers, they do talk about the value that they have in the relationship with a PCP. And at the same time, they also talk about the need for - they use words like navigator. We call it concierge. And the fact that it gets back to one of the imperatives in terms of the ability to be local, and the fact that people are looking - how can you help me access, how can you help me use my benefits, how can you help me navigate through this complex maze called healthcare? Our HealthHUBs are playing that role. So I don\u2019t want that to get lost in this overall equation. Operator : Your next question comes from Lisa Gill of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Great, thanks very much. Good morning. I just want to start with the 2021 selling season and kind of compare it to 2020. So Larry, I heard you talk about in your prepared remarks the zero to low co-pay plan options for commercial members. One, is that just really in your Aetna book of business? Are you selling that within that the Caremark component? And then as we think about some of the plan designs that drove 2020 and you talked about the better profitability and aligning formularies, etc., how do we compare what you are selling for 2021 versus 2020? Larry Merlo : Yes. Lisa, I will ask Derica to start and just start with the selling season broadly, and then we will dig into the questions there. Derica Rice : Good morning, Lisa. If you think about it, when we came into the selling season, our book of business that was up for renewal was around $50 billion. And today, we have completed about 65% of that with a very high retention rate. So we are off to a very strong start. And as you heard from Eva\u2019s opening comments, that included the retention of FEP, which we have signed through 2021 as well as we were also able to renew the WellCare book of business as well. When you think about the economics of this, this is what is helping to drive our outlook for not only 2020, but our outlook for 2021 as well. So we don\u2019t anticipate having the net new business loss to overcome in 2021, that obviously we are overcoming in our guidance for 2020. So that bodes very well. And then obviously when Larry talked about the formulary management, that really related to our efforts to mitigate our rebate exposure. And again, as I have stated previously, it was expected to peak in 2019 that began to mitigate in 2020 and we expect it to be de minimis by the time we get to 2021. And then in terms of the zero-dollar co-pay, recall that we just launched a program here recently RxZERO for our diabetes patients, where essentially we removed the out-of-pocket burden. We think that that will not only improve access but adherence, but it will translate into improved health outcomes when we think about the medical claims that we expect to see downstream. And we are selling that to all our clients as well as our zero-dollar co-pay. Larry Merlo : Yes, and Lisa, to that point, and then I will flip it over to Karen. Because to Derica\u2019s point, that zero co-pay at the diabetes care category is both for Aetna members as well as Caremark members. And the excitement around that is, today as you know, the rebates get passed back to the plan sponsor and they have that tug and pull in terms of, do I apply those discounts at the pharmacy counter or do I apply those discounts in buying down the monthly premium. And this takes that off the table. And by clients adopting the value formulary, OK, and the benefits of improved adherence reducing medical costs, they no longer have to make that decision. And that is the beauty of that program. But Karen, maybe I will flip it over to you. Karen Lynch : And Lisa, just to give you some color on the 2020 enrollment, we have seen strong interest in the integrated pharmacy medical. We actually sold more integrated pharmacy members in January of 2020 than we did all of 2019. So obviously, a significant interest in the integration value and we had about 40% increase in new business was also sold with Pharmacy. So really strong results relative to the integrated story. Lisa Gill : And how do I think about the profitability of things like the RxZERO diabetes program? Is pharma in some way helping to fund that in the way that you contracted for that? Is it that you are making it up with incremental scripts because people are going to be more adherent to the program? Just how do we think about those kind of programs and the profitability as we think about these going forward? Derica Rice : Hi Lisa, this is Derica. Pharma is not funding this. In fact, if you think about the way we have constructed is pretty much self-funding. So one, through the client adopting our value formulary, they are able to create offsets in terms of their cost structure and then obviously they get the second offset with the improved medical outcomes downstream by have an improved adherence and compliance with the meds on the part of the diabetes patients. So again it is a win-win for both, both the out-of-pocket burden for the member as well as the cost control in terms of downstream medical claim costs for the client themselves, or the plan sponsor. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Your line is open. Kevin Caliendo : Hi, thanks for taking my call. I want to go through some of the comments around the stronger purchasing economics. You mentioned both generics and in the PBM. I\u2019m guessing there is also better purchasing on specialty as well. What is the dynamic, like what is changing that is making your purchasing better incrementally? Just want to understand what is sort of changing over the last six months there. Eva Boratto : I will start. Right. Overall, with our Red Oak venture as well as our internal teams, right, we work to improve our cost structure each and every day. And we look for opportunities. You are right. There is specialty opportunities, there is generics, our rebate negotiations, our network negotiations are all part of a contributor. Jonathan Roberts : Yes, and this is Jon, Kevin. So, as you look out over the next couple of years, there is going to be significant launches of generics and biosimilars. As a matter of fact, between 2020 and 2023, there is going to be  of these launches. And as Eva says, we are very happy with Red Oak. And we see an opportunity not only with new launches, but we also see opportunities in how we purchase existing complex generics, single source generics and existing biosimilars. Derica Rice : And just don\u2019t underestimate also the comments Larry made earlier around having better formulary compliance on the part of our clients as well, which also improves the yield in terms of the utilization. Kevin Caliendo : Okay. And just one quick follow-up. I was a little confused about the Centene renewal. In the past, it was $3.6 billion headwind, now it is $900 million or so with the WellCare renewal. Can you just help me understand sort of what happened there in terms of the headwind from that contract? Am I thinking about that right? Or, just some more detail around that would be really helpful. Larry Merlo : Yes, Kevin, in-keep in mind that with Centene transaction just closing, these were two separate events. So the WellCare contract was extended. As you will recall, that contract went through 2020 and has been extended for another three-year period effective 1/1/21. And the dynamic around Centene is that contract was renewed again a three-year period starting 1/1/24, a larger portion of the Centene business than what was originally planned. So some of the business rolled off to RxAdvance, largely the exchange business and some Medicaid programs. And we are retaining the balance of that business and we expect in both cases to operate that business for the value of that contract over the three-year contractual periods. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Cherny of Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Cherny : Good morning, and thanks so much for taking the question. I guess I just wanted to circle back, Lisa had asked some questions about the selling season. When you think about the selling season, and this is dramatic relative to the overall enterprise, how do you feel about where you need to be from a tipping point perspective when all of the pieces you are putting together within the integrated pharmacy medical offering, are fully resonating in the market? And I guess along those lines, what else start the consultants or plan sponsors are asking you to do that you are not already doing or that you have planned in the hub, but maybe try to accelerate to make sure that they can maximize the value they have of working with you? Derica Rice : Michael, this is Derica, I will kick it off for the PBM. And Karen, if you have anything you want to add in terms of the Aetna book of business. But as it relates to the PBM, I will say that we have had really good feedback from both the client base when we talk to our health plan and employer clients, as well as the benefit consultants, when we hold our advisory meeting, and we actually just held one here recently at the beginning of January. They are extremely excited about the opportunities with the HealthHub and our ability to integrate our pharmacy and medical claims, and use that four points of intervention on behalf of the member incite them to take their next best action from their own personal health. That is resonating very well, Michael. And what we have seen is that, there were some question around how would health plans take on to this new integrated model. We have now had a number of health plans that have come and chosen into pilot with us on some of our care management programs, that we have in development. So, again consistent with our open platform concept, we are bringing some of those new inventions and insights to them that we are developing along side with our Aetna colleagues. And that is actually playing out very well in the marketplace. So I do think that that is contributing to our successful start to the 2021 selling season. And I would expect that to continue as we think about the remainder of the selling season, and as we move into 2022 as well. Karen? Karen Lynch : Yes, Michael, very similar responses from our customers. We have recently met with our customers and our brokers. They are very excited about the opportunities from the HealthHUB, increasingly excited about the connectivity of the data and analytics, and really connecting the members throughout their personal health journey. So that is where they are really excited about our care management programs, how we are connecting their employees into the communities. So it is been resonating quite well. I think that is why we have seen the increase in the integrated pharmacy medical sales that we had this -- with this open enrollment season. But as we look to 2021, we will continue to develop new capabilities, we will be advancing our behavior change programs like our Aetna Advice or Aetna\u2019s Next Best Action. We will continue to drive at local sites of care using the HealthHUBs and MinuteClinics as a primary place for those sites of care. We will continue to drive new benefit designs like our low-cost no co-pay MinuteClinic, but also looking at additional plan designs for first-dollar coverage. And then we will be continuing to round out our new clinical programs like RxZERO program and our transform oncology and our kidney care program, all of which have been resonating with the customers and the brokers. Derica Rice : So Michael, what is really getting traction is our ability to solve for both the client and the member. It is not either-or, it is an and. And I think that is where the power in this really lies. Operator : Your next question comes from Lance Wilkes of Bernstein. Your line is open. Lance Wilkes : Yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to take a step back and let you address a little bit the management changes that have been taken place, and some of the new appointments you have got, maybe to put that in context with kind of your overall strategic vision and how you are looking at the company going forward and how you see the organization supporting that, if there are different roles and different sorts of talents you are looking for. Larry Merlo : Yes, Lance, it is Larry. Look, I think everybody on this call is aware, organization structures evolve over time depending on the needs of the business. And we have always had a very robust management planning and development program across the organization. And we are pretty proud of the results that we have seen with that. So we have results in a very deep and talented bench. And as you heard in my prepared remarks, these changes really reflect the priorities that we have today, and the excitement around these products and services coming to market, and the opportunity to get them into the hands of more and more people as quick as we possibly can. So we are very pleased with where we are at today and excited about what is in front of us. Lance Wilkes : Great. I appreciate it. And if you could maybe just on a smaller point, talk a little bit about the fourth quarter commercial medical cost, your experience relative to your projections, and if there is anything else for with from a medical cost standpoint, maybe among the businesses that impacted fourth quarter positively or negatively. Eva Boratto : Yes. Lance, this is Eva. As we look at our fourth quarter medical cost trend, it was in line with our guidance. I would say it was at the lower end of our guidance range of 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points. As you look at 2019, the year played out largely as we expected and there is really no changes to call out. Karen Lynch : Lance, the only thing I would add is we heard -- we saw an earlier flu season in December, as you likely know. We have seen it happen in December, coming down in January, but nothing out of the ordinary. It is the influenza B, the incidences are a little bit higher in outpatient. But we aren\u2019t seeing the severity that we have seen in past years relative to the flu season, and we feel like we have adequately covered it in our reserves. Operator : Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe of Citi. Your line is open. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks, good morning. Can you just give us a little bit better idea on the enrollment trends by end market in the Health Benefits segment? And specifically the commercial market, and the split between ASO and commercial as we think about 2020? Eva Boratto : Relative to the commercial business, as you know we continue to offer choice to our commercial business. We have seen a transition from risk to ASO particularly in the lower end of the small segment. We have been offering a self-insured product at the smaller end of the segment to combat what we have seen relative to those changes. Relative to ASC business and our national accounts business, as we came into the year, I mean we are kind of flat to down in January. But we are well aware of some national accounts that we will see coming to us in the latter half of the year. So we expect to increase that number in the latter half of the year. And then in small group, we continue to be pressured in that business and we are contracting in that business. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. So is it fair to say commercial business down year-over-year in 2020? And then I guess we have talked a lot about sort of the selling season specifically, sort of on the pharmacy side. Just as we think about sort of the medical selling season if you will, as we move through the year with sort of the integrated pitch, is it more selective to sort of match with the HealthHUB roll-out that is going to be more expensive going into 2022? Or is this something that we should see resonating and start to see commercial growth in 2021, given sort of the integration of the Aetna and the CVS pieces? Thanks. Eva Boratto : Yes. Given the integration of the pieces, we should expect to see better commercial growth in 2021. Larry Merlo : Yes. And Ralph, keep in mind that it is our plan for the hubs will be between 600 and 650 by year-end. So we do need to build those critical masses. It is not going to surprise you that as we prioritize markets, we have worked to match concentration of Aetna members for these first phases. So, Chris, we have got time for two more questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. Your next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Your line is open. Charles Rhyee : Yes, hey, thanks for taking the question. Larry, maybe just going back, as you are talking about the HealthHUB there, you know when you look at these new HealthHUBs formats, I think along with adding all the health services aspects of it, there has also been sort of a remodeling of how you are looking at remodeling the front end and how you are kind of shelving the products in maybe a more intuitive way there. Do you see that being extended out just beyond the HealthHUBs? And can that be applied across all your stores? And I ask that because when we think back historically when retailers have gone into a phase of trying to refresh stores, that is kind of come with a uplift in same-store sales. And is that something that you have seen so far in the HealthHUBs against the control group? And is that something we could expect as you kind of go forward, and as we think beyond just the 1,500 HealthHUBs? Jonathan Roberts : Yes, Charles, this is Jon. So remember, in the HealthHUBs, we are taking probably 20% of the sales floor and converting it to the hub services. And at the same time, we are shrinking the general merchandise and adding a lot of health and wellness items. And when we look at our 2019 HealthHub stores, we are actually seeing positive growth in the front store sales and margin because health and wellness are actually carrying higher margin. And we are taking components of what we are learning in the HealthHUBs and we are deploying those products and categories across our fleet. So yes, there is an opportunity to expand that to all stores, and we have different formats depending upon volumes and geographies that stores are in. And also recall over the last several years, we have remodeled just about the majority of our fleet. So we are feeling really good about the shape that these stores are in and our ability to continue to grow. Charles Rhyee : Thanks. And a follow-up then maybe partly related when we are looking at the synergy guidance, it looks like in 2019, you outperformed that fairly nicely about $100 million or so. When you look at the 2020 guidance, you kind of bumped it up a little bit, taking up the range $800 million, $900 million from, call it roughly $800 million. Anything to think in that, is that more of a pacing and timing of like how quickly you can realize synergies, or is there an opportunity that we can again exceed probably better given where our end target out in 2021 is? Thanks. Larry Merlo : Yes, Charles, it really reflects on the quality of the integration work in terms of the fact that it was done extremely well and we were able to accomplish many of those activities ahead of schedule. So it is really a great job by the team. Operator : Your final question comes from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Your line is open. Steve Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. You touched on this topic a little bit, but just a question around the commercial medical cost trend for 2020 in particular. We have seen some other managed care companies talk about lower trends in 2020 due to better pharmacy integration. So with your 6% expected commercial trend for 2020, you mentioned on Page 23 in the slide deck, I\u2019m curious, are there any elevated cost areas maybe either in inpatient or outpatient that might be offsetting some pharmacy savings? Maybe more importantly, is there any bias for the 6% trend to improve over time as you get further along in the overall CVS, Aetna merger integration? Thanks. Eva Boratto : Relative to our trend - we don\u2019t know what our competitors include in some of their trend expectations, but we obviously factor in a variety of things like the economy, provider consolidation, use of technology, continued emergence of specialty drugs, but there is nothing included in our trend that is out of the ordinary. We factored in what we typically factored in, accounting for where we think savings will occur as well. And we are quite confident in how we are projecting our trend at 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. Steve Valiquette : From the merger overall though, shouldn\u2019t this trend come down over time? Should commercial cost trend be a beneficiary of the overall merger? Eva Boratto : Yes. So Steve, we haven\u2019t provided longer-term trend projections. Right. But as you saw back at Investor Day, right, we are driving toward meaningful medical cost savings through the integration and we will have more to say about that as time progresses. Larry Merlo : So with that, let me just thank everybody for their time because just summarizing quickly here, I hope you agree with us that today\u2019s results really reflect the importance of our strategy in making healthcare more simple, local and affordable. And we are really pleased with the progress that we have made in executing our plan, and a lot of the credit for that goes to our nearly 300,000 colleagues for all their hard work and commitment to our purpose. And all of us here are confident in our ability to meet the needs of the diverse markets that we serve, while continuing to accelerate growth. So with that, I\u2019m sure we will talk to many of you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Valerie Haertel : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the CVS Health first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I'm Valerie Haertel, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for CVS Health. I'm joined this morning by Larry Merlo; and Eva Boratto, Executive Vice President and CFO. Following our prepared remarks, we'll host a question-and-answer session that will include Jon Roberts, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Karen Lynch, Executive Vice President and President of Aetna; and Alan Lotvin, Executive Vice President and President of Caremark. In order to provide more people with the chance to ask a question during the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up. In addition to this call, our press release and Form 10-Q, we have posted a slide presentation on our website. Please note that during this call, we will make certain reviews including our financial projections and statements related to our future financial performance, future events, industry and market conditions, and the future impact of COVID-19 on our enterprise.  Our forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections and are subject to significant uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond CVS Health's control, including the future impact of COVID-19 on our enterprise. We strongly encourage you to review the information we filed with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties, in particular those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and the Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements and risk factor disclosures in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Cautionary Statements Concerning Forward-Looking Statements in this morning's earnings press release. During this call, we'll use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance and financial conditions. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in this morning's earnings press release and a reconciliation document posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website.  And as always, today's call is being broadcast on our website where it will be archived. I will turn the call over to Larry. Larry Merlo : Well, thanks, Valerie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our 2020 Q1 earnings call. These are certainly unprecedented times for us all. And at CVS Health our dedicated colleagues have been working on the frontlines in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, responding in real time with solutions for consumers and patients across the country. And I'd like to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our colleagues for their work in all parts of our organization. They are doing a phenomenal job of responding to the needs of our communities, and I could not be more proud of their efforts. Now, as we all know, over the last couple of months, the situation has rapidly intensified as the pandemic has spread from coast-to-coast. Federal, state and local governments, in partnership with the private sector have worked to curb the spread of the virus and its impact on our population and the economy. As CVS Health is one of the largest providers of essential services, we are supporting these efforts through our community reach, local presence, broad healthcare offerings, digital capabilities and our hard working colleagues, and we are part of the solution during these difficult times.  So let me provide an overview of the actions we've taken in response to COVID-19 with two key priorities in mind. First is the well-being and safety of our colleagues, consumers and communities we serve. Second is maintaining the continuity of our businesses and operations. In order do that, we are making investments to support our consumers, clients and members while deepening our relationships and advancing our long-term strategy of being the most consumer centric health company.  Starting with our colleagues, we took swift action designed to keep them safe, while we kept our stores and other operations up and running with minimal disruption. We implemented social distancing practices, enhanced cleaning protocols, distributed personal protective equipment and outfitted stores with plexiglass barriers. We also provided our colleagues with enhanced benefits and resources, including family support and announced bonuses for our frontline colleagues for their outstanding work. All of these actions help ensure the continuity of our operations at a time when they are needed the most. For our consumers and members impacted by COVID-19, we are providing them with continued access to quality healthcare, while relieving some of the added costs and stress resulting from the pandemic. Eva Boratto : Thanks, Larry. And good morning, everyone. Like Larry, I want to take this opportunity to thank all of my colleagues for their hard work, courage and dedication as we navigate this difficult time. As Larry mentioned, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic brought about new challenges to all of us, and CVS has been adapting our business operations to support our key stakeholders. Through this pandemic, we've continued to advance our cost reduction priorities, including delivering integration synergy goals and our transformative goals to become a more digital enterprise. The rapid changes across the country in response to COVID-19 has led us to accelerate some of those initiatives.  In light of the COVID-19 uncertainty, we also took steps to enhance our liquidity and strengthen our capital. We issued 4 billion in bonds in March as a preemptive measure against cash needs in a severely adverse scenario. While this will add about 15 million additional interest expense monthly, it puts us in a strong liquidity position to weather potential crises, with access to over 5 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of March, as well as 6 billion available by issuing commercial paper we're borrowing under our backup credit facility and strong operating cash flows. Once we return to normalcy we expect to repay the incremental debt. We will also continue to prudently manage our operating expenses and will reduce our planned capital expenditures by $200 million this year. Our long-term leverage target remains unchanged and we continue to prioritize paying down our debt and maintaining our dividend with no share repurchases planned until we meet our leverage target. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Lisa Gill of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : And thank you, Larry and team for all that, that CVS is doing on the front lines. Let me just first start. Eva, one of the comments you made is that there was a strong underlying core versus your expectations in the first quarter. Can you just maybe talk about what areas performed better on the core side than you were expecting. And I know you're not going to give any incremental guidance, but I just want to understand how we think about the front end and the impact to overall results. So you talked about the April update, and I appreciate that being down 10.9% on the front end. If it stays like that for some period of time, how does that impact the overall results as we think about the core guidance that you gave? Eva Boratto : Hi, Lisa, it\u2019s Eva. Thanks for thanks for your question and your comments about everything the company is doing. I think as we commented on the strong underlying core, right, I'll start with the PBM. You saw really strong top-line and bottom-line growth with specialty leading the way. We're realizing the benefits of some of the initiatives that we had started last year and underlying sales in the PBM. So we're pleased with that and the performance we've reported was above our initial expectation. Additionally, as you look at the retail business. Again, strong performance ex-COVID, pleased with the front store comp of 2% prior to COVID, continued strong script growth and we reported over 8% script growth when you adjust for COVID, you're still above 6% and that's the continuation of our patient care programs and what have you. And from a Health Care Benefits perspective, I'd say our results were largely in line. We're pleased with the growth in the government sector. But on the Medicaid side as I outlined, we have some MBR pressure that we're working through. Lisa, on the guidance question, I'll say there are a host of assumptions underneath of leaving our guidance unchanged. And it's based on a number of factors, as you look at things coming back on-board, I don't think it's consistent across the country, right, it'll be state-by-state and we've really tried to factor all the different pieces. And Jon, if you want to add anything on the front store? Jon Roberts : Well, I mean Lisa, listen all categories are obviously down in April coming off from the peak in March and it's still very early. We have very limited data. But we are seeing that as shelter-in orders are lifting and we return our hours of operation to the normal hours, we're beginning to see sales improve. So, still early, but the early view is improving. Larry Merlo : And Lisa, it\u2019s Larry, just maybe one final point on it, specific to front store sales. Keep in mind front store now represents 8%, 9% of enterprise revenues, continues to be important. And team has done a great job in terms of -- when you think about the underlying ex-COVID, the sales performance was around 2%. So, that reflects a lot of the activities that we've talked about in the past around personalization. Lisa, I think one of the things that we're seeing and learning is -- and we talked about things that are happening today that are part of today's norm. But things that will migrate from today's norms to tomorrow's everyday routines, and as you heard in our prepared remarks, we've seen a dramatic increase in home delivery. One of the questions that we've always had is, how do we increase the front store attachment rate to prescriptions? And again, we've seen a fourfold increase in terms of those prescriptions being accompanied with a front store purchase. So, we think that's an opportunity that we can capitalize on, as we begin to return to, I\u2019ll say, a new normal environment. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Percher of Nephron Research. Your line is open. Eric Percher : Eric Percher and Josh Raskin here from Nephron. Maybe building on the last question of what a new norm may look like. You spoke to some of the shifts occurring in mail, specialty shift and home infusion. How material are these? Do you see the shift, I think mail is 5% of all scripts, as being material. And obviously across your models, you can capture then in a couple of ways. And I'd love to hear the same on specialty and infusion and whether you think there is share gain from the hospital channel as well? Larry Merlo : Yes, Eric, it\u2019s Larry. Maybe I'll start and ask Alan to talk more specifically on mail. I think the core and the home infusion is a great opportunity and ties back to something that we've talked about many times. When you think about, how do we provide care in the right care setting with the variables being convenience as well as cost. And our infusion nurses have made 60,000 visits since the pandemic began, which is a great example of what we're talking about in terms of -- we freed up important hospital capacity by working with the hospitals in terms of expediting discharge back into the home for those patients who needed to continue to require IV therapy, and were well enough to do that within the comfort of their home, and we're able to provide that service. So, Eric, a lot of this goes back to the strategy that we've been talking about for the last couple of years in terms of, what we can do to make healthcare local and simple, whether it's in the community, in the home or in the palm of your hand. Alan Lotvin : So Eric, it\u2019s Alan Lotvin. I'll add a couple of points. One, on home delivery, we've seen an increase in home delivery in mail but I think when you think about mail and the power of enterprise, we have the ability to bring prescriptions to people's home not only through traditional mail, but also as Jon talked about through home delivery from retail and that's also up dramatically. And the last point I would make is that as we talked about the early view into what we're seeing, with mail and specialty in April, we're not seeing the same patterns of decline that we're seeing in the retail network. Eric Percher : And along the same lines of early views, are you seeing any change in pre-authorizations on the HCP side relative to that 30% decline, where that may move? Karen Lynch : Hi, Eric, it\u2019s Karen. In April, pre-auth, we saw almost a 40% decline in prior authorization. And in utilization it's down 30% through April. I would tell you that as states are opening up, however, we  uptick in pre-auth and pre-cert but not dramatic increases yet. Operator : Our next question comes from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Ann Hynes : So just for clarification. Eva, I know you said kind of Health Care Benefits segment results were in line with your estimates. So when I look at your prior guidance for Health Care Benefits, the operating profit guidance was 5% to 6.7%. So is that decline -- negative 4.5%, was that Q1 decline in line with your expectations going into the year? It will be my first question. And my second question is, I know you touched this in your prepared remarks. Can you just remind us some of the initiatives you did in 2019 in specialty, which resulted in such strong results? Thank you. Eva Boratto : Yes, sure. So Ann on the Health Care Benefits, I would say the results are largely in line as I said before. And as you think about the results, a couple of things our operations are elevated in Q1, as we're on-boarding the growth in the Medicare business that we spoke to as well as IlliniCare and bringing that acquisition on. And recall I spoke last year to some stranded costs related to the Aetna-PDP divestiture. We're aggressively working that down as we go throughout the year. That said, I did highlight some of the pressure on the Medicaid and MBR and that certainly is something we're working through. And I\u2019ll let Alan provide some additional color on some of the specialty initiatives. Alan Lotvin : So on the specialty side, Ann, we\u2019ve expanded a program we call Specialty Expedite, which is a way to simplify the process of getting prescriptions sorted for both physicians and patients, in short of time. It has been very well accepted in the provider community. We continue to refine Specialty Connect, our approach to allowing patients to pick up or drop off prescriptions. Specialty prescriptions at retail is a very, very popular approach. Again, resonates very strongly in the provider community. And we really continue to drive our digital adoption and the ability to interact with our Specialty members via text and secure messaging, which again creates just a tailwind for us as we work more closely with these patients. Larry Merlo : And Ann, it's Larry, maybe just one final point. Keep in mind when we talk about 19% Specialty growth that now includes the Specialty business within Ingenio in those numbers as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Your line is open. Charles Rhyee : Thanks for taking the questions. Just a follow-up from earlier question around Jon, I think you were responding to Lisa's question around the experience you're seeing in the reopen states. Anything, any more details you can give like a breakdown between not just pharmacy but also front-end? And is it foot traffic that is accelerating and talk about may be how consumers are kind of responding as they are kind of going back to sort of a normal life, is first. And then just going back to, I think earlier, in the prepared remarks you talked about strong retention rate in the PBM business. Maybe talk about what new business activity looks like this year. Is it fair to think that with all the disruptions that employers are seeing, we should expect a lot less new business activity? Thank you. Jon Roberts : Charles, this is Jon, I'll start. So we are -- I mean if you look at where most of the COVID positive cases are, we're seeing more of a significant sales impact both in the front and in the pharmacy than we see in other areas that are less impacted. But as the shelter-in-place orders are lifted, we're turning back on our marketing programs with personalization. That is a big part of our sales driving programs. We're also returning our hours of operation back to normal. So as an example 75% of our stores reduced their front store hours of operation, and it was about 12% of the hour, so returning or return those back to normal as the community is open up. In pharmacy, we did less of an hour\u2019s reduction of about 2%. But listen, it's still very early, but we are seeing some positive trends as I said earlier. In pharmacy, we're seeing less of an impact and I think a lot of that is due to our home delivery program that Larry talked about in his remarks. But I think the biggest headwind we're seeing now in pharmacy is really around new therapy starts. So you've seen doctor visits are down and as a result of that we're seeing about 25% less or lower new therapy starts for April than we saw a year ago. So, this includes new maintenance prescriptions, as well as prescriptions for acute events. And they typically grow about 7% each year. In certain drug classes such as antibiotics new starts are down 40% to 50%. So as physicians start seeing patients, again, we expect this volume to normalize. Alan Lotvin : So I'll jump in, it\u2019s Alan, on the new business question. So I'll first talk about retention. As Eva mentioned, we were about 70%, a little over 70% of the way through our own book, we're at a 97% to 98% retention rate. So we're very happy with that. With respect to new business, we'll talk more about that next quarter. But I will tell you that RFP activity is consistent with what we've seen over the last few years. We have not seen much of a slowdown. Obviously, I can't predict what's going to happen as we get towards the end of the year. But as of now, we're seeing roughly consistent what we've seen in the last two weeks. Operator : Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ricky Goldwasser : Question is focused on your Medicaid comments around some of the higher cost. But if we look forward -- an article yesterday talked about states that are starting to cut Medicaid rates. So what are your thoughts about how prevalent it\u2019s going to be this year and next year and the impact on margins? I think your long-term target at Investor Day was low-single-digit to mid-single-digit, so how should we think about the potential impact of rate cuts on that? Karen Lynch : Hey, Ricky. It's Karen. Relative to your first question on the pressures being in Medicaid. There's really two factors. One is, there we had a longer flu season that impacted Medicaid. And the second was really around some unusually high cost claimants in the Medicaid business. Relative to the Medicaid business on a go forward basis, it's a little early to tell. We are working very closely with our Medicaid states. We expect to see obviously improved enrollment in Medicaid, as we continue to see unemployment increase over time, and we haven't had any states come back and cut rates on us yet, but obviously we would manage to -- our medical costs and our operating expenses to try to maintain those single margins as appropriate. Larry Merlo : Ricky, it\u2019s Larry. One final point I\u2019d add, as you look forward, I think that your question around Medicaid margins is, it's really an open question at this point. Because if you go back and look at the stimulus activity out of Washington, now there's no dialogue beginning on a stimulus for and some of this is, it could really be framed as a policy question that the stimulus today has not addressed the issue of individual subsidies for COBRA as an example, acknowledging that there is going to be a relationship between what happens to the Medicaid rosters, assuming unemployment does increase to some number, versus what happens with COBRA if there are subsides applied for individuals to enroll in COBRA. So, that's something that we'll be watching closely and having discussion around. Ricky Goldwasser : Just one follow-up on that. Do you have any view around what would be the risk profile since you got uptick in Medicaid enrollment, in past you used to see sicker population actually signing up to the Medicaid benefit. Do you think that given what we're seeing in COVID and how it's impacting cross section of the population that you might have a different risk pool and maybe kind of like younger population signing up? Wondering what your thoughts are on that? Eva Boratto : Ricky, I think if we look at historical patterns when we\u2019ve seen unemployment, you look back at 2008, 2009, when we saw increases in Medicaid as well. What we saw was a more healthy population come in, and we would expect to see that as well, because we've got commercial business relatively speaking healthy. So I would think the risk profile will change somewhat and skew to a healthier growth. Operator : Our next question is from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : A couple of things here. First, can you help us understand the $0.10 benefit that you discussed here in terms of how much benefit to the bottom-line from incremental revenue that you can tell us about? And then thoughts about the incremental costs on COVID in March that might have offset some of that benefit? And how we should think about the incremental costs on COVID going forward for the rest of the year? And then just my follow-up would be that what was the benefit of the legal resolution in the quarter in the pharmacy business that you've noted in the results? Eva Boratto : Hi, Justin, it's Eva, I'll take that question. I think if you look at the $0.10 benefit, and we outlined this on our Slide 19. I would think about Q1, you can see the benefit really largely coming from the Retail segment, as the Other segment really had pretty modest impact, and there's some puts and takes. And I think that as you think about the margins, the investments that we've made, and that Larry outlined, a lot of those investments are largely going to hit in Q2, given the nature of those underlying investments, so think about the benefit. There are some investments but more generally in line with underlying margins as the other investments on compensation and what have you and the additional protective gear has really, really ramped as you came towards the end of the quarter. Going back to your other question on the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, you could see year-over-year we have favorability in our underlying costs. And I'm not going to explicitly break out the legal matter. But year-over-year, we had some costs last year. We had some favorability this year. So net-net it was a positive as you look at that outside growth. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Cherny of Bank of America. Michael Cherny : Good morning, and thanks for all the details so far. I want to kind of summarize a few questions you had. Larry, you went through a lot of details early on some of the benefits you're seeing tied to the increase in telehealth, tied to some of the other dynamics on the ability to deliver at home. As you think about the pause you're taking on some of the longer term, investments in long-term strategies, and particularly around HealthHUB, is there anything you're learning through this pandemic that can better educate you on how to think about to help a build out given that there are a lot of dynamics in place that would appear at this point to have people that want to stay away from the average traditional retail store versus coming into more. And so just balancing those dynamics with your approach towards having this incremental differentiated front end healthcare service at a time where the entire world is rethinking how much time they want to spend outside their house. Larry Merlo : Yes. Mike, it's a great question. And I touched on this a bit earlier that what we're seeing -- we see validating our strategy and we talked about some of the used cases that we're seeing play out and whether it's home delivery, telemedicine, and I'll touch one that absolutely is in the community and that's testing. So, Mike, when you think about, we call it our triad of care, in the community, in the home, in the palm of your hand. Think about that as what we're defining here is omni-channel for health, and each one plays a role. But as individuals, we'll need all three in terms of what we do, when we do it, and how we do it. And so back to your question, the learnings and the experience that we're seeing; number one, it validates our strategy; number two, we're working to further optimize what we're seeing to become part of an everyday routine. And I'll speak to the role of testing in the community as being an important part of diagnostics that, yes, we're focused on COVID testing today. But there's a broader universe of diagnostics and monitoring that we see becoming an important part of our HealthHUB strategy. So we're evaluating all of the products and services roadmap, and I'm sure you're going to see us accelerate some of the things that are on our drawing board as a result of what we're experiencing. Operator : Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe of Citi. Ralph Giacobbe : I was hoping if you could bifurcate the commercial risk membership decline between economic factors versus either loss or just shift to ASO. And then how you're viewing the economic backdrop specifically as it relates to the commercial market? And then just a follow up to that, is there any greater appetite to get back into the exchanges in a bigger way at this point? Thanks. Karen Lynch : Hi, Ralph, it's Karen. Relative to membership, we lost two very large folks in labor cases and they were fully insured cases, which is really reflecting the decrease in overall membership. And on a year-over-year basis as you know, we have been -- we also have a decline -- a small decline in small group. And as you know we've been pushing on small group to move it from insurer to ASO. We continue to see those trends. Relative to the question on unemployment in the last six weeks, we do expect to see declines in the latter half of the year. We already are seeing some membership decline in April in our commercial book as a result of the economic downturn. However, we are seeing an increase in our Medicaid membership as well in April. So that's really what we're doing. But we do except depending on what how this plays out and the duration of this, that we'll continue to see decreases in our commercial book. Ralph Giacobbe : And then the exchanges? Karen Lynch : The exchanges, as you know we are -- exchanges today, it's something that we\u2019re continuing to evaluate and we'll continue to look at it, we obviously won\u2019t be in 2021. Operator : Our next question is from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. George Hill : I have two. First for Eva. I'm wondering, if you can unpack the PBM performance a little bit, maybe talk about the benefit of the improved purchasing economics and the cost savings versus lapping Ingenio planning and the negative impact of rebate guarantees? And then I guess a follow-up for Larry, strategically. I guess, how are you thinking about home delivery versus mail, you talked a little bit about the retail attachment rate. Walmart is launching a two hour free service. I guess do you see this as an answer for CVS to challenge kind of the inclusion of online into retail? Eva Boratto : So George, I'll start with your question around the PBM. Obviously, as you look at the first quarter growth, right, it's outsized relative to how we spoke about the full year prior to COVID. But I think as you look at that in relation, right, the Q1 operating income growth is above what we would think about as a full year, given the specialty benefits that Alan spoke about earlier, disproportionately benefiting Q1, as we have the annualization of some generics and the new sales initiatives that Alan spoke about. We also had some timing related to other accruals. At the core though, specialty is performing very well. On the rebate headwind I would say we continue to manage that and the shape of the curve that I've described numerous times that 2019 was the peak, it would come down in '20 and diminish in -- or be de minimis in 2021, that continues. So that continues to be a benefit as well as just cost management and benefit from integration synergies. Larry Merlo : And then George on your home delivery question. George, think about the discussions we've been having probably for the last year in terms of how do we make sure we don't leave any white space for disruption. And we started home delivery in a few markets and I think it was last fall where we expanded it coast to coast. So George you think today about, you can pick up your prescription inside the store in most of our stores through the drive-through, in the mailbox, at the front door or at the office and we're experimenting with UPS in terms of maybe on the lawn through a drone. So it's -- who do you want to be in terms of what makes the most sense for you from a convenience and access point of view in any given point in time. And when you look at our integrated model, we can satisfy all avenues of access and convenience. Jon Roberts : And George, this is Jon. The only thing I would add to that is the reason our home delivery program was so successful as this pandemic took hold is, we have 70% of our retail customers engage digitally. So it was very easy for them to make that transition. So I think that will help us as people decide how they want to get their prescriptions in the future. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Ransom of Raymond James. John Ransom : I was wondering and for Karen, what the medical loss ratio would have looked like in the first quarter without COVID? Karen Lynch : COVID had minimal impact on the quarter. So if you look at that loss ratio it's minimal. Obviously, it will have a big impact in April as we're continuing to see state utilizations up. John Ransom : My follow-up is, when we look at the commercial marketplace, you're able to combine Aetna and the PBM and single package. Do you think that we would see more, what I would call cross subsidization as you go to market, i.e., maybe using guaranteed rebates or some other such things, such that the margin in the two businesses is less and less relevant as you sell them as a single package? Karen Lynch : Yes, when we do that today we obviously will price the whole case and we'll look at the whole case and price it to get a margin that we want to get on that total case. So we would not necessarily subsidize the month or the other. We look at the whole case and what we want write it at. Eva Boratto : And Karen just to add to that, right, we'll look at the value that can be generated across the enterprise as we move forward. Operator : Our next question is from Lance Wilkes of Bernstein. Lance Wilkes : And again, thanks a lot for everything that the CVS team is doing out there in the community. Just wanted to talk on HealthHUB a little bit and wanted to focus on two particular aspects. One is, if you could talk a little bit about how telehealth is integrated in or how separate it is within the MinuteClinic and now the HealthHUB structures? And what your thoughts are going forward with that? And I guess the follow-up is, given some of the instability in the physician practice and urgent care environment today, with the drop-off in volumes. Those are going to become much more significant acquisition targets going forward. Is acquisition an important part of how you're going to build-out capabilities as you look at HealthHUB and maybe the expanded care delivery at retail? Jon Roberts : Yes, Lance, this is Jon. I'll take telehealth and MinuteClinic. So we have the capabilities to do telehealth in MinuteClinic in every state that we operate in. And Larry spoke about the significant increase, I think it was 600% in telehealth visits. So it's going to be an integral part of how we go-to-market moving forward. And we just got some recent consumer research and that compares last year consumer sentiment to this year's consumer sentiment and this is one example, where would they prefer to get their flu vaccines? And we saw a significant uptick in consumers that are interested in getting their flu vaccines in their local pharmacy as opposed to the doctor's office. So it's a good example how MinuteClinic will be able to provide services like that plus telehealth and provide the convenience and choice that consumers are looking for. Lance Wilkes : And just on the -- on how you're looking at maybe the opportunities that could present themselves with respect to the practices that are out there. And I guess a follow-up on the telehealth, are you actually having telehealth deployed using the MinuteClinic clinicians or is it in the centralized format? Jon Roberts : Yes Lance, we actually have both where the telehealth is integrated with MinuteClinic as well as telehealth with physician is accessed through our digital applications. And we talked about the percent increase, anything about 60,000 telehealth engagements on a daily basis, which is a dramatic increase as well. And it's not just one of the things we were looking at. Is it COVID related? And the answer is no, we're seeing an increase in, I'll say PCP utilization as well as an increase in, let's call it, behavioral health concerns and other type of specialist services. So we do believe that it plays a complementary role to what we're doing with our HealthHUBs and it brings us right back to community home in hand. Larry Merlo : We'll take -- we've got time for two more questions, please. Operator : Certainly. We'll take a question from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. A.J. Rice : Glad to hear everyone's safe. I appreciate all the comments that were made about the economic impact on the Health Benefits business. I wonder if we could broaden it out. Obviously, it's been 10 years since the last economic downturn. How does-- how do you think the other businesses respond and how are they may be positioned differently today versus the last time we went into an economic downturn? Larry Merlo : Yes, A.J., it's Larry. A.J., look, it's probably premature and a difficult comparison because to your point, a lot has changed over the last 10 to 12 years. And there are still an awful lot of uncertainties as to where we're going to be in the latter part of this year. I will say the nature of our business is to a degree recession-resistant. I wouldn't describe us as recession-proof and whether it's what you're looking at around the role of our retail asset and you think about our strategy that we've talked a lot about the triad of community home in the hand, and the fact that as you think about the provision of health care in a more challenging economic environment, cost will become a bigger issue and we believe that we have the assets and the capabilities when you think about the cost associated with care provision and the offerings that we have with our integrated model. Eva Boratto : And Larry, if I could just add A.J as you, looking back at the past this is an unprecedented situation and so many unknowns. But as Larry highlighted, where difference is, is we have a lot of diversified assets. Karen got some questions on Medicaid. In our PBM we have a very large Medicaid. We have a very large Medicaid, you saw and you heard in Larry's prepared remarks around the health services that we're offering and expanding and accelerating some of our diagnostic testing. So there is a tremendous amount of moving pieces. And we're going to work to really drive -- to drive the business forward in these challenging times. Operator : We'll take our final question from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Steve Valiquette : Hopefully you can hear me okay. Just a quick follow-up question regarding the April prescription trends; I'm curious if there is any way from your analytics capabilities to determine how much of the slowdown in April is tied to the pull forward in March versus the reduction in physician visits? And you mentioned that 30% reduction in utilization of an array of healthcare services in April. Are in-person physician visits in particular down in line with that 30% or is it higher or lower from your view just separate from telehealth, obviously? Karen Lynch : Hi Steve, it's Karen. Let me just -- I'll give you some of the pieces in April relative to utilization. We saw Pharmacy about flat. We saw in-patient down over 30%; outpatient was down about 25% and our physicians were down almost 35%. And then all other, which would be our lab and our radiology and health science and services they were down about almost 50%. So in this case you could have a broad array of the pieces that contributed to the 30% reduction in utilization. Jon Roberts : And then, Steve, this is John. We saw a lot of 30 to 90-day conversions in March in Pharmacy, so that did take some prescriptions out of the April pipeline. And I would say when I talked about the new therapy starts being down, I think that is -- we think about it as being in line with physician visit. So as physician offices start open and patients start coming back we expect that volume to normalize. Larry Merlo : And Steve, the one thing that I do want to emphasize, because I'm proud of the work that we've done at CVS and quite frankly I'm proud of the work that our industry has done. The continuity of the pharmaceutical supply chain is not something that you've seen a lot in the news and everyone has worked hard to make sure those with chronic disease are staying adherent to their medications and not compounding this problem that we have today with COVID with another problem that would just gridlock our health care system. So it's really been a job well done in that regard. Larry Merlo : So with that, let me just wrap up and again, we're very pleased with our underlying business performance in the quarter. We believe, as you've heard from the dialog we've had in the Q&A that our integrated innovation-driven healthcare model is proving to benefit participants across the healthcare system in these unprecedented times and it will continue to do so, both through the crisis and well into the future. And we remain focused on growing CVS as an integrated healthcare enterprise and we'll continue to invest for sustainable long-term growth. So thanks again for joining us this morning and please stay safe and healthy and we'll talk to you soon. Operator : This does conclude today's CVS Health first quarter 2020 earnings call and webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow CVS Health's prepared remarks at which point we will review instructions on how to ask your questions. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Valerie Haertel : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the CVS Health second quarter 2020 earnings call. I am joined this morning by Larry Merlo, President and CEO; and Eva Boratto, Executive Vice President and CFO. Following our prepared remarks, we'll host a question-and-answer session that will include Jon Roberts, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Karen Lynch, Executive Vice President and President of Aetna; and Alan Lotvin, Executive Vice President and President of Caremark. In order to provide more people with the chance to ask a question during the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up. In addition to this call, our press release and Form 10-Q, we have posted a slide presentation to our website. Please note that during this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views, including our financial projections and statements related to our future financial performance, future events, industry and market conditions, and the future impact of COVID-19 on our enterprise. Our forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections and are subject to significant uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond CVS Health's control, including the future impact of COVID-19 on our enterprise. We strongly encourage you to review the information we filed with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties, in particular those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements and risk factor disclosures in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Cautionary Statements Concerning Forward-Looking Statements in this morning's earnings press release. During this call, we'll use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance and financial conditions. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in this morning's earnings release and the reconciliation document posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being broadcast on our website where it will be archived for one year. Now, I'll turn the call over to Larry. Larry Merlo : Thanks, Valerie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. I don\u2019t have to tell you that this past quarter is unparalleled and unprecedented as we navigate the health, social and economic impacts of COVID-19. Having said that, our earnings in this environment, demonstrate the strength in our strategy, and the power of our diversified business model. The environment surrounding COVID-19 is accelerating our transformation and it is providing new opportunities to demonstrate the power of our integrated offerings and the ability to deliver care to the consumer in the community, in the home, and in the palm of their hand. The pandemic has made it a necessity to contribute in ways that have called on the capabilities, expertise, and footprint of many of our assets in combination to rapidly deliver solutions at scale that meet client and consumer needs and preferences. Now those of you who been following us for some time, know that CVS health is much more than just your corner drugstore. And in this era of COVID our strategy of diverse assets across healthcare, this triad of care where connections are delivered in the community, at home and in the palm of your hand could not be more important. We have substantially expanded our community reach, which has proven to demonstrate the value of bringing differentiated assets and delivery mechanisms to bear, meeting consumer needs and delivering lower cost, high-value care and nationwide testing, which we'll talk about in depth in just a moment. Increasingly, the power of our assets is taking us into areas that provide greater choice, as well as new areas for growth, ranging from diagnostic testing to B2B solutions, to the potential of clinical trial, recruitment and enrollment. The results we share with you today underscores that our strategy is right, that it's working, and the COVID-19 is driving us to bend our innovation curve markedly and accelerate solutions that will have long-term sustainability. There are numerous interdependencies in our three core businesses that the pandemic has made more apparent, driving the strength in our diversification while bringing new solutions to market. So with that, let me summarize our second quarter results and the proactive steps we have taken in light of the pandemic as our team has shown great flexibility and responsiveness adapting quickly to our clients and consumers' evolving needs. For the second quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased to $2.64 with total revenues of $65.3 billion. Our consolidated enterprise core performance was in line with our expectations and our results reflect the very impacts of COVID-19 across our business. Eva Boratto : Thanks, Larry, and good morning everyone. Echoing Larry, these are certainly unprecedented times for all. We have been on the frontline supporting our local communities while continuing to advance our key strategic priorities, including product and service innovation, the delivery of integration synergies and cost savings initiatives. Looking at our second quarter performance, the diversity of our portfolio of assets enabled our enterprise to exceed our expectations. During the quarter we generated $7.1 billion of cash from operations, reflecting the underlying performance, as well as the impact of the deferral of certain tax payments in connection with COVID-19 related extensions of payment deadlines. In July, we repaid $2.75 billion of scheduled debt principle and we remain committed to achieving our low three times target leverage ratio in 2022. We also returned approximately $660million to shareholders through cash dividends In the third quarter, we completed the sale of our workers compensation business for $850 million in gross proceeds in our Health Care Benefits segment. This divestiture is expected to be about a $0.02 drag on adjusted EPS in the remainder of 2020, which is included in the guidance we have provided this morning. As I've said previously, we remain laser focused on delivering long-term value. In support of that focus we are continuing to evaluate and assess all aspects of the Enterprise to identify areas that may not be consistent with our long-term strategic priorities. Moving to the P&L, consolidated revenues of $65.3 billion increased 3% year-over-year with growth primarily coming from the Health Care Benefits and Retail/Long-Term Care segments. Adjusted EPS grew to $2.64, with the majority of our growth attributable to the Health Care Benefits segment, which saw an unprecedented decline in utilization due to the pandemic. Our Retail/Long-Term Care segment was affected by substantial investments made at our stores, colleagues and consumers, a reduction in new therapy prescriptions due to lower provider visits and reduced front store traffic. The Pharmacy Services segment continues to execute and deliver underlying core growth in the quarter. The total favorable impact of COVID-19 on our second quarter results is estimated to be $0.70 to $0.80. Let's turn to operating results by segments. In our Health Care Benefits segment total revenues increased 6.1% year-over-year, primarily driven by membership growth in our government products. Adjusted operating income increased substantially, reflecting an unprecedented MBR of 70.3%, primarily driven by a reduction in benefits costs related to the deferral of elective procedures and other discretionary utilization. The results include investments made in our customers and members, and provisions for potential payments to clients and plan sponsors for contractual and regulatory requirements, as well as support for our providers. The total quarter impact of COVID-19 on HCB operating income is estimated to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. Our medical membership grew by 124,000 lives sequentially, driven by the continued strength of our government products, partially offset by a decline in our commercial products. We are extremely pleased with the continued success of Medicare Advantage which grew membership 2.6% sequentially. Growing Medicare Advantage is one of our key strategic priorities. We believe that our integrated assets which enable differentiated clients service capabilities will continue to support our high star ratings, giving us competitive advantages and resulting in our ability to continue to win new members in this space. Additionally in Medicare Part D, we are pleased with the preliminary benchmark results received from CMS for the 2021 plan year, where we qualified in 33 of 34 regions. This is an important enabler of our overall Medicare growth strategy. Our Medicaid membership grew 4.9% sequentially as states responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by suspending eligibility redeterminations, and we saw some uptick due to increases in unemployment. We continue to view Medicaid as a focus area with a strong pipeline of opportunities headed into 2021. Commercial membership declined approximately 0.5% sequentially, reflecting the impact of unemployment. As we've mentioned previously, our employer sponsor portfolio is diversified and does not have a significant concentration in anyone industry or geography. Base claims payable were 57 days for Q2, reflecting the depressed utilization we saw largely in April and May as a result of shelter in place orders from COVID-19. A significant portion of the quarter and medical claims liability includes June dates of service where utilization was near normalized levels. We expect days claims payable to decline as utilization returns to more normal levels. Within Pharmacy Services total revenues were essentially flat year-over-year as growth in Specialty Pharmacy and brand inflation were largely offset by the previously disclosed client losses and continued price compression. Caremark customers continue to recognize CVS Health as a leader in specialty medication cost and utilization management. As a result, second quarter Specialty Pharmacy revenues, increased approximately 15% year-over-year, reflecting new client and existing channel growth. Pharmacy services adjusted operating income increased 2.4%, and gross margins improved slightly versus last year. Overall COVID-19 unfavorably affected operating income by approximately $50 million, reflecting lower news therapy starts and higher operating costs. PBM performance reflects the growth in specialty, I mentioned previously, and continued improvement in purchasing economics. Our scale and expertise, including benefits from Red Oak and our ability to negotiate with manufacturers, enabled us to deliver optimal value to our clients in CVS Health. Our pharmacy services membership remains in line with expectations as reductions in commercial were more than offset by increases in Medicaid, given our strong position in the marketplace. Additionally, to further assist our clients in the second quarter, CVS Health launched Zinc Health Services, allowing us to deliver new innovative ways to further reduce the cost of brands and specialty drugs. This new entity will be responsible for certain negotiations with manufacturers, but will not make any formulary decisions. While we have continuously worked with industry pharmaceutical manufacturing leaders to lower cost and deliver greater savings, this new approach will give us even greater flexibility and agility to continue in those efforts. This approach will ultimately help make medications more affordable for our clients and members. Shifting to the Pharmacy Services 2021 selling season, our renewals are now approximately 90% complete with a strong 98% retention rate. Today, we have won $4.3 billion in gross new business for 2021 and we continue to increase our pharmacy penetration within the Aetna book of business with approximately $250 in incremental revenue. We are very pleased with these results. Moving to Retail/Long-Term Care, COVID-19 continued to have a significant impact on this segment's performance in the quarter. Despite the challenging environment, total revenues grew 1% year-over-year. Growth was dampened by lower prescription and front store volume due to lower provider visits and stay at home orders in Q2. Front store revenue declined due to reduced store traffic partially offset by an increase in basket size. As the quarter progressed, we saw improvement in sales as store traffic began to return as states relaxed their stay at home orders. Gross margins for the segment declined 240 basis points versus 2019. Nearly half of the decline was attributable to purchasing patterns in the front store as well as drug mix largely as a result of COVID-19. Also contributing to the decline was the ongoing pharmacy reimbursement pressure. Front store margins were relatively consistent with prior year. In the quarter, the segment incurred approximately $240 million in COVID-related investments, due to colleague benefits, providing free home delivery to help keep patients stay on their medications, providing protective equipment and enhanced cleaning to keep both our colleagues and consumers safe. Overall, we estimate the impact of COVID to Retail/Long-Term Care results in Q2 of approximately $525 to $575 million. Going below the line our interest expense was $765 million, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% for Q2. The lower tax rate contributed about $0.10 to Q2 earnings reflecting favorable resolution of several state and local income tax matters. Given the highly unusual and fluid environment in which we are continuing to operate, let me quickly provide an update on some key metrics including July. Within the Pharmacy Services and Retail/Long-Term Care segments, we saw prescription volume growth accelerate in June, as members refilled 90-day prescriptions from March. In June, front store growth started to benefit from states reopening, followed by customers stocking up on key preventative and treatment items in the Sunbelt states during July. In Healthcare Benefits, medical cost utilization, largely returned back to normal levels in June and July, but obviously varies by geography and lines of business. Moving to guidance, while acknowledging the inherent and unprecedented uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and its impact on us, we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $7.14 to $7.27 to reflect the favorability in the tax rate we experienced in the quarter. In addition, we are increasing our full-year 2020 cash flow guidance to $11 to $11.5 billion, reflecting the timing of the payments of certain liabilities. So our cash from operations reached $10.4 billion through the first six months of 2020, we expect higher payments in the second half of the year. Those payments include among others, projected increase in medical costs, costs related to COVID-19, the 2020  and the estimated income tax payments normally do in the second quarter that were extended to July. We remain committed to reducing our debt as initially planned and we are on track to meet our deleveraging target of low three times in 2022. Let me provide additional commentary by segment and on the cadence of our adjusted earnings per share guidance. We expect approximately $2 billion of COVID-19 related investments for the year, of which about 40% was incurred in Q2. Approximately $1.5 billion of the $2 billion will impact HCB benefiting customers, members, including premium credits, minimum MLR rebates and contractual requirements. About 35% was reflected in HCB's Q2 results. For Retail/Long-Term Care, we expect approximately $400 million of investments with $240 million reflected in Q2. Clearly, the timing of these investments will affect the earnings cadence for the back half of the year. Furthermore, in our Health Care Benefits segment, we expect membership to be affected by unemployment as well as the loss of a large public and labor ASC customer effective September 1st. We also expect to continue to see increases in Medicaid membership as a result of the current economic environment. We expect utilization in the back half of the year to remain at more normal levels with select geographies continuing to be affected by COVID-19 waves. In addition, we expect higher costs related to COVID-19 testing and treatment. Turning to the Pharmacy Services segment, we expect the business to continue to deliver growth in the second half of the year, reflecting strong specialty performance the continued strength of our assets positioned in the industry, and continued execution of our strategy. And finally in Retail/Long-Term Care, we expect the back part of the year to be affected by the COVID-19 G&A expenses and to benefit from our testing capabilities. Additionally, we expect gross margins in the second half of the year in line with our year-to-date results improving for our second quarter performance. We remain confident in delivering $800 million to $900 million in integration synergies, and our cost savings initiatives remain on track to deliver $450 million to $550 million. In summary, our financial resilience through this period reflects the effects of successful integration of our enterprise. Our ability to deliver results in this dynamic environment is evidence of the strength of our diversified model. We are continuing to make progress on our strategic plan to deliver new products and services, all while making healthcare more affordable and accessible. Our continued execution and strong cash generation are propelling us toward achieving our long-term sustainable growth. With that, let's open it up for your questions. Operator :  We'll take our first question from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Yes, good morning guys, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Larry, the COVID crisis has kind of reshaped the care delivery model pretty dramatically in the last three to four months. You've talked about how it's impacted the HealthHUB strategy. I guess, can you talk a little bit about how you think about through the Aetna business, kind of engaging the care delivery model and to the change how do you think about the whitespace in what you want to own and what you don't want to own? And Eva alluded to that a little bit and kind of the portfolio process, but we'd just love to hear how the COVID crisis is changing how you think about the delivery model and what pieces you want to own? Thank you. Larry Merlo : Yes, George good morning, thanks for the question. And George, maybe I'll start with I think all of what we're seeing is, I'll call it the acceleration of omnichannel for health. And I would describe that as speaking to care being delivered in multiple and nontraditional settings. And I think we're going to see a new value proposition emerged that is going to be based on the elements of convenience cost, quality and trust. So, George, I would say direct to your question, obviously there is a technology component to that and you've heard in our prepared remarks, care in the community, in the home, and the palm of your hand, obviously that speaks to what we've seen around the acceleration of virtual care and telemedicine. And I think it opens up the door for a greater acceptance of remote monitoring through technology and that speaks to care from the comfort of your home. Then there is care in the community and think about what we talked about this morning around, testing, the broader opportunity that that creates with diagnostics, vaccines, immunizations. You start thinking about the role of the pharmacist and nurse practitioner in what we have seen over the last several months with regulations being relaxed that has allowed them to perform to a higher level to the top of their license. So, you start thinking about, why go backwards, when it's more convenient, less costly and administered by someone that they know and trust and look it also speaks to why retail does matter and the importance of our strategy of pivoting, our retail asset in offering more health services at retail. And then so it is just related to that, it's a little indirect to your question, but I think we see some of the other changes on the horizon as we've got to have a more integrated approach to behavioral and physical health. And we're seeing way too many examples of people feeling the stress, the anxiety of everything going on, and this is an area of health that cannot be ignored and we have to do better. And finally, George, yes, we've talked a lot over the last several years about payment reform value based care. We see the challenges that providers are experiencing economically and will the pandemic be the spark that really accelerates more rapid growth of value based reimbursement and care. George Hill : Larry, that's great color. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Thank you so much for the question. I wanted to ask a question on the retail side. Clearly, there is a lot of moving pieces in this specific quarter extra normal I think wouldn't do the term justice. As you think about the incremental investments that you're making now, how much of the new procedures, new cleaning process, staffing dynamics that you have in place, are the type of investments that might continue on a long-term basis and how does that factor into the thought process and framework you had about where retail in particular should grow into 2021 and beyond? Jon Roberts : Yes, Mike, this is Jon. So, we do expect these enhanced cleaning procedures to continue for the foreseeable future and I think that's until we get a vaccine and COVID essentially goes away. As Larry said, we're making a significant pivot to healthcare services, whether it be the COVID testing we're doing, we're gearing up for a pretty significant flu vaccine season, and the repositioning of our retail footprint in the HealthHUBs supports that healthcare services move. So we view it as evolving to higher margin health care services as we move forward. Michael Cherny : Thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes, hi, good morning. Thank you for the comment on the testing in the vaccine. I just wanted to dig a little deeper into that. Can you give us a little bit of color on the revenue model that is associated with the testing, the turnaround time that you're seeing? And then on the vaccine side, when we talk about first in the flu early new season, are you - what type of magnitude are you expecting to see in terms of demand for flu vaccine? And if you can just share more on your role on the COVID-19 vaccine administration and what conversations you are having with manufacturers? We're getting a lot of questions from investors on the setting for vaccine administration. So I'd love to get your insights on that? Thank you. Larry Merlo : Yes, Ricky, good morning. It's Larry and Ricky, I'll start and then ask - flip it over to Eva to take the economic side of your question. And Ricky, maybe I'll start with the seasonal flu and look, we expect to administer up to $18 million seasonal flu vaccines this fall, which is more than what we have administered in the last few years. We think that for obvious reasons, there is going to be an increased demand. You're going to see a lot of PSAs out there largely sponsored by the government at both the federal and state level. And Ricky, when you think about it, the symptoms of the seasonal flu mimic the symptoms of COVID-19. And the importance of the seasonal flu vaccine is never going to be more important this year than any other prior year because we've got to try to separate that dynamic in terms of what are we talking about. If I shift Ricky to the vaccine, we are having discussions with the administration in terms of the role that we can play and there is absolutely an important role for us to play. And Ricky, some of this goes back, I'll go back 10 plus years with H1N1 that pharmacy became the local solution to administer vaccines to millions of Americans across the country, that is not lost on the administration. And Ricky, I think what is unique for us is, this is where the intersection of testing in vaccine creates a sustainable business model, because I couldn't be prouder of the work of our CVS colleagues and standing up the testing business in 1800 drive-through locations in a matter of a few weeks, and we've also used our digital capabilities as you heard in our prepared remarks, where customers can actually schedule - are required to schedule an appointment to get the test. So you don't see six, eight hours of cars backed up trying to get a test in one of our drive-through sites and we can bring that same digital and technology capability to scheduling vaccines when they become available. So, I think we're in a great place there to be an important part of the solution and I'll flip it over to Eva on the testing economics. Eva Boratto : Yes, good morning, Ricky. I would say, overall as you think about testing and our economics, think about it in the margin range of diagnostics and typical testing. Larry Merlo : And Ricky, I think you had a question in there in terms of what the country has experienced around testing turnaround times and I'll just quickly comment on that. If you heard in our prepared remarks, we've administered about 2 million tests to date. The turnaround times through the months of May and June were in that three-day range and coming out of the July 4th holiday, we did see a spike in testing demand as well as a spike in the turnaround time. We took immediate actions. The first thing we did was actually reduce the number of tests we were doing on a daily basis by 25% in working with the labs as they were working to increase their capacity. We've also added two additional labs to our testing of back office if you will, okay, where they are producing the results. And as we sit today, we have seen a dramatic improvement from where we were coming out of that July holiday. There is still some additional improvement that needs to be made by one of the labs. Okay? And at the same time, Ricky, we talked about our Return Ready testing with our B2B clients. We're utilizing as you heard in our remarks, the point-of-care testing diagnostics and we're also working to pivot some of our retail sites to more point-of-care testing, and we're currently working with the administration in terms of creating the reimbursement codes that don't exist today for that type of retail testing. So, I think that's going to be important as a country where we're testing about 17 million people a month. If you look at the experts, they are saying there is going to be an increased need in the fall timeframe of the 26 million to 28 million tests per month range and more point-of-care testing is going to be an important part of that solution. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you, very helpful. Operator : Our next question is from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you, Eric Percher and Josh Raskin here. Can you quantify some of the impact of the $1.5 billion in investment for COVID in HCB? And I guess specifically I'd be interested in mandatory rebates and items like that versus voluntary investment? Eva Boratto : Good morning, Eric. It's Eva and I'll take that question. First, let me define what's in that investment at the company level. Overall, as we look at the investments, $2 billion at the company level 1.5 for the year at HCB. These are items that are going to affect our earnings. Right? So, essentially they include operating expenses, refunds, rebates and credits to support our customers', members and clients. What I would say, we're not breaking out each of those, each of those individually, but all of those are contributing to the underlying $1.5 billion in HCB. Eric Percher : Okay. And just a follow up on something you mentioned Zinc Health, could you tell us what that is and are you partnering with others and are there any tax benefits there? Alan Lotvin : I'll start, this is Alan Lotvin, I'll start with what Zinc is and then I'll let Eva talk about the tax question. So the Zinc is an onshore entity that we created to essentially develop and extract more value out of the pharmaceutical manufacturers on behalf of our customers and clients as part of the purchasing economics that Eva has referenced a couple of times. Eva Boratto : And as Eric just to perhaps state the obvious as Alan said, it's onshore. We did not design Zinc as a tax strategy, it's around the value that we can deliver from a business perspective to our customers and CVS. Eric Percher : Thank you for that. Operator : Our next question is from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. I wanted to followup a lot of moving parts for 2020 obviously. So just wanted to get your view on kind of what the right kind of jump off number is for 2020 earnings and kind of some of the moving parts in your mind? And then thinking out to 2021 going back to Michael's question on part of the potential run rate costs in the retail business for instance, you talked about a mid-single-digit EPS growth rate. Is that still kind of - is that still the company's view and this sort of fits given everything going on any kind of color there would be helpful as well? Thanks. Eva Boratto : Good morning, Justin. Thanks for the question. In terms of the right jump off, what I would say is the reason we provided all of the transparency around the COVID related effects was to help the investment community really understand outside of COVID, how the businesses are performing. I think if you look at how we've performed at the enterprise level, through the first half of the year normalizing for COVID, right, we've been performing in line with our expectations and there's nothing around our underlying fundamentals that have taken us all far our strategy and trajectory. Justin Lake : So that would indicate that's going to bridge the strategy trajectory is the same sort of 2021 trajectory will be similar as well versus ? Larry Merlo : Yes, there's, as I said, underlying, you've got to think about how COVID is affecting, but our underlying core is in line with our expectations when we started the year, and we'll continue to work towards delivering on what we outlined at our Investor Day. Justin Lake : Great, thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Jones : Great, thanks for the questions. I guess, maybe just a followup on that, on the last question from Justin. I mean, I know it's got to be extremely difficult to parse out, what's exactly COVID related versus what is not. But it does look like in the retail business, even excluding the amount that you highlighted, that margins are still down a few hundred basis points year-over-year. Is there anything else you can parse out as far as what you're seeing from mix dynamics and maybe other areas, traditional areas like procurement, anything around cost there? And then just how you're thinking about those factors as we think about your expectation Eva for gross margins to be in line in the second half of the year-to-date results? Eva Boratto : Yes, thanks. Thanks for the question. So in terms of gross margin, let me go back a bit. In the segment margins declined about 240 basis points, as I said on my prepared remarks. About half of that, nearly half of that was what I'll call mix. So as you look at the purchasing patterns with pharmacy growing faster than front in the quarter, given the disruption by COVID, there's an impact there, as well as mix within the underlying front store basket as sales were lower in the consumer health and beauty categories, which carry a higher margin. And we also saw some drug mix impacts with new prescriptions depressed and the effects on the generic dispensing rate. I think if you look year-to-date at how retail long-term care is performing, it's performing well when you normalize for all of the different factors, obviously margins were stronger in the first quarter and we do expect them to improve in the back part of the year. Robert Jones : That's helpful and the Larry, if I could just follow up, I thought it was really interesting some of your comments on the care from the comfort of your home, and you talked about the new diabetes management program. I was wondering if maybe you could expand on that a little bit, just what the new diabetes program looks like, relative to the previous one? And then just any other comments on your digital solutions that you\u2019re developing, do you think about the evolving landscape and some of these more differentiated offerings that you're bringing to the market? Larry Merlo : Yes, Bob. Maybe just one other point just back on Avis, your question on retail that the other thing to keep in mind is, we shut off a lot of our extra care programs, as we went through the shelter in place orders. So those have been turned back on and that's another contributing factor in terms of why we would see a more normalized margin trajectory in the second half of the year. And then Bob, moving on to your question on the diabetes programs, a lot of it Bob is tied to managing the consumer, if you will, in a more holistic fashion. So, today we remotely manage their blood glucose levels with connected glucometers as one example, but we believe there's a much more broader opportunity recognizing it's just not about managing the diabetes condition, it is also managing the comorbidities that are associated with that. Okay? They go beyond diabetes is a chronic disease. And, those are things that we're going to be focused on that we believe at the end of the day are some of the real drivers in terms of bending the cost curve for those individuals and what we've seen with the pilot programs that we've done. Robert Jones : Make sense. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. So I guess with the commercial membership now only about 2% year-over-year in the second quarter, I guess I was curious to hear more about how that stacks up versus your expectations. And then are there any broad goal posts you can put around your commercial membership assumptions that are built into the guidance for the back half of 2020? Thanks. Karen Lynch : Good morning Steve, it's Karen. Relative to commercial, we had anticipated more losses in commercial than we saw in the second quarter. We do think that's related to companies doing more furloughs and eliminating jobs. However, as we turn the corner for the rest of the year, we anticipate that we'll see continued commercial losses due to unemployment as the year emerges, although what we're seeing in July is similar to what we saw, in each month of the second quarter, but you can anticipate lower membership for commercial for the latter half of the year. Eva Boratto : And Steve, obviously in terms of what actions the government could take that number could vary, right? There's uncertainty there. Steven Valiquette : Okay, just a quick follow-up just around Medicaid reimbursement adjustments. And there's some that could happen for 2020 and then some for next year. As far as the ones for 2020, any clawbacks et cetera, just curious if that's something that is material within any of your guidance assumptions for you guys or is that just kind of a rounding within the overall company as far as the guidance assumption through the 2020 in particular? Thanks. Karen Lynch : Yes, relative to 2020 it's rounding and we have factored it into the numbers that Eva gave you relative to that $1.5 billion. What I would tell you on Medicaid is, every single state that we have has already built in mechanisms to return, any additional profits, so that's all been factored in but not material. Steven Valiquette : Okay, got it. Okay, thanks. Alan Lotvin : Steven it\u2019s Alan. The one thing I would add is we have seen a reasonably significant uptick in membership within our Medicaid lives and the PBMs. So you're seeing that the shift in the demonstrated power of having a broadly diversified book. Larry Merlo : So, we'll go ahead and operator we'll take two more questions. And we know that, many of you have another call at nine and we want to be respectful to that. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Stephen Tanal with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Stephen Tanal : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. It sounds like you may have had some pretty solid wins in the National account part on the Aetna business. So I was hoping to just follow-up there and wondering how those that have contributed, if at all, and whether there's any self insured clients that have made them a central part of their network design at this stage? Eva Boratto : We - relative to National accounts to clearly give you kind of a broad perspective, our National account customers are interested in, our integrated value and our integrated story. What I would tell you, if you look at our 2021, we have sold four times more pharmacy members this time compared to last year for 2021. And we've improved our pharmacy penetration from 34% to 39%. But as I, and we also are doing a lot to be in the market relative to the HealthHUBs, but relative to National accounts, it's been, a lumpy season for us. We did see a fair amount of our customers, and RFPs pull back and defer some of their decisions until 2022. We've had very solid retention. We've had some good sales, but generally speaking, if you look to 2021, I'd say that National account membership will be flat to down, really reflecting in Group attrition from unemployment. However, on the Group Medicare side, we've had very strong retention in the high 90s, very solid sales and you can expect growth in 2021 from Group Medicare. Larry Merlo : And Steve, maybe I'll ask Alan to comment, similar question to the PBM in terms of selling season. Alan Lotvin : Yes, so on the on the selling season in general, we're about 90% through the sales season, we have a 98% retention rate as Eva said and we have $4.3 billion in gross new wins. We haven't, I'd say this season itself has been interesting and the lumpiness with COVID, but overall ending up about where we thought. The health, specifically on HealthHUBs we've seen a tremendous amount of interest in the HealthHUBs, not just from National accounts, but also from our health plan customers who want to understand how to better connect with their members in the community. So, very happy with where the sales season is right now. So and again, as I said a strong interest in the HealthHUBs. Stephen Tanal : Helpful, thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Yes, just a question on your comment on looking at non-core assets and potential strategies related to them. I just wanted to understand the performance in the Long-Term Care business, the status of the turnaround there, and if there are any other assets that are particularly in focus as non-core? Eva Boratto : Hi, Lance, it's, Eva. So let me take your second question first, right? I don't have any specific comments in terms of where we're, the things we continue to evaluate, but what you've seen us do is we divested our Brazilian operation that CVS now Workers' Comp. And, what I can tell you is, we continue to just thoroughly evaluate what's in our portfolio, how the dynamics in the marketplace are changing to make sure we're optimizing the business. In terms of Long-Term Care performance, obviously, it's been a segment that has been substantially affected by COVID. Right? As you look at the industry challenges, we've seen as an industry admissions down about 20% and facilities, some facilities continuing to not accept new patients, but not be shutdown per se. As you look at what Long-Term Care contributes to our overall bottom-line enterprise, right, it's, it's less than 2% of our overall enterprise profitability. As you look at what we're doing, we have made substantial improvements related to our service model over the last 12 months. And in Q1 of this year, we had the highest customer satisfaction score since we've been tracking this back to 2015. We're also, COVID and testing this vulnerable patient, right, we're continuing to drive opportunities there as Larry highlighted, and I would say we are aggressively managing our cost structure in this environment, and we have new leadership, leading the Long-Term Care business and we're really focused on driving improved performance here. Larry Merlo : Okay, so, with that, let me just go ahead and wrap up before we sign off here. And a big thank you, and my sincere gratitude to, our 300,000 colleagues for all of their hard work across all parts of our organization, especially those that are working the front lines. And they have just displayed incredible commitment and effort during these unprecedented times. And all of that represents our best in terms of our commitment in helping people on their path to better health and we're proud to be able to serve our communities. It's such a crucial time in our nation's history. So with that, thanks again for joining us this morning and please stay safe and healthy. Operator : And this will conclude today's CVS Health second quarter 2020 earnings call and webcast. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the CVS Health Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow CVS Health's prepared remarks at which point we will review instructions on how to ask your questions. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Valerie Haertel : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to the CVS Health third quarter 2020 earnings call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I'm Valerie Haertel, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for CVS Health. I am joined this morning by Larry Merlo, President and CEO; Eva Boratto, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Karen Lynch, Executive Vice President and President of Aetna. Our question-and-answer session will also include Jon Roberts, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Alan Lotvin, Executive Vice President and President of Caremark. We have also posted a slide presentation on our website. During this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements reflecting our current views including projections and statements related to our future performance. Our forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. You should review the information regarding these risks and uncertainties in particular, those described in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. You should also review the cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements in our earnings press release. During this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings press release and the reconciliation document posted on our website. Today's call is being broadcast on our website where it will be archived for one year. Now, I'll turn the call over to Larry. Larry Merlo : Thanks Valerie and good morning everyone and thank you for joining this morning's call. Before discussing our Q3 results, let me say a few words about this morning's news. After more than 40 years with the company and a decade as CEO, I will be retiring from CVS Health next February and I'm very pleased to share that we have chosen Karen Lynch to become CVS Health's next President and CEO effective February 1. As you know Karen is currently President of Aetna and she is ideally positioned to lead CVS Health on our ongoing journey to transform health by making it more accessible and affordable, while delivering better health outcomes. And I'll work closely with Karen and our Board of Directors to ensure a seamless transition as I remain on the Board and serve as Strategic Adviser through May of next year. Karen Lynch : Thank you, Larry. I'd like to start by thanking you and the Board of Directors for this opportunity to lead CVS Health. I have tremendous pride in our company and in the 300,000 talented colleagues who work tirelessly every day for millions of Americans. Larry Merlo : Thanks, Karen and congratulations. I also want to thank all of our CVS Health colleagues past and present, especially, our management teams with who I have been privileged to serve. I know you'll have questions for Karen, a few for me, but for now let's get down to the business of our third quarter results. And our strong Q3 demonstrates the value we're creating through the resilient, strength and flexibility of our diversified business model and underscore the impact of our transformation and growth strategies. We are accelerating elements of our strategy with innovative healthcare offerings that address the evolving consumer landscape providing both personalized and connected care that deliver better health outcomes. Importantly, as we expand our range of offerings our client and customer satisfaction metrics are at all-time highs. We continue to serve our local communities as a trusted provider of essential healthcare services and now as the leader in diagnostic testing during one of the most challenging times in our nation's history. We are working closely with local community organizations as well as federal, state and local governments to expand COVID-19 testing, especially, within traditionally underserved communities. In addition, we are pleased to have been selected to partner with the government in administering COVID vaccines when available for long-term care facilities. And our track record with COVID testing along with our experience in vaccinations have demonstrated our ability to rapidly scale services and we expect to play a significant role in all vaccination administration. Eva Boratto : Thanks Larry. I want to thank you for your leadership over the last 10 years. It's been a true pleasure to work together. I'd also like to congratulate you Karen, and I look forward to continuing to work closely with you as we enter our next chapter of growth at CVS Health. During the third quarter, we made steady progress on our strategic priorities, keeping us on our long-term growth trajectory. Our diversified assets are delivering innovative health solutions, as Larry noted, and have also provided enterprise-level resiliency through the challenging market conditions as evidenced by today's results. During the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of cash from operations, bringing our year-to-date total to $12.3 billion and we have paid down $4.75 billion of net debt in the quarter. We remain committed to achieve our low three times leverage target in 2022. We maintained our commitment to delivering solid shareholder returns through our dividend while also investing in our enterprise to support our customers during the pandemic and accelerate future growth. Our core operations performed above our expectations with the Pharmacy Services segment driving continued momentum. The quarter reflected the benefit of our successful COVID-19 diagnostic testing in retail long-term care. In addition, we had some lower medical utilization in the Health Care Benefits segment, partially offsetting the planned COVID-19 cost in both Health Care Benefits and Retail/Long-Term Care during the quarter. Turning to our operating results by segment. Our Health Care Benefits segment, total revenues increased 8.8% year-over-year, driven primarily by membership growth in our government products and the favorable impact of the reinstatement of the HIF in 2020. Adjusted operating income declined $343 million, largely reflecting the planned COVID-19-related investments, benefiting customers and members costs associated with the actions to right-size our operations and divestitures of Aetna's PDP and our workers' compensation business. Recall, Aetna's PDP was divested in 2018 in connection with the closure of the Aetna acquisition. However, we continue to retain the economics of the contracts for all of 2019, and as is typical with a PDP, the economics are greatest in the back half of the year. Transitioning to membership. Medicare Advantage grew by 1% sequentially. Growing Medicare Advantage is one of our key strategic priorities, and as Larry mentioned, we are pleased with our position in the market for the 2021 annual enrollment period. Our recently released strong Star Ratings from CMS demonstrate our commitment to maintaining best-in-class service quality and how our integrated assets are providing value to our customers. Our Medicaid membership grew 5.2% sequentially, as states responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by suspending eligibility redeterminations. Looking ahead, we have a robust pipeline of opportunities to serve this population across various states given our diversified assets and local presence. And finally, commercial membership declined 3.1% sequentially, including the previously disclosed transition of a large public and labor client. The sequential decline in membership in the third quarter was better than initially anticipated. In total medical membership declined 316,000 sequentially. Our MBR for the quarter of 84% increased 70 basis points compared to the prior year driven by COVID-19-related investments, shifts in mix of our business, as well as the effects of the Aetna PDP divestiture, partially offset by the reinstatement of the HIF Days claims payable were 49 days for Q3 lower than Q2 as utilization has returned to more normal levels. We remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. Moving to Pharmacy Services. Performance in the quarter was excellent exceeding, our expectations. Adjusted operating income increased 12.5% compared to the third quarter last year, driven primarily by improvements in purchasing economics and growth in specialty pharmacy. Total revenues declined approximately 1% versus last year, primarily driven by the previously disclosed client losses and continued price compression. The decline in revenue was partially offset by growth in specialty pharmacy of 6.5% and brand drug price inflation. Total pharmacy claims increased 3.7% in Q3, mainly driven by net new business. COVID-19 had an unfavorable impact on volume in the quarter, reflecting lower new therapy starts a trend that has continued from last quarter. Shifting to the 2021 selling season. Our renewals are now largely complete with a strong 98% retention rate. To date, we have gross new wins of $4.6 billion for 2021. And finally, our Retail/Long-Term Care segment continues to demonstrate strength in top line performance despite headwinds created by the current environment. Total revenues grew 5.9% year-over-year driven by increased prescription volume and front store sales, as well as diagnostic testing and brand inflation. Front store revenue increased 2.7%, driven primarily by consumer health sales and a higher basket size partially offset by lower foot traffic. Retail/Long-Term Care prescription volume increased 4.6% benefiting from flu vaccinations and continued adoption of patient care programs. Gross margins for the segment declined about 150 basis points versus 2019 in line with our expectation. Adjusted operating income declined 6.9% year-over-year driven by continued reimbursement pressure and lower bed census in the long-term care business. These were partially offset by increased pharmacy volume and front store volume. Impacts from COVID-19 in the quarter were not material as higher operating expenses were essentially offset by the benefit from our COVID-19 testing. Moving to other notable items on the income statement. We incurred lower interest expense as a result of our continued debt paydown and the adjusted tax rate was higher in Q3 2020 compared to Q3 2019 primarily due to the reinstatement of the HIF. As we think about our outlook for the rest of the year and 2021, we just like others are facing uncertainty as to what will happen with COVID-19. In our slides, we have again shared monthly metrics to enable you to understand the trends in our business during this unusual time. During the month of October, flu vaccinations increased versus LY. We also experienced reduced cough and cold sales in the front store and lower MinuteClinic visits and prescriptions for flu and flu-like symptoms. Medical utilization is trending generally in line with normal levels varying by geography and type of business. With that as Larry mentioned, we are raising our full year 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.35 to $7.45, to reflect the outperformance as well as the estimated unfavorable impact of COVID-19 in Q4. We remain confident in delivering savings of $800 million to $900 million from integration synergies for the full year 2020. As mentioned last quarter, we expect approximately $2 billion of COVID-related investments refunds and rebates for the year. We are also raising our full year 2020 cash flow from operations guidance to $12.75 billion to $13.25 billion. The increase reflects the underlying performance of the business as well as working capital improvements. The cash flow from operations guidance includes the October receipt of $313 million that was owed under the ACA risk corridor program. Note that, this income from this payment will be excluded from non-GAAP results. Let me share a little color on what we expect for the segments in the fourth quarter. Similar to Q3, within Health Care Benefits, we expect medical utilization to continue at more normal levels with select geographic areas affected by COVID-19 wave. The investments discussed are expected to have the greatest impact in Q4. Additionally, Health Care Benefits will incur seasonal costs during Q4 related to readiness for 1/1.  In the Pharmacy Services segment, we expect the business to continue to deliver operating income growth in the fourth quarter including strong specialty performance and higher costs associated with 1/1 readiness.  In addition to the comments noted about October the Retail/Long-Term Care segment is expected to have lower flu vaccinations for the remainder of the quarter due to the acceleration of our programs. These impacts are partially offset by continued benefits from our expanded COVID-19 testing.  As we look ahead to 2021, we have received many questions on the 2020 jump-off. I want to be clear our target remains to grow mid-single digits off our baseline and we are confident in our outlook. As we typically do the baseline removes prior year's development and net realized capital gains or losses as we do not forecast these items.  As you'd expect, we are also adjusting for the COVID-19-related activity and the workers' comp divestiture. When factoring in all of these items, I would think about our baseline as about $7.10, which is at the midpoint of our initial guidance for 2020.  In summary, our financial resilience through this period reflects the strength of our diversified portfolio of assets and our ability to deliver on expectations. We are executing on our strategic plan to do more with what we have and deliver new and innovative products and services in this dynamic environment.  We continue to demonstrate the early success of our healthcare services model. We are on a path to fundamentally change the consumer experience to make healthcare more affordable accessible and better. Our continued execution and strong cash generation are propelling us toward achieving our long-term sustainable growth.  With that let's open it up for your questions. Operator :  And we'll go first to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Let me be the first to congratulate you Larry on your retirement. It's been great working with you and to see the strategic vision that you put together for this company, so congratulations. And obviously congratulations to Karen also. I am incredibly happy to have a woman as CEO for one of our large-cap companies. So all the way around I think this is great for CVS. Larry Merlo : Thanks, Lisa. Lisa Gill : So Larry, my question, just want to understand, you gave us a lot of information today. Clearly, moving in the right direction around some of the initiatives that you've put in place. When we think about for example the HealthHUBs 450 in 30 states is there a way to think about how that has driven the performance of the enterprise or has driven the performance of those stores to get a baseline of how we think about some of these opportunities going forward?  As well as you talked about incremental chronic visits in the MinuteClinic. How do we think about those things coming together? And what are going to be the most important metrics for us to follow as we think about the progression of the company into 2021, 2022? Larry Merlo : Yes. Lisa, thanks for the question. And Lisa, as you look at the HealthHUBs today and as you look at the performance within the four walls of the store, we continue to be pleased with what we're seeing even in a COVID world. Okay, in terms of additional visits whether it's MinuteClinic, whether it's pharmacy utilization. And as we look at the front store performance, we are selling a different mix of products that -- with that comes a higher margin profile for the front store. So that's the first part of the story.  The second part of the story is really what the HealthHUBs enable across the enterprise. And as we talked last quarter, COVID did slow us down in terms of turning on all of our marketing programs and related activities. In the last, I'll say four to six weeks, we have now begun to turn those things back on along with some of the integrated products that are coming to market example of that being Aetna Connect that we talked about in our prepared remarks. So the second value creator is what the HealthHUB enables in terms of value creation that accrues somewhere else across the enterprise.  And as we begin to scale up those types of whether it's enrollment in Aetna Connected as one example along with the other products, we talked about Transform Diabetes Care and obviously Alan plays a role in terms of how that plays through the Caremark business with their clients. That's what we'll be talking about in totality, acknowledging that there's a scaling issue as those products come to market. Lisa Gill : Yes. So just as a quick follow-up I mean as we think about -- you talked about the marketing of these programs. Are we thinking about this as primarily a driver of adding to membership for Aetna whether it's in the MA programs or the commercial programs, or are you thinking Larry of this more broadly of when you think about advertisement, is it more towards the consumer, where the consumer is going to be picking some of these programs? And I'll stop there. Larry Merlo : You know what Lisa, it's a great question and it's really both. There's the general marketing to consumers in terms of the awareness of what new products and services may be available in the store; an example the countless numbers of people that suffer from sleep apnea and how we now become part of their maintenance program as you think about the products associated with that. And then equally if not more important is the second part of your question in terms of what it does in terms of attracting its \u2013 what we talked about is one of the important value creators in terms of how we can grow lives as a result of that and how those lives further penetrate the various community assets that we have in terms of higher utilization. You heard us talk about examples in our Medicare offerings for 2021, as another example that leverage those CVS community-facing capabilities. Karen Lynch : Lisa another way to think about \u2013 to add to what Larry said between Caremark and the health segment, we have 100 million members between the two of us. So if you think about those 100 million members and the opportunity we have to change our products and services to attract them to the HealthHUBs, that gives us a good opportunity for growth as well. Lisa Gill : Thank you. Operator : Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thank you, Eric and Josh here. And credit to the board on succession and congrats to Larry and to Karen. Question on PDP. The plans nationally next year had premiums of around $7. This appears to be about half of the next closest competitor. So I think the question is what is the strategy driving this? And can you show positive income in PDP on those premiums? Karen Lynch : Well, first of all, thank you. Relative to PDP, if you recall when we took over the SilverScript business, we had a very defined strategy to rebalance the product portfolio to achieve higher margins. And the second part of that strategy was to attract PDP members that we could ultimately convert to Medicare Advantage members. So as we changed the product portfolio, this year we introduced the new PDP product. We have priced it at the target margins that we believe are appropriate. The product is designed for a certain set of individuals that we believe can ultimately and will be interested in moving to Medicare Advantage. So we're pleased with where we are priced and the products and service that we're offering in PDP. Eric Percher : Thank you for that. And just on the PBM purchasing side, can you give us a little of what does that mean? And is it early for the link benefits that you spoke to last quarter? Larry Merlo : Yes. Eric, thanks for the question and the comments earlier. I'll flip it over to Alan. Alan Lotvin : Yes. So, Eric, thanks. When we think about purchasing economics it spans a broad range of activities, right? It's drug purchasing within our own pharmacy. It's retail network contracting. It's contracting with the pharmaceutical manufacturers. It's driving brand generics which is \u2013 all of those things go into purchasing economics and they're among the most important and most active parts of the organization. Eric Percher : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes, good morning and you know, Larry always appreciated your long-term vision and using your words of Karen not being afraid to make the hard decisions for the long-term opportunity and also your access and your insights. So best wishes in everything. And Karen looking forward to working with you for a very long time. My question is related to the 2021 guide. I appreciate that there are multiple variables but we now know what \u2013 CMS established reimbursement for COVID vaccine. You guys a couple of weeks ago said that \u2013 quantified how many more individuals you're going to hire to assist in that effort. How should we think about this opportunity within the 2021 growth target that you provided us, or is it an incremental and one that you will address upon a vaccine approval? Eva Boratto : Hi, Ricky, it's Eva. I'll take your question. Thanks for that. Overall, I guess where I want to start is as we look at all of the aspects of our business and all of the variables that could affect our business, we remain confident with mid-single-digit growth. And certainly in February on our year-end earnings call, we'll have more to provide there. But we believe we've made the right investments over the last several years to set us up to continue to accelerate growth. Some of the things I'd highlight are we've invested in our Star Ratings; delivering new offerings you've heard Karen and Larry talk about that, continuing to expand our diagnostic areas and things you've heard us talk about, related to the HealthHUBs and modernized and managed our underlying cost structure. So there are many moving pieces. As you can appreciate there's a lot of uncertainty as well, in terms of the timing of different aspects. But we'll come back in February providing greater detail. And I would add -- one more point Ricky, I would add is, as you've seen our business perform over the last several quarters during COVID, we have some natural offsets in our business. What is an opportunity from one side of the business may be an incremental cost for another area. So our diversified portfolio is really playing together nicely. Larry Merlo : And Ricky thanks for the comments. The only other point that I would make, in terms of -- I think what we'd like people to walk away from is -- if we told you a year ago that to-date six million people would have gone to their local CVS Pharmacy for a diagnostic test, related to some virus. We'd probably get an eyeball roll. The reality is, that's happened. And it really speaks to the strategy that we've talked about, in terms of meeting people where they are. One example of that's being in the community. So again, I think it's a very tangible proof point of our strategy coming to life in a very meaningful way. And we look forward to playing an important role in the vaccine administration, once that becomes available. And as Eva pointed out there's a lot of uncertainties. And in February, when we get to the Q4 call we'll provide a lot of context in terms of 2021 as well as the assumptions that we're making. Because -- between now and then probably all the questions won't be answered, but we'll talk about how we're thinking about it for the year. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And just a quick follow-up, as you think about the strategy. In the retail segment you highlight long-term care is still a headwind. You've been evaluating this business for a while now. So as we sit here, do you view it as strategic asset to the business, that justifies keeping it at the losses? Larry Merlo : Well Ricky, look, as we look at the challenges in long-term care, we view those as -- I'll describe them as cyclical that are directly tied to COVID. And Eva talked about, lower bed census. That continues. We think that, once the -- once COVID is behind us, that they will return to more historic levels of occupancy. And we continue to see the assisted living space, as an important element of those that we can serve. And we're continuing to look at those opportunities, as we think about what we can do today in a COVID world, okay, in terms of supporting those facilities when you think about both, testing as well as vaccine administration. And then, how that transitions in a post-COVID world. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to A.J. Rice with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. A.J. Rice: Hi everybody. And best wishes to Larry and congratulations to Karen. Just maybe to pick up on the comments that we've made around the Medicaid business in the prepared remarks, I know we're talking about the lack of re-determinations helping the enrollment growth that you're seeing there. I wonder -- one of the issues with re-determinations is people not being eligible for Medicaid and being taken off the rolls. With the underlying economic situation we have now, as you assess that, do you think that the headwind of re-determinations coming back will be less of a headwind, if the economic environment stays persistent? Because maybe more of those people will actually be eligible, and then you mentioned that there were some -- you were looking forward to RFP activity next year, any assessment of that and early discussions about rates around 2021, at Medicaid? Karen Lynch : Hi, A.J., it's Karen. Relative to the opportunities for next year, we are -- there are a number of RFPs that we are assessing that we feel that we're well positioned for. So we're excited about the integrated value and the opportunities, we think we can bring to the marketplace with all of our enterprise assets. So we're working through that. I would note that, relative to one of our contracts that is under protest. So, we're monitoring that very closely and that was a large contract. On re-determinations obviously we are monitoring that. And that has been a big part of our growth this year. Unemployment we expect to continue to see unemployment. We expect to see increases in Medicaid enrollment, as a result of that as well. So, Medicaid is an important business for us. It does have the opportunity for growth. It is strategically positioned, as an important business and we hope to continue to grow that asset. A.J. Rice: Just any thoughts on the rate outlook given some states are having budgetary pressures? Karen Lynch : Yeah. Thank you. I forget you asked that question. Yeah. Obviously the states are -- have a lot of budget concerns. In a lot of our contracts we have -- they have protection on risk corridors and we're working very closely with the states on Medicaid rates. And we've always been in the position to have conversations with them about actuarial soundness. So those are the conversations that we're having. But we do anticipate in the fourth quarter to see some impact on our Medicaid business as a result of state rate adjustments. A.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : We'll go next to Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles Rhyee : Congratulations to Larry and Karen as well. My question really goes back to a little bit on the Aetna Connected also with the HealthHUBs. I think last year, obviously, very few HealthHUBs were up and I think you guys wanted to get to a bit more of a critical mass before having it launched more directly into the Aetna membership. When I -- when you guys talk about this Aetna Connected Plan is the HealthHUB, a key part of that benefit design? Because my sense was -- back then that that was the idea moving forward is to really use HealthHUBs as a key part of the care delivery here for Aetna members to demonstrate the savings able to generate from that and then be able to maybe prioritize that going forward to sell to other plans. Just wanted to understand if that's still the idea that you're moving towards, is that in the benefit design for 2021? And just any kind of color around how that's evolving? Karen Lynch : Yeah. What we've done to drive volume into not only the HealthHUBs but our MinuteClinic is we've offered low-cost, no-cost copays. We have almost four million members in that product design today. We have started to see increase in Aetna membership in our HealthHUBs overweighting for chronic diseases. So we're pleased with what we're seeing for the benefit design, and then obviously driving utilization into MinuteClinics and the HealthHUBs. Our connected care product, which we introduced this year as well is designed to essentially leverage all of our company assets. And we're really excited, we've seen good pipeline, good interest in that that not only supports the MinuteClinics, HealthHUBs, our standard formulary, our telemedicine, our Coram business. So again we are looking at opportunities. When we develop products, we develop designs for the integrated assets of the company. Eva Boratto : And Karen if I could just add in addition to what you said as you thought about the MA designs as well. And for this year it was a smaller pilot, but we've also expanded as we look forward to 2021 incorporating the enterprise assets and the hubs. Karen Lynch : That's correct. Larry Merlo : Yes. And Charles, I alluded to this on an earlier question in terms of concentration. And we continue to believe that 1,500 hubs is the right number. I'm sure everybody can appreciate that converting HealthHUBs in a COVID world has been a challenge just from a logistics point of view. So the build-outs have been a little more difficult. We will end the year this year around 600 hubs. And as you think about 2021, and the earlier discussion -- or question around testing vaccines, we have reprioritized some capital and resources investing in those capabilities as we think about the ongoing role that testing and vaccine administration will play. So as we think about 2021, we will -- by the end of the year we will have at least 1,300 hubs. There may be some spillover to that 1,500 number into the early part of 2022 but that level of concentration certainly allows us from a sales point of view to address the multiregional and the national clients in a very differentiated way than what exists today. So most of what -- the question you were asking is more very regionally focused where we have a concentration within a particular geography. Charles Rhyee : That's helpful. And Eva if I could follow up with you real quick. Cash flow is, obviously, very strong for the full year here. If I recall, you guys have more or less said you'd probably hold off on really any meaningful share repurchase until you get the leverage down toward that three times range by 2022. If cash flow continues to come in stronger than expected, any potential to layer in a little bit of additional share repo earlier than we could assume? Eva Boratto : Thanks for that question. At this juncture what I would say is we continue to stay focused on achieving our low three times leverage ratio. And I'm extremely pleased with the cash and the focus across the company. You heard our increase in guidance was due to the underlying operations as well as the focus on working capital, and we will continue to focus to get to that target ratio while -- I'd just add while investing in the business as we've spoken about and maintaining the dividend. Valerie Haertel : Next question. Operator : We'll go next to George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Good morning guys, and thanks for taking the questions. And let me echo my congratulations to Larry and to Karen. And I'll say given the week we're in it's always good to see a peaceful transition of power so that's nice? Larry Merlo : Thanks, George. Good comment. George Hill : I guess Larry and Karen, as we think about the MinuteClinics and the HealthHUBs, one of the things we've seen coming out of the COVID crisis is that ED utilization remains sharply lower likely to the benefit of other benefits channels like retail and urgent care. I guess what I would ask is are you guys seeing anything that you can do to kind of lean into the market share shifts where people are accessing the care delivery channel? And kind of like what do you see as the best opportunity to maximize that if we look out over the next six to 12 months? Karen Lynch : So as you said, consumer behaviors have changed dramatically because of COVID and we do believe that we need to meet people where they need to be met for their care delivery having that be in our HealthHUBs and MinuteClinics, having that be through telehealth capabilities. And as we mentioned on our last call, we are building out E-Clinic capabilities so that we can certainly address when people want to have telehealth capabilities. We also see an advantage for people being in the home and we believe there's opportunities for serving members in their homes through our nurses and other services that we have yet to build out. Larry Merlo : And George the only point I would add to that is keep in mind the regulations being relaxed have enabled a lot of what Karen just alluded to. And the customer satisfaction, patient satisfaction around that is extremely high. And I am very optimistic that in a post-COVID world, we won't go backwards okay because those relaxed regulations are -- you got a high level of customer satisfaction. And in terms of what we're monitoring there's also a high level of quality associated with how the services are being provided for today. George Hill : Okay. And if I could have a real quick follow-up for Karen. I want to ask a follow-up on Eric's question. What have you guys seen to be the most effective tools for flipping PDP members to MA and keep the member from kind of making a fresh plan decision from a vendor perspective or a carrier perspective, if they want to make the PDP to MA flip? Karen Lynch : Yes. We've had tremendous success in doing that. You heard Eva earlier talk about the 40,000 members that we've moved. We really have a targeted strategy to identify those members that make the most sense. We use our marketing tools and then obviously with our broker channel have those conversations. And now with the change in the pandemic we're using a lot of digital capabilities to interact with those individuals. But we're quite pleased with the success that we've had. The product that we put in the marketplace has been very targeted and we're confident that we can continue to grow moving from PDP to MA. George Hill : That's helpful. Thank you. And congrats again guys. Karen Lynch : Next question please. Operator : We'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Lance Wilkes : Great. Certainly, congratulations to you Karen. And congratulations Larry on your tenure. I wanted to ask a question related to your go-to-market strategy and the way in which you're integrating HealthHUBs into the Aetna offerings not just as an access point of things you might be doing with care management and things like that. I was interested in how it worked going into the 2021 sales cycle, how it's looking in 2022 as well? Karen Lynch : Lance, let me comment on the national accounts. You recall that our first and foremost strategy was to deliver the medical pharmacy integration. We achieved over $300 million of additional pharmacy revenue as a result of that integration. Relative to the HealthHUBs, the MinuteClinics I think what we've done here on the benefit designs recognizing that four million people have already -- have benefit designs that support our HealthHUBs and support our MinuteClinics is truly a good indication that we -- that it's resonating. We also are working with certain national accounts on piloting where HealthHUBs would be kind of primary first place for them to go. So we have one large national account that's working with us to see how that would work. And we're excited about that possibility and then leveraging that to other national accounts. Clearly, there's other opportunities from our Caremark business and let me have Alan talk about what those are as well. Alan Lotvin : Yes. Lance, I would say as we went through the 2021 selling season, the ability to use HealthHUBs was really demonstrative of the last-mile connectivity we have into members. And so it really was a very important part of a successful sales season in differentiating the enterprise and Caremark. So we're super excited to continue to drive these sort of new tools into the Caremark book of business. The Caremark customers are very receptive very responsive to some of our early pilots with Caremark health plan. So I think this is going to be a -- continue to be a real differentiator for the Caremark organization as well. Lance Wilkes : Yes, that's great. And just a quick follow-up on -- with you moving up, Karen, to run the whole company, what are you guys thinking from leadership at Aetna? I know you've been adding talent in there. Just interested in any initial comments on that. Karen Lynch : Yes. We'll be announcing a leadership change shortly, so more news to come on that. Lance Wilkes : Thanks. Larry Merlo : Next question? Operator : We'll go next to Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Michael Cherny : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And like some of the others, Larry, best of luck in retirement. It's been a pleasure working with you. And Karen congratulations on the new role and look forward to working more closely together. So, again, best wishes to both of you. Thinking about the front end of the store. Clearly, there's been a redefining on how people are shopping, both in your stores and through some of the digital capabilities. As you think about the next three years of -- next five years, whatever the right number is, of the store-based build-out, store-based adjustments, how do you think about the changing dynamics of the types of SKUs that you want to use? And also, as well, some of the potential investments you're making on the digital side, specifically tied to front of store and the e-commerce channel, as much as you're doing some of the digital efforts on a lot of the pharmacy and, obviously, across the rest of the business? Jon Roberts : Yes. Hi, Michael, this is Jon. So, as you think about what we've done in the HealthHUBs and the SKU pivot that we did to more health and wellness products, skinning down general merchandise and we ended up taking space from the front end of the stores. And we're continuing to see an increase in sales in less space and an increase in margin. And so, we've been able to take those learnings and move that out to the balance of the stores and that will continue to happen over time. As we think about digital, our strategy is going to be anchored around the pharmacy customer and omnichannel and promoting products that are relevant to them, based on what we know about them and then allowing them to pick up their products, either at the store, through the drive-thru or sent to their home. And as you know, we have our CarePass program that we launched last year in August and we're up to 3.4 million members. And the encouraging thing is our enrollments have remained constant through COVID. And CarePass enables that free delivery. It enables them to come in and buy incremental front-store product as they participate in that program and we're seeing an additional trip from each of these members per month. And so, we're very happy with linking all of these capabilities together. Michael Cherny : Got it. And then, I know -- I don't want to get too much into 2021 guidance beyond the baseline, the dynamics that you gave. But as you think about the incremental COVID-related costs you have in the store, how should we think, at least, qualitatively about how those should transition especially against the backdrop of the potential ramping of costs tied to hopeful vaccination process? Eva Boratto : Yes. Michael, thanks for the question. As you think about the incremental operating costs, the PPE, the store cleaning and those types of areas, I would think about those on a monthly run rate in the $7-ish million range. It obviously can fluctuate depending on what's going on in a particular area in a particular market. And as Larry said earlier, we have been investing and looking in terms of the testing going forward, readiness around being a vaccine distributor and to be ready to deliver a vaccine when one comes to market. Michael Cherny : Great. Thanks. Larry Merlo : Rita, we\u2019ll take two more questions, please. Operator : Ann Hynes with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Ann Hynes : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Congratulations, Larry, on your retirement. You will be missed. And, obviously, congratulations to you Karen. I have a Washington question for you Larry. Over the past few years, the talk about removing the rebates from Medicare Part D has been a big overhang. And I feel like that's been a President Trump and Alex Azar issue. And now since Biden's likely going to win and HHS and CMS will change, can you just give us a feel for how much Democrats support that policy, since it has been such a big overhang for your stock? Larry Merlo : It's a great question Ann. And look, I wouldn't say that I could answer that there is one party preoccupation with rebates. And I think, it comes back to the stories that we've told countless times in terms of the value that PBMs play in driving down the net cost of pharmaceuticals and the fact that the vast, vast majority of those rebate dollars get passed back to plan sponsors. And you'll remember when we had the great debate, as it related to the PDP program and the analytics that were done not by us, but by independent authorities that said that premiums were going to go up for seniors by as much as 25% to 30%. And yes there were a relatively small percentage of higher utilizers that would net up favorably but for more than 80% of seniors their costs were going to go up as a result. And those facts haven't changed and it's those facts that killed that rebate roll from moving forward. And if we were to sit here today and reinvigorate that debate, we would be having the same discussion that we had a few months back. Ann Hynes : All right. Great. And then also just on Biogen's Alzheimer's drug. I know we've talked about this before. But obviously the market really didn't think it was going to be approved and now there's a greater chance. I guess going into 2021, can you just talk about how this potential drug was underwritten in the managed care business? Thanks. Larry Merlo : Yes. Ann I would just say that and we'll talk more about that as we give our 2021 guidance and outlook. That drug we're still working to understand the indication in terms of -- it is our understanding that it has a very narrow indication based on the symptoms that a particular patient may present. So it's -- there's more to come on that. Karen Lynch : And I think Ann, from an underwriting perspective our actuaries always work closely with the clinical teams understanding the pipelines understanding the probabilities to factor in all of the variables to underwrite our business with the greatest level of accuracy possible. Operator : Steve Valiquette with Barclays. Steve Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Let me offer my congrats to Karen as well. And Larry you had a pretty strong track record as CEO. I think the company actually either met or exceeded the initial EPS guidance every single year since 2011 so congrats on a successful career. Just a couple of questions here for me. First the monthly medical utilization trends on Slide 18 are pretty helpful. Is there any... Valerie Haertel : Steve we lost you. Larry Merlo : Look I think where Steve was going with the question was about the utilization trends in COVID. So Karen can... Karen Lynch : Yes. Let me just comment on utilization. As we've mentioned utilization has been steadily rising since April. It does vary by segment. We have our commercial segment that is back to almost near normal levels. Our Medicare business is slightly depressed. And relative to cost categories we are continuing to see lower utilization in emergency room and inpatient, but above levels in specialty pharmacy lab and radiology. Obviously it will vary by product and by geography. And we're closely monitoring our utilization because of the COVID viruses in the certain geographies. What -- relative to elective procedures, we have seen electives come back. But again that varies by geography. We see it more depressed in areas that the virus has spiked. But overall that's where utilization is and we're monitoring it very closely. Larry Merlo : So do we have one more, since Steve got cut off. Or is he back on or? Operator : We can go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : Thanks Steve for that. Thanks for fitting me in and congrats to Larry and Karen. A couple of follow-up questions here; first on the 2021 outlook, specifically in the second quarter you talked about being on track with COVID being an uncertainty to that. Here I hadn't heard you use that language. So is it fair to think that you feel like you've got a better view on Eva, I think you said puts and takes around COVID? And do you feel like 2021 you're on track even with the puts and takes of COVID? Eva Boratto : Hi, Justin. Thanks for that question. Absolutely. We provided the baseline jump-off $7.10 right in the middle of our initial guide reflecting the underlying performance adjusting for the variables that I outlined in my prepared remarks. Additionally as I said, we remain committed and on track towards the mid-single-digit targets that we have for 2021. As you've seen quarter in quarter out, our overall enterprise has been performing, delivering on the expectations that we have set and the assets are working together to deliver on our expectations. Justin Lake : Great. Thanks for that. And then just my last follow-up on you -- on the pharmacy business, and specifically you talked about the fact that -- the monthly numbers are really great. Appreciate you, offering those each quarter. September was really strong across the pharmacy business. And I think, you said it had to do both with early flu and COVID. October, a little weaker I assume that's because of flu. I think you noted that. Can you try to delineate that for us in terms of how did flu impact September? And also, what are you seeing in terms of -- is there a number you can put around the benefits of COVID from a testing perspective that's running through the pharmacy? Thanks. Larry Merlo : Okay. Justin, it's Larry. And there's a couple of variables in play here. And if you go back to the March time frame when we saw a lot of pull-forward activity, especially with 90-day, you're going to see -- you're going to continue to see some spike. It's starting to even out, where you saw this dynamic in March, but then you saw 90 days later in June, 90 days later in September. The second dynamic that, we did see flu -- the seasonal flu vaccine, really spiked in September. We started -- we always start that program in very late August. And we ran September, where flu vaccines year-over-year were probably double what they were the prior year. Good news, people were heeding, the public service advice in terms of the importance this year of . So, as you move into October, that is beginning to normalize. So you don't see that spike continuing. And as you look at the comparison of seasonal flu year-over-year, the good news is, we do not see any outbreaks at this point even regionally of the seasonal flu. And if you compare that to last year, the seasonal flu did begin in the month of October, so that is depressing the October numbers. So hopefully that gives you some context of the variables that are in play. Larry Merlo : And with that, look, it was a long call. I know, there was an awful lot of information. We appreciate everybody joining us this morning. And I think you hear our enthusiasm for the progress that we made our Q3 results. And please stay safe, stay healthy and we'll talk to all of you soon. Operator : This concludes today's CVS Health Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call and Webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time. Have a wonderful\u2026",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to the CVS Health Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow CVS Health's prepared remarks at which point we will review instructions on how to ask your questions. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Valerie Haertel, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for CVS Health. Please go ahead. Valerie Haertel : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to the CVS Health fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. I'm Valerie Haertel, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for CVS Health. I am joined this morning by Karen Lynch, President and CEO; and Eva Boratto, Executive Vice President and CFO. Following our prepared remarks we'll host a question and answer session that will include Jon Roberts, Chief Operating Officer and Alan Lotvin, President of Caremark. Our press release and slide presentation have been posted to our website along with our annual report on form 10-K that we filed with the SEC this morning. During this call we will make certain forward-looking statements reflecting our current views related to our future financial performance, future events, industry and market conditions as well as the expected consumer benefits of our products and services and our financial projections. Our forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what may be indicated in them. We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties in particular those that are described in the cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements and risk factors section in this morning's earnings press release and included in our form 10-K. During this call we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance and financial condition. In accordance with SEC regulations you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures in this morning's earnings press release and the reconciliation document posted on the investor relations portion of our website. Today's call is being broadcast on our website where it will be archived for one year. Now I would like to turn the call over to Karen. Karen Lynch : Thank you Valerie and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Before we begin, I'd like to acknowledge Larry Merlo's leadership. He set a bold path for CVS Health to change the healthcare industry in this country. Larry did an incredible job bringing together our unique assets and establishing the foundation for our future. Our transformation over the last decade has enabled us to become the nation's leading diversified health services company. As one of the most trusted brands in America, our presence in communities across the country allows us to meet consumers where they are and becoming bigger part of their everyday health. Our unparalleled capabilities, reach, and relationship with over a hundred million people uniquely positions us to support them for every meaningful moment of health throughout their lifetime. These are unprecedented times, and our purpose to help people on their path to better health has never been more important. CVS colleagues are on the front lines every day helping millions of Americans with COVID testing and vaccines in home and virtual care services and face-to-face care in our CVS locations. We understand our responsibility to support our customers, members, and communities during these difficult times and we are delivering. I am proud of the nearly 300,000 colleagues on the CVS Health team and all that we've achieved in this past year. Turning to performance, our strong results in 2020 show that both our strategy and business model are working. We exceeded our earnings commitments while delivering 6% year-over-year adjusted EPS growth. We grew revenue 4.5% to achieve adjusted revenues of $268 billion. We delivered continued strong growth in our PBM and government services business, once again achieving solid results in Medicare Advantage. We generated strong cash flow from operations of nearly $16 billion as we continue to delever while investing in our business for future growth. We served a prominent role in supporting our customers, providers, and communities during one of the biggest public health crisis in our nation's history. We continue to progress against our strategic roadmap, and we set 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of $7.39 to $7.55 with mid-single-digit growth from our baseline. Eva will go into much more detail about our performance and our outlook. Turning to our three business segments. We delivered strong results in 2020 in the Healthcare Benefits segment. We grew total revenue by 8% for the year with increases in our government businesses partially offset by declines in our commercial business. In the fourth quarter, we saw utilization of total healthcare services in the aggregate, return to more near-normal seasonal levels as higher COVID related costs were partially offset by somewhat lower levels of traditional services. Adjusted operating income was in line with expectations. As we head into 2021, we demonstrated growth within each of our Medicare product lines in January. Overall, we are on track for another very strong year of Medicare growth. For years, we've used our voice to advocate for policies, programs, and regulations at the local, state, and national levels that support access to affordable care for all Americans. After careful consideration, we have decided to re-enter the individual public exchange market as of January 1, 2022. As the ACA has evolved, there is evidence of market stabilization and remedies to earlier structural issues. It is now time for us to participate in these markets. We will show that we can bring great value to those who seek coverage. You can expect to hear more about our exchange re-entry plans and future updates. Turning to our PBM. Our pharmacy services segment has been resilient to the pandemic. We demonstrated the value we bring to our customers and our members. We achieved strong retention rates and positive momentum in winning new business in 2021. And finally, in our Retail Long-Term Care segment, we continued to advance our clinical programs which improved medication adherence and health outcomes. We increased the level of engagement with our loyalty and subscription customers, and we also achieved high customer satisfaction results. During the last year, we delivered new market solutions and we strengthened our role as a personal and trusted healthcare partner in response to COVID-19. We pivoted and rapidly innovated to meet customer needs for COVID testing in the community. We also advanced our digital capabilities to create a seamless experience across CVS Health touch points. Today, we remain the largest community testing organization in the U.S. We've administered approximately 15 million tests at our more than 4,800 testing locations nationwide. Over 50% of these tests have been administered in communities with significant need for support according to the CDC social vulnerability index. Additionally, we launched our return-ready solution to help employers and universities as they execute their return to work and school strategies. To-date, a hundred clients have enrolled representing over 1.5 million individuals with interest continuing to grow. Such leadership enabled us to establish new relationships with approximately 8 million consumers through our COVID testing efforts. These are people who are new to CVS Health. Turning to vaccines. We've been working with the federal government on vaccine distribution readiness for several months. We were selected as one of the partners for vaccine administration and long-term care facilities. We've administered more than 3 million vaccine doses to the patients and staff in over 40,000 long-term care facilities across the country. We completed the first doses of vaccine administration in all skilled nursing facilities and will complete the second doses by the end of the month as planned. We are on track to complete both doses of vaccine administration for assisted living facilities by mid-March. This will fulfill our commitment to administer vaccines in long-term care facilities. We've also been selected as one of the national partners for the Federal Pharmacy Partnership Program. This is the linchpin of the Biden administration's plan to vaccinate 300 million Americans by the end of the summer. As part of this program, we are administering approximately 250,000 COVID immunizations across 11 states and in over 350 CVS locations each week. Early feedback from customers has been very positive on their overall experience across both our in-person and digital channels. We will continue to add stores as the vaccine supply increases. With the commitment and hard work of our employees we have the capacity to administer 20 million to 25 million doses per month depending on supply availability. Millions of new customers will engage with CVS Health for the first time through testing and vaccine administration services. We will use this opportunity to shape a health experience that demonstrates the value we bring. It will create the opportunity to expand our customer base while deepening relationships with current customers. We have made measurable and important progress with our strategy as a health services company that utilizes all our assets that integrates them for superior consumer experience and firmly addresses the total cost of care. For example, we are creating health platforms that combine local points of care, remote biometric monitoring, and access to healthcare professionals all within a personalized consumer-centric model. Our new diabetes program is an example of this. We have approximately 1.4 million members in this new program with about 50% representing integrated Caremark Aetna plan members. We've had strong reception to our fully integrated plan, the Aetna connected plan and expect to add 15 markets in 2021. Key features include zero dollar copays at MinuteClinic locations, standard formulary and use of our quorum infusion services. We deepened our pharmacy penetration in the Healthcare Benefits segment to increased cross sale of medical and pharmacy plans. This is expected to result in approximately $350 million in incremental revenue in 2021. We are bringing dialysis services into the home to better manage chronic kidney disease. This program offers a simpler more patient-centered approach. It delays the onset of end-stage renal disease reduces hospital admissions and supports people with treatment options. Our kidney program will engage a targeted cohort across businesses currently available to over 7.5 million eligible members. And finally our oncology program helps patients start on the best treatment and matches eligible patients to clinical trials. Our goal is to improve patient outcomes and lower overall costs at every point of the cancer care journey. Our program has expanded to more than 125 provider systems across 28 states covering over 30% of Aetna's insured oncology population. As we engage consumers in addressing their most prevalent, costly and complex health conditions impacting their lives we are also concentrating on expanding access to affordable quality care. We\u2019ve launched new medical benefit plans designed with low copay or no copay at MinuteClinics to offer broader access to care. We have approximately 6 million commercial and Medicare members enrolled today. In our small group product which was the first to adopt we achieved 25% greater use of MinuteClinics and CVS pharmacy retail scripts increased from 30% to 65%. This continues to strongly demonstrate the value of bringing CVS Assets together to support members across their healthcare needs. We continue to expand access through our integrated care delivery approach. We ended 2020 with just over 650 health hubs nationwide including locations in underserved communities. Health hubs are one of many channels we have to engage with consumers for their health that also complement the traditional healthcare system. We continue to expand our virtual care capabilities. We launched our E-clinic service in our MinuteClinic footprint across 33 states and in the District of Columbia. Consumers are now able to interact with nurse practitioners for comprehensive virtual care in a convenient way. Through this offering we can help customers with both episodic care and provide a longitudinal integrated care experience. We launched our virtual first primary care program. Members engage with providers virtually. They are then directed to lower cost high quality sites of care such as MinuteClinic or other face-to-face in-network provider care settings as needed. We are delivering value by creating a superior system that is centered around the consumer where they want and need healthcare. In closing, we are starting 2021 with strong momentum. We are accelerating our pace of progress to drive our consumer-centric strategy, a strategy built upon the fundamental belief that's solving consumer health needs will create value for all; our customers, our communities, our people and our shareholders. We will further develop and refine our strategy to leverage the rapid shift in healthcare underway in the U.S. trends that we are not only on top of but in many places driving. As we move forward with this work the touchstones of our strategy will remain focused in the following areas. We will demonstrate the integrated value of CVS Health's unique portfolio of products and assets. We'll enhance the consumer experience through the expansion of digital services and platforms that seamlessly connect to in-person channels. We will expand our portfolio with new innovative consumer-oriented solutions that improve health, lower medical costs while creating better health outcomes. We will continue to build a high performing organization that is passionate about our purpose that reflects the diverse populations we serve and is empowered to do the right thing the right way for consumers health and well-being. I am confident in our future in our ability to help people on their path to better health. CVS Health will lower costs, improve customer experience enhance access and be their trusted healthcare partner. Now I'll turn it over to our chief financial officer Eva Boratto. Eva Boratto : Thanks Karen and good morning everyone. As Karen stated our strong performance across the enterprise continued in the fourth quarter as we executed on our strategy during this challenging time. For the full year we delivered $7.50 adjusted earnings per share and importantly achieved over $900 million of integration synergies above the high end of our expectations. We've hit the 2021 run rate and the synergies are fully embedded in the business. During the quarter we generated $3.6 billion of cash from operations bringing our full year to $15.9 billion which is above the high end of our expectations and we paid down $2.5 billion of net debt in the quarter exiting the year at a low four times leverage ratio. Since the close of the Aetna transaction we have paid down more than $12.2 billion in net debt and remain on track with our low three times leverage ratio goal in 2022. We maintained our dividend while we also invested in our enterprise to support our colleagues and customers during the pandemic and to accelerate future growth. Looking at our fourth quarter results by segment our Healthcare Benefits segment total adjusted revenues increased 9.6% year-over-year driven by membership growth in our government products and the reinstatement of the HIF. Adjusted revenues exclude the ACA risk quarter payment received during the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income was $153 million in line with our expectations largely reflecting the planned COVID-19 related investments benefiting customers, testing and treatment costs and the divestitures of the Aetna PDP and our workers comp business. Total membership increased about 140,000 sequentially with Medicaid membership up about 90,000 as states continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by suspending eligibility redeterminations. Additionally, our Medicare portfolio continues to show growth with strong Medicare Advantage and [Med sub-membership] growth increasing sequentially about 90,000 up over 2%. These increases were partially offset by a modest sequential decrease in commercial membership of about 35,000 members driven by additional membership attrition due to COVID-19. Our adjusted MBR for the quarter excluding the ACA payment was 88.3% and in line with our expectations representing an increase of 260 basis points compared to the prior year. The higher MBR was driven by COVID-19 related investments, testing and treatment costs, the divestiture of the PDP business partially offset by the reinstatement of the HIF. Overall fourth quarter utilization was generally in line with our baseline including higher COVID-19 related costs. Days claims payable were 48 days for Q4, 2020 consistent with our Q4, \u201819 and a day lower than Q3, 2020 largely driven by pharmacy payments. We remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. Moving to Pharmacy Services, total revenues declined approximately 2% versus last year primarily driven by the previously disclosed client losses and continued price compression. The decline in revenue was partially offset by growth in specialty pharmacy of approximately 4% and brand drug price inflation. Total pharmacy claims grew 0.7% in Q4 compared to last year driven by net new business. Momentum in pharmacy services continues with adjusted operating income increasing 7.9% compared to the fourth quarter last year. Improvements in purchasing economics and the ongoing benefit to our clients and CVS Health from several generic launches and our continued success with customers in managing specialty pharmacy continues to fuel the growth. The quarter also reflected higher investments to support our successful 2021 welcome season. And finally retail long-term care total revenues grew 6.6% year-over-year driven by a 2% increase in prescription volume including strong flu immunizations as well as benefits from our diagnostic testing and brand inflation, partially offset by a 1.6% decline in front store sales. Our COVID-19 diagnostic testing program contributed nearly 400 million in the quarter. Prescription growth was driven in part by continued adoption of our patient care programs. Offsetting the growth was lower incidence of flu and flu-like illness which reduced flu related scripts nearly 40% and affected cough and cold sales in the front store by approximately 30%. Gross margins for the segment declined 140 basis points versus 2019 driven by continued reimbursement pressure and mix partially offset by testing. Adjusted operating income declined 12.6% year-over-year reflecting the items I've discussed as well as cost related to COVID-19. Moving to other items on the income statement we incurred lower interest expense as a result of our continued debt pay down and the adjusted tax rate was higher in Q4 compared to Q4, 19 primarily due to the return of the HIF. Transitioning to 2021 guidance full year adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.39 to $7.50, an increase of approximately 4% to 6% from our 2020 baseline of about $7.11 and in line with our mid single digit growth expectation. Consistent with our practice net realized capital gains or losses and prior years\u2019 development are excluded from our outlook. We expect to generate between $12 billion and $12.5 billion of cash flow from operations in 2021. This includes the impact of timing of certain payables and receivables that contributed to our 2020 outperformance. Our gross capital expenditure expectations of $2.7 billion to $3 billion is above historical levels as we expand our investments in technology and digital enhancing our app and systems workflow and we continue to invest in our health hubs. As noted over the course of 2020 there were positive and negative impacts from COVID-19, many that offset across our segments stemming from changes in consumer behavior. We are pleased with our ability to pivot to deliver the products and services in demand to drive continued growth at our enterprise as we create a better way to deliver healthcare. In 2021 COVID-19 is expected to have an immaterial impact on our adjusted earnings per share. As we have highlighted in our slides COVID-19 is expected to have a benefit to the retail long-term care segment and have an unfavorable temporal impact to the healthcare benefits segment. Importantly, we will continue to drive our enterprise cost savings initiatives which we expect to deliver between $900 billion and $1.1 billion and will ramp as we move throughout the year. Key drivers of savings include ongoing digitization of our businesses along with system technology improvements in our operations such as our call centers, real estate changes including our decision to reduce office space by about 30% resulting from COVID-19 and workforce management changes in how we are working as well as productivity and operational efficiency initiatives within each segment. We expect consolidated full-year adjusted operating income to be in the range of $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion with consolidated total revenues in the range of $276.1 billion to $280.6 billion up 3% to 4.5%. We are maintaining our shareholder dividend of $2 per share. Moving on to our segments as a result of continued strength in Medicare products we expect HCB total revenues to be in the range of $79.4 billion to $80.7 billion. Medical membership is expected to be between $23.2 million and $23.6 million medical members at the end of 2021 fueled by growth in each of our Medicare lines of business. Partially offsetting the growth in Medicare is the transition of two large Medicaid contracts. Our guidance includes an expectation that state redeterminations do not return in 2021. We believe the strength of our unmatched benefit plan designs that utilize our enterprise assets positions us well for 2021 and beyond. Within healthcare benefits we expect adjusted operating income in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. Our outlook reflects the negative impact of COVID-19 of approximately $450 million to $550 million largely attributable to the Medicare risk adjuster impacts and the recent regulatory changes from the Consolidated Appropriations Act, the removal of the HIF insurance fee which we expect to decrease 2021 adjusted operating income by approximately $175 million and strong growth in Medicare membership. Our full-year MBR is expected to be approximately 84.7% plus or minus 60 basis points which reflects the return to more normal levels of utilization. The removal of the HIF, lower risk adjusted revenue and mixed shifts in our business. In Pharmacy Services, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $144.5 billion to $147 billion driven by strong net new business of $3.3 billion, continued growth in specialty pharmacy and brand drug inflation in the mid single digit range. The 2021 selling season is largely complete and we maintained a strong 98% retention rate with gross wins of$ 4.9 billion. Adjusted operating income is expected to be within the range of $6 billion to $6.1 billion driven by continued growth in specialty and our ability to drive further improvements to purchasing economics partially offset by industry-wide price compression. Turning to retail long-term care we expect revenue of $93.8 billion to $95.1 billion. We expect strong adjusted script growth in the range of $7.25 to $9.25 driven by the continued successful execution of our Patient Care Programs, expected return of provider visits and COVID-19 vaccinations. We expect front store traffic will increase as we move throughout the year. We expect adjusted operating income to be in the range of $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion benefiting from continued pharmacy volume growth and approximately $400 million to $500 million from COVID-19. The benefit from COVID-19 reflects the positive impact of vaccines and testing related revenues, net cost associated with these programs partially offset by the adverse impacts of front store and pharmacy and our continued investments in COVID-19 related protocols. Operating income growth also continues to be unfavorably affected by reimbursement pressure. Moving to other income statement items, we expect interest expense of about $2.6 billion benefiting from the pay down of our debt and our liability management actions and our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 25% reflecting the repeal of the HIF. Finally we expect quarterly earnings cadence to be fluid over the course of the year but let me share some perspectives on Q1. Q1 is expected to be the lowest earnings quarter for the year. In Retail Long Term Care lower traffic in the front store and lower script volume has persisted into January in part due to the weaker flu season. Q1 is also impacted by investments to advance our vaccine program. Healthcare Benefits is expected to have higher earnings in the first half of the year and the lowest in the fourth quarter. Cost savings initiatives across our segments are expected to ramp over the course of the year. In summary, we continue to deliver on our financial expectations and our confidence and our ability to achieve the 2021 guidance we outlined today. We are making progress toward driving sustainable long-term growth. As Karen mentioned we are accelerating aspects of our consumer-focused strategy to meet the consumers health needs of the future. Before opening it up it for questions, I would like to take a moment to thank Valerie for our work here in investor relations. I am disappointed to see Valerie leave over the next month but am grateful for the advancements that Valerie made during the time she was with CVS Health.

I'm joined this morning by Karen Lynch, President and CEO; and Eva Boratto, Executive Vice President and CFO. Following our prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session that will include Jon Roberts, Chief Operating Officer; Alan Lotvin, President, Pharmacy Services; Dan Finke, President, Healthcare benefits; and Neil Montgomery, President of Retail and Pharmacy. Our press release and a slide presentation have been posted to our website, along with our Form 10-Q that we filed with the SEC this morning.

Today's call is being broadcast on our website, where it will be archived for one year. Now I would like to turn the call over to Karen. Karen Lynch : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. In what continues to be an unprecedented environment, CVS Health has delivered strong first quarter results. For all of us the past year has been defined by the pandemic and our response to it. In the first quarter, CVS Health orchestrated an all-out effort to vaccinate Americans against COVID-19. I\u2019m proud to say we have helped achieve the President's accelerated 100-day goal of 200 million vaccines. This would not have been possible without the dedication and effort of our approximately 300,000 colleagues who worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic and delivered when they were needed the most. Eva Boratto : Thanks, Karen, and good morning, everyone. As Karen stated, our strong performance across the enterprise continued in the first quarter. We delivered solid revenue growth of 3.5%, as a result of strong net new business, plus the expansion of our successful COVID-19 testing and vaccine programs. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.04 increased 6.8% and exceeded our expectations. Our cash flows remain strong, generating $2.9 billion of cash from operations. We paid down over $3 billion of long-term debt in the quarter, while returning $656 million to shareholders through dividends. Since the close of the Aetna transaction, we have paid down a net of more than $15 billion in long-term debt, and we remain on-track with our low three times leverage goal in 2022. We are maintaining our discipline of capital allocation strategy and managing our balance sheet to generate additional cash flows. Across the Company, we are executing on our modernization and cost savings initiatives, for which technology is at the core. As mentioned last quarter, we implemented an AI-enabled capability to efficiently address COVID-related calls. This intelligent agent addressed over eight million calls for frequently asked questions. And we are expanding this technology to call centers across the enterprise. Operator :  We will take our first question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Rivka Goldwasser : Congratulations on a very good quarter. So my question is focused on PBM segment. I mean, clearly, very strong performance, and really trying to understand the moving factors. You mentioned specialty and improved purchasing. So on the specialty side, maybe you can give us a little bit of more color on what are the specific products. It seems like you are alluding to biosimilar performance so what type of adoption you are seeing? And then also on the improved purchasing, there is a lot of questions we are getting from investors around generic pricing environment. So I wanted to see what you are seeing there. Thank you. Karen Lynch : Good morning Ricky. I will start and I will hand it off to Alan to give you more specifics. But as we mentioned, we continued to see very strong growth in the PBM business, really fueled by strong purchasing economics, the wrap of our specialty trend programs. And more importantly, we announced last week that we had really strong trend management with average trend of 2.9%, truly resonating in the marketplace. The other thing I would mention, Ricky, is that the integrated value story between medical and pharmacy continues to resonate with our employer groups, and we have had strong success there. But let me turn it over to Alan, he can give you some more detail. Alan Lotvin : Yes, good morning Ricky how are you? So as you think about kind of the economics across specialty, you sort of think about it in a couple of categories. So one is just generally improved purchasing economics across brands as well as generics, right. So that allows us to create greater value for our customers as well as meet all the obligations that we have created there. Then, successfully executing against programs that take advantage of the generics that launched late last year were also critically important, right. So we were able to drive generic dispensing rates to levels a little bit higher than I think we initially thought and that both benefits us as well as our clients. Those are the principal drivers of the economics within specialty. And then as Karen and Eva mentioned in their remarks, continuing to drive outstanding specialty trend is what allows customers to continue to choose us to manage their specialty spend as FEP did. So again, it becomes a self-reinforcing cycle. Rivka Goldwasser : Great and just a quick follow-up on the vaccine. Just to clarify, when you think about the vaccine benefit, clearly, you saw an improvement in reimbursement rates. Given that we are seeing some hesitancy around vaccine, and it seems that we might have seen a peak in growth there, are you now assuming a lower vaccine volumes for the year versus what you assumed in prior guidance? Eva Boratto : Ricky, this is Eva. I will take that one. Overall, as you said, recently, we have seen some vaccine hesitancy. We have seen a drop-off of around 30%, as you look at some of the recent data there. The additional outlook we had provided was it was about a 2% to 3% contributor to our overall volume growth. Right now, we are probably trending at the lower end of that range given performance to-date and what we are seeing in the market. In our outlook, we are assuming the pediatric vaccine. But not included in our current estimates is the impact of a booster should there be one later this year or. Katie Durant : Thanks. Next question please. Operator : We will go to Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open. Steven Valiquette : Great thanks good morning everybody. So within the HCB or Aetna segment, the MLR came in better than expected. There also seems to be some investor focus on the better than expected SG&A, which in that segment as well. So I'm curious if you can some of the operating expense. Karen Lynch : Hey Steve, we are having a hard time hearing you. So I wonder if you could speak up. Steven Valiquette : Okay. Sorry. I'm not sure what happened there, so I apologize. My question was just on the HCB retina segment. The MLR came in better than expected, but there also seem to be some investor focus on better than expected SG&A within that segment as well. So I was curious if you are able just to speak to the operating expense trends within Aetna. And also, if I missed it, if you gave the prior year development number, just to have that handy as well within HCB. Thanks. Karen Lynch : Yes. I will start, and I will hand it to Eva for prior period development. On the expenses for Aetna last year, and we continue to do this every year is to continue to look for ways to improve our overall cost efficiency. We embarked on initiatives last year using technology, looking at ways we can be more competitive. And that is reflected in the first quarter results in the segment. And as you might expect, we continue to do that across the company, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we every year continue to look at ways to become more efficient and we are really trying to harness technology to make those efficiencies real. And the health care benefit really did see the effects of that in the quarter. Eva, do you want to talk about the prior year development? Eva Boratto : Sure, Karen. Thanks. Good morning Steve. Overall, we did experience elevated prior year development in the quarter. However, when you look at it on a financial statement net basis, given the MLR MBR contractual requirements, I would say it is really not that unusual compared to prior years. Steven Valiquette : Okay. Got it, okay, thanks. Katie Durant : Thanks. Next question please. Operator : We will go now to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Karen, I want to go back to your earlier comment when you talked about behavioral health and connecting the consumer with the best site of care. Can you talk about how you are doing that specifically, how you are contracting with behavioral health specialists there - if these are psychiatrists or psychologists? And how that really feeds into a broader comment that you made around the consumer talking about the home, virtual community. How do I think about all those elements working together when we think about both mental health and physical health? Karen Lynch : Good morning Lisa. Well, I think relative to behavioral health, it is critically important for us to focus on it. The pandemic has increased the number of behavioral health interactions and I think what we have seen in the - with individuals, we have seen increases in substance abuse. We have seen increases in domestic violence, we have seen increases in depression anxiety. What we have done is we have put licensed clinical social workers in a certain number of our HealthHUB and what we are trying to do is really connect the physical health with the mental health. In every single MinuteClinic, we do behavioral health screenings, they then will be referred to our licensed clinical worker that is in the in the facility in the HealthHUB. And then we can connect with them digitally as well through our e-clinic capabilities. And we are actually seeing very strong results in this program. We are seeing three visits in a month from those individuals that have already engaged with us. So clearly, there is a need to make those connections. It is a differentiator for us and something that I believe is important as you think about mental health and physical health combining to take care of the holistic person and then meeting them where they want to be met. Quick customer story, Lisa. We had an individual reached out to us, she was trying to get into see behavioral health provider, she couldn't. And when she took her month, and then after a month, they told that it would take another month for her to get an appointment. She learned about CVS Health, and we got her in the same day. So there is definitely a need and I'm very excited about the possibilities for us to really enhance our products and services to support the holistic health of individuals. Lisa Gill : And how do we think about that like from a financial perspective, Karen? Is this that these are Aetna members, and therefore, you are going to be able to lower overall health care costs for that member because we keep them well both mentally and physically or is this a program where you are charging fees for service to other planned members? And is this going to be a big enough driver and is there an attachment rate to this? Just how do we think about some of the opportunities around that? Karen Lynch : Yes. The way to think about it and I will hand it over to Neela, it is broader than just Aetna because we have contracts with other managed care plans. So they are coming in. It is part of their insurance coverage, and that is how kind of the economics of it. Let me ask Neela to talk a little bit more in detail. Neela Montgomery : I would say that we are using insurance at the moment, and that is the main way in which people are accessing care. As Karen mentioned, access is a huge factor, and the convenience of evenings and weekends in our proposition makes it very desirable to customers. Overtime, we do expect to grow the sort of D2C fee-for-service business because we do recognize that is a large part of the market and we expect to launch that next month. Lisa Gill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Albert Rice : Just to start out, I really appreciate the comments about how Aetna is integrating with MinuteClinic and HealthHUBs for new product offerings. That seems like the principal way the three businesses are maybe integrating. But I wonder, two years into the deal, are there other things you would highlight as to why the three individual businesses are better all together and things you have realized from the deal that may be worth highlighting some people beyond that. Karen Lynch : Good morning AJ. I think there are a number of things. You mentioned MinuteClinic. I would say the integration of medical pharmacy is another area. We have also put out a number of clinical programs that we are advancing as part of the overall combination of the three companies. Our diabetes program, our chronic kidney program, our oncology program. All those programs demonstrate the value of an integrated offering where we have those programs, and we can meet people either in the MinuteClinics or we can meet them at home, and obviously manage their insurance coverage. So there are a number of different proof points. We are also leveraging technology and analytics through our next action. And then I would say our new programs like our Return Ready program is another demonstrable impact of having a combined company where we have the ability to sell our testing and our vaccine programs to our employer groups and then engage them in their sites or in our MinuteClinic. So a number of things that I would point to that demonstrates the value of the combined three companies. Albert Rice : Okay. Maybe just a quick additional question. We are seeing a lot of the companies in the sector pursue incremental service opportunities through acquisition. I know you guys are still highlighting a priority for capital deployment is just to continue to reduce debt. But how should we think about your interest in some of the service line, extension provider, extensions that we are seeing others do? Is that of interest to you how should we think about that? Karen Lynch : Yes. A.J., thank you for the question. Obviously, you mentioned our first and foremost priority is capital deployment to pay down debt. But clearly, we are looking at all of our options around additional services, as demonstrated by our virtual care offerings and things like that. But yes, that is something that would be of interest to us. And let me turn it over to Eva. Eva Boratto : Thanks, A.J, good morning. What I would add to Karen, certainly paying down our debt remains a top priority. Additionally, I would remind you that, in the outlook provided, we did provide for what I will call smaller M&A to fill out the businesses and where there are needs. And we continue to invest organically as well in terms of our CapEx spending and building out the services and capabilities to drive the business forward. Albert Rice : Okay. Thanks. Katie Durant : Thanks AJ. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Cherny : Good morning and thanks for the colors so far. I wanted to dive a little bit back into some of these sourcing dynamics that you are seeing. As you think through the component in particular on both generics and specialty, you called it out for the Pharmacy Services segment as a whole. How does that factor in across the entire enterprise and how should we think about the durability, especially given that you are easily the largest purchaser in the world of drugs on some of these ongoing sourcing efficiencies, especially in a world where generics as a whole are pretty close to 90% of the total market? Eva Boratto : Mike, it is Eva. Thanks for the question. Overall, we source our generics consistently for the entire enterprise, whether it is the Retail/Long-term Care segment or the PBM segment. And obviously, there have been some specialty generics launches that we have been able to optimize the benefit of that given our size and scale and our capabilities within the company. I would just remind you the economics of specialty manifest themselves on the PBM segment with our Specialty Connect program. And so you will see the benefits from that program there. And I think to your question around durability, right, we do see new generics continuing to come to market, availability of biosimilars to provide longer-term benefits. And Alan will provide a little bit more color on that. Alan Lotvin : Yes, Michael, if I could just add. As you know, specialty is somewhere north of 50% of the total drug spend right now. And given the evolution of the FDA around substitutability biosimilars as well as traditional generics for older small molecules, the specialty businesses is sort of entering that phase of increased competition. So as we look forward over the next two, three, four-years, we see a very robust pipeline of both generics and biosimilars and specialty, which while, to your point, the generic dispensing rate is now 90% given the dollar volume is still largely in specialty creates ongoing opportunity for us. Michael Cherny : Thanks. Just one more really quick question. I know you don't guide quarterly, but what is implied on the next year's cough/cold flu season in terms of how to think about the trajectory of the business since the end of the year? Karen Lynch : Mike, if I could predict the cough/cold season that would be a great skill to have. But what I would say is, as you look, we are assuming the economy continues to return to normal levels as people are vaccinated, what happens with the cough/cold flu season will affect the segments differently. Obviously, lower medical cost, if it is a weak cough/cold flu season again, and lower scripts on the Retail/Long-Term Care segment. So overall, I think about it at a more normal-ish level. But when there is variability, it will affect the different segments differently. Michael Cherny : Understood. Thanks. Katie Durant : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Eric Percher : Thanks you Eric and  (Ph) here. A question on the Retail segment and Pharmacy reimbursement pressure. As we enter a new year, we always see a comment on reimbursement pressure and I know that there have been strategies to drive volume or increase pharmacy services, and of course, integrated opportunities. But when you look at reimbursement pressure itself, does it remain the same type of headwind that it has over prior years and what are the strategies you have implemented that can offset that actual reimbursement pressure? Karen Lynch : Hi Eric and Josh. A couple of things on reimbursement, we recognize that this continues to be a challenge for us. And what we are currently working on are revising our contracting strategies, continuing to manage cost initiatives and clearly managing our supply chain in an appropriate way. As I mentioned on the call, we are exploring all of our options here, and I think we will have more to talk about in December. And let me just see if Eva has anything to add here. Eva Boratto : As Karen said, Eric, right, we have volume, we have cost and we have Red Oak to continue to unlock value. As you saw, we are looking on the costs front beyond the purchasing side, we are looking at ways to continue to reduce operating costs in our operations, utilizing technology and really trying to lower the cost. Eric Percher : Thank you. And on the biosimilars side, when we see the sourcing benefits, is that in part reflecting success with the new Zinc entity or does that fall into Red Oak? Alan Lotvin : So biosimilars would flow through our traditional Caremark contracting. Part of that is within Zinc and part of that is directly through Caremark, not through Red Oak. Eric Percher : Thank you. Katie Durant : Next question please. Operator : We will go now to Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Robert Jones : Hi, great. Thanks for the question. Maybe just to go back to the HCB segment and the strong performance there and the subsequent guidance raise of 150 million at the midpoint. I know there is obviously a number of moving pieces that inform the guidance. But I was hoping maybe you could just break out and talk a little bit specifically about the sequestration extension. And how maybe any updated views on utilization help inform that raise for the full-year. Eva Boratto : Good morning Bob, it is Eva. And as you said, we delivered strong performance in the quarter, and our outlook remains strong. So I will try to give you four key pieces what we reflected in that outlook. Our performance to-date and I commented earlier the benefits from prior year's development. Think about that generally on a net basis, not that different from what we have seen previous years given where MDRs were for 2020 and our client and contractual requirements. We have included sequestration through the end of the year. And as you think about medical costs, we have updated our medical cost assumptions for two areas. One, we continue to incur COVID-related costs, driven largely by testing and vaccine spend. And those costs are at lower levels than the first half of the year, given as people become immunized, the treatment costs we expect to decline. As it pertains to non-COVID utilization costs, we expect it to return to more normal seasonal baseline levels, particularly in the second half. And our outlook for membership remains consistent with what we provided previously. Robert Jones : Great that is helpful. I guess just one quick follow-up within HCB around the decision to get back into the exchanges in a more meaningful way. Any updated thoughts or latest thoughts on the strategy, kind of what the go-to-market will be? Who you will be targeting within the exchanges relative to some of the other offerings out there? That would be helpful to get your latest thoughts on that. Karen Lynch : Hi Bob, it is Karen. First, I would say, given that we are entering into the exchanges that is a market that we have 12 million to 15 million people that we don't have access to today. We are clearly going to offer an Aetna-CVS branded product. We will continue to have our narrow networks and we are in the midst of filing rates. So I don't want to give too much competitive insight or information. And let me see if Dan Finke has anything else he wants to add here. Daniel Finke : Sure. Thanks, Karen. So as Karen said, we are excited about the opportunity to enter the individual market. We are in the middle of the filings. As Karen stated, we are taking a really disciplined and deliberate approach to selecting those states. One of our opportunities is really to connect our strategies around the use of CVS assets. And so we are really looking forward to opportunities around our digital and physical assets, enhancing some of our pharmacy support with those offerings, and of course, giving access to our MinuteClinics and our HealthHUBs. And so we are really excited to bring this new and different offering to the marketplace. Katie Durant : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks good morning. First question, I just want to follow-up on the PBM outperformance. It has been pretty incredible over the last three, four, five quarters. I know your purchasing is very strong there. But not seeing the same performance at your peers. I'm wondering if there is anything you feel like you are doing differently in terms of that generic specialty opportunity, your purchasing with Zinc, et cetera, that might be allowing for that outperformance versus your peers here. Alan Lotvin : Hi it is Alan. Thank you for the question. I think the key drivers here are paying really close attention to creating competition, right, to driving more value for our customers, which enables us to bring on more volume. I think one of the things that we should also talk - let's talk about two things, right. So first is the purchasing and the performance around generics and specialty agents. The second is, we have a good portion of our business is what we would call open market where there is choice. We are very aggressive in talking about the benefits to members and patients from an experience perspective of both Specialty Connect and Specialty Expedite. And so that is, again, an example of how we use the entire enterprise to create better experiences and ultimately more value because it drives volume. So it is a combination of volume. It is a combination of attention to detail and performance on the generic side. And it is, as you said, purchasing economics that continue to drive and look for opportunities where we can create more competition to drive more value. Eva Boratto : Sorry, Justin, it is Eva. Alan, just to add your performance overall remains very strong, we had a very strong welcome season this. Year, and client satisfaction remains high, which, Justin, as you know, in the PBM sector is critical. Justin Lake : Sure. Thanks for that. And then just a quick follow-up on the transformation targets you laid out with the deal. Those are expected to be a big benefit for 2022. So I was hoping to get some any kind of updated color on HealthHUBs versus the 1,500 target. And how you feel about that transformation number of 850 as you kind of look ahead to next year. Karen Lynch : Hey Justin, I will comment on the HealthHUBs and Eva can give the transformation update. Just on HealthHUBs, we have about 800 health hubs now. We built about 250 during the quarter. We do expect to get to about 1,000-ish by the end of the year. What I would tell you, I'm not really looking at the number. I'm looking at coverage. I think coverage is the more important metric here. And right now, by the end of the year, it will be 60% coverage on the Aetna Caremark business will be about almost 50% of the U.S. population. So that is really how I think about the hubs and how we get coverage versus the exact number. Eva Boratto : And Justin, on the transformation, you heard throughout Karen's comments and some of the proof points that we brought, I would say how we are unlocking value is : A, focusing on driving medical cost savings; two, our ability to win new lives in the marketplace by having these differentiated products and services; and continuing to sell into new customers in an open market type of way. So as you look specifically, we are pleased with how transformation is running. And as Karen said, we will outline more December Investor Day. Justin Lake : Thanks. Katie Durant : Operator we have time for one more question. Operator : We will go to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open. Lance Wilkes : Good morning. Could you just talk a little bit about the Omni-channel strategy, in particular, in the home health or the home focus, what sort of populations and offerings are you looking at there? And then just maybe secondarily, just asking about how you are going to organize these efforts and manage them within the company is HealthHUB home and virtual are going to be managed together or how are you going to work that out as well? Karen Lynch : Well, Lance, on the operating model, we continue to evaluate the best approach to managing our business, and more to come on that. Let me ask Alan to talk about our home strategy as he is developing our overall home services strategy. Alan Lotvin : Yes, thanks you Lance. So it is Alan. As we think about home, I think about home as a really important channel as part of that evolving care delivery, right. We have seen a change in how people expect to receive many things after the pandemic, including care. So as we think about it, it is how do we create products and services that are either partly or entirely delivered in home, that help us both differentiate on the medical cost savings side, create new experiences for customers or take advantage of specific technologies. So whether it is our home dialysis program, which is in process, our quorum or new virtual care products that support specific populations, that is how we are thinking about home. But it is about meeting the customer need or the member need first rather than focusing especially on the channel and how do we integrate across all of the touch points we have, whether they are digital, virtual, physical in the home or local. Lance Wilkes : Great. And just understanding it for the home aspect, obviously, infusion and some of the drug-specific opportunities present themselves there. In addition, there is kind of a stabilization that might be important for an MA population like home health, and there is the emerging spaces and kind of frail elderly with physicians. As you are talking about home, are you thinking about one area over another as far as your areas of focus? Alan Lotvin : And I'm sorry, I wasn't clear enough. So when we think about specific population, exactly the populations you are talking about, people transitioning out of the hospital who are frail, keeping them out of the hospitals, keeping them out of skilled nursing facilities by using more virtual services and physical services in the home are a core population. That is an example of how we would enable, for example, the health care benefits business to be more effective at managing their risk. So that is exactly a population we would be looking at, in addition to the ones you traditionally expect us to look at like drug and dialysis. Lance Wilkes : Great. Thanks. Karen Lynch : Before we conclude today, I would like to leave you with three points that I hope you took away from the call. First, our integrated health care model is unique, and it is driving growth. You can clearly see that in our financial results across our business, but you can also see it in different ways that we are interacting with our customers. Secondly, we are increasingly using digital and technology to redefine the health experience and to improve our cost structure. And finally, we are making significant progress and are well positioned to deliver growth against our strategy. So thank you all for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today's CVS Health First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call and Webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time. Have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow CVS prepared remarks, at which point we will review instructions on how to ask your question.  As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Susie Lisa, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for CVS Health. Please go ahead. Susie Lisa : Thank you. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to the CVS Health Second Quarter 2021 Earnings call. I'm Susie Lisa, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for CVS Health. I'm very excited to be on the call with you today and to have the opportunity to work with you going forward.  I'm joined this morning by Karen Lynch, President and Chief Executive Officer and Shawn Guertin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll host a question-and-answer session that will include Alan Lotvin, President Pharmacy Services, Dan Finke, President Healthcare Benefits, Neela Montgomery, President Retail and Pharmacy, and Jon Roberts, Chief Operating Officer.  Our press release and slide presentation have been posted to our website, along with our form 10-Q that we filed with the SEC this morning. During this call, we will make certain Forward-Looking Statements reflecting our current views related to our future financial performance, future events, industry and market conditions, as well as the expected consumer benefits of our products and services and our financial projections. Our Forward-Looking Statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what may be indicated in them. We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties.  In particular, those that are described in the cautionary statement concerning Forward-Looking Statements and risk factors section, in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, this morning's earnings press release, and included in our Form, 10-Q. During this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the Company's performance and financial condition.  In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures in this morning's earnings press release, and the reconciliation documents posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website. Today's call is being broadcast on our website, where it will be archived for one year. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Karen. Karen Lynch : Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. This was another strong quarter for CVS Health. We are playing an integral role in connecting experiences across the healthcare system to deliver better health outcomes. This is what truly differentiates us and generates our growth. In the rapidly changing U.S. healthcare environment, we have proven that we can bring solutions, at scale, to meet individual health needs however they evolve.  Our COVID-19 testing and vaccination campaigns for millions of Americans are just one example. We meet customers where they are. We're there when and how they want to access care. That is what's driving growth across our Company and it's where we'll continue to focus our innovation and investments.  During the 2nd quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 11%. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $2.42 and strong cash flow from operations of $5.8 billion. We are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $7.70 to $7.80. This reflects the continued positive momentum across our business, with growth both in new and current markets.  Today, we announced an important investment in our employees. We will raise the minimum wage for our colleagues to $15 an hour by July 2022. This wage increase will boost our competitive edge in a tight retail labor market. We estimate it creates an incremental $600 million in labor costs over 3 years. Approximately, a $125 million of that impact will be in the final 4 months of this year. Increasing our minimum wage for hourly employees will help attract and retain the talent needed for our customer-centric business approach.  Just as critical, it aligns with our values and our purpose, and builds on a history of our investment in our people. Each of our businesses delivered strong performance, highlighted by overall sales and earnings outperformance and sequential margin improvement.  Customers realize the value we are providing across our CVS Health assets which results in increased customer retention rates and new wins. In Healthcare Benefits, results were powered by growth in our government business. Our medical benefit ratio of 84.1% was modestly above expectations, driven by COVID-related costs.  Underlying non-COVID cost emerged favorably. We continue to believe aggregate medical cost will modestly exceed baseline level during the second half of the year. In addition to strong performance in our core business, we are leveraging our broad and unique portfolio of assets with our first CVS-Aetna co-branded offerings. We have submitted our exchange regulatory filings for a January 2022 entrance in 8 states outlined in our supplemental earnings materials. With Aetna's strong networks and CVS ' significant local presence, we believe we are creating a compelling new offering that combines health insurance, pharmacy, our retail presence, and behavioral health services.  This is something that no one else can deliver. The 2022 national account selling season in healthcare benefits has been marked by a somewhat compressed, industry wide pipeline. Employers have been focused on developing strategies for vaccinations and other return to work activities. As a result, we concentrated on client retention, delivering a strong result of 97%. For those cases that were out to bid for 2022, we have been successful in securing new business, and introducing new differentiated products.  For example, our virtual first primary care product is the only nationwide program to offer long-term dedicated virtual primary care and a traditional in-person national network, including MinuteClinic and HealthHUB. Turning to Pharmacy Services, we outperformed expectations, delivering 9.8% revenue growth and very strong operating income growth.  We continue to build momentum in Specialty Pharmacy with revenue up 8.9% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we have maintained an impressive 98% retention rate with more than 80% of renewals complete. We have also driven strong new business results, winning over $8 billion in new growth sales for next year.  We remain well-positioned for continued specialty and pharmacy growth in 2022. The differentiation we offer is particularly important. It reflects our integrated offering with in-store, mail order, and specialty services. We added nearly 1,000,000 new integrated pharmacy and medical members through the 2021 and 2022 selling seasons alone.  This is a testament of our success in the marketplace from the aligned interest and value we bring to our customers. Our Retail segment continues to play a crucial role as part of our community-focused strategy.  We are a vital local health destination for millions of Americans who are resuming more normal activities and fueling macro improvements in the economy. Our second-quarter results for retail outperformed our expectations, and the market. In our pharmacies, we grew prescription market share to over 26%.  Importantly, our customer-centric programs continue to improve adherence for our patients. At the same time, we saw a solid rebound in front store sales, which increased nearly 13% in the quarter, with strength across all categories. Nearly 2/3 of that growth was driven by health and wellness products.  Similarly, pharmacy script growth in the quarter was strong, up more than 14% year-over-year, 1/3 of which is attributable to COVID vaccines. We now administered 30 million vaccines and 29 million tests through the inception of the program. Approximately 40% of vaccines we administered over the past 2 months were to members of underrepresented communities, a rate at or higher than the benchmark population.  Our effort to make the vaccine accessible and convenient for all Americans continues. However, vaccination rates are slowing from a peak in April, despite the impact of new variants. Our COVID work is a powerful example of the trust and relationships we are building with consumers, augmented by our local presence and digital tools. For customers introduced to us through COVID testing, approximately 12% have subsequently chosen to fill new prescriptions or get their COVID vaccine at CVS Health. This helped drive overall strong script growth in the quarter. The COVID testing outlook remains strong.  As public health recommendations evolve, we are prepared, and continue to play a critical role in helping Americans prevail against the pandemic. I'm grateful for the continued dedication and tireless efforts of the nearly 300,000 colleagues. We are making considerable progress across key drivers of our growth.  The first is our role in care delivery. We continue to focus on our integrated platform to expand access to care that is local, affordable, and connected. HealthHUB S represent one of many channels, and lower-cost sites of care, that allows us to address individual health needs.  Aetna commercial members in the no co-pay low co-pay product are utilizing our MinuteClinic and our HealthHUB more frequently, more than twice as often as members without these benefits. We expanded the spectrum of health services we offer to include common services usually done in primary care settings, such as chronic care management, like diabetes, and behavioral health, a critical area of need that will continue beyond the pandemic. We expanded our Care Concierge program to support our Medicare members.  Rolling out as planned, the HealthHUB Stars program designed to close gaps in the quality of care. Early intervention results are promising as they are demonstrating strong reach and a high engagement rate of 67% for a variety of health screenings such as diabetes and cancer. The second key area is technology. We are using the power of our digital capabilities to reinvent how consumers experience their care by creating choice, expanding access, and reducing complexity. And we are creating new sources of value while accelerating the speed, flexibility, and launch of new health solutions.  Today, we regularly serve more than 35 million unique digital customers across our CVS Health assets. Our digital customers are important. Digital retail customers spend two-and-a-half times more in our front store, manage one-and-a-half times more scripts, and remain customers longer than other pharmacy patients. And customers who engage with us digitally have lower medical costs related to personalized data insights that guide health behaviors. This quarter, we also saw more than 37% of specialty prescriptions initiated digitally from the 85% of our pharmacy specialty members who have opted into our digital program.  Building these trusted digital relationships with customers generates new growth opportunities across all of our businesses. At the same time, we are reengineering our cost structure by simplifying operations to benefit both customers and our own colleagues.  Our technology-driven programs are leveraging blockchain, driving cloud migration, and intelligent automation, and streamlining processes to accelerate results and generate greater impact. One example is a specialty pharmacy script automation program that uses AI to yield better results more quickly, while eliminating more than 30 manual steps, such as benefit verification and prior authorization.  Our commitment to shareholders, customers, and communities we serve, does not stop at commercial product offering.

I'll turn now to Shawn Guertin, who recently joined CVS Health as Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer in late May and has already made an impact. His deep healthcare expertise, financial acumen, and strategic mindset will be instrumental to the successful execution of our strategy. Shawn. Shawn Guertin : Thank you, Karen and good morning, everyone. I'm very excited to be at CVS Health, particularly at such a dynamic and important time, not only for our Company, but for our healthcare system as a whole.  Our differentiated portfolio of capabilities and local community presence, creates a compelling competitive advantage that improves healthcare access and outcomes across a broad population, while generating strong cash flow and value for all our stakeholders. I look forward to executing on our growth strategy and reshaping the healthcare experience for the people we serve. I'll 1st discuss our Second Quarter Financial Results. As Karen stated, we delivered another quarter of outperformance across each of our businesses.  Exceeding our expectations and further demonstrating the strength of our combined enterprise. Total revenues of 72.6 billion grew 11% year-over-year, and reflected strong contributions from each of our segments. We reported adjusted operating income of 4.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $2.42.  We continue to generate excellent cash flow in the second quarter, with year-to-date cash flow from operations now exceeding $8.7 billion. Further, we have repaid 5.4 billion in debt during the first half of the year.  All our cash-flow metrics exceeded our internal forecast during the quarter. Moving to the segments> Healthcare Benefits total revenue increased 11% year-over-year, driven by our continued growth in our government services business, slightly offset by the repeal of the health insurance fee or HIF. Our Medicare franchise continues to perform very well with quarterly sequential membership growth across all products.  Medicare Advantage membership is slightly exceeding our prior expectations and is now on track to be up 9% to 10% for the full year. Dual special needs plans membership grew by double-digit 's sequentially, and has more than doubled year-over-year, reflecting our strategic focus in this business.  Medicare Supplement and Prescription Drug Plan membership, also increased in the quarter, providing a sustained, strong pipeline of opportunities for future conversions to Medicare Advantage. Our midyear Medicare risk-adjusted revenue settlement was in line with our expectations. Finally, for our prescription drug plan business, we are pleased with our bid position below the 2022 low-income benchmark in all our targeted regions. Healthcare Benefits adjusted operating income exceeded our projections for the quarter, but was down materially on a year-over-year basis due to the depressed levels of utilization observed in the second quarter of 2020 at the start of the pandemic.  The medical benefit ratio for the quarter of 84.1% was slightly higher than our forecast, driven by higher-than-expected COVID-related costs, which, while materially lower than the first quarter, did not fall off as much as we had forecast. Underlying non-COVID utilization continued its return toward normal baseline levels and was slightly favorable versus our expectations.  The combined result was an MBR slightly higher than our forecast for the quarter. We remain comfortable with the adequacy of our reserves. Recording a modest amount of favorable prior year development in the quarter while days claims payable of 48 is consistent with both the 1st quarter of this year and the 4th quarter of 2020.  Turning to Pharmacy Services, we continue to deliver exceptional value for our customers by producing industry-leading, low single-digit drug trends. This value proposition allowed us to produce strong revenue growth of nearly 10% versus last year, primarily driven by network volume and Specialty Pharmacy growth.  Total pharmacy claims processed increased by more than 11% versus last year, with approximately one-half attributable to net new business wins from our 2021 selling season, and another 1/4 due to COVID vaccine administration. Our Specialty Network and Maintenance Choice business lines all delivered sequential claims growth in the quarter.  Pharmacy Services adjusted operating income exceeded expectations in the second quarter, up more than $400 million or 32% year-over-year. The 3 major drivers of this increase are, improved purchasing economics reflecting the products and services of our group purchasing organization launched in the second quarter of 2020.  Specialty Pharmacy, including our 340B Claims Administration business, and increased pharmacy claim volumes. These favorable items were partially tempered by ongoing client pricing pressure. Lastly, it's important to note that the initiation of our group purchasing organization and certain generic specialty launches in the second quarter and second half of 2020 respectively, created relatively low comparisons in the first half of 2021 that will increase significantly in the second half of the year.  Therefore, we expect a much smaller incremental year-over-year improvement in operating income in the second half of this year. Retail also delivered strong results this quarter exceeding expectations. Total revenue of nearly $25 billion increased by 3 billion or 14% year-over-year.  This improvement is driven by 3 main components. 1, approximately 1/3 or $1 billion is attributable to the nearly 17 million COVID vaccines. And more than 6 million COVID test administered during the second quarter. Two, an additional 1/3 or another billion dollars is due to the broad quarantine restrictions and civil unrest experienced last year, that depressed results in the 2nd quarter of 2020.  Three, the final 1/3, or remaining 1 billion, was driven by a combination of improved pharmacy growth and mix during the second quarter, as well as broad strength in front-store trends. Front-store revenue increased by nearly 13%, while pharmacy prescription volume was up 14%, including COVID vaccines. This strong revenue growth combined with a 340 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin, produced adjusted operating income well ahead of our forecast, and an increase of nearly a billion dollars year-over-year. COVID testing and vaccines, which were immaterial in Q2 2020, represent approximately half of the operating income increase.  2nd quarter 2021 results also reflect again from a legal settlement related to an anti-trust matter worth a $125 million which is included in both our GAAP and non-GAAP results. Turning to cash flows in the balance sheet, cash from operations remains strong at 5.8 billion for the quarter, and 8.7 billion year-to-date.  We paid down 2.4 billion of long-term debt in the quarter while returning 650 million to shareholders through dividends. Since the close of the Aetna transaction, we have paid down a net 17.6 billion in long-term debt. Our commitment and discipline in this area was recognized during the quarter as S&P raised our credit outlook from stable to positive.  Let me now turn to our updated guidance for 2021 and share some preliminary thoughts regarding 2022. But first, I want to provide a framework of the pandemic-related dynamics that will impact our business over the remainder of the year and the interplay between the Retail segment and the Healthcare Benefits segment.  As mentioned, our Retail segment benefited from strong COVID testing and vaccine administration services in the second quarter, but began to see vaccines fall below expectations in May and June. As a result, we have reduced our forecast for vaccine earnings to below the midpoint of our original range for the full year.  In healthcare benefits, given the ongoing fluidity of the current environment, we have incorporated a higher estimate of COVID-related costs in the second half of the year. As a result, our full-year MBR, while still well within our range, is approximately 20-30 basis points higher than our previous forecast.  Overall, we believe the combined impact of our reduced outlook for vaccines and retail and a slightly higher MBR and Healthcare Benefits now make the pandemic a modest negative for 2021. Despite this, given our strong performance in the quarter, and solid outlook, we are increasing our guidance. We are raising full-year 2021 total revenue guidance to a range of 280.7 billion to 285.2 billion representing year-over-year adjusted revenue growth of 4.5% to 6.25%. We're also raising adjusted EPS guidance to $7.70 to $7.80 per share.  A significant earnings outperformance in the second quarter is reflected in our updated full-year guidance, but it's partially offset by 3 key headwinds during the second half of 2021. The 1st is expectations for full-year COVID-19 vaccine volumes to be below the midpoint of our original guidance.  As I mentioned earlier, we saw vaccinations peak in April then begin to decline in May and June. Although the recent rise in COVID-19 cases has caused a reacceleration in 1st dose trend, We believe it to be prudent to adjust our full-year outlook for vaccines to a range of 32 to 36 million.  This includes a limited contribution from the administration of pediatric vaccines, but does not assume any contribution from booster shots. Overall, despite the slowdown in vaccine administration, we continue to be pleased with our expanded and strengthened customer relationships stemming from our local presence, and see ongoing customer connectivity from the significant role we play in combating the pandemic in our local communities.  The second item is the investment in wages that Karen highlighted. Our work to retain and attract talent includes an additional $600 million investment in wages over 3 years, primarily for our retail colleagues and pharmacy technicians, with approximately 125 million impacting the last 4 months of 2021. Finally, the third item is increased investments in the second half of 2021, reflecting our efforts to drive and support growth, enhance our consumer experience, and improve our cost structure in 2022 and beyond. In aggregate, these three items are expected to negatively impact second half adjusted-EPS by approximately $0.25 per share.  In addition to increasing our EPS guidance, we are also raising our expectations for cash flow from operations by $500 million to a range of $12.5 to $13 billion. Our expectations for gross capital expenditures remain in a range of 2.7 billion to 3 billion to fund organic growth initiatives and our expanded investments in technology and digital.  We remain committed to ongoing deleveraging and our investment-grade rating target. By segment, for Healthcare Benefits, we are maintaining our full-year adjusted operating income guidance of 5.25 to 5.35 billion.  As discussed our outlook assumes a slightly higher full-year MBR by 20 to 30 basis points, to reflect the higher COVID cost observed in the second quarter and our expectation that slightly higher COVID costs will continue into the second half. Our forecast assumes that non-COVID utilization will return to normal baseline levels by the fourth quarter.  This MBR pressure is largely being offset by an improved revenue outlook and operating expense management. It's also worth recalling the natural seasonality of the Healthcare Benefits segment, with fourth-quarter operating income typically the lowest of the year. We believe that our forecast is appropriately positioned, given that there remains a high degree of uncertainty in terms of how COVID will play out during the second half of the year.  For Pharmacy Services, given the strength in the quarter and visibility to the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full-year 2021 adjusted operating income guidance to 6.45 billion to 6.55 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 13.5% to 15.25%.  While we expect the factors driving second-quarter performance to continue to benefit the second half of 2021, due to the timing elements I discussed earlier, we do not anticipate the same level of year-over-year growth observed in the first half of 2021. For retail, we are maintaining our full-year 2021 Shawn Guertin : Segment guidance for adjusted operating income in a range of 6.6 billion to 6.7 billion. Given the dynamic environment relative to the pandemic and its impact on vaccines, testing and front store sales, we have taken what we believe to be a prudent posture in our outlook and have not fully pulled through the favorability we observed in the second quarter, to the full-year. This full-year guidance also reflects the reduced outlook for vaccines and the impact of the wage investment, approximately 80% of which is experienced in the retail segment. You will find further details in the slide presentation we posted to our website this morning.  Moving onto 2022, while it is premature to provide forward-year guidance at this time. I want to share some preliminary thinking on some of the more visible puts and takes we are considering for 2022. Starting with tailwinds. It is reasonable to expect benefits from 1 : strong selling seasons in the Pharmacy Services segment and then, commercial national accounts in the Healthcare Benefits segment. 2, anticipated lower COVID-related costs and improved Medicare risk-adjusted revenue reimbursement in the Healthcare Benefits business. And 3, continued contributions from our ongoing cost savings initiatives.  For headwinds, we anticipate, first, consistent pressure in Pharmacy Services from client price improvements and reimbursement pressure in retail, both of which are consistent industry headwinds, which we seek to mitigate through improved purchasing economics.  Second, the impact of annualizing the increase to minimum wage across the Company, and third, uncertainty regarding the expected revenue from COVID vaccines and testing in our retail operations. Lastly, I'd remind you that our standard practice is not to include any estimates of prior year development or realized capital gains in our Forward-Looking Guidance. On a year-to-date basis, these two items comprise approximately $0.15 per share.  Again, this is not a comprehensive outlook for 2022, but represents some of the key items likely to influence performance next year. To conclude, CVS Health continues to produce strong results as we execute on our differentiated strategy. Putting the consumer at the center of what we do, and redefining the integrated delivery of healthcare. I look forward to updating longer-term financial targets at our Investor Day event this December, and detailing our key priorities, positioning CVS Health to deliver sustainable, long-term, profitable growth, and to return to a more balanced and strategic program of capital deployment. We will now open the call to your questions. Operator. Operator :   We'll take our first question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan, please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. And thank you for all the detail. Shawn, just going back to your thoughts around 2022, am I thinking about this correctly? If I take the midpoint of this year at 7.75, add back the $0.25 that you talked about, we get to $8, minus the $0.15 that you think about  and capital gains gets us to 7.85. And then how do I think about the headwinds and tailwinds that you talked about, are they fairly equal between them? Is there any other color that you can give us as we think about the puts and takes going into next year? Shawn Guertin : Yeah, I think I'd be careful on the specific math there, because to some extent, as I mentioned for example, about vaccines and testing revenue, there's just an uncertainty about the level of those things. And I'd also not add back the full $0.25 as an example, because the minimum wage impact in that is only for 4 months and obviously, that will annualize next year. So there's some moving pieces in there. But honestly, some of these things, I think we can see are going to be factors, but we don't have completely quantified at this point. But I do think when we talk about 2022 if it's worth talking about a couple of things. I would say at the outset we remain very well-positioned in our core businesses and our operating performance is very strong as evidenced by the last couple of quarters of results. And as I mentioned in my remarks, I don't want to provide 2022 guidance today, but I do recognized that there's previous targets out there for a low double-digit earnings growth for 2022. And what I would say is, make no mistake. Double-digit adjusted EPS growth remains the benchmark that we're always trying to achieve, and frankly the benchmark that we're using in considering the strategic choices that we'll make. But an awful lot has changed since 2019 when that target was out there and stated. And it's not just the composition of our earnings, but sort of to the point of your question, was a -- what's the visibility that we have into how those components are going to trend forward? Again, the vaccines and testing and COVID treatment costs are just 2 good examples of factors, but the direction and the degree is a bit hard to see. A lot of this will come down to thinking about what baseline we're measuring from and how we see these factors playing out here. But as I sit here today, if I consider a starting point of 7.70 to 7.80, I would say at this point, no. That from this forecast baseline, I wouldn't reiterate the double-digit growth target for 2022. But again, as I mentioned, it says more about the shifting factors. It does not have anything really to do with the core performance of our business, which has been really outstanding. Obviously, we hope to talk in much more detail about 2022 at our Investor Day as well as some of the longer-term financial targets in the earnings power of the business. Lisa Gill : And Shawn, just as my follow-up, I just want to understand, you talked about COVID costs returning as we go into the back half of the year. Can you talk at all of what you've seen in the last few weeks with the Delta variant and potential increase to cost on the COVID side? And then are you seeing any non-COVID costs coming down, that people are pushing off elective surgeries because of COVID? Any incremental color would be helpful there. Thanks again for the comments. Shawn Guertin : Yeah. What I would say is, in the HCB business, obviously, there's a lag in what we see in any real-time, so we don't have great insight necessarily, into July. But what I would say, there certainly has been -- I've seen a number of media reports about various facilities beginning to cancel elective procedures again, and so it does feel like there's certainly some push in the system on the deferred utilization side again. But again, premature to conclude for HCB. I would say though that what we do see on the retail side is pretty strong momentum continuing in testing in particular. And again, while vaccines are still down in July versus the prior month, they've probably had a bit of an uptick, as I mentioned in my remarks. I think clearly, you could reasonably infer that there's sort of the ongoing COVID treatment costs are persisting, certainly into early July here. And again, thus, why we thought It made sense to be a bit more cautious in our MBR outlook for HCB. Lisa Gill : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse, please go ahead your line is open. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Welcome, Shawn and Susie. Anyway, I appreciate the conversation the last couple conference calls about how the 3 businesses can work together. When you look at today, what are the leading opportunities for the businesses to the Retail, Pharmacy Services and the Benefits business to capitalize on, that are still in front of the Company? Can you highlight maybe a couple of things that you guys particularly focused on and seized opportunities? Susie Lisa : Good morning, A.J. I would highlight a couple of things in front of us. One is, as you know, we have more opportunities in expanding our digital access and our digital connections. We've seen across the board with our next best actions, Using digital connections, we've seen -- for those individuals, we've seen reductions in overall medical cost. We also have the opportunity to expand our home service and delivery, as you know, we are in Corum today. We have kidney care, but I do think that there's more expansive opportunities. It's a 100 billion-plus market that I think we have more opportunities to penetrate and really enhance our overall care delivery. So I would point to those two as ones that -- and then, I think there's more that we can do with just the fundamental core business through integration, through selling more of our products, capturing more share of wallet, driving benefit designs across to support lower sites of care like MinuteClinic and the HealthHUB, so those would be a few I would comment on. Thanks for the question, A.J. A.J. Rice: Great. Maybe just a quick follow-up. I know the slide deck says that the priority remains to continue to pay down debt. At what point, Shawn, can you say onboard? What point do you think you might look at tuck-in acquisitions a little more actively, share repurchase, any of those type of things, what's the timeframe of that? Shawn Guertin : Thanks, A.J. And good to hear from you again as well. If I thought about the near term being sort of the rest of this year, but primarily 2022, we have $4 billion of debt. Or thereabouts, a little more than that, maturing, and it would be our intention to continue to deliver by paying that off. Shawn Guertin : However, if you think about the level of our cash flows in '21, if we achieved a similar level of cash flow next year, even with the dividend that would still leave a lot of room for other capital deployment, potentially M&A, potentially dividend increase, and potentially share repurchase. So I think 2022 is a year where we begin to do that in a potentially more limited way, but still meaningful. What I would say is, longer-term as I think about this, and as you've heard me to say before, my first use of that and my most preferred use of that capital all the time is to grow the business. And undoubtedly that -- there are capabilities that we will need over the next few years to effect our strategy as efficiently as we can, and so M&A is a part of that. But I've always found -- also found that balanced deployment of capital tends to produce the best long-term results. And so that is a combination of M&A, a dividend that moves up as EPS moves up, and share repurchase that's accretive to your EPS growth on a steady basis. Karen Lynch : Next question please. A.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ricky Goldwasser : Hi, good morning. Thank you for all the details and congrats on a very good quarter. My main question, Karen is around the relationship and how you think about your Medicare Advantage book of business, and your vision for how you're going to evolve the HealthHUB presence? Then you talked about, Care Concierge for Medicare. Just curious to see how that marketplace is shaping your seeing of what HealthHUB S would look at the future versus what it is today? And then the follow up question would be to Shawn. Shawn when you talked about second-half guidance, you mentioned investments in future growth as a headwind. You didn't mention it as a headwind for fiscal year 2022. So just from a modeling perspective, should we think about these investments just as happening in second half, or should we also run rate them as we adjust our models for next year? Karen Lynch : Good morning, Ricky. Let me just start with relative to Medicare. First of all, that is one of our single biggest growth opportunities. Continuing to sell more Medicare, driving the duals. And so we do think that is a big opportunity for growth on an ongoing basis. As we think about care delivery and -- you'll think about stars ' performance. The HealthHUB will play a critical role, but as I said, we have to have a broad, expansive approach to care delivery, particularly as it relates to the Medicare patients. So the HealthHUB will play a role. As you know, we have the 0 co-pay, low co-pay. Now I'm asking -- demonstrating that we can have follow-ups, visits at our HealthHUB, but we need to expand our capabilities in the home and we need to make sure that we're staying digitally connected to them. But this new program that we had just recently introduced as part of our plan to roll out in the HealthHUB is really intended to close gaps in care. And the more that we close gaps in care, the better stars performance we get, the better revenue we get. So you can see that cycle. And that really is a big opportunity for us. But I really want you to think about Medicare, care delivering a broader role with HealthHUB being part of that care delivery strategy. Shawn, let me turn it over to you. Shawn Guertin : Yeah. In terms of the second half guidance, Ricky, I do think there's two levels of investment here, and one of them each year is when we do have growth better than our original plan, for example, as we foresee, in PSS now, we do then have to staff up and be prepared for that higher growth so that's always an element. Part of your question is how you feel about in essence, '23 growth that we'll achieve in 2022. And I think, broadly there's -- I would not run rate the whole thing, but I do think there are pieces that tend to run rate forward in the business, whether they're ongoing investments we make in Medicare distribution, and as I mentioned, in staffing up for customers. So I -- to -- as I sit here today, I wouldn't run rate the whole thing. A lot of this is still to be determined, but there probably is a piece that continues if we continue on the trajectory that we're on. The other element I would say about 2nd half guidance with some of this is, some of the spending gets sort of pushed back into the year, more towards the end. I think you take that with the natural seasonality of the Healthcare Benefits business, and that would tend to get a slope of earnings for the rest of the year, where Q4 is likely less than Q3. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Karen Lynch : Next question. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup, please go ahead. Your line is open. Ralph Giacobbe : Great, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just on the labor commentary. First, are you seeing underlying wage pressure outside of the minimum wage lift? And then just wanted to clarify the numbers. I think you said the cost would be 600 million, a 125 million the last 4 months of this year, but I think you also said it would stretch over 3 years. So just want to reconcile that versus that July 2022 date that you put out there? Karen Lynch : Yeah. Hi, Ralph. Let me just start with the minimum wage adjustment. It's a series of investments that we've been making for our employees since the pandemic, and we are seeing 65% of our employees that are hourly are already at or above $15 an hour. This is a very targeted investment for our pharmacy technicians, our front store colleagues, and we will start a series of wage increases beginning in September, which is really what's driving that $125 million impact to the latter half of the year. Obviously, it's a tight labor market. We are paying attention. We've got a lot of hiring to do to support growth. And so far, we see pressure but we've been managing through it. But we're watching that labor market, we're seeing impact s in the stores. And that's part of why we're making this wage investment today. Shawn, do you want to answer the 3-year question? Shawn Guertin : Yeah. Ralph, the way this will play out over the next few years is, as you mentioned, there would be -- the change in September would be a $125 million for the last 4 months of this year. That will annualize next year, but there'll also be a 2nd change in July of next year, I believe. The total cost of this in 2022 will be 485 million, which is a step-up, if you will, of about 360 million from the 125. That second step in July '22 will annualize again in '23, but not to the same degree. So the total cost is right around 600 million by the time you get to '23. And that's a step-up year-over-year from '22 to '23 of about a $115 million. Ralph Giacobbe : Got it. All right. That's helpful. And then just quick follow-up, just want to clarify, Shawn, I think you said you would not factor in low double-digit growth on the 775 basis, I think I heard that. But if I do look at consensus, it factors about 7% growth, so we know we're not at that double-digit level. And give me your commentary around capital deployment alone, are you willing to say if there is comfort in that sort of mid-single-digit EPS, or is it just still too early to even give that comfort or clarity. Thanks. Shawn Guertin : I would say it's too early for me to give you specific guidance. But if you go back to what I said, I think the businesses are performing very well, and we will have the ability, potentially, to deploy some capital next year. So I certainly wouldn't dismiss that as something that's not sort of in the thinking or not a viable target. But again, I want to stay away from giving precise guidance. But the core fundamentals of our business are excellent right now. And again, with the return to a more balanced capital deployment, I certainly feel good about the longer-term trajectory. Karen Lynch : Next question. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Mike Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open. Mike Cherny : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for all the color so far. I'm going to dance around the '22 outlook a bit without, obviously, trying to hold you to anything, Shawn. But -- as you talked about some of the tailwinds, in particular with regards to the strong PBM and commercial selling season so far, can you give us any characteristics of the type of customers that you're winning?  What the real pits that they're looking at relative to how you're going to market and what that driving force is. Obviously, you had the federal employee plans specialty that came back that we know about in the Pharmacy Services. But beyond that, any characteristics that you can point to that are really resonating in the strong performance year-to-date? Karen Lynch : Mike, it's Karen. I -- we as I mentioned in my opening remarks,  very much having a strong one-one (ph) part of it is due to the integration and the products and services that we're offering, and part of it's just due to the service delivery that we've been delivering to our customers and the value that we've been delivering to our customers. I'm going to ask Alan and then Dan to talk about specifically what they're seeing and the types of customers that we're winning in the market. So Alan. Alan Lotvin : Yeah. Thank you Karen. When you look at the Caremark selling season and the Caremark array of clients it is a, I would say, relatively normal distribution of clients. We won obviously the Federal Employee Program specialty, but we've won in the Health Plans segment, we've won in the Employer segment, and we're winning in the Coalition segment. So across the board, we continue to win and I think the key drivers there are one, I'm delivering on what is most important to our clients, which is controlling their drug trend. Number two, I'm providing an outstanding level of service, so avoiding all -- not just avoiding service issues, but proactively addressing our clients' needs. Alan Lotvin : And the 3rd related to the 1st with innovating particularly around new programs in specialty, like our oncology program, medical benefit management program. So it's really -- there isn't a specific segment that's over-performing other than specialty, obviously, because of the FEP one. Dan Finke : And I would just add that similar to Alan. What -- we are -- have quite a few areas of focus that are resonating in the market that's leading to that improved persistency that Karen stated. But also some really strong wins in the market. Alan and I have been working really close together on Improving the further penetration of our integrated offerings, specifically in pharmacy which is resonating really strongly. Also, Dental and Behavioral Health. And then like Alan with our innovative solutions, we're targeting some new capabilities for chronic disease that use the breadth of the assets of CVS, like Transform Diabetes and Transform Oncology, which are resonating, as well as our new access point products like our Virtual Primary Care.  And so that's really what leading to a strong and improved national account selling season. Mike Cherny : Got it. it. If I can just ask one more. You highlighted a lot of the investments that you made into the store base, prepare for the COVID vaccines, COVID testing. As you think about your outlook going forward and the uncertainty around what the pacing will be of vaccines, pediatric boosters, et cetera, What happens to a lot of those costs, the incremental labor, the incremental staffing that you've done in terms of how that should factor into the model on a go forward basis? Shawn Guertin : Michael you're right. I mean, we did have to stand up a fairly sizable operation to handle volume like this, and it's a delicate balance of trying to adjust that as you see volumes change. But we see how quickly volumes can go up and down. So I think we've been a bit cautious with that and tried to make sure that we have the capacity. If things go in a different direction, this is an important role that we play. Even more important now without as many large-scale sites up. And so we want to make sure we have the capacity. As you think that -- the thing, I think that comes off of that is as you think now, about vaccine volume up and down, the marginal impact right, of those vaccines is probably greater than average. So it is something that we're paying very close attention to but a balance. Neela Montgomery : It's Neela. I'll just add to that -- Shawn's comments, which is that we started the vaccine campaign with a number of dedicated clinics, which had dedicated labor. And since then, we've expanded to all stores and are seeing about 40% of the appointments are now walk-in appointments, so they are really within our existing labor model within the pharmacy. That does help us to flex up and down much more with demand, that we're seeing on a weekly basis. Karen Lynch : Next question. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Kevin Caliendo with UBS, please go ahead. Your line is open. Kevin Caliendo : Hi. Thanks. I just want to go through the headwinds and tailwinds and try to figure out. I think we're all trying to figure out what is the baseline. I know. Lisa tried earlier. I think -- when we think about the vac's benefit, right? When you sized it earlier as $500 million, that's for the quarter. How should we think about that benefit for the full-year, net-net? And I guess the question really is how to think about what that headwind could be for next year. Like, what can we anticipate over the economics of the vaccine change, in your opinion? That's the first one. And then the second one is, do you think you can still get the same purchasing synergies that you're seeing this year, next year in the PBM with -- it sounds like you are getting massive new growth there. I'm just wondering if you can continue to see this year-over-year growth, which I'm guessing is driven by the purchasing synergies next year. Shawn Guertin : I can let Alan comment more deeply on the second one, but what I would say is, recall that some of these initiatives, as I mentioned in my comments, were launched midway or in the second half of last year, so the effect we're seeing year-over-year is probably more -- is more pronounced in the first half of the year than we'll see in the second half of the year. But Alan can comment on the longer-term potential. On the vaccine and the testing economics, As we mentioned, a billion dollars of the revenue increase is attributable to those 2 things. In our full-year outlook, the full-year revenue's probably double that. The margin dynamics are probably a little high just in this quarter, just because of some of the timing issues. But to date, I don't have any insight into changing reimbursement or changing the labor model we are using to deliver those. So I think that's as reasonable a baseline to begin to work off of as we can -- as we think about next year. And again, as you think about the dynamics here, as you have FDA approval mandates, booster shots, there's a lot of things. And listen, you could make a bull case if you wanted to on this.  Certainly, with what's going on now and I wouldn't dispute that and I'd acknowledge that if our guidance has some upside, this could be a place depending on how things play out. The only caution I would put there though, is to think about some of the interplay of just looking at this in isolation. So even inside retail, if we do see an uptick and it does see increased activity, well, what does this mean for cough, cold and flu. For this, what does it mean for front of store. And then obviously the HCB ripples. So again, I'd acknowledge that there is a bull case that you could make here, but I'd also say this has changed rapidly over the last couple of months, and I just ask you to sort of think about it in a broader context. Alan Lotvin : And Kevin, it's Alan. When I think about the drivers of purchasing economics on the manufacturer side and the sustainability, the first thing I'd acknowledge is, as Shawn has said, when you launch something new, there's always going to be an outsized . Having said that, I think the future viewpoint on the ability to create more competition through whether it's biosimilars and biosimilar interchangeability, as we saw recently through the generics, particularly in the Specialty area, we see that as we're at the beginning of the Specialty era -- or the generic era biosimilar era of Specialty. So I think that's sustainable and a good opportunity longer term. I think the growth of our value creation will grow as volume growth. So as we continue to win, new business we'll grow -- we'll continue to grow there. And the last is, we built this platform as a platform for a series of services. We've just launched our 1st set of services, we think there's a number of other ones that we can continue to launch into the market within the GPO, that will create meaningful value for both us and for our customers. Susie Lisa : Great, with that it brings us to 9 :00. We appreciate your interest and time. And Ashley, if you could please give the replay information. Thank you all. Operator : Thank you, and this concludes today's CVS Health Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Karen Lynch : Thanks, Susie, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. CVS Health has delivered another strong quarter and exceeded expectations. For the third quarter in a row, we are raising adjusted EPS guidance. Throughout 2021, we have made progress executing our strategy to deliver an integrated healthcare experience centered around the consumer. We sustained strong revenue growth in each of our core businesses, helped improve health outcomes, and reduce costs by broadening access to quality care. We help fight the pandemic and reached millions of consumers with convenient accessible care in communities across America. During the third quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 10%. This double-digit growth was led by membership gains in both healthcare benefits and pharmacy services, as well as higher volume in retail. We grew adjusted operating income by 12.5%. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.97 and strong cash flow from operations of $5.5 billion. Given these results and our outlook, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $7.90 to $8.00. This higher guidance reflects the quarter's outperformance and continued positive momentum, which Shawn will discuss shortly. Third quarter results again demonstrate that our customers value, how we bring together our unique portfolio of assets, our deep healthcare expertise, and vast consumer touch points to meet health needs. There is strong demand for our integrated solutions across the healthcare continuum, including health management programs for chronic conditions, mental health support, pharmacy services, and health and wellness products. We added over 1.3 million new integrated pharmacy and medical members through the 2021 and 2022 selling season. More customers are seeking complementary health services that work together, such as virtual care. Earlier this year, CVS Health launched the first National Virtual Primary Care program. This market-leading solution offers a national network of physicians virtually and access to convenient face-to-face care in our MinuteClinic locations when needed, often with zero co-pays. Our program has grown to 30 customer accounts with over 750,000 eligible members as of January 1st, 2022. This is an indication of our ability to scale nationally and bring innovative products to the marketplace. Our customers recognize the importance of CVS Health, Care Solutions, and the ease of access we now provide in the community, the home, and virtually. Our high customer retention rates and new business wins are a testament to the strength of our business model. Healthcare benefits revenue increased 9.5% year-over-year. Strength in government services helped drive an adjusted operating income increase of 2.4% versus prior year, despite higher costs related to COVID-19, net of deferred care, primarily with our commercial book. We generated sequential membership growth across all three product lines in the quarter, Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. Our medical benefit ratio of 85.8% was above our expectations, driven by COVID-related costs, primarily driven by commercial. Underlying non-COVID costs emerged in line with our expectations. We believe aggregate medical cost will slightly exceed baseline levels for the full year. We produced strong results in our Medicare business and grew membership both sequentially and year-over-year across all Medicare products. This reflects our strong product portfolio, star performance, and reputation for service excellence. Year-to-date, Medicare Advantage Membership has grown 9.2%. In 2022, we anticipate we will achieve double-digit growth in individual Medicare and generate strong momentum in dual eligibles. Our strong performance in stars continues as you saw for 2022 with 87% of our members in star plans rated four and higher, up from 83% in 2021. In our commercial business, we expect moderate growth in 2022 for national accounts, driven by both increased sales, which are up approximately 50% year-over-year and a 95% client retention rate. As we mentioned earlier this year, we are reentering the individual exchanges in eight states as of January 2022. Enrollment began on Monday, and we anticipate our co-branded CVS Aetna offering and benefit design focused on consumer choice will result in gains of at least a 100,000 new members in 2022. Turning to pharmacy services, we delivered third quarter revenue growth of 9.3% and adjusted operating income growth of 9.5% year-over-year. For the 2022 selling season, we achieved a 98% retention rate. We drove $10.4 billion of growth new business, resulting in $8.9 billion of net new business wins, providing evidence of our market-leading trend management, transparency, customer service, and integrated offerings. We continue to be a leader in Specialty Pharmacy, with programs that drive value in the marketplace, provide substantial savings to customers and differentiate us as we pair programs with digital assets. We maintained a strong momentum at this quarter with specialty revenue up 8.7% versus prior year. Our service excellence and top-tier execution are key areas of differentiation. Our retail segment continues to play a critical role as a local health estimation for millions of Americans. Retail outperformed both expectations and the industry in the third quarter. We delivered 10% revenue growth and 22% adjusted operating income growth year-over-year. Pharmacy sales and prescriptions filled both increased 8% year-over-year, largely driven by COVID-19 vaccine administration and core pharmacy services. Our patient satisfaction scores remain high with approximately 90% satisfied with their experience in our CVS Health locations. We continue to support millions of Americans for COVID-19 testing and vaccine administration. We administered 11.6 million COVID-19 vaccines and 8.5 million COVID-19 tests in the quarter. Since our program began, we have administered 43 million vaccines and approximately 38 million tests. We also expanded our digital capabilities to provide universal access to CVS Health vaccination records to the millions of adults we have vaccinated. This new capability has driven over 1 million visits per month to vaccination records on cvs.com. This provides another opportunity for us to build deeper engagement with our customers while simplifying and connecting their health experience. Front store sales momentum also continued, with revenue growth of 13% versus prior year. Front store sales were led by consumer demand for COVID-19 home testing kits, as well as cough and cold products with year-over-year volume increases across most front store categories. Our CVS Health retail presence consistently serve as a strong channel for capturing new life. In fact, this year, 12.5% of new COVID-19 testing customers chose to fill new prescriptions or received a COVID-19 vaccination with CVS Health. Finally, we anticipate a benefit from administering boosters and pediatric doses to eligible consumers will occur largely in the fourth quarter of this year. We continue to make measurable progress with our strategy to deliver a superior customer experience and address the total cost of care. We are focused on several important areas. First, with our unique portfolio of businesses, we continue to expand our role in care delivery designed around the customer. We're taking a proactive approach to meet the emerging needs of customers, clients and communities. We are improving access lowering costs, and combining local points of care to simplify the consumer health experience. We have one of the country's largest network of physician extenders and are able to deliver care locally with our national footprint. We will continue to drive higher engagement with customers as we evolve the format of select CVS locations, creating community health destinations, and shifting into three distinct models. Sites dedicated to offering primary care services and enhanced version of HealthHUB with products and services designed for everyday health and wellness needs. Our traditional CVS Pharmacy store model that provides prescription services and health and wellness and other convenient retail offerings. Our unique combination of businesses, and our presence in communities nationwide enable us to meet consumers where they are to enhance their wellbeing and to be a bigger part of their wellness. Next, we are further strengthening the consumer experience through the expansion of digital services and platforms that connect to health services and in-person channels for our more than 35 million unique digital customers. For example, more than 70% of CVS pharmacy customers are enrolled in our text messaging programs today. Within that group, this quarter, adherence outreach drove 10% growth in prescriptions filled. Greater adherence leads to improved health outcomes and lower costs. In today's hyper-connected digital consumer driven world, the demand for Omnichannel Pharmacy is greater than ever. We continue to modernize our operating systems and enhance the integration of pharmacy models, simplifying consumer interactions, and driving further engagement with our customers. Finally, we continue to invest in our employees as part of our workforce strategy. Last quarter, we announced the phase increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour by July 2022. We invested in modernizing our training programs and technology for our frontline and clinical colleagues. Despite the tight labor market and anticipation of the higher demand for Health Services, we strengthened our workforce in every business. We hired a record number of people in the third quarter to advance open enrollment and customer service, as well as enhanced technology and clinical capabilities. Nearly 20,000 pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and nurses recently joined the CVS Health team supporting flu season, as well as COVID-19 vaccinations and testing. Our pharmacists and Pharmacy technicians are an integral part of our overall workforce strategy. We are committed to investing in our pharmacists, awarding immunization bonuses in the second half of this year. We look forward to sharing more about our strategy to improve access, quality, and customer engagement in Investor Day on December 9th. Our commitment to shareholders, customers, and communities remain steadfast. Health equity is critical as the pandemic continues to disproportionately impact certain communities. In addition to targeted vaccine and booster education effort, we provided 31 million meals this year to people suffering from food and security and invested in 2,800 affordable housing units in 30 cities. By helping address the social determinants of health, permanent housing can reduce healthcare costs by 59%. We recently hired our first ever Chief Health Equity Officer, Dr. Joneigh Khaldun to build upon our efforts to advance health equity and better support underserved communities and our increased wages and bonuses support our employees, their families, and their communities. For the third quarter in a row, we executed on an exceeded our plan, and raised adjusted EPS guidance. We continue to enhance our diverse portfolio of assets to serve the customer. We are guiding to a strong year-end, all possible due to the leadership and commitment of our over 300 thousand CVS Health colleagues that bring their heart to every moment of our customers health. With that, let me turn it over to Shawn. Shawn Guertin : Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect a continuation of the strong performance observed in the first half of 2021, as we exceeded our expectations from both a revenue, cash flow, and adjusted earnings per-share basis. These results ensue from our differentiated portfolio of capabilities, in keen focus on operational execution. This momentum in our performance enables us once again to raise our outlook for 2021. Starting with the enterprise as a whole, total revenues of $73.8 billion increased 10% year-over-year with robust growth in all three segments. We reported adjusted operating income of $4.1 billion, a 12.5% increase versus the prior year. This growth in adjusted operating income was also reflected in the strong cash flow generation in the third quarter. With year-to-date cash flow from operations now exceeding $14 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.97 represent a nearly 19% year-over-year increase generated by our adjusted operating income growth and lower interest expense resulting from our ongoing deleveraging efforts. Moving to the segments. Healthcare benefits revenue increased by 9.5% year-over-year, driven by sustained growth in our government services business, slightly offset by the repeal of the health insurance fee. In the third quarter, we saw our Medicaid membership grow sequentially by 67,000 members across multiple geographies. Medicare Advantage membership also continued to grow in the quarter, increasing by 42 thousand members sequentially, and representing year-over-year growth of 9.8% Our Medicare Advantage franchise continues to be a powerful growth engine. With Medicare Advantage membership more than doubling since the third quarter of 2015, representing a 15% compound annual growth rate. Our attention is now turned to ensuring a successful 2022 annual enrollment period for Medicare, which began on October 1st. While still quite early in that process, we are pleased with what we have seen to date. Healthcare benefits' adjusted operating income grew modestly year-over-year, but fell below our expectations for the quarter due to higher-than-expected COVID-related medical costs in our commercial business. With the surge in nationwide COVID cases emanating from the Delta variant, we experienced higher-than-expected COVID-related medical costs in August and September. Three key factors drove this difference versus our expectations. First, commercial COVID inpatient admissions in August and September, were in line with the peak levels experienced in January 2021 and were nearly 3 times the average of the 2nd quarter of 2021. Second, COVID testing costs, which we had expected to moderate during the third quarter, also approached January 2021 levels, and we're more than 1.5 times the average we experienced in the second quarter. It is critical to recognize the outsize impact of COVID testing on overall claim costs, as testing costs represented approximately 35% of gross COVID costs in the quarter, and finally, while non-COVID deferred care was better than we had forecast, it was not enough to entirely offset these higher COVID costs in commercial. The resultant medical benefit ratio for the quarter of 85.8% was above our forecast and driven almost entirely by the higher-than-expected commercial COVID testing and treatment costs. There are 2 important aspects of HCB's third quarter performance to note : 1. Absent these COVID dynamics underlying performance in our commercial book of business continues to be in line with our expectations, 2. In our government services business, we also saw an increase in COVID treatment and testing costs, but far less pronounced than in commercial. This lower level of increase was fully offset by better-than-expected deferred care. As a result, the overall performance of our government services businesses was in line with expectation. Wrapping up HCB, we experienced favorable prior period development in the quarter on both commercial and government products. Days claims payable of 51 at the end of the third quarter is 3 days higher sequentially, and 2 days above prior year. While influenced by many factors with the anticipated abatement in COVID-related claims in the fourth quarter, we would expect DCP to return to a more typical results in Q4. Overall, we remain comfortable with the adequacy of our reserves. Turning to pharmacy services, our ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth remains clear. 2021 is expected to be the second year of adjusted operating income growth in excess of 10%. This sustained growth has been driven by our track record of delivering industry-leading drug trend on behalf of our clients, our proven industry-leading capabilities, particularly in the Specialty Pharmacy arena, and our outstanding customer service, as reflected by our over 98% renewal rate for 2022. During the third quarter, pharmacy revenues increased by 9.3% year-over-year, driven by increased Pharmacy claims volume, growth in Specialty Pharmacy, and brand inflation. Total Pharmacy membership increased by 1.6 million lives sequentially, primarily reflecting growth in government programs. Total pharmacy claims processed grew nearly 7% above the prior year. Nearly 1/2 of this growth was attributable to net new 2021 business, with COVID vaccine administration and new therapy prescriptions also contributing to the year-over-year growth. Note that new therapy prescriptions were adversely impacted in the third quarter 2020 due to the pandemic. Pharmacy adjusted operating income exceeded expectations in the quarter, up more than $150 million or 9.5% year-over-year. The three major drivers of this increase remain consistent with the second quarter. Improved purchasing economics, reflecting the products and services of our group purchasing organization launched in the second quarter of 2020; continued strength in our Specialty Pharmacy business, driven by 340B administration and increased Pharmacy claims volumes, both of which were partially tempered by ongoing, but stable client pricing pressure. Our Retail business delivered strong results this quarter, again, exceeding expectations. Total revenue of just under $25 billion increased by $2.3 billion or 10% year-over-year. There are two main components to this increase. Approximately half or $1.2 billion is attributable to the contributions from the more than 11 million COVID vaccines and over 8 million COVID tests we administered, combined with strong front store sales driven by demand for over-the-counter COVID test kits and related treatment categories. With this quarter's results, we're now on pace to deliver about 44 to 49 million COVID vaccines and 28 to 33 million COVID tests for full-year 2021. The remaining half, or $1.1 billion was driven by a combination of sustained pharmacy growth in broad strength in front-store trends across a range of categories, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure. This strong revenue growth combined with a 70 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin, produced adjusted operating income that exceeded our forecast, and drove a year-over-year increase of $300 million. This adjusted operating income growth driven by COVID testing, vaccines and front store sales was partially tempered by continued Pharmacy reimbursement pressure, business investments, including the minimum wage increase, and other performance incentives, and increased staffing to provide expanded levels of service. Turning to cash flows and the balance sheet, our liquidity and capital position remained excellent at the end of the third quarter, with cash from operations of 5.5 billion for the quarter, and 14.3 billion year-to-date. Through our proactive liability management transaction in August, we paid down $1.1 billion in net long-term debt in the quarter. As of the end of the third quarter of 2021, we have repaid a net total of $18.7 billion in long-term debt since the close of the Aetna transaction. In addition, we returned over $650 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend. Let me now discuss our updated 2021 guidance. As Karen noted earlier, we are raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance range this morning by $0.20 to $7.90 to $8 per share. This increase reflects a strong performance and pharmacy services and Retail. Partially offset by expected COVID pressure in our healthcare benefits business, specifically in the commercial block. We are raising our total revenue outlook to $286.5 to $290.3 billion and adjusted operating income outlook to $16.4 to $16.6 billion. We are also increasing expected full-year cash flow from operations to a range of $13 to $13.5 billion. Note that this increased cash flow forecast is actually lower than our September year-to-date figure, reflecting expected payments in the 4th quarter that were accrued in 2020, including FICA taxes, an increased minimum loss ratio rebates, as well as the timing of receipts and payments between the third and fourth quarters. I'll now highlight some key items related to the segments and full-year guidance. For the Healthcare Benefits segment, we are lowering our full-year adjusted operating income guidance from $5.25 billion to $2.355 billion to $4.9 billion to $5 billion. We expect the full-year medical benefit ratio to be in a range of 84.4% to 85.6%, or an increase of 30 basis points from our prior range. This reflects the higher-than-expected commercial COVID medical costs observed in the third quarter and our expectation that these will continue, although at a lower level, into the fourth quarter. Emerging October operational data indicate that COVID in-patient admissions are tracking at approximately 1/2 the levels of September. Again, it is important to remember the degree to which testing costs are driving expenses. So while we expect Q4 testing expenses to be lower than Q3, we do not anticipate they will decline as much as in-patient expense. Finally, recall the normal seasonality of the Healthcare Benefits segment with 4th quarter operating income typically the lowest of the year, driven by deductible satisfaction producing the highest quarterly medical costs. For pharmacy services. Given the continued strength in the quarter and our visibility to the remainder of the year, we are increasing FY2021 adjusted operating income guidance from $6.85 billion to $6.94 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 20.5% to 22%. We anticipate that the strength in 3rd quarter Pharmacy Services results will largely continue into the 4th quarter. In the Retail Long-Term Care Segment, we're also increasing our full-year 2021 adjusted operating income guidance to $6.98 to $7.07 billion. As you consider the fourth quarter, I would note that we currently expect to vaccinations to continue although at a lower rate than the third quarter. We have also contemplated the impact of the CDC's COVID booster recommendations, as well as a modest impact from pediatric vaccinations. We expect testing to decline modestly in comparison with the levels experienced during the third quarter. Given Retail 's Q3 outperformance and Q4 outlook, we now expect the full-year 2021 COVID impact to be neutral. This compares to our prior guidance in August for an overall modest negative net impact. You will find further details regarding our updated guidance in the slide presentation we posted to our website this morning. As we closed the third quarter, we're very pleased with the performance of our businesses, which provides us with a strong foundation as we now look ahead to 2022. While we plan to share more details with you at our upcoming Investor day in early December in New York, I want to update you on our thoughts regarding the 2022 outlook. While there are still many factors to play out, we believe that current analyst estimates for 2022 adjusted EPS of approximately $8.20 are within our anticipated initial guidance range. As we discussed last quarter, there are some significant moving pieces to keep in mind in determining an appropriate baseline for 2021. First, consistent with our standard practice, we exclude prior year's development net of profits returned to customers, and net realized capital gains from our forward-looking guidance. Second, in 2022, we will incur a full year of expense related to our minimum wage increase announced last quarter. We estimate these factors combined, represent approximately $0.40 per share. Using the midpoint of our updated 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range, which is $7.95, these adjustments create a 2021 baseline of $7.55. The other significant factor in considering 2022 performance is the effect that COVID will have on our Retail and Healthcare Benefits businesses. For Retail, we expect that COVID-19 vaccine and testing volume, which is expected to generate over $3 billion of revenue in 2021 will decline significantly in 2022 to 30% to 40% of the volume we administered in 2021. In addition, we expect COVID-driven front store sales to decline in 2022. For HCB, we expect to see a significant improvement in results in 2022, as treatment and testing costs decline with COVID costs estimates and improved risk adjusted revenue reflected in our pricing. Overall, we estimate the COVID-driven impact in HCB will largely be offset by the expected decline in COVID-related retail performance. It is important to note that forecasts of future COVID impacts to our business remain extremely difficult and are subject to change as circumstances dictate. Beyond these considerations, other factors affecting our growth for 2022 remain consistent with the commentary we provided last quarter regarding headwinds and tailwinds. With all of this in mind, the current consensus of analysts\u2019 estimates of approximately $8.20 for adjusted EPS would represent about an 8% increase over the 2021 baseline. To conclude, the strong performance of CVS Health in the first half of 2021 continued in the third quarter, producing strong revenue, adjusted operating income, and cash flow results, and we are pleased to again raise our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance. During the pandemic, we have solidified our opportunity to become a national leader in healthcare delivery, which at its core starts and ends with lowering the cost of care, improving access and convenience, ultimately enabling people to live healthier and more fulfilling lives. During our Investor Day in a few weeks, we look forward to sharing with you more about our path over the coming years to deliver on this ambition and to position CVS Health, to generate sustainable, low double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We will now open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator :  In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one quick follow-up. We'll take our first question from Mike Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Mike Cherny : Good morning. Thanks for the color and congratulations on the results and especially Shawn, thanks for the early '22 views. I'm sure there will be some other questions there. I did want to get into something on the pharmacy side for next year. You talked about the COVID headwinds year-over-year, which is very much expected. That being said, you also have the positive news on the TRICARE side and re-entering their network. As you think about that, either as an example, for your network approach or just getting back to what's hopefully steady-state performance. How is the overall trend going relative to network participation, preferred network participation? What that means for CVS 's ability to offset some of those COVID headwinds with sustained script growth and share gains. Neela Montgomery : Thanks for that. It's Neela here. We continue to see underlying script growth around the 5% level, which is good both compared to the market and our historical averages. So that's our forward assumptions for '22 as we plan for it, and as you mentioned, Tricare was a good win for us starting December the 15th, and we're pleased to be back in the network. But it's part of a number of network needs that are happening in '22, which mean will be above level of growth moving forward. Shawn Guertin : Mike, I would say, as well, when you think about this issue more broadly, to Neela's point. This is an example of one of the things I think that we've continued to do to try to tackle it, and one is obviously get more volume and more participation to help offset that. But it's also looking at cost of goods sold and looking not only at just improving that, but looking, thinking, and considering new models that we might be able to embark on to deal with this. The pressures here continue to exist, but they are stable, and certainly it's something we were thinking about as we think about next year. The one thing I would say is, certainly, all of these things are all designed to sort of basically produce a balanced, sustainable economic model in the long term. Mike Cherny : Great, thanks. Operator : We'll take our question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning. Karen, I just want to go back to as we started 2021, you talked about introducing a new low or no co-pay for the MinuteClinic, low or no co-pay for generics at CVS. I think you talked about 6 million people in that program, then today you made a comment around shifting towards primary care. I just want to better understand how do we think about the roll out of this in combination with a virtual 360 that you will offer going into 2022. My first question would be, did you see the opportunity to really lower the cost trend when we think about those members that utilized, for example, the MinuteClinic and the Retail Pharmacy of CVS, and is that being masked because of COVID, that we're not really seeing that trend come through? Then secondly, as we think about plan design going into next year, can you maybe just spend a minute and talk about where you see the biggest opportunities? Do you feel the need to own or now employ primary care physicians? Karen Lynch : Good morning, Lisa, and a lot of questions there, and we actually really look forward to sharing much more of our strategy when we meet in December. But let me just give you a brief overview. I would start with as we kind of look at the consumer, obviously the consumer has been incredibly challenged by the complexity of the healthcare system and our overall strategy is to make sure that we can provide them access points with lower costs higher-quality. With convenience and overall engagement, and we think, those factors will help us with the long-term strategy driving down healthcare costs. As we think about, you mentioned, our MinuteClinics and our trends. We have now 7.5 million people that have this 0 co-pay or low cost co-pay. We have started to see the Aetna members utilizing those services. Obviously, that's a lower site of care. It is convenient. We've also expanded the services, as I mentioned earlier, adding behavioral health care. We've seen repeat customers coming there. Obviously we are starting to get traction with the Aetna members with these plan designs and we feel quite good about it. Now, your question around primary care and what we think we need to do here is, primary care is a small component of overall medical costs. I think we all recognize that, but it wields significant influence on the total medical costs picture. So as you think about us managing and navigating care for our patients, we really believe that we need to kind of push into the primary care so we can influence the overall cost of care, and by doing that, we think that we can have better engagement, help customers better navigate, and obviously have higher quality, lower cost of care, and so that's the intent here of really pushing into primary care, and we expect to see continued evolution of our plan designs, if you think about our overall care strategy, it's virtual care. It's in the community, and it's in the home. If you look at what we did this year with our virtual primary care offering, clearly, we were able to be in the market early. We have 750,000 people now that are eligible for that virtual primary care. We connected that virtual primary care with an in-person connection with our MinuteClinic, and also in the home with diagnostic bio-metric monitoring. So you can see that we're innovating around the consumer and that's how we think we're going to really change the game in healthcare is innovating around the consumer. Lisa Gill : Is there a way to quantify that, as far as medical cost trend or anything that we should think about as we see incremental adoption of these kinds of programs. Or is that something you're going to talk about at the Analyst Day? Karen Lynch : We'll talk about that as well. But I think the two things that we'll be monitoring is do we expect incremental growth because of our product design? Yes, and then do we see improvements in overall trends, and we would expect to see that. We'll give you kind of more insights into our kind of longer-term goals here, but that would be the expectation growth in medical cost improvement. Lisa Gill : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : We will take our next question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. A.J., your line is open. A.J. Rice: Sorry about that. Hi, everyone. Obviously, the Pharmacy Services business continues to perform very well. When you look at the high retention rate is there any of that that's being driven by customers just deciding that they want to delay a big RFP for another year as they try to get employees back. How much of that activity did you see and when it comes to where you're getting the winds, maybe just expand a little bit on where in particular. Is it in the middle market? Is it with the large account that you're picking up business? What particularly of your marketing effort is resonating to get those new ends? Alan Lotvin : A.J., it's Alan, thank you for the questions. So I'll answer in order. So the first one with respect to the retention rate, we didn't really see a tremendously different selling season in '21 going into '22 than we have in the past, and that's I think a function of the size. We generally focus on 5,000 lives and above. We obviously go through a process when we can avoid an RFP. We do, but many of those were active competitive RFPs. When I think about why and where our sales came, it was in all segments of the market, right? We won in health plans, we won in Medicaid, we won in all pretty much all segments that we participate in, and I think we win for 3 reasons : We win, 1. primarily, because we demonstrated the ability to manage drugs spend particularly in Specialty Pharmacy, where you know it's critically important, 2. We've maintained extraordinarily high levels of service and built on that service with a culture of transparency and building trust with our clients and aligning our incentives, 3, and finally on innovation and bringing new tools to market largely in the specialty area to help our clients better manage trend and create better experiences for both providers and patients. A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : We'll take our next question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about the Healthcare Benefits business from '21 to '22 specifically in Medicare Advantage. Can you talk show on a little bit about how that business has performed this year, where trends are running versus normal, and how you expect it to bounce back? Sorry about that. In 2022? Shawn Guertin : I will look at that barking dog barking at me here so. No, it's a very important question. Obviously, Medicare is the biggest single premium block that we have in HCB, and so its performance is critical to HCB's performance. The good news, I would say on this is that since we have submitted our bids, our Medicare experience the last 2 quarters has been completely in line, if not, a little better than that, and so we still feel good about our baseline and our forward provision for that. We continue to see deferred care i.e. some utilization less than normal in this business, and that did continue this quarter, but we're continuing in our forecasting to assume that that is going to go away over time and continue to sort of edge back to normal. Certainly by the bulk of 2022, we would anticipate that. So from a margin standpoint, I think this business feels like it is. I'm very sound footing. In terms of looking at our benefits, I think we feel good about where we are, both growth and margin wise when we think about next year, and as I mentioned, it's super early in the AEP, but we feel good about what we've seen so far. Justin Lake : Just a quick follow-up, specifically, Shawn. The rates were so strong for 2022, and hopefully, everyone's getting back their risk scores after a tough '21. Do you think yourselves, and what you've seen in the industry, are positioned to absorb something, maybe a little bit more than a 100% of typical trends? It feels like given where the rates are maybe one-on-one or even more could be absorbed before you'd have a margin issue next year. Shawn Guertin : Yes. I wouldn't want to forecast that now, mainly just because of the difficulties I think that exist sort of around this whole deferred utilization kind of COVID interplay. You're certainly right. It was a good reimbursement year. We're able to do a lot of things, sort of, in our benefit design, and again, I think it's part of my comfort with sort of the foundation that that business is going into '22 up on. Justin Lake : Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Hi, thanks for the comments and color on 2022. I just wanted to confirm or ask for clarification here. I think your comments suggested that from a COVID perspective, the 2022 your initial view is also that that would be approximately neutral. Can you confirm whether or not that was the case when you're talking about those factors? Shawn Guertin : Yes, that is what I said. Stephen Baxter : Okay. Perfect, and then the commentary on your initial expectations, expectations around vaccine and testing contribution decreasing to about 30% or 40% of 2021 levels. Obviously, it's dynamic, but any directional color on how you're thinking about vaccines related to testing in spite of that. Shawn Guertin : They both are down fairly significantly in that same general range. I think we have testing down right now a little bit more than vaccines for next year, and I want to be clear too that we did the 30 to 40%, we said it was a volume number, the number we will administer. At present, I would assume sort of some of the same profile of margin that we have today. But again, that could be also a factor subject to change next year. Stephen Baxter : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Hi, good morning, and congrats on the quarter and the 2020 to comments. Quick questions here on capital deployment. You're on track to bring down debt to your target levels. If you look to innovate around the consumer, what role do you anticipate M&A will have and maybe you can rank order for us, your capital deployment priorities, and then when we think about it, long-term sort of guide that you provided of low double-digit, does that include M&A as well? Karen Lynch : I'll start and I'll hand it over to Shawn. As you think about our strategy, we'll lay out our capital deployment in much greater detail. But as you think about managing around the consumer, we have a tremendous amount of assets in our portfolio today, which we can build off on. However, there will be additional capabilities that we think we need to either partner or buy. So that will be part of our overall strategy and I'll ask Shawn to comment on your other question. Shawn Guertin : I'll answer the second one because it's fairly quickly in terms of my long-term kind of goal to get to the low double-digit EPS, what I'd say is that includes capital deployment. That capital deployment in some years can take the form of accretive share repurchases. Some years it can take more of a form of M&A, and as Karen mentioned, our strategy. will require the development of new capabilities, and I think while it's likely some of those we can do ourselves, I think there's some of those that will make more sense for us to acquire along the way. But it is a good and timely question around capital and long term. We're nearing the end of a sort of three or four year deleverage cycle, and I think the next three years are going to look different than the last three years. While we remain committed to our investment-grade target, and we will always manage leverage responsibility, my first priority always with capital is to grow the business, and we mentioned that our strategy might require that. So from year-to-year that can move between, as I mentioned, share repurchase, dividend M&A. But my experience is that a balanced deployment over time has tended to work best, and that might look like something with the M&A aspect, a dividend that grows with EPS in some level of accretive share repurchase. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you and looking forward to seeing you guys in December. Operator : We will take our next question from Eric Percher with Nephron. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Eric Percher : Thank you. The strength in Pharmacy Services was miserable after some cautious commentary last quarter. Relative to expansion of PBM profit per script, I think kind of two items I'd like to focus on here : 1. with the GPO benefits is this primarily CVS or is Zinc benefiting from added partners and their scale, 2, and then on 340B is this development of new strategies to serve covered entities or is it natural growth in the program, what's the driver in that piece? Alan Lotvin : Hi Eric. It's Alan Lotvin. How are you? On the on the GPO answer, principally, this is CVS, volume and capabilities that are being brought to market. We have a partner, but I would say it's mostly the CVS volume. With respect to 340B there are a few things that drive the growth. So think about 340B in 2 ways, right. One is we provide third-party administrative services to covered entities. So as we grow the number of covered entities, we grow the size of the contribution. The 2nd area is dispensing margin. We get paid a fixed fee for dispensing the drugs on behalf of the covered entities. So as volume grows, both because Specialty is growing as an example, as our book of business grows from new wins, and as our covered entity book of business grows, all 3 of those contribute to volume growth. Sorry, I would just add with last point was that volume growth substantially benefits the covered entities, and as you know, many of the covered entities are dependent upon the 340B program for their for their financial health. Eric Percher : Right, and then maybe just a quick follow-up. We're starting to see a little bit more of the structure among what damage may propose, one of those was transparency provisions. What is your perspective on what increased requirements around transparency would mean at this point in the rebate game? Alan Lotvin : So we've done a lot of work on the original version of the transparency role at it creates a really tremendous administrative burden for everyone in the system. I think at this point when you think about transparency and rebates, essentially all large clients or even mid-sized clients are now have a 100% pass-through of rebates. Many of them have extensive audit rights. So to some extent, I think this is quite frankly solving a problem that's already been solved commercially. Eric Percher : Thank you for that. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just for the comments around the fourth quarter of '21 and non-COVID utilization. Can you remind us what your assumption is for the fourth-quarter specifically for just overall non-COVID, as a percent of pre-COVID baseline. Gathered for the whole book of business or just broke it out between commercial and government, and just want to confirm also that the increase in the MBR sounds like it is related new more, specifically, to direct COVID costs. Just want to confirm there is no change to your outlook for the non-covered utilization into the fourth quarter? Thanks. Shawn Guertin : Sorry, my mic wasn't on. Yeah, on the 2nd one, you're correct. The MLR increases entirely driven by COVID. Fairly consistently over the last couple of quarters, the non-COVID utilization has been at, and even better in some places than expected. So the underlying business continues to look strong from that regard, so the increase is clearly COVID. As I mentioned, we do expect that we will see deferred utilization in the 4th quarter, but we're only assuming half the level that we experienced in Q3, and you could think about that a little bit from where we are today, taking half the step back to kind of zero deferred utilization. Where this is, is very similar to my commentary last time. Commercial has the least amount of deferred utilization right now in the system, and governments also. Government probably has the most with Medicare, having a little less than Medicaid at this stage. But we see all of those moving back towards normal in the fourth quarter, and as we think about next year. Steven Valiquette : Okay, great. Thanks. Susie Lisa : With that, we're going to conclude the Q&A portion of the call, and I'll turn it back to Karen. Karen Lynch : First of all, thank you for joining us today. CVS Health reported another strong quarter, exceeding expectations and driving growth in all of our core businesses in a very fluid market. We continue to demonstrate progress, executing on our strategy to create an integrated healthcare experience centered around the consumer, and I am very grateful for the 300,000 dedicated colleagues who continue to deliver every day, helping America combat COVID and its variance, including flu and other everyday health challenges. We do look forward to seeing you all in December in New York. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, and this concludes today's CVS Health Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call and Webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. 2021 was an important year for CVS Health. We exceeded our financial goals, we advanced our strategy and we brought greater value to the people we serve playing a critical role in the nation's pandemic response. We ended a strong 2021 with another strong quarter. We exceeded our adjusted EPS expectations for the fourth quarter in a row delivering $1.98 adjusted EPS in the final quarter of 2021 and $8.40 adjusted EPS for the full year. We are entering 2022 with powerful momentum. We are delivering health care solutions that are personalized, connected and increasingly digital. We are engaging millions of consumers across our businesses and in our community health destinations across America. CVS Health is becoming a bigger part of their everyday health. Turning now to our performance. For the full year 2021, CVS Health grew adjusted revenue by 8.8% to $292 billion. We delivered adjusted operating income of $17.3 billion, up 8.1% year-over-year, and we increased adjusted earnings per share by 12%. We generated strong cash flow from operations of nearly $18.3 billion for the full year, exceeding our most recent guidance of at least $13.5 billion. This strong performance positions us well for 2022. At this early stage of the year, we are maintaining our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $8.10 to $8.30. Our forecast reflects increased volume from COVID testing and front store sales in our retail business relative to our forecast at Investor Day, offset by the accelerated timing of vaccine boosters pulled into the fourth quarter of 2021. Shawn will provide more details on our results and guidance shortly. Our 2021 performance demonstrates our ability to anticipate, deliver, and exceed consumers' expectations for health care. Consumers are a major force driving change in health care and we continue to engage successfully with individuals in more places and on their terms, virtually in the home and in their local community. Customers and clients continue to realize the superior value we are providing with our integrated health solutions, particularly those that address the most prevalent, costly and complex health conditions, such as diabetes, cancer and chronic kidney disease. Turning to the segment highlights. In Health Care Benefits, we delivered 9.4% adjusted revenue growth for the full year 2021, driven by our performance in Government Services. We had another strong year of Medicare growth with increases across all product lines. Total Medicare Advantage membership grew at 9.8% on a year-over-year basis, as we added over 265,000 new members in 2021 and exceeded our initial growth expectations. As a result of our strategic focus on dual-eligible special needs plans, enrollment nearly doubled in 2021. Our full year medical benefit ratio of 85% was in line with our guidance expectations. For the full year 2021, the utilization of total health care services in aggregate was in line with normalized historical baseline levels. Turning to 2022, we had an impressive annual enrollment period in our Medicare business. For the second consecutive year, we grew all Medicare product lines, and our growth rates this year exceed the industry averages in all categories. We grew total Medicare Advantage membership by 11.6% versus the prior year, reflecting increases in individual and group Medicare Advantage of over 15% and 6%, respectively, year-over-year. We also led the industry in absolute Medicare PDP net membership growth. This added nearly 295,000 net new members, while the overall PDP market continues to decline. We had a solid 2022 selling season in our national accounts Commercial business. We expect to grow membership in the low single digits for the full year and maintained strong client retention of 96%. Our success is driven by the combination of our competitive cost structure, our integrated benefit designs, including medical and pharmacy, and products and services that utilize CVS Health capabilities, such as Transform Care Diabetes and Virtual Primary Care programs. Membership enrollment was lower than expected in the eight ACA individual exchanges we entered this year. We continue to build this business gradually, with select geographic expansion, a focused price discipline and the appeal of co-branded Aetna CVS Health offerings. Consistent with our prior guidance, we do not expect this offering to contribute materially to our financial results in 2022. Overall, our deep understanding of consumer needs, innovative product portfolio and our service excellence will drive growth in our Health Care Benefits segment. Our comprehensive range of products and benefit design that address consumers' whole health needs remains a key differentiator and fueled a strong selling season. For 2022, we forecast 7% to 9% revenue growth and 15% to 17% adjusted operating income growth. Turning to Pharmacy Services, we delivered 7.8% revenue and 20.6% adjusted operating income growth in 2021. We continue to be a consultative partner to our clients and members. We're delivering industry-leading cost trends and savings, service excellence and a broad product portfolio and a commitment to transparency. We consistently create value for our customers and clients with our better-than-market drug trend. We continue to enhance our utilization programs to ensure access to the therapeutics that are the most clinically appropriate. For 2022, we achieved a client retention rate of over 98% and drove $8.8 billion of net new business revenue. We are a leader in specialty pharmacy, delivering revenue growth of 12.3% for the fourth quarter and 9.3% for the full year versus prior period. Our specialty pharmacy programs drive value in the marketplace and they differentiate us as we pair programs with digital capabilities to deliver a convenient and connected experience. For Pharmacy Services in 2022, we expect 6% to 8% revenue growth and 7% to 9% adjusted operating income growth, as we create long-term value for our clients, and our members. Our retail segment plays a critical role as a community health destination for millions of Americans. This segment outperformed the industry and our expectations in 2021. We grew revenue 9.8% year-over-year to just over $100 billion, marking an important milestone in the history of this CVS Health business. We delivered an exceptional 24% adjusted operating income growth in 2021. Pharmacy sales and prescriptions filled both increased by nearly 9% year-over-year. This was notably driven by consumers who came to CVS Health for COVID-19 vaccine administration. For the full year 2021, CVS Health administered more than 32 million COVID-19 tests and more than 59 million vaccines. Over 35% of COVID-19 vaccines in 2021 were administered during the fourth quarter. Our work to test and vaccinate America for COVID is a powerful example of the relationships we are building with consumers, which leads to new customers seeking a range of other health services at CVS Health. Front store sales growth was strong throughout 2021, up 8.4% versus the prior year. They were led by consumer demand for the over-the-counter COVID-19 tests, as well as cough and cold, beauty and personal care products. We sold over 22 million OTC COVID-19 tests, with approximately 70% of sales in the fourth quarter. We are progressing on optimizing our retail portfolio and pivoting our stores into three formats : primary care clinics, enhanced health hubs and traditional CVS pharmacy locations. We are executing our plan to dedensify stores based on consumer health and buying needs, omnichannel preferences and shifts in the U.S. population. For 2022, as I mentioned, given the earnings outperformance and pull forward of vaccine boosters in 2021, we are maintaining our 2022 guidance. This now implies retail revenue to be plus or minus 1% versus prior year, and a low 20% decline in adjusted operating income growth. Shawn will provide more details. Our digital approach is focused on delivering a superior experience for consumers by creating a more connected and seamless health journey. We are making progress towards setting a new standard for digital health care for consumers. cvs.com is one of the top health websites with over 2 billion visits in 2021, up nearly 55% over the prior year. Our digital capabilities for health interactions such as COVID testing and vaccines, prescription services and sales of health and wellness products have dramatically increased consumer engagement across all CVS Health businesses. We now serve 40 million customers digitally, up approximately 10% in the last six months alone. In 2021, we launched several new digital health services powered by advanced analytics to personalize the experience. We made it easier to join our CarePass program reaching 5.6 million subscribers in the quarter, up more than 40% year-over-year. We integrated CarePass for our Aetna Commercial members and are excited about the adoption we are seeing. We also simplified the CarePass enrollment for all consumers, which is driving more growth in subscribers. For our HealthHUB and MinuteClinic patients, we simplified and digitized the check-in process for patients. Our self-service digital tool enables individuals to complete traditional paperwork in advance of their appointment. Almost 80% of patients are already utilizing this capability. At our Investor Day, we promised a superior health care experience for consumers that will improve health outcomes, lower cost and provide broader access to care. We are making several moves to realize our vision for health care. We're advancing our care delivery capabilities, optimizing our retail portfolio and further diversifying the health products and services that we offer. We're driving this evolution both through internal initiatives and by seeking to execute capability-focused M&A for complementary health services. We will connect consumers in more places, in more ways and on their terms, with our digital-first technology-forward approach as well as an enhanced omnichannel health experience. These strategic moves will accelerate the growth of our foundational businesses. In all this work, we will place the consumer at the center of all that we do. We remain focused on delivering on our commitment to sustainability for our shareholders, our customers and our communities. We recently launched CVS Health Zones aim to advance health equity and to address social determinants of health in high-risk communities. We are collaborating with trusted national and local organizations to confront the six key social determinants of health through local investments. Our goal is to equip communities with the resources needed to close gaps in care for specific health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. Health Zones is now active in five geographies with additional markets planned in 2022. We remain committed to the environment and have pledged to reduce our overall impact, cutting greenhouse gas emissions across our operations and supply chain and decreasing resource consumption, especially paper and plastic. In December, CVS Health was named to the 2021 S&P Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index for the 9th consecutive year and the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 3rd consecutive year. Our financial performance, execution, portfolio of assets and differentiated strategy all create strong momentum into 2022 and a clear pathway to achieve low double-digit adjusted EPS growth over time. I would also like to take a moment to recognize the continued contribution of our colleagues who have played a vital role in helping our nation prevail over the pandemic. I am proud of what we have done and are doing every day to make a difference. With that, let me turn it over to Shawn. Shawn Guertin : Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter results reflect the continuation of the strong performance delivered in the first three quarters of the year, as we once again exceeded our expectations for revenue, cash flow and adjusted earnings per share. We maintained our focus on growth, operational execution and supporting the communities we serve as the effects of the pandemic persists. Starting with the enterprise as a whole. Total fourth quarter adjusted revenues of $76.6 billion increased by 10.6% year-over-year. We reported adjusted operating income of $4.1 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.98, representing an increase of 40.8% and 52.3% versus prior year, respectively. For full year 2021, we reported total adjusted revenues of $292.1 billion, an increase of 8.8% versus prior year, reflecting robust growth across all business segments. We delivered adjusted operating income of $17.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $8.40, up approximately 8.1% and 12% year-over-year, respectively. And we generated significant cash flow from operations of nearly $18.3 billion. This marks a record year of cash flow from operations for CVS Health and reflects the strength of our financial results, accelerated collections and focused improvements and our working capital position. Turning to the Health Care Benefits segment. Fourth quarter adjusted revenue of $20.7 billion increased by 10.1% year-over-year, driven by membership growth in our Government Services business and lower COVID-19-related investments, slightly offset by the repeal of the health insurer fee. Adjusted operating income of $510 million grew by over 230% year-over-year driven by lower COVID-19 related investments and improved underlying performance, partially offset by higher COVID-related medical costs compared to prior year. Our adjusted medical benefit ratio of 87% improved 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower COVID-19 related investments, partially offset by the repeal of the health insurer fee. As a result of the Omicron variant, we experienced higher COVID testing and treatment costs in the fourth quarter, but this was largely offset by lower non-COVID costs, particularly in Medicare and Medicaid. Days claims payable at the end of the quarter was 49 and was, as expected, lower than the third quarter and consistent with normal seasonal trends and historic levels. Overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. In the Pharmacy Services segment, fourth quarter revenues of $39.3 billion increased by 8.2% year-over-year, driven by increased pharmacy claims volume, growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation, partially offset by the impact of continued client price improvements. Total pharmacy membership increased by approximately 400,000 lives sequentially, reflecting sustained growth in government programs. Total pharmacy claims processed increased by 8.2% above prior year. Approximately half of this growth was attributable to net new business in 2021, with COVID-19 vaccine administration and new therapy prescriptions also contributing to the year-over-year growth. Adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion grew 16.8% year-over-year, driven by improved purchasing economics, reflecting the products and services of our group purchasing organization, and growth in specialty pharmacy. The quarter also reflected additional investments to support a successful welcome season. In our Retail Long-Term Care segment, we delivered exceptional revenue and adjusted operating income growth versus prior year and once again exceeded our expectations. Fourth quarter revenue of $27.1 billion was up by 12.7% year-over-year, representing an increase of $3 billion. There are two main components to this increase; one, approximately 60% was driven by the administration of COVID-19 vaccines and testing, front store sales, including demand for over-the-counter COVID test kits and related treatment categories, as well as strong COVID-related prescription volume. The remaining 40% was attributable to a combination of underlying sustained pharmacy growth and broad strength in front store sales trends, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure. This strong revenue growth helped produce adjusted operating income of $2.5 billion. This quarterly result was 38% above prior year and significantly exceeded our forecasts. The increase in adjusted operating income was driven by a few key components; the administration of COVID-19 vaccines, underlying strength in pharmacy and front store sales, and a $106 million gain from an antitrust legal settlement, which were partially offset by the combined impacts of ongoing but stable reimbursement pressure, and business investments, including the minimum wage increase and store improvements. In terms of the improved performance in the quarter versus our expectations, there are two primary components. Approximately 75% was driven by vaccines, largely third dose boosters, which we previously expected to impact the first quarter of 2022. And the remaining 25% was driven by the nationwide surge in demand for over-the-counter and diagnostic COVID-19 testing, combined with stronger underlying front store sales performance. Looking at cash flow and the balance sheet. Our liquidity and capital position remained strong at the end of the fourth quarter with full year cash flow from operations of nearly $18.3 billion and non-restricted cash of over $3.8 billion. Through our proactive liability management transaction in December, we paid down $2.3 billion in long-term debt in the quarter, bringing the total long-term debt we have repaid since the close of the Aetna transaction to a net total of $21 billion. In addition, we returned over $2.6 billion to shareholders through our quarterly dividends in 2021. Our consistent outperformance during 2021 provides solid momentum as we head into this year, setting the stage for our continued strong outlook in 2022 despite multiple COVID unknowns that remain challenging to predict, such as additional variants, vaccine and testing protocols, and government testing initiatives. As Karen noted earlier, we are maintaining our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $8.10 to $8.30. We feel this is an appropriate stance at this early point in the year, especially given the earnings outperformance of retail in Q4 was due largely to the pull forward of third dose vaccine administration from 2022 into 2021. This represents 2% to 5% growth versus our revised 2021, adjusted earnings per share baseline of $7.92. As you think about the adjusted earnings per share baseline and year-over-year growth, I'd like to encourage you to keep a few things in mind. First, recall that our 2021 baseline of $7.92 removes items we do not forecast, prior year's development, net of profits returned to customers and net realized capital gains. It also includes the annualized impact of our investment in our colleagues through an increase in minimum wage. Second, it is also important to note that the baseline now includes a net favorable component attributable to COVID-19 driven by vaccines and testing of approximately $0.30 per share. CVS Health continues to help lead the nation's COVID-19 pandemic response, clearly demonstrating the power of our integrated business model, consumer engagement and local community health destinations. While there is no change to our Retail segment guidance, I would like to provide more detail on our COVID-19 retail volume assumptions for 2022. We expect that COVID-19 testing both in-store diagnostic and over-the-counter will continue at higher volumes than anticipated at Investor Day, offset by a reduced outlook on vaccines. In 2022, we expect vaccine volumes to decline approximately 70% to 80% and in-store diagnostic testing volumes to decline 40% to 50% compared to 2021. For over-the-counter test kits, we expect modest full-year volume growth versus 2021. Relative to vaccines, our outlook does not assume any impact from the administration of a fourth COVID-19 booster. As such, we expect the contribution of COVID-19 vaccines to be more heavily weighted to the first half of the year. As I mentioned, the impact of COVID-19 remains one of the most challenging aspects of developing our guidance due to many factors, including the risk of additional surges, potential new testing or vaccine protocols, legislative changes, and OTC test kit dynamics such as supply challenges, coverage mandates and government initiatives. You will find additional details regarding our updated guidance in the slide presentation we posted to our website this morning.  Turning to items that are below adjusted operating income on our income statement, we expect our interest expense for 2022 to be approximately $2.3 billion. We are purchasing shares to offset dilution. And as a result, we expect that diluted share count to be approximately flat versus 2021. Our expectation for the effective income tax rate is approximately 25.6%, consistent with 2021. In terms of cash flow and capital deployment, we anticipate continued strong cash flow from operations in 2022, and we are updating our guidance range to $12 billion to $13 billion, reflecting the improved cash flow results for 2021. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion as we invest in technology and digital enhancements to improve the consumer experience as well as our community locations. As we detailed in December, we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings, while also having the flexibility to deploy capital strategically for capability-focused M&A. To conclude, the strong 2021 performance of CVS Health is expected to carry into 2022 as we continue to execute our strategy. We have solidified our leadership role in healthcare delivery as a trusted partner to our consumers and their communities. As we build upon this trust, we will continue to drive meaningful improvements that lower the cost of care, improve access and build engagement and convenience, ultimately enabling people to live healthier lives. We will now open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator :  We'll take our first question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning and thanks for all the detail. Karen, I just want to go back to the comment that you made about how to think about the stores in the future. Primary care, HealthHUB enhanced and traditional, how do I think about the breakdown between each of those? And then secondly, you talked about making incremental acquisitions around healthcare services, do you need to by physicians to make the primary care clinics work? And how do I think about the other enhanced services that you'll bring to the overall CVS offering? Karen Lynch : Good morning, Lisa. So let me just start with the three parts of the retail portfolio. As we said, we'll have primary care clinics, which would serve as a quarter back and serve as the patient's primary care medical home. And our HealthHUB, the way you should think about HealthHUB is they'll extend kind of the primary care for specific lower-risk use cases, which will allow us to expand the patient panel size with the primary care and obviously, lower cost. The HealthHUB will also serve as that extender in virtual care. And our pharmacies will leverage kind of the existing touch points to provide the ancillary and complementary services like actions and medication inherence programs. And then you'd have the third ring, which would just be your typical CVS pharmacy. So if you think about -- we'll have a differentiated experience where we have the primary care clinics. We'll have coordinated assets. We'll bring the breadth of services. We'll connect through a single digital ecosystem. And then we'll have kind of -- and we'll invest in making sure that we're connecting the patient data, the provider workflows that digital front end, so that we'll have a seamless patient and provider experience. That's the goal. Now you mentioned -- we mentioned at Investor Day, Lisa, that we would look at M&A activity to supplement our primary care services, we will -- we are continuing to evaluate our options there. And when we have more to talk about on that front, we'll be sure to share that with you. Lisa Gill : Karen, can you -- just when we think about the three and you think about the number of pharmacies, is there a way to put a number around them? As far as like -- will one-third of them be primary care clinics, half of them is -- is there any number that you've put around the number of each in each bucket? Karen Lynch : Yes. I wouldn't specifically focus on a number. What we're really focusing on is how do we have coverage. And if you think about our HealthHUBs and MinuteClinics today, we actually have coverage of 45% of the -- a little bit over 45% of the US population. So we wouldn't -- and we'd want to have good, strong coverage for our Aetna and our Caremark health plan customers as well. So I look at it as coverage, not necessarily numbers. Lisa Gill : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Lance Wilkes : Yes. Good morning. Kind of a related question on the primary care strategy and, overall, how you integrate that in with Aetna. I was interested in what sorts of patient types, I'm thinking about like segments such as Medicare, Medicaid and employer, you'd be more focused on for the primary care? And if that helps you to define, what sorts of capabilities you're looking to add into our targets? Thanks. Karen Lynch : Hi, Lance. Good morning. I'll start, and I'll ask Shawn to supplement here. What we said was we would look -- obviously, Medicare is our largest growth driver. We've been very successful, as I mentioned, to you with our growth. That is a growth engine for the company. So we would be focused on that. But not primarily, obviously, these clinics would serve a variety of different patients, and we would build them out. So we would have the opportunity to support other members with our -- with those primary care clinics. And let me ask Shawn to add here. Shawn Guertin : Yes. No, Lance. I would agree with that. I mean I think that our long-term aspiration, especially given the size of the company, right, is to have sort of a broad cross-section of customer types. But clearly, Medicare is an important business for Aetna. Frankly, the preponderance of chronic conditions in that population, I think, make it a population that would benefit tremendously sort of from the strategy. And obviously, today, there's also an economic model that works there. So Medicare is important for a variety of reasons. But ultimately, we would look to serve the local communities and the populations that exist. And I think the footprint and the nature of sort of our community assets will flex to serve the local populations. But Medicare is key, but the ultimate aspiration is a broad cross-section of customers. Lance Wilkes : Should we think of the additional health services that you'd be looking at as also being kind of focused maybe initially more on Medicare like home care and those sorts of areas as potential expansion targets? Shawn Guertin : Yes. It's hard to predict the exact order with which things will potentially show up if you're -- if this is something you decide that you'd rather acquire than build. But yes, absolutely things that make sense to sort of extend sort of the care continuum. Again, particularly to a Medicare population would make a lot of sense and they'd be high on the list. Lance Wilkes : Thanks. Operator : And our next question will come from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matt, are you there? Matthew Borsch : Oh, I\u2019m sorry. My mute button, I clicked it, but I didn\u2019t click. Medicare Advantage, there's been a lot of chatter, as you all know about, increased competition being an issue for some of the other companies. Are you confident in your growth strategy coming into this year given all that sort of backlash from competitors and the very impressive growth numbers that you're pointing to achieve from the open enrollment? Karen Lynch : Matt, we've had a long-standing growth strategy for Medicare. And I'd just remind everyone that we have a broad portfolio of Medicare products that isn't just focused on individual. We have group Medicare, our PDP business and Med Sup. We had a very strong open enrollment period. We attribute that obviously to our strength in our product designs, our Stars performance, our products and services, our connections with the broader portfolio of assets that we have.  As we look to 2023, clearly, the rate notice was positive. It looked like CMS was keeping with the stability that will allow us to have continued flexible benefit design. So we're confident in our strategy. Obviously, there -- it's a competitive marketplace, and we'll continue to play to our strengths. And let me ask Dan if he has anything he wants to add here. Dan Finke : Thanks, Karen. I think you said it really well. Look, we've been really deliberate around our growth strategy here across the entire portfolio, making sure that we can provide really solid benefits to the senior population really focused on our footprint coverage, inclusive of our D-SNP and that played out during AEP. And so like you said, we feel really confident in our growth expectations for 2022. Matthew Borsch : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning. I was also going to ask a question on Medicare, so part of it was answered. But I guess at investor conference last month, you guys touched on your internal distribution capabilities for individual MA. So I'm curious if you're able just to provide more color on the mix of how much of your -- either the total MA book or just the membership growth in the MA book is driven by the internal sales, distribution and marketing capabilities versus the external channels. Thanks. Karen Lynch : Yes. So Steve, we have a number of distribution channels that we rely on for Medicare growth. Clearly, we have the national distribution, the tele service and our own internal proprietary channel. And we've had pretty good strength across all those channels. Obviously, we continue -- the other thing we did this year too is we added resource centers in the CVS Health locations so that people could get educated on Medicare more broadly. I think what's important to look at is the distribution of the book in Medicare, not necessarily where the current sales are going, because that gives you a sense for kind of the future persistency. We had very strong retention across all of our distribution channels and feel good that we have the right focus on the distribution channels. Coupled with that is our marketing capabilities and what we've done \u2013 we continue to do is really gear our marketing capabilities towards growth areas in the market and that has served us well that generated solid growth for us. But let me see if Dan has anything to add here as well. Dan Finke : Karen, I think you said it really well. Look, our strategy is to really use our diversified distribution channels for growth, digital, our personnel, our partners. We do have a robust internal sales force, and I think that the results really speak to our ability to optimize success across all of those channels. Steven Valiquette : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Good morning, thanks for the detail so far. Shawn, I think you said something, I just want to clarify regarding the baseline, and that there's roughly $0.30 of COVID-related impact that's now in the baseline; A, I just want to make sure you got that right -- or I got that right. And then B, regarding that and how it factors into the store performance, clearly, I was again expecting double-digit same-store growth for forever with this business. But as you get further towards what hopefully is the far side of the pandemic, what are the signs you're seeing relative to the new customers you brought into the stores and how you can continue to make them customers in a post-testing, post-vaccine world? Shawn Guertin : Yes. Yes. And let me start on the first, and I'll give you some insight, and I'll have Michelle or Karen talk a little bit about sort of the customer acquisition. But going back to the $0.30, you are correct. So for most of this year, when we've looked at the effect of COVID for the organization, it's been neutral plus or minus between the pressure in HCB and the revenue we're getting on the retail side. In the fourth quarter, one way to think about it is, we had about a $0.40 fee and almost $0.30 of that was sort of sitting in the vaccine and testing, including the OTC line. And HCB came in relatively consistent with expectations. So we've gone from having this be a neutral item to being about a 30% contributor during the year, all really kind of manifesting itself in the fourth quarter. And you're right. I mean, obviously, in 2022, the revenue from the stream of vaccine and diagnostic testing and OTC testing will decrease significantly. But we have seen kind of what I call new customer acquisition. We have seen a lot more traffic in the stores, and that's manifesting itself in more prescriptions and increased basket sizes in some instances. So it's an excellent question that I think we're going to continue to work on, which is how do we maintain that momentum. But we definitely have built some momentum beyond sort of the direct COVID kind of product line here. Michelle Peluso : And Shawn, I would just add from a loyalty perspective, three things. First, the most important thing we've been working on is, making sure that everybody who comes through the door has a great experience. And we've seen overall satisfaction for vaccines and testing is extremely strong. Secondly, using this to drive digital adoption, we see many of these customers come back to get their QR code, their vaccine record and then do things like next best actions, potentially other vaccines that they need to take in the like, so we're seeing strong digital adoption from these customers. And finally, our loyalty programs are critical. You heard Karen mention, CarePass is up over 40% year-over-year. When people become CarePass members, we see incremental engagement. And so it's critical as you build loyalty and retention amongst our many new customers. Shawn Guertin : Yes. And Michael, let me just clarify, I might have said 30% and I meant $0.30. I think that was clear, but just to be abundantly clear. It was $0.30 I was talking about. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to touch on in the 10-K disclosed about the CID. And I know you've been working with the DOJ. But maybe if you could just kind of give sort of your broad thoughts on opioids and sort of the company's stance here currently? Karen Lynch : Shawn, do you want to grab that one. Shawn Guertin : Yeah, yeah, of course. So I think our stance here is very similar to where it's been all along. Our fundamental position is that these prescriptions were written by doctors, not pharmacists. We did not manufacture or market these. And the health care system does rely on pharmacists to fill legitimate prescriptions that doctors are deeming necessary. So based on that, we strongly disagree with the recent court decision in Ohio, and we look forward to the appellate court review of that case. And I'll remind you there that, that was a ruling on liability only, not on damages. But \u2013 and like any litigation, we will \u2013 if we think it's in our interest in the company's interest to sort of resolve matters, we will. But at this point, it's still very early and there's a lot to play out and we remain pretty firmly convicted in our position. Susie Lisa : Next question, Ashley. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Great. Thanks for taking my question. You said earlier you weren't expecting \u2013 your guidance doesn't assume a fourth booster shot, but are you contemplating another different or later COVID surge this year? And how would that \u2013 how do you think a new COVID surge might impact the cadence for the year or the health care benefits business, given we have a potential drug that keeps people out of the hospital? And/or if there's no vaccine, how it would impact the retail part of the business? Shawn Guertin : Yes. So we are not, Kevin, forecasting a surge later in the year, whether it be Delta or Omicron. And again, all of these have been a little bit different. But I'd remind everybody that we have had \u2013 we have two business \u2013 large businesses that have tended to move in opposite directions in these surges and which have largely allowed us to sort of navigate them successfully. So I would say, our overall cadence of earnings right now with that assumption is actually very similar to 2021, a little bit more than half the earnings are in the front of the year. It's all hypothetical, but if we \u2013 we don't have a lot of vaccine volume, for example, right now in the second half of the year. So if that did pick up or if there was a fourth booster, or if there was even more testing activity, that would be certainly something that would sort of lift that on the retail side. But obviously, we have some of the offset on the HCB side. So there are a lot of moving parts, but we've been fortunate to sort of navigate frankly, both the surges because of the kind of the opposite performances of these two businesses in the face of the surge. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. I thought I might ask about the at-home testing. Obviously, there's been a lot of discussion about the mandate for commercial insurers to cover that and so forth. You're saying in your guidance, I guess, you've got modest year-to-year growth. I'm assuming that a lot of that would be what you've seen in January. Can you comment on sort of beyond the first quarter? Do you really have much continued at-home testing? And maybe give a little bit of flavor for your strategy on the retail side as well as on the benefits side network, out of network, how you're dealing with the different ways that you can potentially cover that on the benefit side and then participate on the retail side. Shawn Guertin : A.J., I'm happy to start on the forecast, and I can have Karen, and or Michelle sort of talk about the other side. But most of the OTC test volume is in the first quarter right now, in the first \u2013 certainly, the first half of the year in our forecast. The year-over-year comparisons are a little funny here, because we really didn't have any meaningful volume until the third quarter and almost all the volume is in the fourth quarter. So that was pretty back-end loaded in 2021. And conversely, our forecast, I think, is pretty front-end loaded right now. Obviously, there's a lot of dynamics here that are moving around, whether it be the insurance coverage of the benefit, the free test from the government, supply chain issues. This is a great example of an area where there's an awful lot of moving pieces that make the forecasting challenges. But I think this is also a good example of something that I think we will largely see play out in Q1 and hopefully have a more informed view on this for the full year. Karen Lynch : And A.J., the kind of way we think about it is more testing could lead to earlier diagnosis. And when it's necessary, you could see COVID therapeutics and help minimize the spread of the disease and drive fewer hospitalizations. Relative to the benefits, let me ask Dan to just comment on how we're thinking about coverage and actually what we're doing today. Dan Finke : Yes. Thanks, Karen. I mean our top priority has really been to ensure that our members have access to the tests in a really convenient way. Obviously, supply plays into this. And so early on, as we're looking at making sure that our members have access, we're using our broad network opportunities. But we are working very closely with our retail partners to bring out more convenient digital solution into play that can be even more convenient for our members. Karen Lynch : Yeah. And maybe I'll have Michelle comment on. We are -- we have -- part of our strategy is to become digitally oriented, and we're working on a new digital strategy. So Michelle, maybe share what was in that. Michelle Peluso : Sure thing, Karen. Just like we did with vaccine and testing, our aim is to provide the best experience for consumers, and next week we\u2019ll be launching what we believe will be a really great solution, more consumers can come online, enter their information, and immediately be adjudicated and figure out the stores near them. Pick up the stores -- pick up the test kits in that store for free. So it will be an incredibly smooth digital experience for our customers. So we're excited to launch that next week. A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : And we will take our next question from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Stephen Baxter : Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask about the labor market and your latest thinking there. Obviously, some headlines during the quarter for challenges on the staffing side. And in the release, you mentioned that you hired 45,000 associates through a virtual career day. That seems like a pretty big number relative to the size of your workforce. Hopefully, you can give us an update on where that puts you for staffing today, how many open positions you have, how turnover is trending and how you're thinking your strategy on labor play out from there? Thanks. Karen Lynch : As you know, talent is always our top priority. And as you mentioned, we have been strengthening our workforce despite a very tight labor market, we did have significant hiring throughout the year. And as you might imagine, we weren't immune to some of the Omicron issues and some of our colleagues did get sick, but we were able to maintain strong store hours and pharmacy hours across the country. This is a big focus. I think the minimum wage that we mentioned that we put in place has helped us. Keep in mind that I continue to evaluate that minimum wage to see if there's more that we could or should be doing as we continue to address labor shortages in the country. Next question? Operator : We'll take our next question from Justin Lake with Wolfe. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to see if I can follow-up with a little bit more detail on the membership side. Hoping you can run us through maybe what you're expecting on the Commercial risk book, how you're thinking Medicaid redeterminations play out and how that impacts your Medicaid membership. And I'm not sure if you gave a specific Medicare Advantage membership number that I might have missed. Thanks. Karen Lynch : Thanks. Dan, do you want to grab that? Dan Finke : Yeah, sure. So let me take those in part. I mean, first of all, as Karen mentioned the Commercial book, we've seen some really strong retention in the fourth quarter, certainly related to national accounts. In the fourth quarter, we also saw continuing strong retention and strong sales. We also saw a little bit of shift in that change in force dynamics due to the pandemic that we were expecting, which is good, and that's leading to our lower single-digit growth overall there. As far as Medicare, we had mentioned really strong AEP season. The team is really focused on OEP and making sure that we sustain that momentum. And so we're really confident in our ability to deliver on that double-digit individual growth in 2022. And then the last piece is the Medicaid piece. Look, we're following the PHE really, really closely. Redeterminations are, obviously, something that we're watching as it relates to that. I think it's reasonable to expect that the suspension of redeterminations will continue through the second quarter, and then we'll be monitoring it closely. And of course, working with our state partners to make sure that when that does occur, that's timely and appropriate. We don't consider that to be a sort of a day one event, it will be a gradual process, but we'll work closely with the states around that. Justin Lake : But just to be clear, if your membership guidance, I think, is flat to up slightly for the year and Medicare Advantage is going to grow, give or take, maybe 300,000 members, is most of that decline going to be in Medicaid to kind of offset the growth in Medicare Advantage, or is Commercial also going to decline year-over-year? Dan Finke : Yeah. It will be mostly focused on Medicaid. That component of the redetermination is at play. But recall we also had a large known group that's coming off the books in Medicaid as well. Justin Lake : Great. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. Eric Percher and Josh Raskin here, a question related to labor maybe in the back of the store. In 4Q, did Omicron require you to change either ramp to ramp up or stop a ramp down relative to what expectations of needs in the back of the store are? And how do you view the flexibility of labor in the back of the store, as you see a decline in vaccine and tests? And is some of that offset by the desire to have a pharmacist providing more services from the store? Karen Lynch : Go ahead, Prem. Prem Shah : Yeah. Thanks, Eric. This is Prem. It's a great question. So we are obviously doing three things. One is, if you think about how we're thinking about our pharmacy assets and what I would say is consumer-led, digitally focused, really taking out a lot of work that would be duplicative or challenging, so creating efficiencies in the back of the store. The part of your question around Omicron, has absolutely led to a little bit of what I would say is stress, right? We saw vaccination volumes grow very quickly and then come down. So that also -- we were able to absorb that and be able to deliver that care in a very, what I'd say, is high customer value way in the back of the store in December and in January. And we're definitely continuing to look at our back of the store and creating, what I'd say is a digital-first experience for consumers, but also creating efficiencies across stores when you look at our pharmacy assets and how we can leverage those efficiencies across stores in the back of the store. So absolutely looking at that, there's more to come. And we see a tremendous opportunity there with our large fleet of stores to really maximize our efficiencies. Eric Percher : Thank you. Susie Lisa : One last question, please. Operator : Certainly, we'll take our final question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Great. Thank you. Karen, if I could maybe go back to your comments on the primary care strategy. You talked about to have a digital platform to connect the physical assets that you have. Is that the starting point for this strategy as you think about kind of integrating primary care into the CVS Health business? And do you see this as something that you'd look to develop internally, or could you look externally for these capabilities as we think about the best way to scale this strategy? Thank you. Karen Lynch : Thanks for that question, Nathan. I think digital is a part of the strategy it's not necessarily the driver. I think it's important when you think about the connectivity of care, the continuity of care, the seamless experience you have to have those digital connections. So that will be part of our overall strategy. And we will continue to look at what we can do internally versus what opportunities there are externally as we think about tech stacks and things like that and target companies that we're looking at today. So I'm going to wrap-up the call. So first of all, thank you all for joining us today. As we said, 2021 was really marked by strong financial performance across all of our businesses and very good progress on our strategy. And we are entering into 2022 with very powerful momentum and strong growth across all our businesses. So thank you for joining our call today. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's CVS Health Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call and Webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time. And have a wonderful day.",

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Tom Cowhey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets for CVS Health. Please go ahead. Tom Cowhey : Good morning and welcome to the CVS Health first quarter 2022 earnings call and webcast. I am Tom Cowhey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets for CVS Health. I am joined this morning by Karen Lynch, President and Chief Executive Officer and Shawn Guertin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session that will include Jon Roberts, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Dr. Alan Lotvin, President, Pharmacy Services; Dan Finke, President, Healthcare Benefits; and Michelle Peluso, Chief Customer Officer; and Prem Shah, Chief Pharmacy Officer, both Co-Presidents of the Retail segment. Our press release and slide presentation have been posted to our website, along with our Form 10-Q that we filed this morning with the SEC. Today\u2019s call was also being broadcast on our website, where it will be archived for 1 year. During this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements reflecting current views related to our future financial performance, future events, industry and market conditions as well as the expected consumer benefits of our products and services and our financial projections. Our forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently projected results. We strongly encourage you to review the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our recent current reports on Form 8-K and this morning\u2019s earnings press release and our Form 10-Q. During this call, we will use non-GAAP measures when talking about the company\u2019s performance and financial conditions and you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in this morning\u2019s press release and the reconciliation document posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Karen. Karen? Karen Lynch : Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining our call today. We entered 2022 with significant momentum and delivered strong first quarter results across our business. We grew revenue by over 11% to $76.8 billion and increased adjusted operating income by nearly 7% to approximately $4.5 billion. Adjusted EPS was $2.22, up over 8.5% over the prior year. In the quarter, we generated $3.6 billion of operating cash flows, representing growth of over 20% as compared to the prior year quarter. Our foundational businesses performed well in the quarter. In Health Care Benefits, revenue increased by 12.8% year-over-year. We achieved adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion. We grew membership sequentially and year-over-year. Overall medical costs remain consistent with projected baseline trends. These results reflect our strong product portfolio, our deep understanding of consumers\u2019 health needs and service excellence. In Pharmacy Services, revenue increased by nearly 9% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income grew 8.6% despite a flat year-over-year contribution from our 340B product line. Our results demonstrate the consistent value and savings that we deliver to our customers. In retail, we strengthened our position as a leading community health destination for millions of Americans. We grew revenues by approximately 9% with approximately 15% adjusted operating earnings growth over the prior year. We grew same-store retail scripts by approximately 6%, approaching twice the growth in the marketplace. Store visits increased over prior year as more Americans see CVS Health as central to their health needs. We administered more than 6 million COVID-19 tests and more than 8 million COVID-19 vaccines nationwide in the first quarter of 2022. Given these results, we are raising our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $8.20 to $8.40. Our cash flow guidance for the year remains strong in the range of $12 billion to $13 billion. We are well-positioned to achieve near-term and longer term growth goals. We are doing this across five strategic value-creating imperatives, which we outlined at our Investor Day. Let me just share a few examples of the strong progress we are making in each. First, we are advancing our all-payer primary care delivery capabilities. Our community health destinations are engaging more consumers with 6.5 million in-person and virtual visits in 2021, approximately 1.5 million visits in the first quarter, up nearly 35% from the prior year. Our virtual care solution represents one of many care delivery channels and lower cost sites of high quality of care. We will be broadening our virtual care services in the next 30 days. More people are accessing healthcare using digitally-enabled solutions. Pre-pandemic back in 2019, we supported 10,000 virtual mental health visits. Last year, we supported 10 million virtual visits just for mental health. This dramatic increase demonstrates the power of our ability to drive innovation at scale. Second, we are optimizing our retail portfolio that will be comprised of three models : advanced primary care clinics, enhanced health hub locations, and our traditional CVS Pharmacy locations. As of today, we have closed approximately 100 stores out of the 300 planned for this year and the 900 planned by the end of 2024. Our early experience suggests we are retaining nearly 70% of the prescription volume within our network, demonstrating strong evidence of our value to consumers. Additionally, we retained more than 95% of colleagues and redeployed them to other CVS locations. Third, we are diversifying our growth portfolio with new health services. We are expanding our capabilities in home health as we prepare for the 2023 launch of a post-acute transitions pilot for our Aetna membership in select geographies. Partnering in technology and home-based care will allow us to reduce readmissions and improve care for our customers at this critical juncture on their path to recovery. As we broaden our capabilities to create new sources of value, we continually evaluate our portfolio for non-strategic assets. Our recently announced sale of Payflex and selected assets from our international businesses are two recent examples of our actions. These transactions are in line with our commitment to invest in areas that are aligned with our strategy. Fourth, we are focused on our digital-first technology-forward approach. We serve nearly 44 million unique digital customers as of the end of the first quarter, up by over 7 million customers since our Investor Day, a testament to the value and ease of our digital offering. Digital customers are omni-channel and on average visit CVS Health 2x more often than traditional customers. We also continue to expand our digital first health dashboard offering. This dashboard makes managing your family\u2019s health more seamless, convenient and personalized. It does so by putting critical health information into one place, health records, pharmacy medications and next best actions. We have 5 million active health dashboard users, up over 25% in the past quarter and we will continue to enhance connectivity to more services later this year. Finally, we are making progress serving our consumers wherever and whenever they receive healthcare. In the first quarter, we launched a new fulfillment option for consumers as part of our omnichannel health experience. Consumers can purchase health and wellness products online with an option for free same-day pickup that will be available in approximately 6,000 CVS community health destinations later this year. We are partnering with Google and Microsoft in ways that deliver real benefits to consumers. For example, MinuteClinic scheduling is now integrated into Google Search, driving new and more convenient appointment bookings. In our specialty pharmacy, we are using Microsoft text analytics and robotics to automate the 40% of prescriptions that are still paper or facts based, making it easier and faster for us to fill the patient\u2019s prescriptions. We are increasingly using technology to improve our business process and reduce cost. Here are just two examples. Our specialty intelligent medication monitoring and adherence engine uses machine learning to help our most at-risk patients by predicting the likelihood of individual patients becoming non-adherent to their medications. This approach then prompts ways in which we can coach and help them maintain their overall health. Also using machine learning and robotics, we can now resolve a wide range of prescription drug claims, which previously require the attention of our pharmacists, freeing them up to spend time with patients. This advanced approach reduces overall cost and improves the patient experience. These five strategic imperatives taken together place the consumer at the center of everything we do. Consumer value is behind the integration of our businesses and we are making steady and real progress. Ultimately, it\u2019s the hard work and commitment of our dedicated colleagues that makes our strategy and results achievable. At CVS Health, we are committed to fostering a culture of values. We have made increasing workforce representation, promoting the inclusion and belonging and equitable access to growth and development our priority. Our commitment to shareholders, customers and communities remains steadfast. In our 2021 Environmental Social Governance report released last month, we highlighted our sharpened focus on sustainable business practices and our priority to advance health equity in America. You can find our report on our website. Our work to fundamentally reshape the delivery of healthcare in our country is well underway. Before I turn it over to Shawn, I am pleased to announce we have named a new Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Sree Chaguturu. Also, I\u2019d like to acknowledge Jon Roberts, who will be retiring at the end of June and thank him for his many contributions to CVS Health over his 42-year career at our company. I am grateful to our dedicated colleagues who continue to deliver everyday, helping millions of Americans and bringing their heart to every moment of our customer\u2019s health. Let me now turn it over to Shawn for a deeper look into our operational results and outlook for the remainder of the year. Shawn Guertin : Thank you, Karen and good morning everyone. Our first quarter results reflects strong performance from all our core business segments with continued momentum in revenue growth, cash flow generation and adjusted earnings per share growth, positioning us to increase our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $8.20 to $8.40 per share. As we continue making progress towards our financial targets, we remain focused on growth, operational execution and supporting the communities we serve. A few highlights of total company performance. First quarter revenues of $76.8 billion increased by 11.2% year-over-year, reflecting robust growth across all business segments. We delivered adjusted operating income of approximately $4.5 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.22, representing an increase of 6.6% and 8.8% versus prior year respectively. Our first quarter adjusted EPS performance reflects both a higher adjusted operating income contribution and lower interest expense versus prior year due to our proactive deleveraging campaign in 2021. Importantly, our first quarter 2022 adjusted EPS was impacted by $75 million of net realized capital losses, which lowered adjusted EPS performance by $0.04. Of the losses noted, approximately $40 million or $0.02 per share related to write-downs of sovereign bonds in Ukraine and Belarus. Turning to Health Care Benefits segment, first quarter revenue of $23.1 billion increased by 12.8% year-over-year driven by membership growth across all product lines. We delivered sequential membership growth of over 670,000 reflecting growth across all product lines. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our Medicare franchise, which has been a key growth engine over the years. Medicare Advantage grew about 200,000 members sequentially, up 6.7%. Our momentum in dual-eligible plans enrollment also continued into the first quarter, growing 28% sequentially. In our commercial business, a strong national account selling season contributed to membership growth, along with growth in commercial risk membership, driven by group commercial and our reentry into the individual exchange marketplace. Adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion was down slightly as compared to the prior year as the previously mentioned net realized capital losses impacted growth along with the continued progression towards normalized medical cost trends. Our medical benefit ratio of 83.5% increased approximately 30 basis points year-over-year, reflective of the same continued progression towards normalized total medical costs. In total, medical cost trends in our commercial business remain in line with pre-pandemic trended baselines, with government remaining slightly lower than pre-pandemic baselines. Consolidated days claims payable at the end of the quarter was 51.7, up 2.6 days sequentially as we brought on new government and other membership in the first quarter. Overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. In Pharmacy Services, we continue to achieve strong revenue and adjusted operating income growth. This is a natural outcome from our execution, delivering industry leading drug trend on behalf of our clients, providing leading specialty management capabilities and outstanding customer service. During the first quarter, revenue of $39.5 billion increased by 8.6% year-over-year driven by pharmacy claims growth, growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation partially offset of continued client price improvements. Total pharmacy membership was roughly flat from year end at 110 million members as underlying growth in commercial and other government lives helped to offset significant membership losses from the California Medicaid carve-out that started this year. Total pharmacy claims processed increased by 5.8% above prior year, primarily attributable to new business in 2022. Currently, we are approximately 60% through renewals for the 2023 selling season, with over 98% core client retention. Adjusted operating income of $1.6 billion grew 8.6% year-over-year driven by improved purchasing economics, reflecting increased contribution from the products and services of our group purchasing organization in specialty pharmacy partially offset by continued client price improvements and increased expenses to onboard new business at the beginning of the year. As Karen mentioned, our 340B product lines did not grow inside the quarter. In our Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we delivered strong revenue and adjusted operating income growth versus prior year. First quarter revenue of $25.4 billion grew 9.2% year-over-year largely due to increased prescription and front store volume, including the sale of COVID-19 OTC test kits. Adjusted operating income of $1.6 billion grew 15.1% versus prior year, driven by a few key components : strength in pharmacy and front store sales, the administration of COVID-19 vaccines and demand for over-the-counter test kits and related treatment categories, particularly at the beginning of the quarter when Omicron incidence was high. These positive factors were partially offset by the impacts of ongoing, but stable reimbursement pressure, business investments including the minimum wage increase in store improvements and investments in store labor as we were consciously slow to drawdown staffing in response to declining Omicron case levels to ensure we had sufficient capacity to meet consumer health needs. Our liquidity and capital position remains strong at the end of the first quarter, generating cash flow from operations of $3.6 billion and ending the quarter with $3 billion of cash at the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries. We remain committed to maintaining our investment grade ratings, while also having the flexibility to deploy capital strategically for capability focused M&A. The announced sales of our Payflex and Aetna International business in Thailand are expected to provide us with additional deployable capital later this year. We repurchased approximately 19.1 million shares of common stock during the 3 months ended March 31, 2022, marking the first time the company has repurchased shares of its common stock since 2017. We also increased the quarterly shareholder dividend by 10% effective with the February 1, 2022 dividend distribution, which resulted in the return of 722 million to shareholders through dividends during the 3 months ended March 31, 2022. In March, we also announced we had entered into an agreement with State of Florida to resolve claims dating back more than a decade related to opioid and medications. Under the agreement, we will settle all opioid claims by Florida for $484 million to be paid over a period of 18 years. As a result, upon satisfaction of the settlement terms by the state, CVS will be released from the pending litigation in Florida. Associated with this settlement, we have taken a charge of approximately $370 million after tax in our first quarter 2022 financials, which has been excluded from our adjusted operating metrics. As a result of our first quarter performance, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $8.20 to $8.40 which represents 3.5% to 6% growth versus our 2021 adjusted earnings per share baseline. The increase reflects the favorable impact of prior year\u2019s development, net of realized capital losses experienced in our healthcare benefits business, both of which we do not forecast. As such, we are raising full year healthcare benefits guidance as follows : Membership increases to a range increases to a range of 24 to 24.3 million members. Revenue increases to a range of $89.3 billion to $90.8 billion. Adjusted operating income guidance increases by $180 million at the midpoint to $5.94 billion to $6.04 billion. Similarly, MBR guidance is updated to 83.5% to 84.5% to reflect our first quarter experience.  We are maintain all other guidance shared during our fourth quarter earnings call. Our updated guidance now reflects the assumption that a fourth COVID-19 booster will be administered to adult aged 50 and older and to certain immunocompromised individuals as per the guidelines set forth by the CDC. Administration of a fourth booster is expected to have a net neutral impact to our enterprise. Representing an incremental cost to our health benefits segment, but helping to maintain our full year outlook for our Retail segment by offsetting first quarter 2022 expense pressures previously mentioned. As we evaluate the progression of earnings for the remainder of the year, we would remind investors of our prior statements that we expect 2022 earnings to be modestly higher in the first half of the year. Similar to 2021 earnings progression, we currently project that 47% to 49% of adjusted EPS will occur in the back half of 2022, which we project will be fairly evenly split between the third and fourth quarters. You will find additional details regarding our updated guidance and in the slide presentation we posted to our website this morning. We continue to anticipate strong cash from operations in 2022 between $12 billion and $13 billion and capital expenditures in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion as we invest in technology and digital enhancements to improve the consumer experience as well as our community locations. Full year deployable free cash will benefit from our recent divestiture activity while any earnings impact from these divestitures are incorporated into our updated guidance ranges. To conclude we are encouraged by our strong first quarter results and improved 2022 outlook, particularly at this early stage in the year as we continue to sharpen our focus and execute our strategy. As a leader and trusted partner in healthcare we strive to delivery as superior healthcare experience for our consumers to lowering the cost of care, improving access and building engagement and convenience to our consumers and their communities. We will now open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you.  We will take our first question is from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Hi, thanks very much and good morning. First let me give my congratulations to Jon in his retirement. It\u2019s been great. Getting to know you all for all these years, Jon. So, I wish you well in your retirement. On my question, if I look at the guidance, Shawn, the one area where you raised guidance versus previous was in the health benefits business. So can you talk about what the key drivers are of the better MLR going forward? Karen talked about digital. Is that playing a part of it? You talked about virtual, so if you can just give us a more color to how we think about what some of the key drivers are to the better MLR in your guidance. Shawn Guertin : Yes, so I think the easiest way to sort of think about that is largely what\u2019s being sort of pulled through here is the prior year development that we experienced in the first quarter less the realize capital losses. And just to be clear on that, we talked in my remarks about $75 million of realized capital losses. About $60 million of that was in HCB. So the net of those two things is right around $180 million, and that\u2019s really the guidance increase. To round out the story though, as mentioned, we now have incorporated the fourth booster for the specific populations that it has been recommended for, so that\u2019s going to be a cost item, obviously, for HCB. But as you saw, we\u2019ve had strong volume growth and excellent kind of performance sort especially post January as Omicron faded on that side. So the biggest thing is the prior year development and the realized capital losses, but we should have ongoing strength from volume that should be able to absorb the cost of the fourth booster. Lisa Gill : Okay, great. Then just as my \u2013 I guess, my follow-up from my questions that I\u2019ve been asking for the last year, and that\u2019s around the primary care strategy. I really thought we would had an announcement by now, you did talk in your prepared remarks about making headway around primary care and some of the offerings you have in the marketplace. But maybe can you talk about are you still looking to make a larger scale acquisition? Or will this be more of internal growth? Just any update on that would be helpful. Thanks very much. Karen Lynch : Good morning, Lisa, let me just comment on that. Yes, that we are continuing to look for a broader range of primary care capabilities. It\u2019s an interesting market. We are trying to make sure that we are prudent, both strategically and financially, but it is part of our strategy, and we\u2019ve more conversations to come. Shawn, do you want to talk about capital? Shawn Guertin : Yes, I\u2019ll talk little bit about the M&A specifically on this and Lisa, I certainly understand your question and I want to be careful because different people will define large different ways, I think we\u2019ve been pretty clear. We\u2019re not talking about a jumbo acquisition here. We\u2019re talking about a capability-based acquisition. At some size but not necessarily anything jumbo. We have been very active in this space. We\u2019ve evaluated a range of assets in and around the care delivery space, I will remind you most of this assets aren\u2019t out for sale and so that dialogues start to process. Our priority areas remain primary care and MSO capability and the home health capability. These assets will serve as the foundation of the platform, which will pursue our strategic vision. So it\u2019s essential that we fully evaluate their defining characteristics and capabilities. And so while the valuation environment continues to present it\u2019s own sets of challenges, I\u2019m cautiously optimistic with our ability to begin to execute on our strategic plan in \u201822. Jon Roberts : And Lisa, this is Jon. Thanks for your kind words. Obviously I have a very rewarding career at CVS, and I feel really good about the leadership team that\u2019s now here, confident in their strategy and the team\u2019s ability to execute. So thanks. Lisa Gill : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Thank you and good morning. So clearly, 2023 is progressing in line with your expectations. Shawn, back in December, you also gave us sort of targets for 2023 and 2024. So with kind of like everything that\u2019s happening in the macro environment, how is your thinking of 2023 and 2024 for stance now \u2013 is it changed in December or we still on track with those starts? Shawn Guertin : Yes, so we remain committed to achieving those EPS targets for \u201823 and \u201824 and we are certainly off to a good start in doing that and as it pertains maybe more immediately to \u201823. While we are not providing specific guidance as it\u2019s sort of too early, there is a lot of moving parts, but to your point, I understand why the question is being answered when you think about macro factors like COVID and the uncertainty about the future testing and treatment protocols there, as well as all of the macro economic factors that are work right now in the market. When I think about \u201823 at this very early stage and sort of think about our businesses, I do think there is certainly some headwinds, but there is also a lot of tailwinds in PSS, we\u2019re having a very good retention season. The sales season is still in progress there, but we have the tailwinds of specialty, specialty generics and biosimilars, and there is a lot of good things happening there that I expect to continue into the future. On HCB, obviously, we expect some loss in Medicaid as the redeterminations kick in. But we have as good a momentum as we\u2019ve had in a long time in commercial. We have a strong individual MA franchise. The group MA business is always about jumbo accounts, and so we have some of those that are up for renewal. But we will also have our ongoing exchange expansion. But maybe most importantly for that business is the outlook on margin. And we\u2019ve had actually a really good start here with excellent baseline development and I would point out that in light of the macroeconomic conditions today, much of our \u201823 pricing is still yet to be set. The question, obviously, we get a lot about \u201823 ends up kind of pointing off in at retail. And so I think it\u2019s worth spending a few minutes there. Many like to model COVID going to zero for retail, and that\u2019s a convenient modeling assumption. But I think a very highly unlikely outcome for 2023 as we move from pandemic to endemic. We have a very strong testing and treatment franchise there as well. We\u2019ve had particular strength in the front of the store, both OTC COVID testing, as well as other categories. Our CarePass membership is up 33% year-over-year to 6 million members. And while in the pharmacy reimbursement pressure continues, it has stabilized and moderated a bit in 2022. We will continue to do all we can to reduce that pressure further. But we\u2019re also going continue to combat this by trying to increase volume and reducing costs. We took share again in retail pharmacy. In other words, we\u2019re growing faster than the market. This is probably at least the eighth quarter in a row that, that\u2019s happened. We\u2019re implementing buy online, pick up in store, which should help increase volume overall, both in the front and potentially the back. We\u2019re well positioned for omni-channel pharmacy, which can both help volume but also give us new ways to fulfill customers\u2019 prescriptions, and in so doing, potentially have efficient, cost-efficient way to fulfill that customer. In \u201823 will be the second year of our store closures, and so far in 2022, those are going at or better than expected in terms of the of stores and the script retention we\u2019re having. And as always we are going to aggressively push on the cost of goods sold. Maybe most importantly, though, as we think about the next couple of years, I continue to feel very positive about our significant capacity to deploy capital and you will recall that our \u201823 guidance only assumes that we repurchased shares enough to offset dilution. So, this is a lever that not only helps advance our strategy, but it\u2019s also a lever that can be used to deliver on our EPS targets as well. Ricky Goldwasser : Great, thank you. And just one quick follow-up there. As we think about those efficiencies and investment in the future, Karen talked about the fact that digital customers visit the stores, I think 2x more than the average customer. Can you just give us maybe a sense of also how the profitability of those customers compared to sort of the brick and mortar customers? Shawn Guertin : Yes. I think it\u2019s probably a comparable sort of set when you think about things like basket size and whatnot, but it\u2019s been more of a frequency. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Cherny of Bank of America. Michael Cherny : Good morning and thank you for a ton of details so far. Shawn, you mentioned the dynamics around \u201823 at one point that obviously, it was in there was on specialty and specialty biosimilars. As you think about the conversations you\u2019re having during this selling season with a very clear pipeline of some potential blockbusters coming on the biosimilar side as soon as next year. How do you think your customers across the enterprise are preparing for that potential raft of both interchangeable and non-interchangeable biosimilars and how willing are they \u2013 do they appear to be at this point in time to work with you on driving greater adoption, which obviously seems like it\u2019s going to be nicely additive to your overall growth profile. Alan Lotvin : Michael, it\u2019s Alan. A very timely question. So I would say that our customers are anxiously awaiting the biosimilar kind of way that\u2019s really starting in \u201823 and continues through most of this decade. What they are looking to us to do is to deliver to them strategies, plan designs, programs, approaches that lower their net cost of product. And they are very willing to entertain. I\u2019m not going to say whatever it takes, but they are very willing to entertain the approaches needed to drive to the lowest net cost. And so as you pointed out, there are products that will be interchangeable, so that will be substitutable. The manufacturer pricing strategies aren\u2019t an entirely set yes. So it\u2019s \u2013 one would say it\u2019s not quite clear exactly how that\u2019s going to come to fruition, but we are very, very confident that the biosimilars will be an important contributor to our continued success in lowering specialty trend and overall trend for our customers. And as we\u2019ve said many times, generally, when we create that sort of value, our customers are happy to pay us for it. Michael Cherny : And if I can just add one more question on pharmacy services and growth. You did mention 340B in terms of not growing year-over-year, whether it\u2019s within this year\u2019s guidance or the multiyear plan, what is the assumption for 340B growth within your overall book of business? Alan Lotvin : So it\u2019s Alan, Michael. So 340B, obviously, the way I would think about 340B is think about it as a volume discussion, right? So subsequent to when we put guidance out last year, there were a number of I would \u2013 I guess I would phrase it as the manufacturers continuing to write their own regulations and deciding what they were and weren\u2019t going to apply pricing to. And so that reduced the volume. So when the volume goes down, by covered entities make less money, which is the entire reason for the existence of the 340B program, our clients don\u2019t have access to lower-cost drugs well partner. Our third-party administrator doesn\u2019t have the volume to reprocess claims and our dispensing pharmacies don\u2019t earn the dispensing fees. So that\u2019s when volume goes down. What we\u2019ve now seen going into the first quarter of 2022 is that manufacturers have articulated the conditions by which they will open up contract pharmacy, 340B pricing for covered entities. So that volume comes back. Now there is a timing issue, right, how fast to covered entities make the decisions they need to make, what are the restrictions that are placed on it. So \u2013 and then there is an ultimate volume, which manufacturers decide to do. So within all of those variability. So as the volume comes back, covered entities make money, our clients save money well partner has more volume to process. So within all of the totality, we\u2019re estimating basically flat in the program year-over-year, which is sort of our best thinking right now. Michael Cherny : Thank you. It\u2019s very helpful. Alan Lotvin : You are welcome. Operator : We take our next question from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Hi, thanks. Good morning, everybody. So just for the LTC sub-segment, the former Omnicare operations that nobody ever really asked about \u2013 just wanted to ask, we\u2019ve seen some pretty notable increases in the skilled nursing facility or SNF industry occupancy gains in the first 3, 4 months of \u201822 after a slower occupancy recovery in calendar \u201821. So I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s translating into just better Rx volume results for the LTC Omnicare operations in early \u201822. Thanks. Shawn Guertin : Yes. Steven, we\u2019ve seen that volume come up a little bit. And for the most part, that business has tracked with our expectations this year, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t characterize it as an inflection point or anything like that. It\u2019s definitely been recovering from its bottom during COVID and has more or less been consistent with expectations this year. Steven Valiquette : Got it. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Nathan Rich of Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Maybe just start on the retail business. Shawn, could you give a little bit more detail on the margin dynamics that you saw play out in the first quarter, I guess gross margin was down a little more than we expected year-over-year. Can you maybe just talk about what\u2019s driving that and kind of what you expect over the balance of the year? And then it looks on like on the cost side, SG&A came favorable. Can you maybe just talk about how wage increases have trended relative to your expectations? Shawn Guertin : Yes. It\u2019s \u2013 obviously, we had a very strong quarter. There are some dynamics in the quarter year-over-year that have to do with sort of the vaccine program starting last year, and we had very high expense levels last year in the vaccine business, and that\u2019s obviously been fine-tuned now. So year-over-year, despite the fact that vaccine volumes were down, which I think is a little bit of the gross margin question answer. We actually did better kind of bottom line wise because of sort of the G&A components and some of the reimbursement has changed over that period of time, too. Testing, again, that\u2019s probably been down sort of year-over-year. But overall, we probably had a contribution towards growth of a couple of hundred million from COVID in Q1. The other dynamics, I think we are \u2013 we had a light kind of cold and flu season, right. So, there was that going on both in the front store and the back of the store. But again, script growth was good, there was nothing particularly surprising on the reimbursement side. The front store was good across sort of a broader set of categories than just OTC. In fairness, last year\u2019s first quarter \u201821 was still probably somewhat depressed because of what was going on. But overall, the metrics looked good. Nathan Rich : Okay. Great. If I could just ask a quick follow-up on your comments on the M&A landscape and I guess it sounds like there is still a disconnect on valuations between buyer and seller. I guess have you seen that conversation start to shift at all, just given what we have seen kind of play out in the market so far this year? Shawn Guertin : Yes. And it\u2019s been an interesting dynamic, right? When we set out on this journey, some of these companies were valued at 7x to 8x revenue, right. And now they have \u2013 and that probably wasn\u2019t right, right. But now some of them have regressed to maybe one or two, and that may not be completely correct either. So, I mean the answer is the longer this persists, right. The greater this becomes sort of the reality upon which people make some decisions. And so I would say sort of directionally, yes. But it still remains challenging given sort of the memories of where some of these values were. Nathan Rich : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. First question, just Shawn, appreciate your comments on COVID. You talked about $200 million contribution year-over-year in retail. I was getting to an estimate of about $800 million benefit to the year. Is that a reasonable ballpark? And then how much is the total benefit in the first quarter? And then just lastly, does this completely get offset in your mind by a weakness \u2013 negative COVID impact in the benefits business? Shawn Guertin : Yes. So, the \u2013 let me just sort of talk a little bit about what our COVID expectations are. And the answer to your question eventually will be that\u2019s probably in the neighborhood, albeit we have gotten there with a little bit different path now with the fourth booster. We expect now about 18 million vaccines for 2022, including the provision for the fourth booster for the defined populations. This would be a decline of about 70% versus 2022. Testing, excluding OTC, is expected to be down 50% plus or minus. And the OTC test will be in the same neighborhood, maybe a little bit higher. But overall, that\u2019s going to probably produce a contribution year-over-year. That\u2019s down 60%, 65% on COVID. And if you do the math, you are not going to be far off your number. A lot of that contribution maybe half-ish is in the first quarter of this year and it is more back end loaded than back end loaded going forward. And again, to some extent, the jury\u2019s out in an endemic situation in terms of where we will go with additional boosters, testing and test to treat and things like that. So, there is more to play out as in terms of how that ripples out in the second half of this year, but into next year. For HCB, the picture is more nuanced in the sense that we are now 3 years removed from our 2019 base line. But maybe most importantly, we have now been able to reflect the COVID expenses in product pricing. And so as I mentioned in my remarks, overall cost trends came in consistent or slightly better versus our trended baseline, which, while I am not going to declare victory prematurely, that\u2019s a very encouraging result, both for \u201822 and potentially \u201823 as well. I think what this means for \u201823, though is I think we have to return to how we have traditionally looked at this business, which is by matching price increases with expected cost trends and managing revenue growth and operating margin levels. Justin Lake : Got it. And if I can just ask a follow-up. You mentioned capital. So, running some numbers there, I am getting to over that 3-year period you talked about the Investor Day \u201822 to \u201824, about $20 billion of potential capital above and beyond what you have already kind of earmarked, but about two-thirds of that coming from free cash flow generation, about a third from potential leveraging up to about 3.5x. Is that a reasonable ballpark number in terms of what you think your excess capital could be that\u2019s already not guided? Shawn Guertin : I think that probably assumes some leverage ratio that\u2019s a little bit higher than where we are today, but still consistent with sort of our investment-grade rating strategy. But I think that ballpark is in the neighborhood. Justin Lake : Thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. And A.J. Rice, your line is open. Please check you mute switch. A.J. Rice: Hi. Can you hear me now? Shawn Guertin : Yes. Proceed with your question. A.J. Rice: Yes. Sorry about that. So, as you are commenting the primary care there is still a little pricey. You also mentioned home health. I wondered and if maybe you can flesh out a little more what the capabilities you want? I mean are you looking as some of your peers have done for something that\u2019s got a platform and fee-for-service that you can then pivot to value based. Is there other aspects of a whole health platform that would be of interest to you. And I think there is an anxiety in the marketplace a little bit that you sort of set up an idea that one of these areas would start to contribute in \u201824. It\u2019s been about a year since the Investor Day, not quite, but about and people get a little anxious to nothing has been announced. Can you give us maybe your perspective on your ability that how important is doing some sort of deal to being able to deliver on some of your long-term objectives, or do you feel fresh that you need to do something maybe just have a few comments on that? Karen Lynch : A.J., it might feel like a year since Investor Day, but it\u2019s actually only been 4.5 months since Investor Day. But I think we all look like it\u2019s been a year. But any way, let me just comment broadly on our home health strategy and then I will kick it to Shawn to talk a little bit about kind of what we are thinking. Obviously, as a company, we are uniquely positioned to integrate our existing capabilities. As we think about primary care and extending into the home, we \u2013 there is a number of opportunities for us. We are starting very early with our post-acute care transitions. We will look at opportunities to support first and foremost the membership particularly to support improvement in Medicare costs and expand into a payer-agnostic. So, there is a lot in the home, but clearly \u2013 and as you know, we are already in the home with Coram, with our virtual care with our new post-acute transitions. And then we will expand coverage where we can link it in primary care. So there is a number of options and we are looking at that, too, as part of our acquisition strategy as well. But our first and foremost priority is really to advance our primary care capabilities. And as Shawn mentioned, we continue to navigate our way through the valuation. Shawn, do you want to talk about \u201824? Shawn Guertin : Yes. So what I would say A.J., on this is we certainly remain committed to delivering the EPS target for 2024. And what we described at the Investor Day was a pathway to sort of get there with an M&A contribution. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t step away from that yet. But it was a pathway and inevitably, pieces of that pathway might be different. And I am not sort of abdicating the number that we won\u2019t get the earnings contribution, but I do want to go back to the capital point that if we were hypothetically in that position, capital continues to be a lever that we can use. You recall at Investor Day, when you just looked at the pure capital, if we did just sort of deploy all that capital, you can get on top of these numbers. So, it\u2019s \u2013 this is about longer term strategic positioning that we are doing. And again, I think it\u2019s important that we do the right deal for us and for the strategy. And I am going to do everything in my power to make sure that we can satisfy both commitments. But I also want to make sure we do the right deal because it\u2019s that important for our future. A.J. Rice: Okay. Just a brief follow-up, you haven\u2019t been asked this way at the call, so surprising on inflation, supply chain, labor. Any updated thoughts on any of that? Karen Lynch : Yes, A.J., on inflation, obviously, we are incredibly mindful of this topic. And as you know, the U.S. hasn\u2019t seen these kinds of inflationary pressures in decades. There are some aspects of inflation that impact \u2013 that could be very positive to us. But as we think about each business and inflation, there is varying reaction to inflation. And I will ask Shawn to kind of go through a little bit of those details by each of those businesses to give you a firmer view of what it looks like. Shawn Guertin : Yes. And I would say in the quarter, mainly, I think because we made wage moves last year, I don\u2019t think we felt a lot of pinch, but the one obviously the one place that we did see it is actually a result of the kind of cousin of inflation, and that\u2019s interest rates and some of the losses that \u2013 realized capital losses that we took in the portfolio related to that. And that will be something to keep in mind going forward. We have a $20 billion plus fixed income portfolio that has moved from about $1 billion gain position, unrealized gain position at the end of the year to approximately $1 billion unrealized loss position. And there is always some element of portfolio turnover and management during the year. So, that\u2019s something that I think will continue to monitor closely. As you mentioned, I mean as we think forward, there is a potential across all of our businesses for both the labor and G&A aspects, but I think as I have thought about this it\u2019s the cost of goods sold aspect that I have \u2013 we have certainly thought about a lot. I would remind everyone that historically higher inflation has also driven a higher top line, particular in the HCB, in the PSS businesses. From a COGS standpoint, I wouldn\u2019t say we are seeing it show up in pharmacy yet, \u201822 I think we are in very good shape as most of our contracts are all locked down in HCB. Our average HCB contract is about 3 years in duration. And so obviously, some number of those will be coming up for \u201823. But I will also point our one of my earlier comments, that we still have a lot of pricing leverage on 2023 and will certainly fully reflect our thinking on inflation as we think about forward pricing. On retail, obviously, we will be watching that as well, but it is a dynamic that can actually help frankly with our membership programs and also make our store brands more attractive relative to other products. So, there are certainly a lot of fingers of this, but I do think we are looking at this kind of thoroughly and thinking about all the levers we can pull to mitigate the impact. Karen Lynch : And A.J. on your labor question, obviously, we continue, like everyone else to experience a very tight labor market. But as I mentioned in prepared remarks when we are closing stores we have been able to retain those retail, which has been really helping us out in those locations. We also had very strong retention across our business, and we have been very successful in hiring some of the key areas in our company like digital and tech and analytics. So \u2013 and the other thing I would just say is we are very pleased with that, more than half of our hires are diverse and are reflecting the communities that we serve. A.J. Rice: Great. Alright. Thanks so much. Operator : We will take our next question from Eric Percher of Nephron Research. Your line is open. Eric Percher : Thank you. Shawn I appreciate the color on the factors impacting quarterly profit in HCB and pharmacy. I wanted drill into pharmacy services. For the year, do you expect fluctuation given COVID and large onboarding? And is there any fluctuation from sourcing benefit or 340B through the year? Shawn Guertin : On PSS, to your point, I think when you looked at our first quarter results, and this is something we anticipated, but we did have a very successful growth season, and a very successful welcome season. And we did staff to sort of create that positive experience for our new customers. So, expense levels are certainly a little bit higher in Q1 than sort of the run rate for the rest of the year. There is some movement, but the rest of the year, the quarters are generalized sort of in the same neighborhood as each other for the rest of the year. Alan mentioned before from a 340B standpoint, we are largely assuming a flat year-over-year contribution. So, a lot of the increases are coming sort of from the core elements of the business, kind of around growth and specialty and things like that. Eric Percher : And Alan\u2019s comment, if I caught it correctly, was that there are ways to expand volumes, does that suggest that your view is that your support covered and is providing data, that\u2019s key to seeing the volumes increase, which ultimately gets you flat for the year? Alan Lotvin : So, Eric, it\u2019s Alan. The volume growth is off of the kind of depressed base from the actions that the manufacturers took, right. So, it\u2019s not year-over-year volume growth. It\u2019s just a kind of a recovery of the volume. And so that\u2019s the first thing I would say. The second thing is, ultimately, the decision about whether or not they supply data to the manufacturers is up to COVID entities. And so they will work with us and tell us when they are or aren\u2019t ready to turn the program back on and under what conditions. Eric Percher : Thank you. Operator : We will take a question from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brian Tanquilut : Hey. Good morning. Alan, just a follow-up question on \u2013 just on your side of the business. As I think about some of the changes that we saw \u2013 we have seen we have signed a service shift because of the pandemic. So, as things normalize in terms of hospital visits and physician visits, what are you seeing in terms of the durability of say your Coram, home infusion side or maybe even specialty mail just in terms of volumes and how that shift is \u2013 if that\u2019s sticking on both sides? Alan Lotvin : Yes. So, I guess I think of the three business units within the company, the Pharmacy Services segment probably had the least variability in terms of underlying core business activity. So, the specialty pharmacy itself, there was a little bit of a dip along the way in new prescriptions as you saw people not going to the doctor, but by and large, the site of service shifts there were non-material. The Coram business was a little bit more impacted. Obviously, a lot of the acute scripts, the infusion and antibiotics, there weren\u2019t as many hospitalizations. That was offset to some extent by more oncology things that were traditional hospital outpatient that we picked up on. So, net-net, I would say it\u2019s probably not a material change that impacts the Pharmacy Services segment just given the relative size of Coram versus the rest of the company? Brian Tanquilut : And Shawn just a follow-up, as I think about buybacks, probably a little earlier than I would have expected. So, is this just capital deployment because your cash flow was really strong during the quarter, or is it because of the delays with some of the acquisitions that you had planned? And should we expect potential upside from the buybacks as a result? Shawn Guertin : Yes. I mean it certainly emanates in some ways, right from the strength of our ongoing ability to generate sort of deployable capital. And I want to make sure people understand that. It\u2019s less that it\u2019s something that we are going to rush out to do than it is to fully understand the strength of that capital, and the fact that, that remains a lever that we can pull over time and in some ways, has the potential to be a safety net from year-to-year given just the normal fluctuations of the business. Karen Lynch : I want to thank you all for joining our call today, and just leave you a few comments. As you can see, we \u2013 our team continues to execute. We entered into 2022 with very powerful momentum and strong growth across all of our businesses. We remain confident we will continue that momentum for the remainder of the year and beyond. And we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. Thanks for joining the call. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s CVS Health first quarter 2022 earnings call and webcast.

CVS Health delivered another outstanding quarter. We grew revenue by 11% versus the prior year to over $80 billion with strong results across all business segments. We delivered adjusted operating income of $4.8 billion and generated adjusted earnings per share of $2.40. This morning, we raised our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $8.40 to $8.60, an increase of $0.20. We are also increasing our full year outlook for cash flow from operations to $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion. These guidance increases reflect the continued positive momentum across all of our businesses. We remain well positioned and confident in our ability to achieve our near-term and longer-term growth goals. Our increasingly integrated foundational businesses delivered exceptional results for the quarter. The Health Care Benefit segment had a strong quarter with revenue growth of nearly 11% year-over-year. We achieved adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion. Our medical benefit ratio of 82.9% improved by 120 basis points versus the prior year, as medical cost trends remained favorable. We generated membership growth across all product lines versus the prior year. These results reflect the end-to-end value of our assets, increasingly working together one customer at a time at national scale. Our Medicare business remains one of our strongest growth segments, and we increased membership year-over-year across all Medicare products. Our individual Medicare Advantage membership continues to grow at a double-digit pace and faster than the overall market. This quarter, we achieved a major milestone with more than 2 million individual Medicare Advantage members, including Dual Eligible. Our PDP portfolio also maintains its momentum with healthy growth that is well ahead of industry trends, providing us future conversion and upsell opportunities. Looking ahead to 2023, we're maintaining a nearly 98% client retention rate in national accounts. Additionally, we are having a successful group Medicare Advantage selling season and expect to show positive membership growth next year. As we continue to build our individual exchange business, we're on track to expand coverage where we currently have individual exchange offerings and are obtaining final approvals to add four new states to our portfolio bringing our total to 12 states. In pharmacy services, revenue grew nearly 12% compared to the prior year and delivered adjusted operating income of $1.9 billion. Specialty pharmacy revenue is up nearly 21% year-over-year. We are a leader in specialty pharmacy with programs that drive value in the marketplace, provide substantive savings to customers and differentiate us as we pair programs with digital assets. Looking ahead, we're maintaining a 98% client retention rate for the 2023 selling season with more than 75% of renewals complete. We drove $3.1 billion of growth in new business, providing evidence of our market-leading trend management, transparency and integrated offerings. Turning to our Retail/Long-Term Care segment. We continued our momentum from the first quarter. Our deep customer relationships, high-quality patient interactions, resilient supply chain and agile operating model, all contributed to the strong quarterly performance. Nearly 4.8 million customers engage with us every day at CVS locations, making us a powerful community health destination. In the quarter, we delivered over 6% revenue growth versus the prior year and $1.9 billion in adjusted operating income. Our front store sales grew more than 9%, driven by strength in consumer health sales, including strong COVID over-the-counter test and sales of cost cold and flu products. Our pharmacy grew prescriptions 1.6% or 4.6%, excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccination, which declined versus the prior year. Our retail script growth trend is remarkable as we have consistently increased market share year-over-year since the first quarter of 2020. As COVID-19 continues to move towards an endemic phase, we will continue to play a critical role in communities across the country. Millions of Americans depend on us for COVID-19 testing, vaccine administration and dispensing antiviral medications for treatment. We administered more than 4 million COVID-19 tests and approximately 6 million COVID-19 vaccinations nationwide in the second quarter. The demand for antiviral medications to treat COVID-19 continues to increase, as the national positivity rate remains in the double digits. Overall, we continue to successfully navigate a challenging retail environment, while expanding services and increasing share of wallet by bringing new customers to CVS Health. Of the approximately 43 million new customers who have chosen CVS Health for COVID-19 Health Services, nearly 15% have engaged to us for additional services. Our omnichannel approach connects consumer health experiences, driving high satisfaction levels and continuously enabling CVS Health to attract and retain customers. Our leadership on this omnichannel experience is a competitive advantage and one we are committed to investing in enhancing over time. Turning to our strategic imperatives. Let me give you a few updates. We are a leading provider of retail health services nationally, and we continue to advance our tier delivery capabilities. Our CVS Healthcare teams in our Minute Clinics have supported more than 2.8 million patient visits year-to-date, representing a 12% increase from the prior year. We are further enhancing our services and making them more relevant for our customers. We are working closely with the administration offering the test to treat program in our MinuteClinics and pharmacies and will be implementing pharmacists prescribing under certain conditions to even more seamlessly serve customers with COVID-19. This furthers our strategy to expand access to health services and helps consumers to navigate to the best site of care. As we evaluate complementary health services and care delivery capabilities to enhance our overall portfolio, we continue to take a disciplined approach. Inorganic growth is part of our strategy, and we look forward to updating you on our progress. Relative to store optimization, we've closed 198 stores to date and remain on track to close 300 stores this year. We are successfully minimizing disruption to our customers and maintaining high levels of satisfaction, as we maintain our store and pharmacy hours across our locations to meet consumer health needs. We are retaining over 70% on prescription volume within our network and have redeployed over 90% of impacted colleagues to our other CVS locations. Our technology forward digital-first approach is reducing complexity for our customers and creating new digital health solutions that are convenient. CVS Health now serves more than 45 million unique digital customers, up 1.5 million since last quarter. This increase is driven by our omnichannel pharmacy strategy focused on simplifying how consumers fill and receive prescriptions. Over 60% of our newly acquired digital users are customers of our specialty, mail order and retail pharmacies. We are expanding our digital health services and deepening engagement through personalization to drive convenience for customers. We launched our individualized health dashboard earlier this year and already have 6 million active users, up 20% from the prior quarter. As we successfully execute our strategy, our unified health model grows in relevance and importance every day for the consumers, customers and the communities we serve. And you can see this in our results. And finally, as part of our ongoing commitment to sustainability, we entered into an agreement to purchase renewable energy with one of the nation's largest producers of carbon-free energy. This is the latest step on our path to sourcing 50% renewable energy by 2040. We are positioned to continue our momentum through the second half of this year. None of this will be possible without our talented colleagues who serve America's health needs every day. We recently added two proven leaders to the executive team. Tilak Mandadi has joined CVS Health as our first Chief Data, Digital and Technology Officer; and Violetta Ostafin has joined CVS Health as our Chief Strategy Officer. Both bring deep unique expertise to our diverse leadership team. I will now turn it over to Shawn for a deeper look into our operational and financial results and our outlook. Shawn Guertin : Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results reflect the continuation of outstanding performance from each of our core business segments as we exceeded our  6 days sequentially as reserves grew at a modestly higher rate than premium growth, displaying a pattern similar to what we experienced in the second quarter of 2021. Overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. In the Pharmacy Services business, our ability to deliver industry-leading drug trend for our clients, our specialty management capabilities, and outstanding customer service levels continue to drive growth. During the second quarter, revenue of $42.8 billion increased by 11.7% year-over-year, driven by pharmacy claims growth, growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation, partially offset by the impact of continued client price improvements. Revenue in Specialty Pharmacy grew nearly 21% versus prior year, reflecting new business wins and pharmacy claims growth. Total pharmacy claims processed increased by 3.9% above prior year and 5.7% when excluding COVID-19 vaccinations, primarily attributable to new business in 2022, increased utilization and the impact of an extended cough, cold and flu season. Total pharmacy membership grew sequentially, exceeding 110 million members as growth in commercial and government lives more than offset significant membership losses from the California Medicaid carve-out that started this year. Adjusted operating income of $1.9 billion grew 5.7% year-over-year, driven by improved purchasing economics, reflecting increased contribution from the products and services of our group purchasing organization and membership growth. These favorable items were partially tempered by ongoing client price improvements, as well as $55 million of restructuring and integration costs. Year-over-year contributions from our 340B product lines declined inside the quarter, as covered entities were slower to agree to manufacture conditions than we had previously estimated. In our Retail/Long-Term Care segment, higher-than-projected COVID-related volume combined with strength in pharmacy and front store sales helped to drive strong results. Specifically, during the second quarter, revenue of $26.3 billion grew 6.3% year-over-year, reflecting increased prescription and front store volume, including increased sales of COVID over-the-counter test kits in cough, cold and flu products. Adjusted operating income of $1.9 billion declined 9.1% versus prior year, partially due to a $125 million gain from an antitrust legal settlement recognized in the second quarter of 2021, as well as lower COVID-19 vaccine volumes. Additional drivers include strength in pharmacy and front store sales, improved generic drug purchasing and the favorable impact of business initiatives during the quarter. These positive factors were offset by ongoing but stable reimbursement pressure and business investments, including the minimum wage increase and store improvements. Pharmacy prescription volume grew 1.6% year-over-year, reflecting increased utilization in cough, cold and flu volume extending later into the spring. Excluding the impact of COVID, pharmacy prescription volume increased by 4.6% year-over-year. Turning to the balance sheet. Our liquidity and capital position remained excellent. Year-to-date, we generated cash flow from operations of $9 billion and ended the quarter with $5.8 billion of cash at the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries. During the quarter, we repaid $1.5 billion of long-term debt. Further, in July, we announced that we will be executing a par call redemption on $1 billion of November 2022 notes. Yesterday, we also announced the par call on all of our notes due in December of 2022 for a combined total amount of $1.65 billion of debt representing the last of our outstanding maturities for this calendar year. Through our quarterly dividend, we returned $740 million to shareholders. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings, while also having the flexibility to deploy capital strategically for capability-focused M&A. A few other items worth highlighting for investors. Adjusted EPS in the second quarter was impacted by reserve strengthening of $108 million in our legacy long-term care insurance business. This adjustment which represented the first time we have significantly adjusted this reserve since the Aetna acquisition is included in adjusted operating income for our Corporate Other segment and lowers total company adjusted EPS by $0.06 in the quarter. From a GAAP reporting perspective, in June, we also completed the previously announced sale of Payflex, which resulted in a pretax gain of $225 million in our second quarter financials. Consistent with past practice, this gain has been excluded from our adjusted operating metrics. Turning to our 2022 outlook. We are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.20 to a range of $8.40 to $8.60. This increase reflects both the second quarter performance and an improved outlook for the retail LTC segment, as well as strong second quarter underwriting results in the HCB segment, tempered by $140 million to $180 million of lower net investment income contributions over the remainder of 2022, given the uncertainty and volatility of the current capital markets. As such, we are maintaining our full year adjusted operating income guidance in health care benefits of $5.94 billion to $6.4 billion. This reflects the aforementioned strong underlying fundamental performance, offset by $110 million to $145 million of lower net investment income contributions over the remainder of 2022, as the vast majority of our net investment income is generated in our Health Care Benefits segment. Our updated outlook also contemplates the extension of the public health emergency through the end of 2022. We are raising full year retail LTC guidance as follows : revenue increases to a range of $101 million to $12.7 billion, adjusted operating income guidance increases by $575 million at the midpoint to a range of $6.54 billion to $6.64 billion. We now forecast that we will administer nearly 20 million COVID-19 vaccinations in 2022, with approximately 75% already administered in the first half of 2022. We expect full year diagnostic testing volumes of approximately $19 million and sales of over-the-counter test kits to more than double compared to prior year, exceeding 50 million units. In aggregate, we expect these three categories of COVID-driven items to now produce nearly $3 billion of revenue in 2022, a decline of approximately 33% versus 2021, but indicative of the endemic tail of COVID on our retail business. Our updated outlook also includes a provision for higher levels of investment spending in the back half of the year, as we prepare for a potential late year increase in COVID cases and includes continued investments in our workforce and to enhance our customer experience. In Pharmacy Services, we now expect to be at the low end of our full year adjusted operating income guidance range of $7.31 billion to $7.45 billion based on the following factors. The continued strength from our core capabilities, including purchasing economics and strong network volumes where we have increased the midpoint of our range by 50 million scripts. Being pressured by the restructuring and integration costs I previously mentioned and a reduced outlook for our 340B business, resulting in a contribution that will be down compared to prior year. Looking at the enterprise as a whole, due to our sustained operating momentum, we anticipate continued strong cash from operations in 2022 and have raised our guidance to a range of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion with capital expenditures unchanged at a range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. We are raising our full year adjusted effective tax rate guidance from 25.6% to 25.7%, primarily a result of the discussed changes to our investment income outlook. And finally, as we evaluate the progression of earnings for the remainder of the year, we continue to remind investors that we project that earnings per share will be fairly evenly split between the third and the fourth quarters. All other guidance shared during our first quarter earnings call remains unchanged. You will find additional details regarding our updated guidance in the slide presentation we posted to our website this morning. To conclude, our second quarter results reflect continued strength from all of our core business segments, and we are pleased to raise our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance. Our focus on growth and operational execution continues, and we continue to progress on our long-term strategy. We remain committed to the EPS targets implicit in our long-term model, including as we look to 2023. We will now open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Thank you. We'll take our first question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ricky Goldwasser : Hey, good morning and congrats on a great quarter. So my question, Karen, Shawn is how are you thinking about your primary care strategy on the heels of the recent M&A news, instead of really settling on the balance between organic and sort of the inorganic comments in that you referred to Karen in your prepared remarks. Karen Lynch : Hi, Ricky. First of all, let me say congratulations, and it has been a pleasure working with you, and we want to, on behalf of the entire CVS leadership team wish you all the best in your future endeavors. Relative to your question, first, let me remind you that we are the largest provider of retail health services in the nation. And having said that, we have a strategy that it - we are expecting to enhance our health services in three categories. As you mentioned, primary care, provider enablement and home health. And as we've talked about in the past, there are multiple pathways for us to make a mark on our community health care and our ability to achieve our strategic goals. And as we've talked about before, Ricky, we have very specific criteria that we look at as we're evaluating our many - many options. We look to see if there's a strong management team, which we are looking to see if there's a very strong tech stack. Obviously, the ability to scale, given the size of the company that we are and pathway to profitability. And as you know, Ricky, M&A can be very fluid. You don't necessarily design exactly how these deals and what gets announced. We are committed to extending our health services in categories. And we are very encouraged and confident that we'll take the next step on this journey by the end of this year. As you would expect, we are being very disciplined both strategically and financially, as we pursue kind of our M&A strategy. We can't be in the primary care without M&A. We've been very clear about that. And let me ask Shawn to talk a little bit more about the specific market dynamics. Shawn Guertin : Yeah. Thanks, Ricky, for the question. So we have been very active in evaluating a wide range of assets in and around the care delivery space. And what I would reiterate is that our priority areas remain primary care provider enablement and home health. It's really of paramount importance in a capability-based play that we fully evaluate those defining characteristics, which would include their capabilities to drive real and lasting value. The financial dynamics of these different business models and the optionality and growth levers that they provide us with, including our own ability to deploy our existing assets and create value in these entities. And as Karen mentioned, we've consistently stated that there are multiple pathways to follow to achieve our vision. Our vision is something new and differentiated as you know. And thus, there is no one and done asset there. And so while certainly no asset is perfect. There are differences. As Karen highlighted, when you look at the criteria amongst the available assets, particularly in terms of financial performance, the opportunities for future growth and our ability to drive value. I continue to believe that we can execute on our strategic vision via M&A and begin to execute on that vision in 2022. And the strength of our capital generation is part of what makes this possible, but also provides a powerful lever to supplement our core earnings via share repurchase. And I think we can still - it still remains our goal to commit to the targets that we talked about at Investor Day for '23 and '24. Ricky Goldwasser : Let me just ask a quick follow-up here. Thinking about your existing asset base and footprint and access point is used as valuate  additional assets to add to your portfolio that will really sort of enable that kind of long-term strategy. Maybe you can share with us sort of kind of how you're thinking about\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Karen Lynch : Ricky, thank you. We're having a hard time hearing you. Ricky Goldwasser : Sorry, can you hear me now? Karen Lynch : Yeah, a little bit better. Thank you. Ricky Goldwasser : Great. So if you think about your existing efforts or adding the footprint in the access points, how are you thinking about kind of like, what will really kind of like move your long-term strategy? Is it sort of owning or acquiring a primary care provider versus that kind of like, enabling technology that can connect it all together? Karen Lynch : Yeah, Ricky, I think there's a number of ways for us to think about kind of our overall strategy, and I'll just go back to - we're looking at capabilities. Obviously, in the primary care space, in the home space and in the provider enablement space. So it's a combination of all those. And as Shawn said, it's not a kind of one-and-done activity. We'll continue to evaluate a number of these options. Shawn Guertin : Yeah. And I think, Ricky, it is both, right? We do need both. And I think part of this is because it goes back to sort of achieving sort of a new and differentiated vision. You need a platform to do that from, right? So it is a set of extent businesses and assets that you can begin to work with, but it's also the platform and the technology and what that - you can then use that the springboard to do new and better things. And I think that's why we really need to move on both fronts with equal importance really. Karen Lynch : Yeah. And I think, Ricky, the important point to make here is that we have a very strong foundation with the assets that we have. And that's evidenced by the strength that we're seeing in our retail health operations. We had two point - we had a 12% increase in MinuteClinic visits just this quarter. So a lot of opportunity from the strong foundation that we already have. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. And further best wishes as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Lisa Gill : Great. Good morning. And thank you. Karen, I want to start with the current economic environment and how you're thinking about the overall 2023 selling season. So you talked about a strong selling season that the PBM side. But maybe if you or Alan, could maybe talk a little bit about, what are commercial employers looking for? How are you thinking about employee mid-trends? You talked about the different assets that you have. I know you have a new virtual primary care offering that you have in the marketplace. It's almost been 4 years since Aetna and CVS came together. So can you maybe just talk about where you see different plan design going in 2023 and what you're hearing from employers in the marketplace today, as we think about really bringing all of these assets together as a whole entity? Karen Lynch : Yeah. So, hi, Lisa, I would say what we're seeing and I said in the prepared remarks, we're having very strong retention results in all of our businesses through our national accounts and through Alan's businesses as well. What we're seeing is continued focus on access, lower sites of care, continue to look at cost. Obviously, employers are still interested in making sure that there's low cost, flexibility, and, you know, and really strong service, that the low cost, flexibility and really strong service. And that's really consistent across kind of the entire portfolio. What we're seeing is we continue to see very strong results with our integrated offerings. We've had very good results. We've - I think we've benefited from having an integrated sales team out in the market selling our products and capabilities. So we're pleased with kind of what we're seeing in the market. Obviously, it's been somewhat dampened pipeline across both businesses. So we've been \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you know, as I mentioned, having very retention. But let me ask Dan and Alan to give you a little more color on what they're seeing specifically as they're in the market and selling business, and I'll start with Dan. Dan Finke : Yeah. Thanks, Karen. I think you said it well. I mean, look, we're having really good conversations in the top of the house is all about controlling cost access and consumer experience. As you think about how that value shows up in those conversations, it shows up in some integrated benefit design and cross-sell opportunities. You can see that we're solving some of points with the no-cost, low-cost MinuteClinic benefit. We're also seeing it show up in new products and services, like our transform diabetes and oncology program. And then Lisa, you mentioned our virtual primary care. It's not just about in virtual primary care, it's about total virtual care and so offering solutions across the enterprise for virtual care. And then really lastly, good conversations about how we're using our local resources like MinuteClinic like the pharmacists for access points as well. Alan Lotvin : Yeah. So Lisa, it's Alan. I'll just add two things. One, we've certainly seen at the larger ends of the market. The benefit manager is focusing on bringing people back into the office post-COVID. And so we have seen contracts that we thought might go out in '23 and pushing out to 24 and sometimes '25%. So I think that's the first one. I think the second part would be, we see a continued desire for transparency for cost control, particularly in specialty and for kind of digital connectivity and the ability \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to really a critical moment when they're renewing a prescription they're thinking about their health. So although those things are resonating, particularly in those areas of the market that are still very active. Lisa Gill : Alan, you touched on specialty, and I mean, you guys are the biggest player. Obviously, Humira will lose or how biosimilars come to the market next year. Is that a conversation you're having with plan sponsors? And how do we think about that? Is that going to be a big driver, say, 2024, as you think about the PBM? Alan Lotvin : Yeah. So two things, Lisa. One, as you look out, it's more that just - everyone's focused on 2023 in Humira, but if you look out over the next 7 or 8 years, there's about $100 billion of product that's going to lose marketing exclusivity. We've started talking with our clients about biosimilars back basaglar  day, so 3, 4 years ago. So we both prepared the market for. We've articulated the strategies around lowest net cost and are continuing to work with our clients. So I do think that as we create - as more competition comes into the market, historically, that's always been very, very good for our customers and generally when - what I've said many times before, when we create value for our customers, they generally are happy to pay us for it. So I do think this is going to be a substantial impact in the PBM industry over the next 7, 8 years. Lisa Gill : Thank you. Shawn Guertin : Yeah, Lisa. The one thing I would add, you did ask specifically about some of the componentry on 2023, and I think it makes sense just offer some high-level comments on sort of the broader context, I think, that we see for '23. And obviously, I'm not providing specific 2023 guidance here. But I'd expect the construct of 2023 to be one of higher adjusted operating income in PSS and HCB given some of the things that Dan and Alan were just talking about. And then given a 2020 retail COVID outlook that's nearly double our initial expectations, I'd expect that we'd see lower earnings year-over-year in retail. Below operating income, given the activity, we'd expect lower interest expense and a flat share count. But I would say that overall, at this stage, again, I'd reiterate that, we remain committed to delivering on the adjusted EPS targets for '23 and '24 that are implied by our December Investor Day guidance and as reflected in the current consensus estimates. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Maybe first, just to ask about your experience with the front-end store and the retail side, that continues to be quite strong, even though I think there had been an expectation it would moderate this year. I assume at-home test is a part of that. Can you parse that out? And then also just say anything you will about sort of the underlying growth and where you're seeing the strength? Shawn Guertin : Yeah, A.J., I'll - let me just offer some kind of a frame for the quarters performance, which you are absolutely right. We've continued to see underlying strength in both the front and the back of the store beyond COVID. In the quarter itself, I would say about 60% of our outperformance in retail was really driven by those kind of COVID categories that we talk about. But the remainder, which is still a substantial amount is actually sort of the core strength in sort of the front store and the retail pharmacy operations. And obviously, OTC kits are a big part of the story, as I mentioned in my remarks, but I'll to Michelle to add some more detail on what's going on in the retail operation. Michelle Peluso : Yeah. We're really proud of the strength we've seen in the front store. That's come from a mid-single-digit increase in trips and also a mid-single-digit increase in average basket size. And as Shawn said, while sort of cough, cold, COVID was part of that and a strong part of that, we did see strength across all categories. I would just say two things. We think the momentum is a result of our continual pivot to fulfill the strategy we laid out at Investor Day to service local community health and wellness destinations. And secondly, that our investments are paying off. We're uniquely positioned in omnichannel world. And so our strong digital assets, plus our community presence and our investments in things like you buy online, pick up in store, omnipharmacy, they're accelerating, they're helping to fuel our growth. We've also redesigned cvs.com, which is driving much stronger engagement. We're modernizing our fleet and investing in smart supply chain infrastructure. So smart automation is helping us fuel our in-stock position, which we feel good about. And then finally, really doubling down on service to ensure we're most trusted in the community, that trust is a core part of our enterprise strategy, as you know. And just as small note, we were happy to see Morning Consult\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recognition of CVS Pharmacy as the most trusted brand and retail and actually one of the most trusted brands across every industry. So solid performance and we think we're well positioned as we head into next year. A.J. Rice: Great. Great, thanks. And on the - maybe just quickly on Medicaid re-verifications, updated thoughts there about timing on when that may go into effect to what your exposure might be? And have you done any analysis about your ability to recapture either through the marketplace or the commercial market, some of those members that may lose coverage via Medicaid? Shawn Guertin : Yeah, A.J., so now we're assuming, obviously, that the redeterminations really won't happen until next year of any kind of magnitude, obviously, with the extension of the PGA  assumption in our guidance. We estimate we've added about 400,000 to 500,000 members as a result of that. And this is a, you know, I put a caveat, it's a difficult thing to estimate on the retention side, but we might retain 25% plus or minus of that membership. Obviously, our individual exchange footprint is expanding, but still limited in the scope of our overall Medicaid block, so some of that will help. But it's still obviously a lot to play out. And then obviously, so this activity, obviously, will be more of a '23 activity now than '22, which we had talked about a quarter ago. A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Michael Cherny : Good morning and congratulations on a nice quarter. Shawn, I appreciate the early color that you provided on \u00e2\u0080\u009823 is trying to maybe take a step back real quick. Any changes to think about relative to the baseline in terms of what you reported and how to think through the dynamics of where you sit right now? And I guess, along those lines, as you think about the implied guidance into the end of the year, how are the moving pieces on COVID potential for increased costs in health care benefits versus potential upside as boosters and vaccines and testing continue in the store. How do those factor into where we should be considering the jumping off point next year? Shawn Guertin : Yeah. So there's a lot in there in terms of moving parts, right. The classic sort of baseline adjustments that we would make the prior year's development, that's probably in the neighborhood of, I think, about $0.12 right now on a year-to-date basis. The big driver here, right, is the thing that - last year was realized capital gains, this year is realized capital losses. And we have about $175 million recognized losses year-to-date and obviously, year-over-year investment income. So that's a story that will play out through the second half of the year and one that we're going to need to refine expectations on net investment income for 2023, just with all of the moving parts. Obviously, there were - we did talk about sort of the onetime adjustment that we had related to the long-term care insurance business. That's worth about $0.06. So those are some of the big baseline pieces and then you sort of now pivot to, I think, sort of the COVID moving parts between retail and HCB. I think for HCB, as I mentioned, we're at a point where we've priced this. We're 3 years away from sort of the last time we had a baseline without COVID. And this really, I think, has to kind of come down to the way we've always talked about this business traditionally, right? This is about kind of matching our prudent price increases across all of our products with our expected cost trends and kind of managing the revenue growth and operating margin dynamics. And I think we're in a very good place now for 2022 on that front and then - and as we position for 2023. I think on retail, while again, it's logical to think that given the level we're at this year, that will go backwards. I think our thinking is we still have sort of an endemic tail and a contribution in 2023. And I think we still anticipate that, that business can perform at a baseline level. That's consistent with what we talked about on Investor Day from sort of the jump-off point of around $6 billion. That's still something that we can operate around in that business. So there's still a lot to be played out, obviously, here in terms of where we go with future recommendations, obviously, around Booster. So - but I do feel good that we've got our - we were in a positive pricing position, I think, right now in HCV as we think about sort of pricing for COVID. And obviously, I think we're in a good position in terms of serving the communities in the - continuing to serve the communities on the COVID front. Michael Cherny : Thanks. I'll leave it there. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. First of all, let me say congrats on hiring Larry McGrath, he is the best, congrats. And then second, just on one of the questions on PBM. Specifically, there's a lot of questions in terms of how this the drug pricing provisions on the inflation Reduction Act might impact PBM. I was hoping to give you some color there. And then Shawn, you mentioned the headwind from 340B. Anyway to size that for us and thinking about how that might roll into next year? Would you fully annualized this, or could that be a quarter headwind into 2023? Thanks. Alan Lotvin : So Justin, it's Alan. Thank you. The first one though on the drug pricing provisions, so they're sort of limited, if you look at the details, it's 10 drugs in 26 and 20 by 29. And if you look at the way the language is structured, it would articulate that these are all products that are unlikely to have material competition. So I think the overall impact is going to be positive in the sense that drug pricing will come down for those products where we advance of competition, but I don't think the impact on the overall model is going to be substantial, just given the nature of the way the definition of which drugs fall in work, that's the first part. The second part with respect to 340B, as you know, there have been a lot of changes to the way that program has operated. And essentially, if you boiled it down, it's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there are two critical decision/actions on behalf of the covered entities. In order to reaccess the financial value, which as I know you know, critically important to many of those critical access hospitals to maintain their financial liability. We need to start providing a certain level of data on contract pharmacies to the pharmaceutical industry. Their decision-making process is somewhat slower than I think people expected, and then the ability to turn that data on is a little bit slower, but we're seeing steady decision-making and steady expansion of the number of hospitals that are doing it, and we expect that, that will continue through this year and into next year. Shawn Guertin : Yes. And Justin, just specifically to give you sort of a sense, I mean, as I mentioned in my remarks, we still think we'll be within the range, but probably in the lower half of that range for PSS. And the width of the midpoint to the bottom is a little more than $100 million. And so its in that sort of ballpark, sort of is the year-over-year sort of decrement, some of which, by the way, we experienced already a little bit in Q2. But last - about a quarter ago, we thought this could come in flat year-over-year and now we think it will be down a little bit year-over-year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Your line is now open. Eric Percher : Thank you. I'll shift back to the retail side. And a question really around COVID and the profitability of the VAX  scripts that you're seeing? I know you held some G&A cost early in the year given some of the increases in demand. Did you see a change in the level of G&A of staffing you're able or have to hold in Q2? Do you find that the profitability on COVID scripts is moving up as you can staff for it. And then how does that flip as we think about the second half of the year? And I know you mentioned investments. Shawn Guertin : Yes. So Eric, I would say, I mean sort of like anything that you do for a while, right, you get more and more efficient on how to do it. So I think on the margin, directionally, that's sort of gotten better. But we've kind of taken opportunity, obviously, with the results to think about how we continue to sort of invest in this business and invest in the customer experience and make sure that we can provide sort of the staffing and all of the services and capabilities that we need on the retail side. And so we've made some provision for that in our thinking for the second half of the year. and that's sort of incorporated in our outlook. Eric Percher : As you look at endemic, if we think about 10 million flu shots a year with relatively minimal change to the P&L during that season. Do you get to a point where you're able to staff for this in the pharmacy by moving around what you already have? Or is there always an incremental do you think it becomes even more efficient? Shawn Guertin : Yes. No, I'll turn it to Prem, but I think\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Prem Shah : Yes, we definitely can plan for it and it's part of our modeling. We do have a flu season every year. I would say as we've gotten smarter with COVID, we continue to be very nimble with our models and being able to leverage our staff, whether they're doing prescription-related work or vaccination or other work. So we're continuing to do that really well. And we're also preparing for some of the test to treat that's come out from HHS for the back half of this year and a pilot and then going to scale throughout the year. So we feel really good about it. Shawn Guertin : Just let me go back because I want to make sure I didn't \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Eric, since usually asked about PVM. I'll use you to go back to Justin's question on the PBM. I want to make sure that I was clear and not confusing on something, my commentary about directional contribution of 340B was specific to 2022 in terms of like what was in our guidance. Obviously, as that volume comes back online, we'd expect a different results for 2023 going forward, so. Eric Percher : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brian Tanquilut : Good morning, guys and congrats on the quarter. I guess my question, as we think about the store - the front store, the front store, I mean, obviously, high inflation rates for product categories across the board. So how are you thinking about what - first, what you're seeing in terms of the product inflation right now, where that's trending? And how are you thinking about that as it relates to the guidance? What's the assumption that you embedded for the revenue guidance going forward? Thanks. Karen Lynch : Yes. Let me start with what we're seeing and then turn it to Shawn on guidance. So for the most part, we're able to pass inflation through to our customers. Having said that, we're super mindful of an environment where we want to make sure there's value on the shelf at all times for our customers. And we think about that in - of course, we think about that in terms of how we price. But it's a great time for our store brands. Our store brands on average of 20% to 40% below our national brand. So it's a great time for consumers to find value at our store brands. do have a lot of substitutability across categories. And last but not least, we have a very large lever with extra care and care pass on the care passes up another 26% year-over-year. We have a great lever with extra car care path to make sure we're providing personalized coupons and deals so that our consumers see value on the shelf. So while it's a good guy in terms of being able to price in we're mindful of value in thinking about that really carefully across categories. Shawn Guertin : Yes. And keep in mind that the significant majority of our revenue in the retail segment is pharmacy driven, and we're not really seeing sort of the inflationary impacts that you kind of hear about in the headlines ripping through that segment. So that's still more the typical levels of pharmacy inflation that would be embedded in our outlook. And even within our front store product mix, sort of the inherent inflation rates in that kind of product mix is different and lower than sort of the big kind of gaudy headline numbers that you hear about- in kind of when they talk about inflation headlines. But again, really, it's really going to be the pharmacy sort of inflation assumptions that drive our revenue outlook. Brian Tanquilut : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Nathan Rich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Shawn, you mentioned the favorable cost trend versus expectations in the second quarter. Could you just give a little bit more detail on what drove that? And you didn't change the guidance for MBR  for the full year. Is there any change to your thinking for how cost run plays out in the back half of the year? And then if I could ask a follow-up just upfront. I just wanted to clarify the new COVID assumptions. I was trying to follow the numbers, and it seems like maybe $500 million of incremental revenue and $200 million of incremental earnings. But if you could just clarify that? That would be great. Shawn Guertin : Yeah. Let me do that one first. It's significantly more than that. We're talking about $3 billion, we've raised retail revenue about $2 billion well more than half of that is related to these COVID categories. So it's a significantly bigger contribution for the full year on that totaling about $3 billion of revenue for the year. And as I mentioned, that's nearly double where we sort of started the expectations for the year. on the MBR front, no, that's definitely positive. I still think our range is indicative of our performance in there. But obviously, just on Q2, we were on the favorable side of that. And so that outlook remains, I think, very positive from an underlying standpoint. As I mentioned, the product sort of the way this is rolling out by product has been very similar. Commercial really consistent with our baselines and probably a little favorability on Medicare and Medicaid. But I'll ask Dan to comment a little bit on what we're seeing below that. Dan Finke : Yes. Let me give you just a little flavor we're seeing in some of the service categories. First of all, across all of the lines of business, we are seeing the inpatient volume favorable, we're watching preventative care, PCP visits and specialists. And generally, those have returned to normal levels. We've been really focused on making sure our members have access to preventative care throughout the pandemic. ER is slightly lower than expected. And then when you think about the COVID costs overall as well, we did see a steady volume of COVID costs. that had lower severity, lower length of sand lower costs overall. So just give you a little flavor of the service categories. Nathan Rich : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the Q&A portion of today's conference. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Karen Lynch for her closing remarks. Karen Lynch : Before we conclude today, I just want to leave you with a couple of thoughts. Our team is delivering meaningful progress on our strategy as we're striving to become the nation's leading health solutions company.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Karen. Karen? Karen Lynch : Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. CVS Health delivered another outstanding quarter. Based on our strategic progress and confidence in our execution, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the third consecutive time this year to a range of $8.55 to $8.65. During the third quarter, we grew revenue by 10% versus the prior year to over $81 billion and grew adjusted operating income by nearly 4% over the prior year to $4.2 billion. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was $2.09, an increase of over 6% from the prior year. Our cash flow from operations was $9.1 billion in the third quarter and $18.1 billion year-to-date. Throughout 2022, we've consistently executed on our strategy centered around expanding our capabilities in health care delivery. We are increasingly delivering broader access to quality care, simpler journeys and better outcomes at lower costs across our channels. With the announced acquisition of Signify Health, we will strengthen our engagement with consumers. We will add best-in-class capabilities that enable in-home services and care coordination as well as a platform to accelerate value-based physician enablement. Together, we will have a strong foundation for developing new product offerings consistent with our payer-agnostic approach. We project that this transaction will close in the first half of 2023. We continually evaluate our portfolio of assets for nonstrategic areas that do not fit our long-term priorities. In October, we reached an agreement to sell bswift, and are actively exploring strategic alternatives for Omnicare. As we divest assets, we will continue to invest in areas aligned with our strategy with a disciplined approach to capital allocation. This morning, we made an important announcement on our ongoing opioid legal matter. In late October, we began a mediation to resolve substantially all opioid lawsuits and claims against CVS Health by states, political subdivisions and tribes. We reached an agreement in principle to pay approximately $5 billion over 10 years beginning in 2023, an outcome that is in the best interest of all parties and one that will help put a decades old issue behind us as we continue to focus on delivering a superior health experience for the millions of consumers who rely on us. Let's turn to each of our foundational businesses and discuss their strong results. The Health Care Benefits segment had another strong quarter. Revenues for the segment grew nearly 10% year-over-year with adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion. Our medical benefit ratio of 83.5% improved by 230 basis points versus the prior year, driven by a lower impact from COVID and medical cost trends that remained favorable. Enrolment in our Medicare and Commercial businesses was strong this quarter with our individual Medicare Advantage and PDP portfolio exceeding market growth once again. The 2023 Medicare annual enrolment period is underway and we are well positioned for another year of growth in our individual Medicare and dual-eligible products. We remain a leader in offering zero dollar premium plans with more than 73% of our plans in that category. We also continued our geographic expansion in the D-SNP market and now offer plans to 61% of D-SNP eligible population of more than 8% year-over-year. We were disappointed that the star rating on our national PPO contracts fell to 3.5 star after nearly a decade-long track record of performing at 4 stars or better. We have a strong history of delivering affordable, high-quality plan benefits and a commitment to continuous improvement. Improving our star performance continues to be a top priority for the company. We have the right actions in place to improve our star ratings with our ongoing quality and experience efforts as we address the specific measures scored on the member surveys that contribute to Star ratings. We will continue to focus on our members and invest in programs and processes specifically designed to simplify and improve their health care experience. This is an important priority for the company. In our commercial business, our growth is driven by the combination of our competitive cost structure, our integrated benefit design and services that utilize CVS Health platforms and capabilities. We achieved a key milestone this quarter with more than 2 million members enrolled in our integrated Aetna and Caremark products. This important goal demonstrates the value we provide our customers through our combined CVS Health offerings, a strong proof point of our strategy. Turning to our ACA individual exchange platform. We expanded our footprint and will be available in a total of 12 states beginning in January of 2023, covering 5.5 million lives or nearly 40% of the individual exchange population. Our co-branded product offerings include instant access to providers with 24/7 virtual care and face-to-face access in our MinuteClinic locations. We are committed to helping provide access to affordable care for all Americans.  Finally, our Medicaid platform continues to be an important area for growth. We grew our Ohio RISE program after a successful implementation and have been chosen by the State of Louisiana to serve a portion of their Medicaid eligible children due to the deep expertise we've built to engage and support children, their caregivers and their families. We have expanded our capabilities with a focus on quality and member engagement through our CVS Health community channels as we enter a robust bid period.  In Pharmacy Services, our revenue grew nearly 11% with adjusted operating income of $1.9 billion. Specialty pharmacy revenue grew 22% year-over-year driven by our industry-leading cost management and service excellence that continue to differentiate us in the marketplace. We closed out another successful selling season driving $3.5 billion of growth in new business for 2023 and a client retention rate of nearly 98%, evidence of the strength of our portfolio of capabilities. Efforts are underway to support a successful welcome season for our members. Last week, we learned that Centene decided to move their business to a competitor in 2024. While we hope to continue our relationship with Centene and bid to do so, we also maintained our pricing discipline. For the remainder of the contract, we will work with Centene to facilitate a seamless transition for members. Even after moving this contract, our purchasing power and our ability to drive value for our customers will not be diminished. Our demonstrated success in growing lives under management and revenue is a testament to our high-quality service, compliance capabilities and specialty pharmacy excellence. Our Pharmacy Services segment will remain an important driver of growth within CVS Health in the years to come. Our Retail/Long-Term Care segment also continues to outperform expectations. Revenues in the quarter grew nearly 7% versus the prior year with $1.4 billion in adjusted operating income. Performance in both the front store and pharmacy was strong. Front store sales were up approximately 4%, driven by growth across the majority of our categories. Demand for COVID vaccines and over-the-counter test as well as cough, cold and flu products remain high. In pharmacy, scripts grew 1.8% year-over-year in the third quarter or 3.6%, excluding COVID vaccines. This growth helped propel our retail pharmacy business to another quarter of year-over-year market share gains, extending a trend that started in the first quarter of 2020. Our community retail health destinations play a strengthening role in the overall well-being of the consumers we serve. As demand for health products and services continues to be elevated, we are implementing new digital capabilities that provide a seamless and convenient consumer experience. Now most of our pharmacists are empowered to prescribe Paxlovid COVID antiviral treatment. Our investments in omnichannel health are enhancing transparency and helping consumers better manage their overall health. While there is growing economic uncertainty and recession expectations in 2023, we are well positioned across our foundational businesses to manage through these potential headwinds. We are increasingly delivering connected experiences and health solutions that improve overall well-being. More and more, we are there for every meaningful moment of our consumers' health.  Throughout 2022, we made significant progress advancing our strategy, building a strong foundation for healthcare delivery and expanding our health service offerings and developing new products. In October, we announced that Dr. Amar Desai has joined CVS Health to lead our health care delivery strategy. Dr. Desai's experience in transforming the healthcare system and driving value-based care will accelerate our vision of becoming the leading health solutions company and our efforts to improve healthcare for consumers. 2022 has also been an important year for growing our digital presence and capabilities. This quarter, we added another approximately 1 million digital customers. CVS Health now serves more than 46 million unique digital customers, an impressive 11 million more since this time last year. Our digitally led omnichannel health approach prioritizes experience that matter most for consumers. This includes advancing our digital tools for a seamless and convenient experience, leading to higher engagement and satisfaction. For example, we recently launched a new functionality that drives more choice and convenience for patients filling prescriptions. Patients can expedite urgent prescriptions, have visibility into out-of-pocket costs and track their order status, all before even coming in to our pharmacy. We continue to make strong progress on ESG. For example, we are working to decrease disparities with our focus on women's health as it relates to accessing quality and convenient health care. As part of our Here for Her initiative, we are launching a variety of new MinuteClinic virtual care services to support women's health that will be available 24/7. And finally, I want to take this opportunity to again thank our CVS Health colleagues, especially those in Florida and Puerto Rico, who faced natural disasters. Our teams pulled together to ensure care continuity for our customers and the communities that we serve. I will now turn it over to Shawn for a deeper look into our operational and financial results and outlook. Shawn Guertin : Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect the continuation of the strong performance observed in the first half of 2022 as we exceeded our expectations for revenue, cash flow generation and adjusted earnings per share. This momentum allows us to again raise our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $8.55 to $8.65 per share. A few highlights regarding overall company performance. Third quarter revenues of over $81 billion increased by 10% year-over-year, reflecting robust growth across each of our operating segments. We delivered adjusted operating income of $4.2 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.09, representing increases of 3.9% and 6.1% versus prior year, respectively. Our ability to generate cash remains strong. Our cash flow from operations was $9.1 billion in the third quarter and $18.1 billion year-to-date. Cash flows in the quarter benefited from the timing of CMS payments that are expected to normalize in the fourth quarter. Looking at performance by business segment. In Health Care Benefits, we delivered strong revenue and adjusted operating income growth versus the prior year. Third quarter revenue of $22.5 billion, increased by nearly 10% over the prior year quarter. Membership grew 2.5% year-over-year despite the divestiture of 283,000 lives from Aetna International earlier this year. Our Medicare franchise remains a strong growth opportunity for us, adding 75,000 members sequentially across our portfolio of solutions for individuals and employers. Underlying growth in our commercial business also remains strong. We are excited about the prospects of our individual exchange business, which now includes 12 states as of January 1, 2023. The sequential decline in Medicaid membership is driven by a previously disclosed contract loss, partially offset by the ongoing suspension of redeterminations. Adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion increased 39.6% year-over-year primarily due to the impact of higher COVID costs in third quarter 2021, the COVID pricing actions we took this year and strong underlying performance, partially offset by incremental investments to support growth in the business and net realized investment portfolio losses. Our medical benefit ratio of 83.5% improved 230 basis points year-over-year, reflecting lower impact from COVID and medical cost trends that remain modestly favorable to our pricing assumptions. Consistent with last quarter, medical cost trends in our commercial business remain generally in line with pre-pandemic trended baselines and government remains slightly lower than the pre-pandemic trended baselines. Consolidated days claims payable at the end of the quarter was 54.9, up 0.6 days sequentially as reserves grew at a modestly higher rate than premiums. Overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. In the Pharmacy Services business, our ability to deliver industry-leading drug trend for our clients, our specialty management capabilities and outstanding customer service levels continue to drive growth. During the third quarter, revenue of over $43 billion increased by nearly 11% year-over-year. driven by pharmacy claims growth, specialty pharmacy and brand inflation, partially offset by the impact of continued client price improvements. Total pharmacy claims processed increased by 3.6% above prior year and 4.5% when excluding COVID-19 vaccinations, primarily attributable to new business in 2022 and increased utilization. Total pharmacy membership remains steady, exceeding 110 million members as growth in commercial and government lives helped to offset significant membership losses from the California Medicaid carve-out that started this year. Adjusted operating income of $1.9 billion grew nearly 6% year-over-year, driven by improved purchasing economics, including increased contributions from the products and services of our group purchasing organization. This was partially tempered by ongoing client price improvements. Quarterly contribution from our 340B product lines improved in the third quarter, in line with our estimates as covered entities address manufacturer conditions for program participation. In our Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we delivered strong revenue growth and adjusted operating income above our expectations despite mixed COVID-related trends and continued economic uncertainty. Specifically, during the third quarter, revenue of $26.7 billion grew nearly 7%, reflecting increased prescription and front store volume, including the sale of COVID-19 over-the-counter test kits as well as pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in COVID-19 diagnostic testing and vaccinations, the impact of recent generic introductions and continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure.  Adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion declined 18.9% versus prior year, driven by decreased COVID-19 diagnostic testing and vaccinations, continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure as well as increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities. These decreases were partially offset by the increased prescription and front store volume, improved generic drug purchasing and the favorable impact of business initiatives. Pharmacy prescription volume grew 1.8% year-over-year, reflecting increased utilization. Excluding the impact of COVID, pharmacy prescription volume increased by 3.6% year-over-year.  Turning to the balance sheet. Our liquidity and capital position remain excellent. Year-to-date, we generated cash flow from operations of $18.1 billion, and ended the quarter with $7.9 billion of cash at the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries. Cash flows during the quarter were positively impacted by the early receipt of $3.2 billion of CMS payments which will normalize in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we repaid $2.6 billion of long-term debt. Through our quarterly dividend, we returned $726 million to shareholders. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings, while also having the flexibility to deploy capital strategically for capability-focused M&A.  A few other items worth highlighting for investors. We continue to experience the impact of market volatility on our investment portfolio and recorded net realized capital losses of approximately $110 million in the quarter. These losses emerged predominantly in the HCB segment. We were not immune to the impacts of Hurricane Ian and recorded losses of approximately $40 million related to damages from the storm. We recorded a pretax loss on assets held for sale of $2.5 billion related to the write-down of our long-term care business, Omnicare, where we are in the process of exploring strategic alternatives. We also recorded pretax charges of $5.2 billion for legal settlements related to agreements in principle with certain states and governmental entities to resolve opioid claims. Consistent with past practice, these GAAP impacts have been excluded from our adjusted operating metrics. Turning to our 2022 outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 to a range of $8.55 to $8.65. This increase reflects favorable underlying third quarter performance in retail and HCV; an improved Q4 outlook for the retail LTC segment and slight improvement in the full year outlook for tax rate and share count, partially offset by the anticipated impact of market volatility on net investment income for the HCV business. We are narrowing our full year adjusted operating income guidance in healthcare benefits to a range of $5.96 billion to $6.02 billion. This reflects the previously discussed strong underlying fundamental performance, offset by continued caution on our outlook for investment income given the volatile rate environment. Our outlook also contemplates the extension of the public health emergency into the early part of the first quarter of 2023. For the retail LTC segment, we are raising and narrowing full year guidance as follows : revenue increases to a range of $102.7 billion to $104.0 billion. Adjusted operating income guidance increases by $105 million at the midpoint to a range of $6.66 billion to $6.72 billion. We now forecast that we will administer 28 million COVID-19 vaccinations in 2022 with approximately 70% already administered through the third quarter of 2022. We expect full year diagnostic testing volumes of approximately 17 million, which is down from our prior outlook. However, we now expect higher sales of over-the-counter test kits exceeding 65 million units or nearly triple the number of kits sold last year. In aggregate, we expect these three categories of COVID-driven items to continue to produce over $3 billion of revenue in 2022, a decline of approximately 29% versus 2021, but reflective of the endemic tail of COVID on our retail business. Our updated outlook also contemplates higher levels of investment spending in the fourth quarter as we continue to invest in our workforce and enhance our customer experience. In Pharmacy Services, we are narrowing our outlook range and now project full year adjusted operating income guidance to be between $7.31 billion to $7.40 billion. Looking at the enterprise as a whole, we anticipate continued strong cash flow from operations in 2022 and have raised our guidance accordingly to a range of $13.5 billion to $14.5 billion, with capital expenditures unchanged at a range of $2.8 billion to $3.0 billion. We are also updating our guidance on share count to a range of 1.325 billion to 1.33 billion shares and on our effective tax rate to 25.5%. As Karen noted earlier, we have reached an agreement in principle to resolve substantially all opioid lawsuits and claims against CVS Health, providing increased clarity regarding this long-standing issue. The agreement amount to be paid is approximately $5 billion and will be paid over 10 years beginning in 2023. The timing of cash settlement payments spread over multiple years results in an annual impact to our cash flows that enables us to continue to invest in our strategic priorities. While we will offer detailed 2023 guidance on our fourth quarter call in early February, I wanted to offer some high-level commentary as investors think through our potential financial performance in 2023. We need to consider several factors as we determine the 2022 baseline. First, prior year reserve development improved our year-to-date 2022 adjusted operating income by over $217 million or approximately $0.12 of adjusted earnings per share, and we do not forecast prior year reserve development to recur in future periods.  Second, due to the turbulent rate environment, we have experienced unanticipated headwinds in our net investment income in 2022. As we look at the full year, these headwinds could exceed $350 million or over $0.20 in adjusted EPS. In 2023, we plan to use a reporting convention that excludes capital gains and losses from adjusted operating income, consistent with how Aetna, which bears the vast majority of these impacts, reported these items prior to the acquisition. Third, in the second quarter of 2022, we strengthened reserves in our legacy Aetna Long Term Care insurance business, which reduced adjusted operating income by $108 million or approximately $0.06 per share. This adjustment was the first time we significantly adjusted this reserve since the Aetna acquisition, and we do not currently project we will need to make additional adjustments to this reserve in 2023. Fourth, we have made great progress this year in rationalizing our portfolio to focus on those businesses that will drive the highest growth for our enterprise over the long term. While none of these divestitures, which include Payflex, bswift and portions of our Aetna International business are material on their own, collectively, they present a 2023 headwind of approximately $0.04 in adjusted EPS. In addition to those specific adjustments, we are projecting that our retail LTC segment will have over $3 billion of revenues in 2022 from COVID, which have a robust margin profile. It is not prudent to anticipate a similar level of COVID-based revenues going forward. And we expect that the economics on vaccines and diagnostic testing will change following expiration of the public health emergency which we project will happen in the early part of the first quarter of 2023. As detailed in our third quarter slide presentation, starting with the midpoint of our updated adjusted EPS guidance range of $8.60 and adjusting for these items creates a 2022 baseline of approximately $8.20.  Shifting to our view on 2023, there are a number of headwinds and tailwinds that we are contemplating as we develop our outlook. In our retail business, we plan to continue to offset reimbursement pressure and wage improvements with continued script growth and purchasing improvements as well as front store growth and benefits from our store footprint optimization efforts. We remain committed to generating at least $6 billion of adjusted operating income in this segment in 2023, consistent with the targets we outlined at our Investor Day in December of 2021. In PSS, we are targeting mid-single-digit growth over our baseline New sales wins and growth in specialty generic and biosimilar launches will help drive this result, combined with stabilization of 340B dynamics and a continued focus on efficiencies. In Health Care Benefits, we will continue to target mid- to high single-digit growth. The strength of our Medicare Advantage offering in 2023 and continued membership growth, including in individual and group Medicare will help to offset losses from Medicaid redeterminations in our divested assets to drive top line growth. Continued disciplined pricing and efficiencies will help to drive adjusted operating income growth. Capital deployment remains an important part of our growth equation, and we expect to repurchase shares in 2023 opportunistically to ensure we achieve our targets and to offset dilution. Our preliminary outlook does not include any impact from the announced acquisition of Signify Health, which we continue to project will close in the first half of 2023 and be accretive to adjusted EPS. Taking all these factors into consideration, our initial goal in 2023 is to grow our adjusted EPS to a range of $8.70 to $8.90. At the midpoint, this range is consistent with the high single-digit outlook we provided at our Investor Day last December. Before we conclude, I want to discuss the recent 2024 Medicare Stars updates. We are very disappointed with our Medicare Stars results for 2024. But remain dedicated to providing our Medicare Advantage members with the high quality and service that they have come to expect. We also remain committed to maintaining a competitive product and benefits offering in 2024 and to continue to grow Medicare Advantage membership throughout this period. The change in star ratings is not projected to impact our 2022 guidance, and we expect to be able to manage the impacts to 2023, including cost to improve our 2024 star ratings. Our intent is to mitigate some of the financial impact of lower stars ratings in 2024 through our ongoing contract diversification efforts combined with a variety of operational initiatives as we work to find additional efficiencies. Even if successful, given the magnitude of this headwind, it is appropriate to assume that these efforts alone while potentially significant will not close the entire gap. The recently announced loss of the Centene contract places further pressure on our 2024 outlook. Importantly, and to be absolutely clear, the powerful capital generation capabilities of our enterprise provide us with financial capacity to increase share repurchase and in excess of the $8 billion of our remaining authorization and produce adjusted EPS consistent with our 2021 Investor Day outlook; which had implied adjusted EPS in the range of $9.75 to $9.95 in 2024. While this would achieve a 2024 EPS objective, repurchasing shares alone will not advance the strategic positioning of the company. Alternatively, strategic capital deployment may not yield the same adjusted EPS accretion in 2024 as share repurchases, but could further advance our care delivery strategy and help sustainably accelerate the adjusted EPS growth rate of CVS Health. Absent deploying capital towards further strategic acquisitions Investors should expect that we will deploy capital towards share repurchases to address our 2024 earnings headwinds. We remain committed to using our liquidity to help achieve both our long-term and near-term goals.  To conclude, our third quarter results reflect continued strength from all our core business segments and we are pleased to raise our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance. Our focus on growth and operational execution persists and we continue to progress on our long-term strategy.  We will now open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Shawn, thank you for all that detail. I just really want to go back the last comment that you made and just really understand how you and Karen are thinking about this. One, you talked about hiring Dr. Desai as Head of Healthcare Delivery. And as we think about that strategy going forward, is it, one, you haven't found an acquisition that fits? Two, do you think that there's organic opportunities? And I do appreciate that if something doesn't come along, you're going to buy back shares. But I think as investors think about your story longer term, they want to see you really propelling the strategy that you and Karen laid out last year. So that would be my first question. Karen Lynch : Yes, Lisa, it's Karen. So let me start. You're right. We laid out a strategy, and we said that we wanted to expand into healthcare services. We said that we wanted to have primary care. We thought we would need an acquisition to do that. We also said we want to extend into the home and have provider enablement through the Signify acquisition. That represents strong execution this year of our strategy. We will continue to evaluate our options on primary care. And as I said, we believe that we need to do M&A and we continue to evaluate those options in the marketplace. Shawn Guertin : Yes. And Lisa, I would just echo. I mean, obviously, I think with the 10 months since our Investor Day we've been at this, I think we've demonstrated and I've talked to you a lot about the discipline we have around value and capability assessment. And that will be something that we continue to embrace and will remain critical for the future. So that, I think, has not changed, but it's certainly something we've embraced. As it pertains to M&A and some of my closing comments, what I would say is keep in mind that the ultimate answer here is a byproduct of the specific attributes of any asset and where we are at a given time in terms of our cash and balance sheet capacity. At our current valuation, an M&A deal is likely less accretive than share repurchase. Having said that, for the right strategic deal, we could opt to use the balance sheet capacity we still have even after these enhanced levels of share repurchase. Lisa Gill : Okay. Great. And so just so I understand this, I know you're not giving any kind of guidance yet around cash flow. But is there anything that should be different when we think about cash flow for '23? Just to give us an idea of how much cash flow you'll have available for something in this area. Shawn Guertin : I think in the broad strokes of the year, it's going to be a similar year. Obviously, I think we think CapEx will be in a comparable position and obviously, regulatory capital is a byproduct of the growth in the business, and we'll look at that as well. But our sort of baseline assumption that is behind my commentary today is a similar level of cash flow that we're talking about for this year in the same neighborhood. Again, we'll provide more detailed guidance on the Q4 call, but the '23 capacity, I think, is very sound and intact. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : I'll start with my follow-up to Lisa's question here. Shawn, during your prepared comments at the end there, you gave at least me the impression that there was kind of an if-then statements on this position -- on the potential for a physician deal versus share repurchase and the ability to hit 2024. So I just want to clarify, are you saying that if you do a large physician group purchase, obviously, that advances the strategy, but if you do that, you probably don't have enough capital to buy back shares and still hit the 2024 low double-digit EPS estimate. So you can hit the low double digits if you don't do a physician deal, you -- that number becomes a risk if you do a physician deal? Shawn Guertin : Yes. What I'm saying is it's hard for me to be completely definitive when we're talking about a hypothetical asset, right? And so -- what I will say to you is we have done modeling where we can achieve both objectives. And obviously, we think it's the job of management to always try to achieve your near-term and your long-term objectives. Again, the ultimate answer around that will be dictated by the specific asset and the timing of when we have to fund for that asset. So in the absence of sort of having sort of an actual deal in hand where I could be more definitive. But let me be clear, our goal is to try to achieve both. We think there is a pathway to achieve both but ultimately, the specifics of having a deal in hand. I'll also clarify, if we don't have the deal, I think I was pretty clear in my remarks, then we will continue to proceed with repurchase and as we march towards achieving those objectives. So that, I think, again, in the absence of having sort of something specific to talk about, I think that's the framework I'd like you to understand. Justin Lake : That's helpful. And then my question was just around, you mentioned a couple of headwinds to 2024, specifically the Centene loss in the [stars] (ph). I assume there's probably a little much to ask for exact potential impacts from that. But maybe you could just put it in the context of the long-term growth targets in those businesses over the PBM, I think it's mid-single digits and for the healthcare benefits, it's mid- to high. Maybe you could talk about how to view the lens to view 2024 in those businesses with those specific headwinds? Shawn Guertin : Yes. Let me talk about the '24 headwinds a little bit more specifically. We project the combined impact of [stars] (ph) and Centene on 2024 to be approximately $2 billion on an unmitigated basis. My comments today regarding repurchases and achieving our Investor Day commitments, assume that we're successful in mitigating approximately half of this headwind. And that work is in process and underway, but obviously not 100% certain at this stage. That would leave a headwind of about $1 billion or $0.55 a share for 2024. The amount of repurchases required to combat that headwind could be up to $10 billion. But obviously, the actual amount can vary based on assumed share price and the cost of any debt financing. And going to Lisa's question about capacity, this is an amount that we have the cash and balance sheet capacity to handle and stay within our leverage metrics for 2023. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Michael Cherny : Maybe one just a clarification and then a separate question. With regards to the '23 bridge, can you just let us know in terms of what's preliminarily target on, a, what -- is that $0.50 COVID net headwind, that does include some COVID contribution and then the health care benefits mid- to high single-digit growth. Any way to couch out or tease out what you have in there relative to the investments around the stars performance? Shawn Guertin : Yes. We've contemplated whatever SG&A investments that we need to make in that outlook for next year, and then we will make some obviously, and that has been contemplated. I'm glad you asked about COVID and retail because you just want to make sure that everyone's grounded in that. As we mentioned, we're still around $3 billion of revenue. We've talked about the margin profile in that business before. In that $0.50, there's an item or two that actually kind of goes the other way like the hurricane, for example. But you're talking about probably removing $900 million of operating income on COVID-related categories in retail, which if you went back through each quarter's guidance increase, that's about what we've raised the guidance sort of over the course of the year. So we're resetting back to a number there for comparison purposes to something that's closer to sort of how we kind of entered the year. Again, I think this year is a good demonstration that there's an endemic tail to this business going forward. And so we are expecting some contribution likely not as high as we thought coming into this year. But again, that's also baked into our outlook of getting to $6 billion on that business. Michael Cherny : Got it. And then I don't mean to keep this completely hypothetical, but obviously, I'm not going to ask you about what could or could not happen with the primary care side on M&A. I'm going to ask on what you're doing on an organic basis? And how should we think about the build-out that you're going to be putting in place investments you're going to be making while you do wait for a deal to come or not to come to fruition? Karen Lynch : Michael, it's Karen. Yes. So first of all, obviously, we just hired Dr. Desai to help us really clarify our longer-term clinical care delivery strategy. We have been making investments across all of our businesses to support healthcare delivery. We've made investments in in the clinic to extend our services. We've been making investments in the front store to extend our health and wellness and we're really driving at our integrated products to drive growth of the top line. And we're having very strong progress around that. So we continue to invest in products and service capabilities to make sure that we are competitive in the marketplace. So all across the company, we've been making this investments to advance our strategy. And what I would say is that we are continuing to perform on our strategy. I think a good evidence of that is our Signify acquisition. I think that gives you a good sense that we're executing strongly. We said we wanted to be in the home. We'll make investments around that. And as I said, we expect to close in the first half of 2023. Operator : We'll take our next question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. A.J. Rice : I guess I'm doing two quick cleanups, hopefully, here from previous questions. For the '23 outlook, you don't have signify in there, but you think it's going to close in the first half of the year and you have this Omnicare, so you're pursuing. Any way to bracket what the range of potential accretion Signify might represent? And would an Omnicare sale be a positive or a negative to the outlook? And then just maybe a little more on the mitigation efforts. It sounds like half of the mitigation for '24 or half of -- yes, you're offsetting, you said, about half of the headwind with mitigation. I'm specifically wondering with your national PPO, how you can move that. I know we used to be able to just collapse plans, but it's a little tougher these days to move members. Can you talk a little bit about what you're doing with all of that? Karen Lynch : A.J., I'll start and then Dan and Shawn will clean up. Relative, I just want to go back to your question on Omnicare. I think it's important for you also recognize that we continue to evaluate our portfolio strategically and are making decisions around assets that don't fit into our portfolio strategically, Omnicare is a good example of that. bswift is a good example of that. And as Shawn said earlier this year, we made divestitures as part of our international business and Payflex as well. Regarding stars, and I'll let Shawn talk about the financials in a second. Just a comment on stars, I would just say kind of across the industry, everyone was challenged with stars, and we were extremely disappointed in our 3.5 star rating plan. But as you know, we have been a very strong leader in stars performance for a decade. And we continue to invest. We will continue to invest in our star performance. We have a number of actions relative to the CAP survey and member scores, which is really part of the driver. We do have a diversification effort. I'll ask Dan to talk about what we're specifically doing there. But I am confident that we have the activities, the investment and approach to mitigate stars for 2024. And with that, let me turn it to Shawn to talk about the divestitures and then Dan will pick up on stars. Shawn Guertin : Okay. Just on the -- so on the divestitures and obviously, this is -- the timing of all this is still to be determined. But I think if successful on Omnicare, there's probably another $0.02 or $0.03 potentially that I would add to that $0.04 that I described in the bridge for divested asset.  Again, not something that I think that would change our outlook on our range. But when you're thinking about the baseline, it would be a small sort of a small additional item. But again, 1 we think is navigable for 2023. And obviously, we think this is the right long-term thing strategically to do for the business. Signify, we will -- when we get to the closing, we'll talk more specifically about the accretion. But you're right, we do not have anything in there right now. But when we get more definitive idea on closing date, we can talk about the accretion on that. Daniel Finke : Yes. Let me give you a little bit of flavor of our mitigation strategy. I mean the way I would think about it is we do have a broad mitigation strategy, but there are two very specific initiative and approaches that we're that we're pushing. First of all, as Karen said, is our track record around star, shows that we have a robust stars and CAPS program. And it's through that program that we've already taken some actions and improved things like benefit improvements. An example of that is where we moved 200 drugs to a lower tier for about 650,000 members. We've enhancements to our medication adherence programs and continuous operational efficiencies. With that said, we also have a very intense focus across the enterprise on some targeted actions to drive some improved performance in some of those impactable domain measures. Those are the ones that give us the greatest opportunity to really move the score. So things like gaps in care, member incentives and experience improvements, so really intense program efforts there. On the contract diversification, we do recognize that we've had a concentration of members in one contract. That's largely a result of our own success in using that high-quality popular contract for expansion efforts. And we've been working on this contract diversification. It's been in progress. And we have some additional tactics that we're taking to achieve that, and we'll update you as things progress. Operator : We'll take our next question from Eric Percher with Nesson Research. Eric Percher : Question on the potential settlement of $5 billion. I'm interested in your view on state buy-in. Obviously, you want to ring-fence all liability, but where the distributors were national pharmacy chains have very different state penetration. So what's your view on the likelihood that all states will sign on? And what's a reasonable goal for among the states and municipalities? Karen Lynch : Yes, Eric, let me just give kind of a broad view of opioids. I'll give you our perspective on that. I just want to reiterate that in late October, we did begin our mediation discussions. And as we disclosed today, we have an agreement in principle to substantially close on all of the opioid lawsuits and the claims against the company. As you mentioned, all conditions have to be satisfied, and that means the face to buy in. We have experience in Florida, where we have demonstrated our ability to have those conversations. So we'll be monitoring it across the board. But as Sean and I both said, this clearly provides us more certainty and it gives us -- puts a decade-long issue behind us so that we can clearly focus on our strategy of improving health quality and access to care for our customers. I would also tell you that we recognize that the seriousness of the opioid abuse in this conduct has had on so many Americans. And I just would say that we have made significant investments over the years to combat the opioid crisis and continue to do so through our leadership and our behavioral health company. So we are working -- we'll work very closely with the states, Eric, and we're -- we'll keep you updated along the way. Eric Percher : I appreciate that. And is there any type of minimum we should think of as required to get this to the finish line? Karen Lynch : At this point, there's not necessarily a minimum we need to kind of work through and have the states. But recognize that all the AGs were at the table having these discussions over this mediation period. So we have a high degree of confidence. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Elizabeth Anderson : I had a question in regards to the 2023 outlook that provided maybe specifically on the Pharmacy Services business, which we haven't talked about as much. Can you sort of walk us through sort of the puts and takes of that mid-single-digit growth that you're outlining for 2023? Shawn Guertin : Yes, Elizabeth, I would say it's a fairly straightforward story as it pertains to next year. Obviously, we had another good sales season and good renewal season. We have the normal sort of volume and revenue drivers. We also have the normal headwinds around pricing and things like that, that we need to sort of solve for. So I think the big thing us year-over-year is we'll have some stabilization now, I think, in 340B, whereas that was a drag, obviously, this year a little bit on growth, that should turn in the other direction. So that will also be helpful. Obviously, we're still -- we think the timing around biosimilars and specialty generics will be pushed out into the year a little bit and that effect. But Alan, anything you'd like to add to that? Alan Lotvin : No, I think the only thing I would add, Shawn, is continued focus on expense management, on optimizing minimizing all guaranteed exposure. So it's, I would say, very much business as usual with sales growth and kind of 340B stabilization as the changes. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Erin Wright : This is Erin Wright and Ricky here. But we did see that you signed a value-based care contract with the home health provider announced this week. How do you think about the trade-off between partnerships and owning home health assets? And can partners such as this help you to fill that gap as opposed to necessarily outright M&A? And then I have a quick follow-up. Karen Lynch : Well, Erin, on the home services, as you know, we believe that our Signify Health will close some of the gaps that we have in home, and it will give us a platform to accelerate return to care and provider enablement. So we're -- we've made the decision, obviously, to do an acquisition in the home health space. Obviously, the Aetna business continues to have a variety of different contracts, and we'll continue to look at their network to make sure that they have adequate coverage across the country. And I'll ask Dan if there's anything else he wants to ask. Daniel Finke : Yes. Karen, I would just add that value-based contracting has been a key portion of our strategy for a long time in HCB, and it continues to be. It's a way that we can provide value not only to our providers, but also to our customers. As you think about the acquisition strategy, that only enhances our ability to provide a really strong network. And so I would think about those as sitting side by side and only strengthening the opportunity that we have to provide value to our customers. Erin Wright : Okay. Great. And then the follow-up is when we think about your ability to achieve those near-term EPS targets as well as long-term strategic targets for you, will this involve taking on more debt? Or is this all based on cash? Shawn Guertin : No, we would actually use some of our balance sheet capacity. We're well below sort of our leverage metrics now, and we'll continue to do that. So we have been building both cash and balance sheet capacity. And to accomplish both of those objectives, we would need to take on more debt. But again, we remain committed to our investment-grade rating structure. And I can, just as a rough rule of thumb, about 10 basis points on our debt-to-EBITDA is worth $2 billion of debt or thereabout. So they sound like small numbers, but they're actually significant in terms of capacity. So yes, we would do that, but we would remain committed to sort of our investment-grade ratings today. Operator : This concludes the Q&A. Karen Lynch : Thank you for joining the call today. We appreciate your participation, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's CVS Health Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time. Have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Tom Cowhey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets for CVS Health. Please go ahead. Tom Cowhey : Good morning and welcome to the CVS Health fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call and webcast. I am Tom Cowhey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets for CVS Health. I am joined this morning by Karen Lynch, President and Chief Executive Officer of CVS; Shawn Guertin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CVS; and Mike Pykosz, Chairman, CEO and Co-Founder of Oak Street Health. Following our prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session that will include additional members of the CVS management team : Daniel Finke, President, Healthcare Benefits; Michelle Peluso, Chief Customer Officer and Retail Co-President; Prem Shah, Chief Pharmacy Officer and Retail Co-President; David Joiner, new President, Pharmacy Services; and Dr. Alan Lotvin, outgoing President Pharmacy Services. Our earnings and Oak Street acquisition press releases and slide presentations have been posted to our website along with our Form 10-K and our Form 8-K that we filed this morning with the SEC. Today\u2019s call is also being broadcast on our website where it will be archived for 1 year. During this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements reflecting current views related to our future financial performance, future events, industry and market conditions, including impacts related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as the expected consumer benefits of our products and services and our financial projections and the benefits of the pending acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health and the associated integration plans, expected synergies and revenue opportunities. All forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently projected results, including with respect to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the pending acquisition and integration of Signify Health. We strongly encourage you to review the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are described in the cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements and the Risk Factors section in this morning\u2019s earnings press release, Oak Street Health acquisition press release and included in our Form 10-K and the Form 8-K we filed this morning. During this call, we will use non-GAAP measures when talking about the company\u2019s performance and financial condition and you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in this morning\u2019s press release and the reconciliation document posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Karen. Karen? Karen Lynch : Thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone and thanks for joining our call today. This morning, we are going to discuss our 2022 results, our 2023 guidance and our announcement that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Oak Street Health. Mike Pykosz, Chairman, CEO and Co-Founder of Oak Street Health will join Shawn and me during the call to discuss this important transaction. But first, 2022 was a year of progress for CVS Health. We delivered strong financial results, we made meaningful progress on our strategy and we brought a greater value to the people that we serve. This morning, we announced that we exceeded our adjusted EPS expectations for the fourth quarter in a row, delivering fourth quarter 2022 adjusted EPS of $1.99 and full year 2022 adjusted EPS of $8.69. This result represents nearly 10% growth over our 2021 baseline. For 2023, we continue to expect adjusted EPS in the range of $8.70 to $8.90, which at the midpoint represents high single-digit growth off of our 2022 baseline of approximately $8.25. In 2022, CVS Health surpassed the $300 billion mark in total revenue, growing full year revenues by more than 10% to $322 billion. We delivered adjusted operating income of $17.5 billion and generated adjusted EPS of $8.69. Our ability to generate cash flow from operations was robust at nearly $16.2 million for the full year. Each of our foundational businesses generated excellent results. Starting with the Health Care Benefits segment, we grew revenues by more than 11% for the year and delivered adjusted operating income of $6 billion. Our medical benefit ratio of 84% improved by 100 basis points versus the prior year and was consistent with our full year expectations after adjusting for the impact of elevated flow in the fourth quarter. I want to highlight a few areas within the HCB segment. Although our individual Medicare Advantage growth was below our expectations, Medicare Advantage remains a key strategic growth area for CVS Health. We remain focused on delivering superior service to our Medicare Advantage members while advancing our efforts to improve our Star ratings. We are executing on the actions we identified to address our CAP survey scores and are making the necessary investments to drive our Stars Improvement initiatives. We also made progress in the last 90 days in advancing our efforts to diversify our national PPO contract and have obtained the necessary regulatory approvals to move forward. This will enable us to more effectively manage our Medicare business in the future. As we will discuss shortly, adding both Signify Health and Oak Street Health to our value-based care delivery platform will deepen our focus on this important business. In our individual exchange business, we now expect to end 2023 with between 900,000 and 1 million individual members. This significant growth in membership is driven by our provider network, market growth, marketplace disruptions and our co-branded integrated benefit offerings. We anticipate a positive, sustainable contribution from this membership in future years. Our Pharmacy Services segment grew full year revenues by 11% with adjusted operating income of $7.4 billion. Performance in our specialty pharmacy was again outstanding. Revenue grew more than 19% year-over-year, driven by our industry-leading digital and specialty pharmacy capabilities. As we enter 2023, the first wave of new biosimilars will be coming to market, starting with competitors for HUMIRA. We recently announced that Amjevita will be added to coverage within our commercial formularies alongside HUMIRA and other branded products. Our approach to biosimilars reflects our commitment to drive the lowest net cost for our clients while providing members coverage of clinically safe, effective medications and ensuring continuity of care. Retail delivered another strong year, outperforming our initial guidance and long-term targets. Revenues for the year grew by more than 6% versus the prior year and we generated $6.7 billion of adjusted operating income. We finished 2022 with another quarter of strong performance in both the pharmacy and the front store. Pharmacy revenue increased by nearly 8% versus the prior year and delivered another quarter of year-over-year market share gains. Front store revenues grew by nearly 7% driven by demand for consumer health and cough, cold and flu products. We are making significant progress advancing our strategy, which includes expanding our care delivery and health services capabilities in primary care, home health and provider enablement. Last year, we announced the pending acquisition of Signify Health, which represented an important step forward in our value-based care strategy. Signify will strengthen our presence in the home and enhance our provider enablement capabilities. We now project that this transaction will close in the second quarter of 2023. At our Investor Day in 2021, we shared our vision to deliver a superior health experience for consumers. Central to our strategy is advancing our value-based care platform of capabilities that drive consumer engagement. This morning, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Oak Street Health outstanding shares for $39 per share in cash, representing a total transaction value of approximately $10.6 billion. The acquisition of Oak Street Health will broaden our value-based care platform into primary care and accelerate our long-term growth. Primary care drives patient engagement and positive clinical outcomes. Although it is a very small proportion of total health spend, just about 10% nationally, it will significant influence over healthcare utilization. Individuals who seek routine primary care services report fewer serious medical diagnoses, lower mortality rates and a 33% lower annual healthcare expense. Oak Street Health has a proven senior-focused primary care model that is scalable at a national level. Their innovative care model goes beyond typical primary care to provide patients with comprehensive preventative care to support overall health and well-being. With 169 medical centers across 21 states today, we see a significant opportunity to expand in the next 2 years and provide superior care to many more patients. Oak Street has a committed and experienced leadership team with extensive care delivery expertise and a best-in-class fully integrated technology solution. Oak Street\u2019s model focuses on providing more coordinated, holistic and connected care. Oak Street physicians spend 3x longer on average with their 159,000 at-risk patients and drive markedly better outcomes. Their approximately 600 providers and 6,000 team members have a proven ability to improve patient outcomes and experiences. At a time when consumers are increasingly frustrated with their experience in the healthcare system, Oak Street\u2019s approach delivers a truly specialized care experience that drives a net promoter score of 90. The quality of this experience is evidenced by the fact that Oak Street was selected to be the trusted primary care partner of AARP and is the only primary care provider to carry the AARP name across all their sites. As part of CVS Health, we believe Oak Street\u2019s value-based care model will have a far greater impact on patients. Our unparalleled consumer touch points will expand Oak Street\u2019s reach and will allow them to engage with more consumers more frequently and more conveniently. The combination of CVS Health\u2019s foundational businesses with Oak Street and Signify Health creates one of the premier multi-payer Medicare value-based care platforms in the marketplace today. But our ambition does not stop there. These Medicare-focused assets complement our established care delivery assets, including our over 1,100 retail health MinuteClinics in a number of ways : creating convenient access and additional clinical capacity for Oak Street with preventive care and chronic care services for seniors; enhancing access to our broad nurse practitioner workforce; and providing wraparound services tailored to seniors and those with complex conditions such as medication reconciliation and post-discharge follow-ups. The potential across CVS Health\u2019s base of assets is powerful. Together, we will transform the experience for consumers across the country. The Oak Street transaction is financially attractive and enhances our ability to accelerate our sustainable long-term growth. Shawn will provide more details on the financials of the transaction and will discuss the growth and profitability prospects of the Oak Street assets. At the close of the transaction, Mike Pykosz will continue to lead Oak Street within CVS Health. Mike, we are so excited to welcome you and your team to CVS Health at the close of this transaction. Mike, would you like to say a few words? Mike Pykosz : Thank you, Karen and good morning everyone. Our mission at Oak Street Health is to rebuild healthcare as it should be. When we started Oak Street, we set out to address the root causes of high-cost, low-quality care and poor experiences for Medicare patients. 10 years in that journey, as we continue to drive our national expansion and look to impact more patients and communities, we could not have found a partner more aligned to our mission than CVS Health. At Oak Street Health, we operated a network of primary care centers to specialize in care for older adults. We focus on areas with large concentrations with Medicare-eligible patients with incomes below 300% of the federal poverty line, areas where we can make the biggest impact. We create our innovative models from the ground up and focus on ensuring our patients receive the right care upfront, improving their experiences and keeping them healthy and out of the hospital. This proven and naturally scalable model benefit patients, providers, and payers, while improving health outcomes, lowering medical costs and delivering a better patient experience. This focus has generated meaningful results for our patients, including reducing hospital admissions by over 50% and lowering 30-day readmissions by 42%. By providing coordinated holistic care, we can close care gaps and address social terms of health, delivering 5-star performance. Our track record shows that we have been able to deliver consistent performance across different populations and geographies. And while our primary focus is Medicare managed at-risk patients, we have also demonstrated our care model can work outside of Med. For example, in 2021, we participated in the Medicare direct contracting program, where we took on full risk on traditional Medicare patients. Among all the participants in the program, we generated savings that were 2x higher than any other multistage direct contract candidate and we were ranked number one in [indiscernible]. These results show that even amongst the most innovative groups of this new program, our capabilities and results stood out. By joining CVS Health\u2019s ecosystem, we will accelerate our journey to improve patient outcomes and experiences while continuing to invest in both our innovative care model and invest in what we believe is the best team in healthcare. The expansive consumer touch points of CVS Health virtually and in the community, including the trusted CVS pharmacists, will broaden and deepen our connections with the patients under our care. At Oak Street, we have talked about the massive market opportunity for companies that can address the huge challenges in healthcare. CVS Health is in a unique position to deliver market-leading health solutions. The breadth of their offerings and proven ability to scale assets will significantly enhance our ability to tackle these challenges. We believe this transaction is a great outcome for all of our stakeholders, including our patients, all of our payer partners, our team of Oakees and our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Karen. Karen Lynch : Thank you, Mike. CVS Health delivered strong financial results in 2022 and we are entering 2023 with tremendous momentum. We continue to make progress on our strategy and will enhance the capabilities of our value-based care platform through the Oak Street Health and Signify Health acquisition. We are excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I will now turn it over to Shawn for a deeper look into our results, our 2023 outlook and the Oak Street transaction. Shawn? Shawn Guertin : Thank you, Karen and good morning everyone. I will first take some time to detail our results and 2023 guidance before discussing this morning\u2019s announcement of the Oak Street transaction. Our fourth quarter results reflect the continuation of our excellent performance from each of our core business segments as we exceeded our expectations for revenue, cash flow generation and adjusted earnings per share. A few highlights regarding total company performance. Total fourth quarter revenues of $83.8 billion increased by 9.5% year-over-year, reflecting growth at or above internal expectations for each of our foundational businesses. We reported fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $4 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.99. For full year 2022, we reported total revenue of $322.5 billion, an increase of 10.4%, with solid growth across each of our foundational businesses. This led to a full year adjusted EPS of $8.69, representing an increase of 9.7% off our 2021 adjusted EPS baseline of $7.92. And importantly, CVS Health\u2019s ability to generate cash remains strong. For full year 2022, we generated $16.2 billion in cash flow from operations. Looking at performance by business segment, Health Care Benefits delivered strong revenue and adjusted operating income growth versus the prior year. Fourth quarter revenue of $23 billion increased by 11.3% year-over-year. We grew membership by 548,000 lives in 2022, driven by strong growth in our commercial and Medicare businesses, offsetting the divestiture of a portion of our Aetna International business earlier this year and a decline in Medicaid membership due to a previously disclosed contract loss. Our medical benefit ratio of 86% improved 100 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating income of $858 million grew 68.2% year-over-year. Both of these measures were driven by the net favorable impact of COVID-19 compared to the prior year and strong underlying performance, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the flu. Outside of an elevated flu season, medical costs remain in line with expectations as has been the case throughout 2022. Consolidated days claims payable at the end of the quarter was 52.5, up 3.4 days versus the prior year. Overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. In the Pharmacy Services business, our ability to deliver industry leading drug trend for our clients, our specialty management capabilities and excellent customer service levels continue to drive growth. During the fourth quarter, revenue of $43.7 billion increased by 11.2% year-over-year, driven by increased pharmacy claims volume, growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation, partially offset by continued client price improvements. Total pharmacy claims processed increased by 3.1% above the prior year and 4.6% when excluding COVID-19 vaccinations, primarily attributable to net new business, increased utilization and the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season. Adjusted operating income of $2 billion grew 9% year-over-year driven by improved purchasing economics, including increased contributions from the products and services of the company\u2019s group purchasing organization, partially offset by continued client price improvements. In our Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we delivered strong revenue growth despite mixed COVID-related trends and continued economic uncertainty. Specifically, during the fourth quarter, revenue of $28.2 billion grew 4%, reflecting increased prescription and front store volume, including the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season, pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation. These items were partially offset by decreased COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, the impact of recent generic introductions and continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure. Adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion declined 25.1% versus prior year, but was largely in line with internal expectations, driven by decreased COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and increased investments in the segment\u2019s operations and capabilities, including the vast majority of a discretionary bonus payment to frontline colleagues. These decreases were partially offset by increased prescription volume and improved generic drug purchasing. Pharmacy prescription volume grew 0.8% year-over-year, reflecting increased utilization and the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season, partially offset by decreases in COVID-19 vaccinations. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, pharmacy prescription volume increased by 4% year-over-year.  Turning to the balance sheet. Our liquidity and capital position remained excellent. We ended the year with approximately $5.4 billion of cash at the parent or unrestricted subsidiaries and an adjusted net debt to EBITDA of about 2.9x. Excluding the adjustment for cash at the parent or unrestricted subsidiaries, our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA is approximately 3.1x. Through our quarterly dividend, we returned $719 million to shareholders and repurchased $1.5 billion of our common stock in the fourth quarter. We also entered into a $2 billion fixed-dollar accelerated share repurchase transaction, which became effective on January 3, 2023. A few other items worth highlighting for investors. We continue to experience the impact of market volatility on our investment portfolio and recorded net realized capital losses of approximately $37 million in the quarter. We recorded $117 million of office real estate optimization charges in the quarter related to the reduction of corporate office real estate space in response to our new flexible work arrangement. We also recognized a $250 million gain related to the sale of our bswift business in November. And we recorded $99 million of incremental charges related to opioid litigation to address the final terms and other implications of the global settlement executed in December. Shifting to our outlook for 2023. We expect revenue growth of 3% to 5%, and we are reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $8.70 to $8.90. We believe this range is prudent at this stage in the year and reflects approximately 5% to 8% growth versus our 2022 adjusted EPS baseline of $8.25. We detailed the adjustments reflected in our 2022 baseline in the earnings materials posted on our IR website. I want to point out three things on our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance. First, consistent with past practice, our projections do not assume the recurrence of prior year reserve development. Second, these projections do not include a specific provision for our pending Signify transaction, which is expected to close in the second quarter of this year, but which we project will have a small impact on 2023 adjusted EPS. And third, I want to remind everyone that beginning this year, we are shifting to our reporting convention that excludes net realized capital gains and losses from adjusted operating income. Now let\u2019s turn to some of the segment details. In our Health Care Benefits segment, we expect to see membership growth of 2% to 4% with increased membership in both Medicare and Commercial, partially offset by declines in Medicaid due to the impact of redeterminations in 2023. Overall, we expect to generate revenue growth of 11% to 13%. Our projected medical benefit ratio for 2023 is 84.7%, plus or minus 50 basis points. As I just noted, we do not assume prior year reserve development in our projections. We are providing a cautious outlook for HCB adjusted operating income, expecting growth in a range of about 2% to 4% and reflecting a prudent assumption regarding the performance of our individual exchange business, lower individual MA enrollment and investments in our Stars Improvement initiatives. Moving to our Pharmacy Services segment. We expect revenue in a range from 1% to 2% growth, driven by a successful 2023 selling season and strong retention, partially offset by lower Medicaid volume. For the full year 2023, we expect pharmacy claims to range from flat to growth of 1%. Overall, we expect these results to generate adjusted operating income growth of 4% to 5%. Finally, shifting to our Retail/LTC segment. As we discussed previously, this segment will be burdened by the lower contribution from COVID as we transition into the endemic stage as well as continued reimbursement pressure in the pharmacy. We expect revenue growth of 1% to 3% and prescription growth of 2% to 4% despite continuing decreases of COVID-19 vaccines. Overall, for the Retail/LTC segment, we expect 2023 adjusted operating income to decline from 2022 to between $5.95 billion and $6.05 billion. For items below adjusted operating income, we expect our interest expense for 2023 to be approximately $2.23 billion. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 25.5%. I want to make a few comments as you think about the cadence of our earnings throughout the year as Retail returns to earnings seasonality more aligned to pre-pandemic patterns. We are currently projecting the lowest contribution to earnings in the first quarter of the year. The remaining three quarters will be relatively consistent with slightly more than half of our earnings coming in the second half of the year. Shifting to shares. We expect our diluted weighted average share count to be approximately $1.298 billion, reflecting the impact of both our fourth quarter 2022 repurchase activity as well as the accelerated share repurchase that is currently underway. We anticipate another strong year of cash generation. We expect cash flow from operations of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Turning to the Oak Street transaction. We committed to investors that we would be diligent when deploying our capital, seeking assets with the best technology, capabilities and cultural alignment to our vision. After a thorough and robust review of the market, Oak Street was the primary care asset that proved to be the most strategically and financially compelling. Oak Street will operate as a payer-agnostic business within CVS Health, focused on improving outcomes and experiences for the Medicare population it serves. CVS Health has a strong and proven track record of helping its payer clients succeed, and we will continue to prioritize that success after this transaction. What we saw when we looked into Oak Street\u2019s portfolio of clinics was a remarkably consistent path to clinic profitability. This trend was true across diverse geographies, populations and payers. As Oak Street drives strong patient experiences and engagement, their patient panels grow. And as Oak Street\u2019s providers engage with those patients, they improve outcomes and increase patient contributions over time. These two factors combine to drive clinics to maturity, achieving profitability within the first 3 years and unlocking annual adjusted EBITDA potential of approximately $7 million per clinic using Oak Street\u2019s definition of adjusted EBITDA. Within the 169 clinics Oak Street has today, we have high visibility into embedded adjusted EBITDA of over $1 billion. We also recognize the tremendous opportunity to scale Oak Street\u2019s clinics to reach more seniors across the nation. At their current rate of expansion, we expect Oak Street to have over 300 clinics by 2026, at which point we project they will have more than $2 billion of embedded Oak Street adjusted EBITDA. Shifting to synergies. We envisioned five main opportunities to realize more than $500 million of value over time : one, accelerating Oak Street patient growth through CVS Health channels; two, improving Oak Street\u2019s economics through integration with our broad portfolio of assets; three, improving the retention of our Aetna MA members through the improved outcomes and experience provided at Oak Street clinics; four, driving greater utilization of CVS Pharmacy and Caremark capabilities; and five, capturing modest savings from external public company and lease costs. We project that our investment in Oak Street will drive double-digit returns on invested capital over time as clinics mature and synergies are realized. We are committed to exploring additional avenues to further accelerate growth, synergy realization and returns from this transaction while balancing further near-term dilution to our EPS trajectory. As stated in our press release, this transaction will be funded with available resources and existing financing capacity, and we remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade rating. The transaction is subject to approval by Oak Street\u2019s shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We expect this transaction to close in 2023. We are now targeting 2024 adjusted EPS of approximately $9, growing to approximately $10 in 2025 with the potential for upside in 2025 based on the successful resolution of our Medicare Star Ratings mitigation efforts. The 2024 and 2025 adjusted EPS trajectories reflect the impact of the previously disclosed 2024 Medicare Star Ratings headwinds in Centene contract loss, closing of the Oak Street Health transaction in 2023 as well as projected contributions from the Signify Health transaction in 2024 and beyond. Consistent with past practice, CVS Health expects to exclude integration and transaction costs from its adjusted EPS presentation. With the close of these transactions, we expect that our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA will peak in the mid-3x level in 2024, well within leverage ranges aligned to our current investment grade rating. Our current projections assume modest discretionary repurchase activity in 2024. This is consistent with our 2021 Investor Day projections, which contemplated 1% to 2% adjusted EPS growth from repurchases in addition to offsetting dilution. As leverage begins to subside in 2025, we will have potential for additional repurchases.  In summary, we are excited to announce the acquisition of Oak Street and to incorporate them into our expanding portfolio of capabilities. Oak Street\u2019s best-in-class clinics will serve as the focal point of high-quality care for seniors across America. The strategic rationale for this combination is sound and the growth opportunity is vast. Together, CVS Health\u2019s foundational businesses signifies home assessment and provider enablement capabilities and Oak Street\u2019s clinics and care model create the premier multi-payer Medicare value-based care platform. We could not be more pleased to join with Oak Street as we take the next step in our journey to build a differentiated health services organization and transform how care is delivered. To conclude, we delivered excellent performance in 2022, creating strong momentum as we continue to execute our strategy in 2023. We are building on our achievements, expanding our portfolio of capabilities and continuing on our path to become the leading health care solution company. With that, we will now open the line for your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much and congratulations on the transaction, and congratulations on the strategy overall. I know every quarter I\u2019ve asked about this strategy around value-based care and what you\u2019re going to do in this area. So I\u2019m happy that you finally have done this. So really just two things I want to better understand. One, following Oak Street, they did slow the growth of the number of centers they were opening last year due to cash constraints. Shawn, it sounds like you\u2019re laying out that you\u2019re going to keep that strategy the same at roughly 35 centers per year. One, is there a reason why you wouldn\u2019t reaccelerate that growth when we think about Oak Street? And then secondly, as we think about some of the changes that have come with RADV, the MA rates that have come out, can you maybe just talk about the impact, not just on the MA side but also on the provider side? And did you take that into account when you were thinking about buying a primary care asset? Karen Lynch : Lisa, I\u2019ll turn it to Shawn in a second, but I just wanted to acknowledge your point about we did lay out a variable vision at December 2021 to really expand into health services. And I really believe this transaction is a clear win for both patients and provides, and as we said in our prepared remarks this really does create the premier multi-payer Medicare value-based platform and I talked lot about value-based care and not just being a contract but being platform where we really drive engagement and connect patients to care. And this transaction, combined with Signify Health, really does demonstrate that we are executing on our long-term strategy to drive long-term growth for the company. Let me turn it over to Shawn to answer your specific questions. Shawn Guertin : Hi, Lisa. So on the first one about kind of clinic expansion. To be clear, the numbers we cited today in our model are premised on maintaining a trajectory of 35 to 40 clinics a year expansion. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, one of the things that we will be doing over the coming months is exploring alternative avenues of accelerating synergy realization but potentially looking at the growth aspect of that, and in particular, avenues that would help us manage sort of greater clinic growth but also sort of manage kind of inside the dilution framework that we\u2019ve talked about with this transaction. And we will be looking at those avenues because it\u2019s a very important point because when you look at the long-term returns of this model, that accelerated growth has some real long-term kind of return benefits to doing that. So again, that will be something that we continue to work on and explore the best way to do that within the framework that we\u2019ve discussed with you today. On your second question, it was important to us to both understand the positioning on RADV and at least be able to see the MA advance rate notice for \u201824 and frankly, work in conjunction with Oak on what we thought that meant to them. And we\u2019ve had the ability to do that, and obviously, as you all know, much of that still leaves many questions to be answered in the future. It does provide a little bit more clarity than we had in the past. But I think we do understand the dynamics and some of the mitigation efforts that we could put in place if certain things stand or certain things get modified. In many ways, though, what I would say is what we saw come out of those notices, I think, is exactly why you want high-quality Medicare Advantage value-based care assets. In its most \u2013 simplest sense, when you have a year, for example, when reimbursements get squeezed, what\u2019s one of the things you want to do, you want to look at your cost control levers. And certainly, Oak is a demonstrable asset that has proven to improve outcomes and reduce costs. And so I think as we think about navigating the future of Medicare Advantage and maybe even a broader opportunity in Medicare value-based care in the fee-for-service population, I think both Signify and Oak are exactly the kind of assets that you would like to have at your side as you do that. Karen Lynch : And Lisa, just adding to that point, I think we all recognize the importance of Medicare Advantage and the popularity, and we are very encouraged by the political statements that were made last night to support Medicare. And this fits really nicely into that picture as well. Lisa Gill : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Cherny : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on the deal. I\u2019m sure there are going to be a number of other questions there, so I want to hone in on Health Care Benefits and particularly the work you\u2019re doing around Stars. I know last month, Karen, you outlined the waiver and the requirements to push forward on the \u201824 mitigation plans. Can you just give us a sense of where you stand on the various different work streams tied to achieving the \u201825 mitigation and the planned throughput you have in order to get there and reestablish your Stars presence? Karen Lynch : Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. And you\u2019re right. We did make progress on our regulatory approvals to move our contracts forward. And we are continuing to make investments in Stars so that we can mitigate the risk. As you might remember, we narrowly missed in our CAPS scores, and the team has been working very diligently over the course of the last couple of months to make sure that we are improving our results. I\u2019m going to ask Dan to talk about the specifics Daniel Finke : Yes. Thanks, Karen. So in 2022, we really took a look at the opportunity around CAPS and member experience, and we launched some additional campaigns related to that, that frankly are still ongoing, things like assisting our members to understand their benefits, expanding our concierge services to really maximize the member experience overall. We also have the opportunity to impact other domains as well, our patient safety domain that worked really hard with our retail colleagues on in the fourth quarter related to patient medication adherence. And then, of course, on the HEDIS front, closing as many gaps and care as possible in the fourth quarter and now currently focused on really optimizing our record collection during the hybrid season. So we\u2019re committed to improve our Stars ratings. We believe we are the right actions and the right team to really improve the ratings overall. Michael Cherny : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Congratulations on the transaction as well. I wondered, since we had Mike on the call, the \u2013 obviously, this has played out a little bit in the public domain. So there is been speculation that someone might be up with Oak Street for a while. I wonder if he could comment on what kind of feedback he\u2019s gotten from his doctors, how do they \u2013 how are they reacting to this. And I wonder, do they have to approve in any way this transaction? Is there anything in their agreements that require approval? And then lots of questions around the deal, but I might just ask, Shawn, Karen, you\u2019re thinking you\u2019re going to close this at the end of the year and/or sometime this year. I know the regulatory process is a little less certain than it was a few years ago, I guess, the way to describe it. If it were to slip into some point in \u201824, would you \u2013 would that materially change your $9 and $10 target? Or are you \u2013 does that have some flexibility around the timing of the deal? Karen Lynch : Hi, A.J., we do \u2013 we\u2019re \u2013 we do expect to have this transaction close, I\u2019ll let Shawn comment on the financials, but I don\u2019t think that we have material changes in those numbers. I am going to turn it over to Mike. Mike, can you just respond to A.J.\u2019s question around the clinicians? Mike Pykosz : Yes, happy to. So, on the second point, no, we don\u2019t require any separate approvals. We just need more of the standard shareholder approvals. On the first question you are asking, I think is the most important one. At Oak Street Health, our mission is to rebuild healthcare as it should be. And I think the physicians I have talked to and opinion leaders and team members across Oak Street that I have talked to so far. I think there is a huge amount of excitement that this is kind of the next stage of our journey. And we are really proud of what we have built over the first 10 years of Oak Street. But we really believe there is an order of magnitude of more growth out there for us. We can go to more communities and impact more older adults. And I think that CVS Health brings just a huge amount of resources that we can partner with and leverage to help us provide higher quality care for patients, to help us provide a better patient experience and to help continue to make Oak Street the best place to work in healthcare. So, I think from our physicians and the rest of our team members\u2019 perspective, I think this is a huge positive to continue to help us execute on our mission. Shawn Guertin : And A.J., I am not sure if you had a question about more global kind of deal returns, but specifically to your question about the timing of close, the answer is no, it would not change those. And arguably, it actually adds a little bit of lift because, if you remember, there is an operating loss that\u2019s going on for a little bit of time and you are picking that up a little bit deeper into the cycle of moving from kind of loss to breakeven to gain. So, it actually would not kind of change the $9 to $10 at all, certainly not in a negative way. A.J. Rice: Okay. Great. That\u2019s clear. Thanks Shawn. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to shift back to health benefits for a minute. I wanted to ask you to walk us through your expectations on membership growth across the businesses in detail. So, where do you expect to grow in MA, shrinking tape, commercial and the exchanges. And then your MLR looks like it\u2019s up about 100 basis points year-over-year, maybe a little less. Just hopeful you could frame how much of that comes from the PYD roll off that you are not assuming and what other drivers might be impacting that? Appreciate it. Karen Lynch : Hi Justin, it\u2019s Karen. Let me just comment on the growth. So, first of all, in our commercial book, we do expect to grow in our commercial book. And our value proposition is truly resonating in the marketplace. We announced last month that we closed the state of North Carolina, which will bring us about 570,000 members on 1/1/25. So, I think that\u2019s a good demonstration of the strong value proposition that we have in our commercial business. I mentioned our significant growth in individual exchanges, 900,000 to 1 million members next year. And then in Medicare, as you know, Justin, we are disappointed in our individual Medicare Advantage growth, but we are growing our D-SNP business and our group MA business. So, I will let Dan specifically give you a little bit more details on growth, but I am going to turn it to Shawn to answer your MBR question. Shawn Guertin : Yes. So, Justin, the MBR, I think the guidance midpoint is up about 70 basis points year-over-year. There is a number of pieces that are leading to that. The first, to the point of your question, is the removal of prior year favorable reserves development is about 20 basis points there. Second, the provision we are making for the exchange business and the provision for any adverse deviation there is also worth about 20 basis points. About 10 basis points is driven by Medicaid redeterminations and what we think the MBR impact will be there. The divestiture of our international business in 2022, that was lower MBR, so that\u2019s adding about 10%. So, it\u2019s three or four items that are building that up. I would say more broadly behind this that when you looked at the fourth quarter and you looked behind the impacts of flu and respiratory illness, utilization continued to perform very consistent with what we expected to see. And we still feel the pricing environment is very sound and rational going into 2023. Daniel Finke : Yes. And Karen, I would just add two comments to your remarks. I mean first on the Medicare front, a couple of bright spots during AEP, where our growth in the duals population as well as our group MA products, and so we expect continued growth in those products through the remainder of the year. And clearly, the team is also focused on our individual MA enrollment as it relates to OEP and our lock-in period. Some of the investments we made at the end of AEP showed some signs of growth that we are looking forward, let\u2019s say for the remainder of the year. And then the last comment would just be on Medicaid. We do expect some modest growth in that book of business through the first quarter. But as anticipated, at the end of the first quarter, we do expect some of the re-determined members to fall off the roster. And so we are working closely with the states around our opportunities to regain that membership. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Eric Percher : Thank you. Eric Percher and Josh Raskin here at Nephron. A question with respect to the approach to M&A, how important was geographic diversification in your process or as you are examining assets and making this decision? And then conversely, how important was how much you need the model that Oak Street has built? And maybe lastly, how do you think about how this and Signify come together with respect to physician enablement? Shawn Guertin : I can have Karen talk about that as well at the end, but what I would say is, as we talked about our factors here, Eric. We have conducted a very thorough evaluation over the last 15 months and are confident this is the best asset in the space that really satisfied all of our criteria talented and capable leadership, a leading integrated technology platform, a clear ability, to the point of your question, to scale and reproduce the model and the results across both geography and for different payers. It also has, as Mike mentioned, the demonstrable capability to improve clinical outcomes and lower costs and I think a very clear path around the unit economics required for profitability. I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t also mention that it has a fundamentally differentiated patient experience as evidenced by their 90 NPS and their exclusive AARP endorsement. So, this asset, really, we have talked about the list of criteria, we really hit it. And I think to your point, the geography was important. We are a big company. We are going to need a big footprint over time, and being in 21 states was important in and of itself. But it\u2019s actually, in my mind, the scalability element was the ability to demonstrate the model worked in different geographies. And to the point of your second question about having, I will call it, the homogeneity of the model, it was the ability to reproduce it and then make changes to it. I think that was very, very important, and frankly, very distinct and what we looked at in the market. I think the second part of your question, I think, is important, too, because there is a lot of interplay potentially down the road between these two assets. One of, I think the benefits that we have, and I think we have built in a modest synergy when we talk about the ability to accelerate growth, is the ability of Signify when they are doing a home visit to recognize that here is a member that needs to be returned or connected to care. And that doesn\u2019t have to be obviously through Oak, but it can be and can be our MinuteClinics as well. So, the interconnectivity of actually getting these members the care they need, when they need it and where they need it, and to Mike\u2019s point, the way it should be provided, I think these two things over time, we will be able to work powerfully together. Karen Lynch : Yes. And Eric, just to add to that, I think it\u2019s really important to think about community and community-based care as we have talked a lot strategically being in the community and really having kind of all these assets work together. Shawn made a good example of Signify and Oak, but then you think about our MinuteClinics, and we can kind of leverage those MinuteClinics for additional capacity. We can leverage our nurse practitioners as well and then we can have wraparound services. So, we can have a very much of a holistic approach to care in the community. I would also add that it is really critically important for us to be a multi-payer agnostic provider and make sure that we are connecting care for all the patients that we are interacting within the community. Eric Percher : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Stephen Baxter : Hi. Thanks. I appreciate all the color on the Oak Street acquisition. I was hoping you could help us think a little bit about the timing you would expect to be required to realize both the greater than $2 billion of earnings power itself and also the $500 million of synergies and also maybe any insight into where both those figures might be on a reported basis over the next couple of years, would be great? Thank you. Shawn Guertin : Yes. So, let me talk kind of about this in sort of a financial terms and try to get at some of those points. As I mentioned, right, this is a \u2013 we do think this is a deal that has an attractive long-term return on capital. And \u2013 but it also has the potential to move the needle from an earnings perspective in a company of this size and scale. Our strategy has been and will continue to be to deploy capital to improve the sustainable earnings growth rate of this company as a whole. When you look at this asset in concert with Signify, we project this could improve our overall long-term earnings company growth rate by at least 100 basis points a year as these investments mature. It\u2019s important as you think about this, that the dilution, especially the dilution from financing, is temporal in short-term, but these sustainable improvements in growth rate are not. From a return on capital standpoint, we think it earns double-digit returns on capital in year seven. And very importantly, because of the embedded value in that clinic infrastructure, that return on capital continues to grow on the order of 200 basis points a year thereafter. And I have mentioned in my remarks that at the current rate of expansion, we would expect to have 300 clinics by \u2013 in 2026 or by the end of 2026. And using the Oak Street convention around adjusted EBITDA at $7 million per clinic, we think the embedded EBITDA could cross the $2 billion threshold in the 2026 year. So, that\u2019s an important sort of data point. But I think it\u2019s important to recognize that the way that embedded EBITDA really manifests itself can be in these ongoing returns on capital. I would comment that while the return profile might be longer than other deals you have seen in the past, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s atypical of deals that meaningfully improve your strategic positioning as a company. And I do think it\u2019s important \u2013 in fact, I think being overly slavish to deals that only satisfy short-term returns are exactly what can lead to long-term growth problems. And I think we are \u2013 this is something that has a lot of long-term growth earnings power. And finally, you had asked about the synergies and some of the kind of accretion dilution. The synergies are powerful here, and I think it\u2019s one of the things that we are uniquely positioned to deliver on. I have often \u2013 when I have talked to all of these companies, they have often said to me like, if I say what do you need to grow faster, and they say members and capital. Well, that\u2019s something we can bring to bear here. But most of the synergies, probably about 70% of what we talked about, are tied up really in that accelerated growth and the improved retention of MA members. And so when you think about the model here, the J-curve, if you will, this is about moving them along that curve faster. And in that trajectory, that generally gets closer to breakeven and positive in that year two to year three timeframe. So, that it\u2019s after that, that a lot of these synergies mature. The way we see that playing out is, I think this would be roughly EPS-neutral probably in like year four of our ownership, thereabouts, and begin to be accretive on an EPS line for year five. But make no mistake, it is improving each year, which is going to help our growth rate between then and now. And you are building substantial embedded long-term value in that footprint. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Ann Hynes : Hi. Good morning. Maybe we can shift to retail, our guidance for OP of $5.95 billion to $6 billion. Can you just let us know how much endemic COVID you have in that guidance? And for 2024 and 2025 expectations, are you assuming that stays flat, or is there any growth in that base business? Shawn Guertin : No. So, Ann, for 2023, we have about $500 million to $600 million of what I will call the endemic COVID contribution from the three categories we have been talking about vaccines, diagnostic testing and over-the-counter testing. It\u2019s important to recognize that, that is significantly down from the contribution that we experienced in 2022, nearly $1 billion down from that. So, we are targeting producing the $6 billion again despite kind of that headwind. In our forecasting, the general \u2013 I would tell you the general targeting as we continue to expect retail to be able to maintain flat. And it\u2019s \u2013 we have a declining COVID contribution, and our thinking behind that, that obviously, there is other initiatives. And I am going to let Michelle and Prem maybe talk about some of the other things that are going on in both the front of the store and the back of the store that are helping the business broadly, but also helping us sort of manage through the decline in COVID contribution. Michelle Peluso : Hi Ann, it\u2019s Michelle. So, while it\u2019s easy to see we had a really strong financial year and gaining share in both front store and pharmacy, there is a lot of underlying trends that I think are driving the momentum even if COVID slows. So, if you think about 2022, we grew consumers, we experienced stronger household penetration, and we actually grew service levels and Net Promoter Scores to historically high levels. And so the foundation and momentum has been strong in the front door. This is coming about because of things like our investments in omnichannel, modernizing our store fleet, improving our merch mix, improving service and even our pricing and promotional strategy. So, this is a kind of underlying momentum and foundation that we think will help us continue our growth trajectory. But at the same time, we absolutely recognize there is also opportunity to invest in cost structure and productivity improvements. So, we are investing in supply chain, for instance, to optimize, modernize and selectively automate. We believe that will bear a significant return. We are also finding lots of other opportunities to improve inventory turns and reduce overall product loss. So, it\u2019s this combination of growth on site productivity improvements that we think will continue to fuel our performance not just in 2023, but beyond. So, let me turn it over to Prem. Prem Shah : Yes. Just a couple of other points. Our Q4 market share in pharmacy is now approximately 27%. We grew share another 12 basis points, and we are about 117 basis points higher than the pre-pandemic share. And then secondly, I would say there is two areas we are really focused. One is on our digital approach and our pharmacies and how we continue to be the most convenient retail destinations for our patients and consumers and really connecting that with our digital strategies. And the second is really around our clinical programs. We are seeing continued strong adoption of those clinical programs that drive further adherence and retention for our patients. And we are starting to see new therapies also rise. So, continued strong momentum in retail from a pharmacy perspective, we continue to have extremely strong service levels in our business as well to drive the business forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Nathan Rich : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Oak Street\u2019s cohort data paints a pretty compelling path just in terms of the embedded EBITDA that is in the centers. I guess what do you see as the key variables to kind of achieving that kind of J-curve that they have laid out? And you have talked about some of this, but what can CVS do to potentially accelerate that? And then just as a quick follow-up, Shawn, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more \u2013 in more detail about capital deployment plans in \u201824 and \u201825. I think you said some modest level of share repurchases in \u201824 and more in \u201825. Can you also talk about maybe what you see as sort of deleveraging our debt pay-down across those years as well? Thank you. Shawn Guertin : Yes. So, as you mentioned, I think and I can certainly \u2013 I think Mike can comment as well, right. Really, the variable, and it\u2019s remarkably consistent, right, over time is the ability to drive membership growth sort of along, to your point, along that sort of J-curve of cohort financials. And today, I think Oak has done a great job being successful as that and what this deal really opens up, is a lot of new potential pools for members. And I think that will take a lot of different forms, right. There are certainly \u2013 well, it\u2019s very much going to be a multi-payer asset. There is obviously things we can do for plan design offerings to highlight the Oak network or the Oak clinics. We can do that with the Aetna members. I mentioned Signify before as a potential sort of source of members. But when you just think about the vast array of members that we interact with and the vast array of seniors that we interact with every year across this company, this is a much wider catch basin, if you will, for potential growth. I also think we can strengthen the value of the offering with our other fulfillment assets around pharmacy and MinuteClinics. And frankly, I think that will make that offering not only more attractive than the most, but all of the payers who contract with Oak, they will all benefit from what we bring to bear with our retail health strategy and our pharmacy strategy. And I think that is sort of \u2013 that is an opportunity there. On capital deployment, I think as I mentioned, what we expect for this to play out is that over the next couple of years, we will likely be in the mid-3s from a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, and that\u2019s obviously a range is consistent with our current investment-grade ratings, and that is important to us to maintain that rating profile. Having said that, I still think we have an ample amount of financial flexibility over the next 2 years to 3 years after this transaction. We would \u2013 our current projections are \u2013 or let me step back, as you mentioned, we have a modest amount of share repurchase in the \u201824, \u201825. Think about that as maybe one point or two points above dilution. That\u2019s very consistent with what we told you on Investor Day. So, when we think about the flexibility we have, I would say that we would have probably between $4 billion and $8 billion of flexibility over the \u201823, \u201824 window and then that grows more to like the $10 billion to $15 billion of flexibility in the \u201824, \u201825 window. Timing, obviously still to be determined. But I think that gives us ample flexibility because this is the capital that we could continue to use to return value to shareholders via the dividend, obviously, incremental share repurchases, deleveraging, to your point, or it could be used for other corporate purposes. Karen Lynch : So, before we conclude, I want to take this opportunity to thank our CVS Health colleagues for their extraordinary work, bringing our vision to life, improving the health of our customers and delivering on our financial objectives. As you heard today, CVS Health delivered strong results, and we are advancing our strategic initiatives. We entered 2023 with great momentum, and we are well positioned for growth in our foundational businesses, and we are making continued progress against our strategy. We are so excited about the opportunities ahead of us, including both the Signify and Oak Street Health acquisitions, and we look forward to keeping you updated throughout the year. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s CVS Health fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Karen. Karen? Karen Lynch : Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining our call today. This morning we reported strong first quarter results that demonstrate excellent performance across CVS Health. We successfully closed the acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health and are updating our projections to include the financial impact of both transactions. We are revising our full year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance through a range of $8.50 to $8.70, reflecting the positive contribution of our strong underlying results and the impact of the Signify Health transaction, which enable us to partially offset the dilution from the early close of Oak Street and the financing costs for both transactions. Sean will discuss the details of our updated outlook for the year shortly.  We are purposely executing on our strategy as we continue to expand our health platform of capabilities to serve a broader customer and consumer base. We are addressing the total cost of care, improving health, and expanding access to affordable quality care. Today we are announcing changes to our operating model and financial reporting that more accurately reflect how our businesses are managed. These changes allow us to be more nimble in our execution and more innovative when expanding our products and services. We are excited about accelerating our momentum by unlocking long-term value across our businesses and the broader healthcare marketplace.  Beginning this quarter, we will report our results as follows; first, our new Health Services segment unifies most of the former operations of our Pharmacy Services segment as well as our healthcare delivery operations, including primary care, retail health clinics, home based care services, and provider enablement capabilities. This structure will simplify access to our multi-payer capabilities, better align the way we serve clients, and create superior health experiences for consumers. Together, these businesses are positioned to more effectively address the total cost of care, implement new care models, and deliver connected solutions that build sustainable health communities. These combined businesses serve more than 110 million people, have more than 20,000 colleagues, and in 2022 reported combined revenues of nearly $170 billion. We also created a new pharmacy and consumer wellness segment that integrates all of our omni-channel pharmacy capabilities, traditional retail pharmacy, specialty and mail order pharmacy fulfillment and infusion services along with our front store offerings. We are making the pharmacy experience as easy for consumers as possible while ensuring that we are creating better outcomes, lowering costs, and increasing convenience. These combined businesses serve more than 120 million people, deliver more than 1.6 billion scripts annually, have more than 220,000 colleagues, and in 2022 reported combined revenues of nearly $109 billion.  The Health Care Benefits segment remains largely unchanged and will continue to offer a full range of insured and self-insured medical, pharmacy, dental, and behavioral health products and services. This business serves more than 25 million medical members, has more than 40,000 colleagues, and in 2022 reported revenues of more than $91 billion.  Turning to our performance in the quarter, we grew total revenue to more than $85 billion, an increase of 11% versus the prior year and delivered adjusted operating income of $4.4 billion. Adjusted EPS was $2.20. We had another quarter of robust cash flow from operations generating $7.4 billion. Each of our businesses delivered strong performance in the quarter. Starting with the healthcare benefits segment, we grew revenues to nearly $26 billion, an increase of more than 12% and delivered adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion. Overall medical costs were well controlled and in line with expectations. Membership in the first quarter increased by 1 million members versus the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by the significant increase in our individual exchange business. Our Medicare business remains one of our strongest growth segments. We recently announced that the City of New York awarded us its group Medicare Advantage plan contract that begins in September 2023. The city of New York is one of the largest client wins in Aetna's history. We look forward to providing access to high quality, affordable, and convenient healthcare to the city's more than 200,000 retirees and their eligible dependents. We now expect approximately 12% membership growth in our Medicare Advantage business for the full year 2023 and are diligently working to improve our competitive position in individual MA to return to market growth in 2024. The recent award of two additional Marquee Group Medicare Advantage contracts serving approximately 45,000 retirees and their eligible dependents will supplement that growth beginning in January of 2024.  Turning to our commercial business, we ended the quarter with approximately 18 million members, a nearly 6% increase sequentially. In addition to the significant growth in our individual exchange members, this increase was also driven by growth in key accounts, public and labor, and small group memberships. These results reflect our strong value proposition, innovative solutions, and service excellence. In our Medicaid business, we increase membership in the quarter but expect declines for the rest of the year on the expiration of the public health emergency. As Medicaid members face potential disruptions in their health benefits, we are using the full breadth of our portfolio of assets to help them avoid coverage losses and maintain positive health outcomes.  In our Health Services segment, revenues grew to nearly $45 billion, an increase of more than 12%. Adjusted operating income increased more than 14% to $1.7 billion. Our total pharmacy claims process in the quarter grew 3.7% versus the prior year and 4.8% excluding COVID vaccinations. We continue to deliver strong results in our specialty business with revenue growth of more than 10%.  Our Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness segment delivered a strong quarter, successfully navigating challenging market conditions and normalizing COVID trends. Revenue grew to approximately $28 billion, an increase of nearly 8% versus the prior year. We generated $1.1 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, a decrease of approximately 28% from the prior year, largely due to lower COVID related contributions.  Performance was strong in both the pharmacy and the front store. Pharmacy revenue increased by 10% versus the prior year, driven by product mix and prescription growth of 2.5%. Our growth in the retail pharmacy is notable and has resulted in significant market share gains over time. This is a testament to the value we provide our pharmacy patients and the investments we have made to improve their experiences. Front store revenues grew by 5% or nearly 8% on the same store basis, driven by the strength across a variety of categories including beauty and personal care as well as consumer health products. We continue to successfully execute on our retail footprint optimization strategy, closing more than 100 locations year-to-date, while exceeding our retention goals for colleagues and scripts. We remain on track to close 300 stores in 2023 and a cumulative total of 900 stores by 2024.  Turning to our progress on our strategy. Nearly 18 months ago, we outlined the bold shift in our strategy and shared our vision to become the leading health solutions company for consumers. Our goal is to redefine healthcare by creating a model that is convenient, affordable, connects care, and puts the patient at the center. Achieving this vision requires the right set of capabilities to serve a broader patient, customer and community base. At the center of our vision is a value based platform that is multi-payer, multi-channel, and successful at driving consumer engagement all leading to improved health outcomes.  Importantly as I highlighted earlier, we have completed the acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health. These acquisitions significantly advance our value based strategy by adding primary care, home based care, and provider enablement capabilities to our platform. They also bring cutting edge technology and talent that will accelerate innovation in areas such as automation, analytics, and technology enabled data-driven product development. These premier growth businesses strongly enhance our ability to execute our care delivery strategy. Signify Health has a proven track record of identifying gaps in care and returning patients to care in close collaboration with their payer partners. They have demonstrated their ability to continuously innovate and evolve, further enhancing their value to their payer partners. Signify has a substantial pipeline of opportunities to enhance their position. This includes updating their in home evaluations to continue to accurately document conditions and diseases while adapting to CMS risk model changes. We will also introduce a Star's enablement offering that will provide meaningful benefits for all payers. Oak Street Health has a powerful combination of strong patient engagement, high quality care, and integrated technology that connects care experiences. These capabilities make Oak Street Health the premier clinic based provider in the ecosystem today and uniquely positions them to manage the risk adjustment changes recently implemented by CMS. The early close of the acquisition will be a short-term headwind to our 2023 adjusted EPS, but will enable us to unlock synergies earlier and evaluate all options to accelerate growth at Oak Street and CVS Health. More importantly, the combination of Signify, Oak Street, and CVS Health creates a value based person centered care platform propelled by the powerful connections between our unique capabilities and assets. This will enable us to drive better patient experience and health outcomes while delivering on our long-term financial goals. We are also making progress on driving integrated value across our foundational businesses. We serve 2.9 million members who are enrolled in our integrated medical and pharmacy plans. For members that utilize our integrated offerings we are driving higher rates of medication adherence, up to 15%, lower hospital admission and readmission rate, up to 19% reductions in ER visits, and 25% greater utilization of critical mental healthcare. Overall, these integrated plans offer members access to quality, better coordinated care, and improved health outcomes. As we continue to extend our capabilities, we will develop more powerful connections that drive superior patient experiences, better outcomes, and lower costs. We remain critically focused on digital engagement and achieved a significant milestone this quarter, exceeding 50 million unique digital customers. These customers are driving meaningful results with digital sales in the quarter up more than 30% versus the prior year. Engagement levels are strong as these customers spend 2.4 times more than our non-digitally engaged customers and at higher margins. We continue to drive innovation and expand our digital offerings to meet customer\u2019s needs. Last month we released our 2022 ESG report highlighting the progress we are making towards our ambitious goals. We continue to build on our achievements, including signing two additional renewable energy purchases that meaningfully advance our transition to 50% renewable energy by 2040.  Before I turn the call over to Shawn, I'd like to talk about recent regulatory actions and how our businesses are positioned to successfully navigate through the impact in the months and years to come. We have a long history of successfully working within Medicare Advantage funding levels to support program stability for our members. We're building on that experience to drive more care to value-based arrangements and to clinical care programs that deliver better outcomes and improve member experiences. Our strong capabilities enable us to navigate the current environment and deliver offerings that our customers value. We appreciate CMS' approach to provide a three-year phase-in for the risk adjustment model changes. This will allow the industry to work within the guidelines and to reduce disruptions faced by members. We support CMS' goal to increase the value of risk coding and believe coding should capture the true picture of a patient's health, including risk factors, identifying care gaps and patient needs, and ultimately driving better outcomes. Aetna, Signify Health, and Oak Street are the right combination of assets to successfully manage through these changes. Each have robust processes and infrastructure to handle the increasing complexities in patient care and reimbursement. They also bring an incredible expertise that allows us to quickly evaluate the impact from these changes and rapidly implement the necessary operational updates to excel in this dynamic environment. I also want to address the recent regulatory focus on the PBM industry. PBMs have consistently been found to operate in a highly efficient market and drive real savings to health care customers and members. Every day, we deliver product choices for our clients and their members that help make care more affordable, accessible, and simple. Our business is centered on transparency, innovation, and simplicity which strengthens our ability to meet customers and health plan client needs and most importantly, drive towards the lowest net cost. Finally, I want to thank our dedicated CVS Health colleagues for their commitment and extraordinary work driving our vision forward. I'll now turn the call over to Shawn for a deeper look into our financial results and outlook for the year. Shawn Guertin : Thank you, Karen and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect the continuation of outstanding performance from each of our business segments as we delivered strong revenue growth, cash flow from operations, and adjusted earnings per share. These results are driven by our steadfast focus on growth, operational execution, and supporting the communities we serve. A few highlights regarding total company performance. First quarter revenues of $85.3 billion increased by 11% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth across each of our businesses. We delivered adjusted operating income of $4.4 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.20, representing decreases of 5.1% and 4.3% versus prior year, respectively, primarily due to lower COVID-19 contributions in the current year. Our ability to generate cash remains outstanding with cash flow from operations in the quarter of $7.4 billion. Cash flows in the quarter benefited from the timing of CMS payments that are expected to normalize by the end of the year. As Karen mentioned in her prepared remarks, beginning this quarter we have re-segmented our businesses and our financial reporting to more closely align with how they are managed. I will discuss our first quarter 2023 results and provide comparisons against the prior year based on our new structure. After reviewing the results, I will update our 2023 guidance under the new segmentation. Starting with health care benefits. We delivered strong revenue growth versus the prior year. First quarter revenue of $25.9 billion increased by 12.1% year-over-year. Membership grew over 4% on a sequential basis, reflecting significant growth in individual exchange members as well as increases across all other product lines. Adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion in the quarter declined slightly versus the prior year. This was driven by the expected return to more normalized utilization as the effect of COVID waned and by the lower impact from prior year reserve development. These decreases were largely offset by higher net investment income and membership growth across all product lines during the quarter. Our medical benefit ratio of 84.6% increased 120 basis points year-over-year, reflecting more normalized utilization including the impact of higher flu as compared to last year and modestly lower impact from favorable prior year development. Our assumption was always that our 2023 medical cost seasonality by business would look more like pre-pandemic patterns. We believe that the consensus estimates for quarterly MBR may have relied too heavily on recent experience that was impacted by COVID-19. Overall, utilization trends remain in line with expectations. Consolidated days claims payable at the end of the quarter was 48.1, down 3.2 days sequentially. This is more in line with historical levels of day\u2019s claims payable for the first quarter in pre-pandemic periods. Overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. Our Health Services business, which includes most of the operations of our legacy Pharmacy Services segment as well as our health care delivery operations generated revenue of approximately $45 billion, an increase of 12.6% year-over-year. This increase was driven by pharmacy claims growth, specialty pharmacy, and brand inflation, partially offset by continued client price improvements. While results from both Signify, which closed in March and Oak Street, which closed yesterday, will be included in this segment going forward, the timing of the close of Signify resulted in an immaterial impact to first quarter 2023 results. Adjusted operating income of nearly $1.7 billion grew over 14% year-over-year driven by improved purchasing economics and increased pharmacy claims volume. This was partially tempered by ongoing client price improvements and lower COVID-19 testing. Total pharmacy claims processed in the quarter increased by 3.7% above the prior year and 4.8% when excluding COVID-19 vaccinations. This increase was primarily attributable to net new business in 2023, increased utilization, and the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season. Total pharmacy membership remained steady exceeding 110 million members. In our Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness segment, we delivered strong revenue growth despite continued economic uncertainty and lower COVID-19 contributions. During the first quarter, revenue of $27.9 billion grew nearly 8%, reflecting increased prescription and front store volume, pharmacy drug mix, and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure, decreased COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing and the impact of recent generic introductions. Adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion declined 27.9% versus the prior year, driven by reimbursement pressure and decreased COVID-19 vaccinations and testing as well as increased investments in operations and capabilities. These decreases were partially offset by increased prescription volume and improved generic drug purchasing. Pharmacy prescription volume grew 2.5% year-over-year, reflecting increased utilization and elevated cough, cold and flu volume compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, prescription volume increased by 4.5%. Turning to the balance sheet, our liquidity and capital position remained excellent. Through the first quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $7.4 billion, bolstered by the CMS prepayment I discussed earlier and ended the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion of cash at the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries. During the quarter, we issued approximately $6 billion of long-term debt for general corporate purposes including funding the Signify transaction. The Oak Street transaction was funded with available resources, including proceeds of $5 billion from a term loan that closed earlier this week. We repurchased approximately 22.8 million shares in the quarter, and through our quarterly dividend, we returned $779 million to shareholders. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings while preserving flexibility to deploy capital strategically. A few other items worth highlighting for investors. First, as previously noted, beginning this year, the impact of net realized capital gains or losses will be excluded from adjusted operating income. Net realized capital losses in the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were $105 million and $75 million, respectively. Second, we recorded an additional loss on assets held for sale associated with our Omnicare Long-Term Care business of $349 million. We also recognized acquisition-related transaction and integration costs associated with the Signify and Oak Street transactions as well as additional office real estate optimization charges in the quarter for a total of $68 million.  Finally, effective January 1st of this year, we adopted a new standard related to the accounting for long-duration insurance contracts. Our results will reflect this change going forward. The retrospective adoption of the new accounting standard also required us to revise our net income for 2022. This change positively impacted our first quarter 2022 results by $42 million and our full year 2022 results by $162 million. Before we provide our updated expectations for 2023, I want to discuss the impact of our business re-segmentation had on our financials. The primary impact of re-segmentation that I want to highlight is the revised treatment of our Maintenance Choice product. Previously, the economics of Maintenance Choice were reflected in both our Pharmacy Services and Retail segments regardless of where the drugs were dispensed and drove a large intersegment elimination. After re-segmentation, the economics of Maintenance Choice will only be reflected in our Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness segment, which now includes all pharmacy, mail and specialty fulfillment operations. This change correspondingly results in the discontinuation of adjusted operating income eliminations and provides greater simplicity for investors. In addition to the changes related to our treatment of Maintenance Choice, we shifted our legacy care delivery operations, including MinuteClinic from retail into our Health Services segment. This is also where our recently acquired Signify and Oak Street businesses will be reported. Turning now to updated guidance based on our new segments. Beginning with the Health Services segment, our new adjusted operating income guidance is a range of $6.61 billion to $6.73 billion. This estimate reflects the re-segmentation changes previously described, the impact of emerging risks to the 340B program and the inclusion of Signify Health and Oak Street Health acquisitions, partially offset by underlying strength in our pharmacy services business.  For the Health Care Benefits segment, we now expect adjusted operating income of $6.39 billion to $6.52 billion, benefiting from higher net investment income in the first quarter of 2023 and prior period development. We continue to take a prudent and cautious stance with respect to our individual exchange business inside our full year outlook. In the Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness segment, our new adjusted operating income guidance is a range of $5.73 billion to $5.83 billion, reflecting lower-than-expected COVID volumes as well as the impact of re-segmentation. We are also updating our guidance for additional net investment income generated in our Corporate segment due to higher yields and higher average parent cash balances in the first quarter of 2023. We do not expect these higher corporate cash balances to persist in 2023 following the recent closure of both the Signify and Oak Street acquisitions. Finally, our new projection for interest expense is $2.7 billion, reflecting the incremental financing costs for Signify and Oak Street. We are also updating our share count guidance to approximately 1.293 billion shares as our previously announced accelerated share repurchase transaction yielded more shares than initially projected. In aggregate, the headwind of approximately $0.35 resulting from the impact of the Signify and Oak Street acquisitions and their associated financing, partially offset by underlying strength across the enterprise result in a net headwind of $0.20. This brings our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range to $8.50 to $8.70. Shifting to our cash flow. We continue to anticipate strong cash flow from operations in 2023 and are maintaining our guidance range of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion. Capital expenditures are unchanged at a range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion, and we continue to project an adjusted effective tax rate of 25.5%. I also want to provide an update on the progression of earnings for the year. Due to the strength of our results in the first quarter, the incorporation of Signify and Oak Street and the 340B headwind, we now expect second half 2023 earnings to be slightly more than 50% of the full year results with the third quarter modestly higher than the fourth quarter. We also want to highlight our expectations for quarterly MBRs. We continue to expect the year-on-year increases in MBR to be higher in the first half than the second half. This dynamic is due to COVID-driven lower utilization trends in the first half of 2022. We expect the MBR progression in the second quarter of this year to look similar to the trend in the first quarter. Shifting now to our multiyear outlook. We remain committed to achieving the $9 and $10 targets for 2024 and 2025 that we shared during our earnings call in February. We take these commitments seriously and have aligned the organization and our operations to achieve these goals. As with any multiyear plan, new headwinds and tailwinds can emerge. Recently, there have been significant developments in the 340B program that create challenges for our Pharmacy Benefits business. And based on our most recent experience, COVID contributions may dissipate more rapidly than previously anticipated. The early close of the Signify and Oak Street transactions improve our ability to accelerate synergy realization. In addition, our business re-segmentation presents the opportunity to reduce duplicative efforts and enhanced focus on rationalizing our core operations. We believe these opportunities combined with the underlying strength of our business and our commitment to evaluate all alternatives to accelerate growth and synergies from our new acquisitions will enable us to mitigate the new headwinds I just discussed. To conclude, our first quarter results reflect continued strengths from all of our core business segments. We are excited to begin the work of integrating Signify and Oak Street into our operations and are pleased with the positive contribution of our foundational businesses on our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance. We will maintain our focus on growth and operational execution and look forward to keeping you updated as we continue to progress on our long-term strategy. We will now open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Albert Rice : Hello everybody, thanks for all the details. Maybe just on the focus on MA for 2024. Karen, in your remarks, you mentioned that you feel like Oak Street is particularly well positioned to absorb the pending changes around the risk adjustment and so forth. I wonder if I could get you to flesh that out a little more of what you all see in Oak Street relative to some of the other things perhaps you've looked at or whatever that makes you confident of their ability to make the adjustments or if they've already got things in place to do that? And then maybe the follow-up I'll ask now, too. Shawn, you guys have laid out the mitigation steps that you are taking to offset the Star Rating headwind for next year. I wonder if you've got the update on what you're doing with respect to the one plan that got hit with respect to some of the cost reduction programs that you talked about implementing and other things, any update on that would be great? Karen Lynch : Hi, A.J. Yes, let me take a couple of those things. First of all, as I said in my prepared remarks, we do plan to get back to market growth in our individual MA product for a number of reasons. I'll start with the work that we've been doing on our -- kind of in our Medicare product, making sure that we have strong benefits and strong service capabilities. We believe that Oak Street and Signify also give us credibility in the Medicare Advantage space. We took a long hard look at Oak Street and their ability to adapt to the Medicare rate advantage. The one thing that we were most impressed by was the level of commitment that they have relative to their patient care. And secondly, the technology platform that they have. And I'm going to ask Mike to actually talk a little bit more about that, but I would say that very, very strong performing business. We are excited about what their capabilities will bring to our Medicare and also other payers, Medicare because as you know, it's a payer-agnostic business. So a lot of the work that they're doing, not only benefits us, it benefits their broader customer base as well. Mike? Mike Pykosz : Yeah, thank you, Karen. To build on that, I think most importantly the results we're driving the economics from with our patients is really driven by the strength of our care model. And we've been incredibly successful across programs, across different risk adjustment methodologies. For example, we were in the top 1% of the Medicare Shared Savings Program. We're in that program. We were the top-performing direct contract in our ACO REACH entity. We've obviously achieved phenomenal results on Medicare Advantage. And so what underlies that is a robust interest in the clinical model, an incredible medical leadership team. [Indiscernible] strong technology platform. So when there are changes, we can adapt to those and implement them and the consistency of our approach, the fact that we operate our centers in a consistent manner across the country really enables us to rapidly change as we need to. But most importantly, fundamentally, what is driving the economics of Oak Street is great patient care and keeping people healthy and out of the hospital, and that's going to be durable regardless of how risk adjustment is done. Karen Lynch : And let me ask Dan to talk a little bit about our re-contracting efforts and what we're doing on Stars. Daniel Finke : So a couple of updates on the Stars program. First of all, on the contract diversification process that is ongoing and as expected, we're beginning the operationalization of that as we speak. And then Shawn has talked in the past about the investments that we've made from an enterprise perspective with the enterprise focus to improve the clinical experience and the member experience for our members. We continue to believe we have the right actions and the team in place. We have some positive momentum there. As you know, we're between two important times in the rating cycle. The CAP survey is currently underway. The investments we've made in customer satisfactions are showing some internal measurement improvement in the member experience measurements. We're also wrapping up the [HETA] (ph) season, and the team has been very focused on chart collection and we're seeing some year-over-year improvement there. And all of these actions are added to our robust Stars program, and we look forward to this being reflected in our Stars outcomes going forward. Karen Lynch : So A.J., on that point, I would just say I'm encouraged by what we're seeing on the internal metrics relative to our Stars performance. Albert Rice : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much and good morning. Karen, I just want to switch gears a little bit and go back to your PBM comment, around transparency, lowest net price. We continue to see a lot of chatter in D.C. around potential PBM registration, around both changes to rebates, changes to spread pricing. Shawn called out changes to 340B and having a headwind. There is the net to gross bubble popping when we think about insulin, I think about these new drugs, GLP-1 coming to the market. When we put all of this together, can you or welcome back to David Joyner, talk about your outlook for the PBM, how you're thinking about this and any potential changes that you think will come about on the PBM side and what are you hearing more importantly from your clients as we think about these areas? Karen Lynch : Hi Lisa, first of all, I thought your report on the PBM industry was fantastic. And let me -- I'll just make a few comments on the PBM industry at large, and I'll ask David to answer your specific questions. I think it's really important that we all recognize that the PBMs play an essential role in lowering drug costs. And I think we all would agree that in fact, the PBM is the only player in the supply chain whose specific role it is to lower drug costs for our customers. And I think we've had a number of investigations. They've consistently concluded that the PBMs operate in a highly efficient and effective manner to really deliver real savings. And I think you mentioned the customers, our clients hire us to manage their pharmacy benefit, which includes both the administration and the management of overall drug costs. And almost every case, they bring in sophisticated consultants to help them look at that broader service offering, which includes looking at rebates, looking at spread pricing. And our clients have a choice and decide how they want to contract for rebates and spread pricing. And in fact, today, we're passing through over 98% of rebates on behalf of our clients, which obviously have full audit rights. And our scorecard is really how we're effectively and successfully managing the client spend, which we have consistently demonstrated and low to single -- low to mid-single-digit growth in overall pharmacy spend. So I think that we've seen a high level of member and client satisfaction. And I think that the government -- we've answered the government's questions on transparency and innovation and our clients are making those choices. And I think that we have consistently demonstrated that the PBMs play a critical role in the health care ecosystem. Now your specific questions, let me ask David to talk about the customers. David Joyner : Thanks, Karen and Lisa, thanks for the question. So as you know, I've been in this industry for a long time and maybe have become too accustomed to the scrutiny in the marketplace, but it also has allowed us I think to validate the value that we bring to our customers. So as I kind of answer more broadly kind of the customer question and kind of where the focus is, as you know, 9 out of every 10 prescriptions are generic drugs today. So if you look at it from a member affordability, this is a very affordable benefit. And I think the value that the PBM has been able to accelerate and deliver to our customers. So the focus now is really on that last 10% and the 10% both in terms of the high list prices and areas in which we have been able to deliver competition and actually create discounts for our customers. So I would say there's a couple of different areas that we're focusing on. One is to make sure that we preserve and protect the transparency that we're delivering to our customers today. As Karen said, we passed through, obviously, 98-plus percent of the rebates and the customers choose how they want to contract with us with full audit rights. So I think our customers feel very strongly about the value that we're delivering, but there is obviously an area around the member affordability. So we're focusing specifically in the area of insulins. We have today 65% of all of our planned sponsors to actually offer a $35 or less co-pay for the members that have insulin. So when you look at it from a member affordability and areas where we want to protect the preventative drug classes, our customers are actually moving down this path and making sure that they're both focusing on transparency for themselves and also making sure that they're focusing on transparency for the members. And the last piece I'll say just in terms of kind of the client reaction and/or kind of where they're positioned today, we did have a large client forum upon my return. And there's a big focus on kind of the advocacy, both in the states and at the federal level, and they're very focused on making sure that they both educate and preserve the tools that we have available to us to manage the spend. So whether you mentioned biosimilars or the high cost of GLP-1s is making sure that we continue to actually have the tools in place to drive competition that allows us to reduce cost for our customers. So I'd say it has been somewhat of a wake-up call, and I would expect that you'll see more kind of advocacy not just within the PBM, but obviously, the payers that actually have to fund the benefit. Lisa Gill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : Hi, good morning. Appreciate the reiteration of 2024 and 2025 EPS target. Given you've updated 2023 and there's a ton of moving parts for 2024, I wanted to focus here and ask a question for an update on areas like the Star Rating, Centene loss headwind next year. I know that number has moved obviously. How should we think about the deals year-over-year versus the $0.35 dilution that you've offered for this year? And any other areas of potential offset or growth beyond typical core growth and capital deployment as we think about kind of the moving parts to kind of bridge us to that $9 would be really helpful? Shawn Guertin : Yes. I -- we'll start on that and Karen or anybody else could comment on this. So I think in terms of thinking about the existing headwinds that you mentioned, Stars and Centene, I think we look at those as largely the same. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we're driving the organization to achieve the $9 per share for 2023 and approximately $10 for 2024 on an adjusted EPS basis. But as we mentioned over the quarter, there has been a couple of things, I think, that have sort of popped up. Having said that, we do believe we have two very impactful levers, one of which you mentioned that can help us mitigate these potential headwinds. The first is to explore all the alternatives to accelerate growth and synergy realization in Signify and Oak Street. For Signify, that will be driven by continued strong multi-payer growth and using our combined assets to expand product and capabilities for all payers. For Oak Street, the early closing will allow us to explore alternative growth vehicles that allow us to accelerate clinic growth and mitigate dilution and very importantly, begin this work well in advance of 2024. The second item is that the closing of these two strategic transactions and the re-segmenting of our operation provides us with a timely opportunity to both improve focus and reduce administrative and operational costs by streamlining, eliminating duplicative efforts and achieving greater organizational operational efficiency. We believe both areas represent sizable opportunities that have the potential to serve as mitigating tailwinds for 2024 and 2025. So I'd say, in summary, while there's still a lot to play out here on both the headwinds and tailwinds side, we still believe these are goals that are within an attainable range of outcomes. Justin Lake : And Shawn, when do you think you'll be able to share with us or put some numbers around the benefits you'll see to those deals versus kind of what consensus numbers maybe assumed for 2024 and the efficiency cost cutting that you think you might be able to achieve for next year, any idea in terms of magnitude or timing? Shawn Guertin : Yes, I think this is really at the top of the priority list for the next really quarter or two. And I think we'll have greater clarity on both headwinds and tailwinds sort of over that time period. And I just want to be clear, I might have said $9 and $10 for 2023 and 2024, that's for 2024 and 2025, just to be clear. But Justin, this is really at sort of the top of the performance agenda for the next couple of quarters for us. Justin Lake : Great, thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Michael Cherny : Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. I think this is a quasi two part or one technical and one more test the numbers. But just first, on the segmentation change, I just want to confirm, especially based on the press release that the specialty and mail revenue and EBIT moved from Health Services, the former Pharmacy Services to Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness just because I'm trying to make sure I understand the full footing of where the guidance changed? And I guess the real question along those lines is, can we dive a little bit more into what goes into 340B in terms of the changes that you've seen and you called it out specifically for Health Services, is there any impact that you can bridge in terms of the total number, both for Health Services as well as if there is any impacts Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness? Thanks so much. Shawn Guertin : Michael, I'll jump in on this one. So I want to be clear that the economic benefit really of specialty and the mail is still in HSS. What we have done here is consolidate the fulfillment functions in the PCW organization and there's no meaningful sort of transfer of profit around sort of the fulfillment angle of that. So when you look at the guidance change on HSS, it looks like a big number. The biggest component of that is really the elimination of the dual credit of maintenance choice being in both. When you take that out, you will see the guidance has come down about $300 million for HSS. That's basically two main pieces. One you saw in our earnings slides, there's about a $0.07 decrement or about $130 million that sort of the core performance of the pharmacy business, which I'll come back to vis-a-vis 340B. The other is we're now including the adjusted operating income for Oak and Signify in there, and that is the other piece that would get you to about a $300 -- or $300 million change in the guidance. But the thing to keep in mind is the elimination and then also the elimination then of the elimination entry that we had around maintenance choice, that's going to look a lot bigger. The 340B impact, as I mentioned, it's a very fluid situation. We're reacting to sort of what the actions that various manufacturers are taking. What I'd say is, as I mentioned, there's about a $0.07 decrease in our guidance related to pharmacy performance. That actually is an underlying positive strength in the non-340B elements of our Pharmacy business. And then we've put in sort of a best estimate at this point. So that 340B impact is a little bigger than the $0.07. I think there are various -- there's been a note or two published about this, and I'd say those aren't unreasonable proxies for sort of what we've incorporated into our guidance on this topic. But again, I can't stress enough, it's sort of a dynamic process that's moving around. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thank you. Appreciate the incremental detail on Signify and Oak's impact on the guidance. My question would be how are you prioritizing the development of Oak, are you focusing on getting existing membership into existing clinics near term, it sounds like there is new clinic build that may be accelerated by the early close, what can you tell us there? Shawn Guertin : Yes. I'll turn it to Mike, but it's really both, right. We're considering, obviously, the key financial levers getting membership into the clinics. That's always been -- it's one of the synergy values we discussed when we announced the deal. And then as I mentioned, one of the opportunities we've had once we've closed is to explore solutions to accelerate that growth. But I'll let Mike comment as well. Mike Pykosz : Yes. From Oak Street side, we couldn't be more excited getting to work with CVS, the breadth and the number of older adults that CVS is interacting with across all the different business units is really unprecedented in the U.S., and that creates an incredible opportunity for us to meet more people, introduce to what we do at Oak Street Health, which we think is highly differentiated from a care model perspective and a patient experience perspective that can allow us to bring more and more patients in, which can really move up the profitability timing in our J curve [ph]. And that is an incredible excitement point. And I think even thinking more broadly than just the kind of CVS HSS we're really excited to work with Signify, which is a huge opportunity there as well. So that's just on the filling the clinic perspective. And obviously, we are always excited. We think there's a huge market opportunity to put more clinics up into that combination, I think, is really powerful. Kyle Armbrester : Yes, this is Kyle, I will go in briefly too. When we go into the almost 3 million homes we're going to this year, so many of them don't have a primary care physician or are completely isolated from a care team. And so we're very excited to have an option for those folks and to be able to drive them back to a model that we know is going to drive better outcomes and to connect them into Oak Street. So there's a tremendous amount of synergies, that can bring in all of these three assets together, CVS with the brand and the reach, Oak with their differentiated model, and now our presence in the home. And when we pull all three of those together, I think we're going to have a really unique experience that drives better patient outcomes across the country. Karen Lynch : Yes. And Eric, I wouldn't lose sight of the fact that there are a lot of other assets that we can connect the dots for these members, including kind of our retail health clinics, including our pharmacy, you can think about Medicare -- pharmacy adherence, pharmacy reconciliation. So there's lots of touch points that will create additional value for us across the entire enterprise as we connect all these assets together. Eric Percher : And Karen, do you believe you have all the assets you need now or could we see more inorganic addition to health care services? Karen Lynch : Yes, I think over time, we'll look at what other assets, but right now we need to focus on execution of the assets that we just acquired. And then as you think longer term around the corner, there might be additional opportunities in the home or health services, tech kinds of things. But right now, for the near term, it is important for us to execute on these important assets and bring our products and services to bear for our customers. Eric Percher : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. And Kevin, your line is open, please unmute. Kevin Caliendo : Sorry about that. Just looking at the MBR guide, I just want to make sure I got this right. So you -- Shawn, you said second quarter MBR would be flat, right, with first quarter MBR and that utilization expectations were in line with your expectations. I guess just can you remind us what the utilization expectations were or are in any way to segment out what you're seeing, you mentioned higher flu, but maybe across the different business lines, just to get a better understanding of sort of what the assumption is for 2Q as well in terms of utilization and how to think about that going forward? Shawn Guertin : Yes, I'll have Dan talk a little bit more about the specifics on utilization, but specific to the MBR discussion. Just to be clear, it may mathematically work out to be what you said, but we expect a similar kind of year-over-year increase in MBR and then sort of a leveling out for kind of Q3, Q4. And I think this has more to do I think with how 2022 manifested itself in terms of how COVID was playing out. And I think that's why that's going to sort of drive that pattern. We have been pricing all along for a return to normal utilization across the portfolio. I think we're getting closer and closer to that all the time, certainly with some of what we've seen in first quarter. But I can have Dan comment a little bit more but as you mentioned, overall, we thought it was in line with our expectations and our pricing. So Dan? Daniel Finke : Yes. Thanks, Shawn. As Shawn said, we've been expecting the quarter-over-quarter increases towards a normalized level of utilization, and we certainly continue to see that in the first quarter. Inpatient volume has continued to be slightly below normalized levels. We also saw some transitions care to alternative sites of care, outpatient ambulatory. And obviously, we think that's a good thing, offering alternative sites of care with lower overall costs. So we see that trend continue. Mental Health remains above pre-pandemic levels. We also think that's a good thing because demand is being met. And then general services, like physician services, ambulatory ER and specialists are all generally at normalized levels. And all of that, like Shawn said, is priced within expectations. When you think about the lines of business, the way I think about it is commercial and Medicare, in line with expectations generally at normalized levels and Medicaid is still being somewhat favorable. Kevin Caliendo : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : Hi guys. As I think about the Oak Street acquisition and the guidance that you had given at the time of the deal being announced, $2 billion EBITDA target for 2026. I think I've heard Shawn talk about driving accelerated growth there. How do we reconcile, first, do you still believe that, that's the goal? And then how do you reconcile the J-curve with the increase or the acceleration in growth in units that you're contemplating? Shawn Guertin : Yes. Just to be clear, I think, I'm not sure but the EBITDA number you're referencing was sort of the embedded EBITDA kind of concept. And I think that's again, when we talk a lot about sort of accretion dilution, we're in the GAAP world. And what that does is it leaves out sort of the embedded EBITDA that's building. But as I mentioned, there's significant long-term value because of that embedded EBITDA and accelerating clinic growth. And as we've discussed, though, there are vehicles and models where we could see kind of both accelerating the clinic growth and better managing the dilutive impact of that clinic growth. And now that we're closed, and we're closed well in advance of 2024, I think one of the opportunities we have is to explore and potentially execute on those in time to have an impact on 2024. But I'll let Mike as the expert here talk more about this. Mike Pykosz : Yes. What I would add to that is if you look at the economics of the Oak Street J curve, which we've shared a lot publicly on the Oak Street level, the biggest driver of that is both the quality of care for patients and how fast you can fill up centers. And we're -- we think there is opportunity to continue to improve the quality of care of patients as we have year-over-year. There's a lot of capabilities in CVS, that can accelerate that. But even more importantly, if we can just pull up the time it takes the full center, we will pull off those extremely profitable years at the back-end J-curve, which right now are taking six to seven years to get to. You can pull that up faster. Obviously, now that number that Shawn referenced that embedded EBITDA number becomes reality much faster. And I think that's the biggest opportunity from an economic perspective. And while we are so excited to see part of CVS as we're doing that, we can reinvest even more and more centers, more capabilities to create an incredibly powerful flywheel. And obviously, interacting with a broader CBS ecosystem will both help Oak Street and we can actually do a lot to help different parts within CVS as well. So again, we can be more excited about that, but the opportunities are huge. A - Karen Lynch : I want to thank you all for joining our call today. We obviously entered 2023 with really strong execution, and we are committed to achieving our goals. So thank you.

CVS Health closed another successful quarter, delivering on our financial commitments through the power of our diversified business model and focused execution of our strategy. We have been relentless in the pursuit of our goals to deliver superior health experiences by improving outcomes, lowering costs, driving higher levels of engagement, and broadening access to high quality care. So far in 2023, we have achieved several key accomplishments. First, we acquired Signify Health and Oak Street Health, two best-in-class value-based care assets. We are making progress integrating these multi-payor companies to create meaningful value. We are unlocking opportunities by connecting Signify and Oak Street to CVS Heath assets such as Aetna, MinuteClinic, and CVS Pharmacy, and driving patient engagement and growth. As we scale our healthcare delivery assets and realize synergy opportunities, we will accelerate our long term growth trajectory. Second, we expanded our individual exchange offering to 12 states and successfully on-boarded more than one million new members. Strategically, this is an important marketplace that grew to approximately 50 million enrollees in 2022. Our success with this population lays the foundation for future earnings growth at Aetna and creates connection for these members across all our integrated assets.  Finally, our ability to generate strong cash flows enables us to invest in our long term strategy and return value to shareholders. Through June 30, we generated more than $13 billion of operating cash flow and returned more than $3.5 billion to our shareholders. We expect to continue to return cash to our shareholders and deploy capital to enhance shareholder value. Today we reported second quarter adjusted EPS of $2.21 and adjusted operating income $4.5 billion. Our diversified business strengthened by our exceptional execution positions us to navigate emerging headwinds in Medicare Advantage and a changing consumer environment. We are reaffirming our full year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range of $8.50 to $8.70. Shawn will provide more details on our updated outlook for the year shortly. Turning to our performance highlights for the quarter, in our healthcare benefits segment, we grew revenues to $26.7 billion, an increase of nearly 18%, and delivered adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion. Medical membership in the second quarter was 25.6 million, an increase of 1.2 million members versus the prior year, reflecting broad-based growth including individual exchange, Medicare and commercial membership. For our core commercial membership, this quarter marks the eighth consecutive quarter of membership gains. This growth reflects our differentiated product offerings that address the total cost of care and the whole health of a member through our integrated solutions. Medical cost trends were well controlled in our commercial and Medicaid books of business. Consistent with the broader industry, elevated medical costs emerged in our Medicare Advantage business which became apparent in the latter part of the quarter. The primary driver of these elevated medical costs was greater than expected utilization in outpatient settings. Shawn will discuss these trends in more detail. In Medicaid, the State of Oklahoma awarded us a new statewide Medicaid contract beginning in April 2024 that will add approximately 200 members. This win demonstrates our market-leading ability to comprehensively support Medicaid populations through our deep local relationships, investment in clinical programs, and integrated wellbeing solutions. This quarter, we were able to offset the pressures in our healthcare benefits segment with continued strong execution in our health services segment. Revenues grew to $46.2 billion, an increase of nearly 8%. Adjusted operating income grew 3.5% to $1.9 billion. These results were driven by our pharmacy services business. We consistently demonstrate value to consumers and our clients by successfully managing drug cost trends and bringing innovative clinical solutions to the market. In the second quarter, branded drug revenue increased in part driven by the GLC1 category. This expensive and fast-growing category presents new choices for the over 70 million adults in the U.S. who are living with obesity and the nearly 37 million people who have Type 2 diabetes. We are well positioned to deliver value to customers in this category with our weight loss programs and utilization management tools that drive the lowest net cost for our clients.  Every day, we create competition, drive the lowest net cost, and deliver transparency, value and choice to our customers. This is the foundation of our continued success and our market-leading position. Turning to healthcare delivery, both Signify Health and Oak Street Health had strong quarters, delivering business performance consistent with our expectations. These assets bring core capabilities to our multi-payor value-based care platform that drives optimal patient engagement with health services across multiple channels. In the short time since we closed these transactions, we\u2019ve launched efforts to drive high patient engagement by leveraging our CVS Health assets. Signify Health is core to our home health services strategy. Signify enables better health in the home and has an unmatched ability to build trust and connect with 3 million patients in their homes annually. We capture valuable insights into a patient\u2019s broader care needs during in-home evaluations and are able to create engagement points across other health services for our health plan partners. These engagement points ultimately drive better care, lower the total cost of care such as reducing hospital readmissions, and improving health outcomes.  Survey results show that members who are highly satisfied with their Signify in-home evaluations are 26 times more likely to recommend their health plan and 74% more likely to consider additional health services. Signify\u2019s customers recognize the power of this trusted relationship and the value of these home services. Since the close of the acquisition, Signify has demonstrated exceptional retention of its health plan and health system customers. We\u2019ve added new relationships, expanding the opportunity to bring Signify\u2019s services to more Medicare members. CVS Health\u2019s trusted brand and our broad customer touch points further increase opportunities for Signify to engage with patients and expand the services they deliver.  This quarter, there is a strong demand for both in-home evaluations and additional Signify services in the home. We launched new member engagement initiatives at select CVS pharmacies to drive IET conversion of Aetna Medicare members and CVS pharmacy customers to Signify. Early results are promising with higher engagement across the CVS Health channels utilized. Turning to Oak Street Health, we are accelerating patient growth through our broad community presence and ability to engage consumers across multiple channels. Today there are approximately 1 million Medicare-eligible seniors who visit CVS pharmacies each week that are located near an Oak Street clinic. We launched new member engagement initiatives focused on creating connections between Medicare-eligible CVS customers, both in store and digitally, and Oak Street Health providers. We are also connecting Aetna Medicare members who are currently without a primary care physician with their local Oak Street provider to re-engage them in their care. These initiatives will drive Oak Street patient growth and accelerate the path to mature clinic profitability while broadly serving the needs of Medicare members. As Oak Street expands to additional geographies, these opportunities to drive higher patient growth will continue to increase. By the end of 2023, we expect to have Oak Street clinics in 25 states, up from 21 at the close of the transaction. We will also open new Oak Street clinics co-located with CVS pharmacies this year and have already identified additional locations for 2024. We now expect to build 50 to 60 clinics next year. Turning to our pharmacy and consumer wellness segments, we grew revenues to $28.8 billion, an increase of nearly 8% versus the prior year. We generated $1.4 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, a decrease of 17% from the prior year largely due to lower COVID-related volumes. Our pharmacy business delivered another quarter of strong performance. Same store pharmacy sales increased by more than 14% versus the prior year, primarily driven by pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation. Same store prescription growth when excluding the impact of COVID grew by nearly 5%. This growth is fueled by our efforts to provide a differentiated omnichannel pharmacy experience that meets customers where they are In our front store, we\u2019ve grown market share, increased household penetration, and delivered historically high service levels. This positions us well to manage through economic volatility. In the quarter, our same store sales excluding OTC test kits grew by more than 1%, demonstrating the resiliency of our front store offerings in a more challenging consumer environment.  We also continue to make progress growing our digital members and sales. This quarter, we exceeded 53 million unique digital customers, up over 2 million from last quarter. Our digital sales increased 24% versus the prior year, including a meaningful increase of 65% in our over-the-counter health solution offering. This offering is highly valued by our health plan members, allowing them to conveniently access their important OTC benefits. Last quarter, we discussed optimizing our cost structure. This morning, we announced a restructuring charge of nearly $500 million associated with the elimination of approximately 5,000 non-customer facing positions as well as the impairment of non-core assets. These efforts are expected to generate over $600 million of run rate savings beginning in 2024. Our optimization efforts have also focused on identifying additional opportunities to drive efficiency and operational excellence using technology. For example, we\u2019ve been selectively using artificial intelligence for some time and are increasingly finding opportunities to improve the efficiency of our operations, enhance our customer experience, and increase our competitiveness. When combining all of our productivity initiatives, we are confident we will achieve the $700 million to $800 million of cost savings that we are targeting in 2024. These actions enable us to reallocate resources and invest in critical growth areas such as health services and technology, which are the biggest enablers of our strategy.  We\u2019ve taken meaningful steps executing on our long term strategy with tangible proof of the value of our unique integrated offerings. We look forward to providing more details at our investor day on December 5 in Boston. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Shawn to provide a deeper look into our results and our guidance. Shawn? Shawn Guertin : Thank you Karen, and good morning everyone.  Our second quarter results continued to demonstrate the strength of our execution and the power of our diversified enterprise. We delivered strong revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share and cash flow from operations. A few highlights regarding total company performance. Second quarter revenues of nearly $90 billion increased by more than 10% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth across each of our businesses. We delivered adjusted operating income of nearly $4.5 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.21, representing decreases of approximately 10% and 13% versus prior year respectively. These decreases were primarily due to declines in our healthcare benefits and pharmacy and consumer wellness segments, partially offset by strong execution in our pharmacy services operations.  Our ability to generate cash remains outstanding with year-to-date cash flow from operations of $13.3 billion. These cash flows were impacted by the timing of CMS payments that are expected to normalize in the fourth quarter. Excluding this impact, our cash flows from operations remain strong at $8 billion.  Shifting to the details for our healthcare benefits segment, we delivered strong revenue growth versus the prior year. Second quarter revenue of $26.7 billion increased by 17.6% year-over-year, reflecting growth across all product lines. Membership grew to 25.6 million, an increase of 121,000 members sequentially, reflecting increases in our individual exchange and commercial businesses partially offset by the impact of Medicaid redeterminations. Adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion in the quarter declined approximately 20% versus the prior year. This decline was driven by a higher than expected medical benefit ratio partially offset by higher net investment income and strong execution on operating cost management. Our medical benefit ratio of 86.2% increased 350 basis points year-over-year, reflecting higher than expected Medicare Advantage utilization in the second quarter. These trends were primarily driven by higher utilization in the outpatient setting as well as dental and behavioral health. We also recognized higher utilization levels in the first quarter and prior year, resulting in lower year-over-year prior period development in the quarter. It is important to note that utilization in our other lines of business, including individual exchange, commercial and Medicaid remain generally in line with our pricing expectations.  Days claims payable at the end of the quarter was 46.9, down 1.2 days sequentially. This decline was almost entirely driven by the impact of increased Medicaid pass-through payments in the quarter. Excluding this impact, DCP was stable and overall we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. Our health services segment, which includes our pharmacy services business, and our healthcare delivery operations generated revenue of approximately $46.2 billion, an increase of 7.6% year-over-year. This increase was driven by pharmacy drug mix, growth in specialty pharmacy, brand inflation and the addition of Signify and Oak Street. These increases were partially offset by the impact of continued client price improvements.  Adjusted operating income of nearly $1.9 billion grew 3.5% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong execution and improved purchasing economics, partially offset by ongoing client price improvements and lower MinuteClinic COVID-19 testing. Total pharmacy claims processed in the quarter declined by approximately 1% versus the prior year and down 50 basis points when excluding COVID-19 vaccinations. This decline was primarily attributable to the New York Medicaid carve-out largely offset by net new business. Total pharmacy membership was approximately 110 million members.  Within our health services segment, we are very encouraged by the performance and growth of our healthcare delivery assets. Signify completed 673,000 in-home evaluations in the quarter, an increase of 16% versus the same period last year, and generated revenue growth of 19%. Oak Street ended the quarter with 177 centers and 181,000 at-risk lives, increases over the same period last year of approximately 23% and 35% respectively. Oak Street also significantly increased revenue in the quarter, growing 43% compared to the same quarter last year. Moving to our pharmacy and consumer wellness segment, we generated revenue of $28.8 billion, up nearly 8% versus the prior year and nearly 11% on a same store basis, reflecting the impact of pharmacy drug mix, increased prescriptions and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by the impact of recent generic introductions, decreased COVID-19 related volume, and continue reimbursement pressure. Adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion declined approximately 17% versus the prior year, driven by reimbursement pressure, lower COVID-19 vaccines and testing, and lower front store volumes. These decreases were partially offset by increased prescription volume and improved generic drug purchasing. Same store pharmacy sales were up more than 14%, driven by drug mix, a 3.6% increase in same store prescription volumes, and brand inflation. The increase in same store prescription volumes excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations was 4.9%.  As Karen mentioned, our front store business is not immune to trends in the broader economy, but we have shown resiliency in the face of these challenges and continue to demonstrate the value we offer consumers. Same store sales for the front store were down 30 basis points primarily due to declines in cough, cold and flu and to OTC test kits. Excluding the impact of OTC test kits, same store front store sales were up by more than 1%. Turning to the balance sheet, our liquidity and capital position remain excellent. Our ability to generate cash flow has always been a strength of our organization, and the enterprise continues to identify new opportunities to optimize our balance sheet. Through the second quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $13.3 billion, bolstered by the CMS prepayment I discussed earlier, and ended the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion of cash at the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries. During the quarter, we issued approximately $5 billion of long term debt and repaid our outstanding $5 billion term loan that was used to fund a portion of the Oak Street transaction.  Through our quarterly dividend, we returned $795 million to shareholders. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings while preserving flexibility to deploy capital strategically. A few other items worth highlighting for investors. We recognized acquisition-related transaction and integration costs associated with the Signify and Oak Street transactions as well as additional office real estate optimization charges in the quarter for a total of $168 million. As Karen mentioned in her prepared remarks, we also took a restructuring charge of nearly $500 million associated with our cost optimization efforts and the impairment of non-core assets.  Turning now to our outlook for 2023, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance of $8.50 to $8.70. This guidance reflects our performance through the second quarter as well as a higher than expected Medicare Advantage medical cost trend for the remainder of 2023, offset by strength in our pharmacy services business within our health service segment. In the healthcare benefits segment, we now expect our 2023 medical benefit ratio to fall at the high end of our previous range of 84.7% plus or minus 50 basis points, reflecting the impact of higher Medicare Advantage utilization. While there is uncertainty surrounding the duration of this utilization spike, our 2023 guidance now prudently assumes that these medical cost trends will remain elevated for the rest of 2023. This update also results in a change to our guidance for adjusted operating income, which we now expect to fall in a range of $5.99 billion to $6.12 billion. While we are encouraged by trends in our individual exchange business, this guidance continues to reflect a prudent and cautious stance for that business. In our health services segment, our updated adjusted operating income guidance is a range of $7.11 billion to $7.23 billion, reflecting the strong execution year-to-date in our pharmacy services business and our expectation of continued strength for the remainder of the year. Developments in our 340B business continue to align with the guidance we provided on our first quarter call.  In our pharmacy and consumer wellness segment, we now expect adjusted operating income in a range of $5.63 billion to $5.73 billion. This updated guidance reflects strong fundamental execution year-to-date while recognizing the potential for a weakening consumer environment.  Shifting to our cash flow, we continue to anticipate strong full year 2023 cash flow from operations in a range of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion. As a result of prioritization of our portfolio to optimize our cost structure, we now expect capital expenditures in a range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. We continue to maintain our projections for interest expense and share count, and finally we now project our adjusted effective tax rate at 25.3%. You can find additional details on the components of our updated 2023 guidance on our Investor Relations webpage.  Before concluding my prepared remarks, I would like to address our medium term growth projections and targets. As Karen touched on in her remarks, CVS Health benefits from the diversity of our operations, and this positions us well to be resilient in the face of adversity. We take our commitments seriously, as evidenced by the announcement this morning of our cost cutting initiative which will meaningfully improve our positioning for 2024. However, given the emergence of multiple potential headwinds across our diverse set of assets, including uncertainty in Medicare Advantage, the potential for a weakening consumer environment and reduced retail contributions from COVID, combined with our plans to accelerate Oak Street clinic growth, our 2024 adjusted EPS target of $9 is no longer a reasonable starting point for our guidance range.  Given the more challenging outlook for 2024 and our desire to set guidance that is achievable with opportunities to outperform, we now believe investors should anchor their initial expectations for our 2024 adjusted EPS to $8.50 to $8.70, essentially flat to our existing 2023 guidance range. As is our convention, this guidance does not assume any prior year reserve development.  Given the level of uncertainty for 2024, we also believe investors should no longer rely on our 2025 adjusted EPS target of $10. We will provide more clarity on our longer term earnings growth outlook at our investor day in December. While emerging headwinds have created uncertainty for our 2024 and 2025 outlook, make no mistake - we are more convinced than ever in our long term strategy. The power of our integrated model and care delivery assets will change how consumers and patients engage with the health system and how they receive care. We believe this will benefit customers, patients, payors, and ultimately our shareholders. To conclude, our second quarter results continue to demonstrate the power of our diversified enterprise and the resiliency of our businesses. We continue to maintain our focus on growth and operational execution as we work to become the leading health solution company for consumers. With that, we will now open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from AJ Rice from Credit Suisse. AJ, your line is now open. Please proceed. AJ Rice : Thanks, hi everybody. I know Karen teed it up and you mentioned it a couple times, Shawn, taking into account changing consumer backdrop and then the MA uncertainty. Just on that, it sounds like on the consumer changing, you\u2019re signaling about the cough, cold and flu being somewhat soft, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s related to the economy. Are you specifically seeing something that\u2019s impacting your business from the consumer at this point in the retail side, or are you just anticipating that? Then on the MA, obviously you gave guidance on the benefits in the back half of the year, MLR, but what is your thinking about how some of the things you\u2019re seeing might impact Oak Street, and can you comment on your \u201924 bids and whether they incorporate some caution around utilization? Karen Lynch : Hey AJ. A couple of things on consumer, and I\u2019ll ask Michelle to talk a little bit. But as we saw June kind of emerge and predicting for this economic volatility and a potential recession, we saw a little bit of pull-back in consumer behavior in June, so we are reflecting that in our forward-looking approach. I can have Michelle talk a little bit about what we saw and then I\u2019ll turn it back to Shawn to talk about the numbers. Michelle Peluso : Yes, and just above on Karen\u2019s point, we had another solid quarter. It was a market share gain quarter again for the front store. We saw stronger household penetration and historically high net promoter scores, so I think out of an abundance of caution, we\u2019re just looking at slightly softening consumer demand in the back part of the quarter, along with comping historically high cough, cold and flu. I will say though, of course, the strength is coming from the investments we\u2019re making in omnichannel and our merch mix and service and simplifying pricing and promotion. We\u2019re right-sizing our cost structure with our store footprint, our distribution footprint, improving inventory turns, and we\u2019re really excited and [indiscernible] about the work we\u2019re doing with Oak Street Health and Signify to introduce more seniors and more Medicare-eligible customers to the great offerings that Signify and Oak Street Health have in the community. Shawn Guertin : There\u2019s a lot there, AJ, in your question, so let me try to cover the ground as thoroughly as I can, and I will have both Dan and Mike actually talk about respectively what we saw in Aetna and HCB. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, RMBR was up 350 basis points year-over-year. It\u2019s really important to look at and recall that last quarter, we said that we expected Q2 MBR to be up year-over-year. One of the main drivers in that is we printed 82.7 last year in the second quarter, so there\u2019s a lot to do here with the starting point. Having said that and allowing for that, Q2 did end up coming in higher than we expected, and the real driver here is Medicare Advantage. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that Medicare is more than 50% of our premium revenue now. As I stated, I want to be clear that commercial, Medicaid and exchange all performed consistent or even slightly better than our expectations in the quarter, but as we closed the month of May, in mid-June it became apparent that the Medicare costs were higher than we had anticipated in Q1, and that pressure was continuing into the second quarter. The real driver remains the outpatient categories that we and others have been discussing. Let me have Dan talk a little bit about what we saw in Aetna and I\u2019ll have Mike follow that up with what we saw in Oak Street, and then I\u2019ll come back and talk a little bit about how we\u2019ve prepared our guidance for \u201923 and \u201924 in light of this. Dan Finke : Yes, thanks Shawn. I think it\u2019s important to note that our commercial and Medicaid lines of business were largely in line with expectations, and as reported more broadly in the industry, we did experience higher than anticipated outpatient utilization in Medicare. This is likely due to some of these services that have been postponed by our seniors not feeling comfortable accessing the healthcare system during the pandemic. You can think about this as outpatient orthopedic procedures, hips and knees, some cardiac procedures, a little bit of increase in dental, and we\u2019re still seeing some continued levels of elevated mental health use. Again, specific to Medicare and outpatient services, our inpatient volumes remain lower than our normalized levels, and that\u2019s the same across all lines of business, so it\u2019s something we\u2019re closely watching. Mike Pykosz : From an Oak Street perspective, we\u2019ve seen similar trends on medical costs with outpatient being up across our payor partners. Specifically, though, we\u2019ve had a really strong start to the year on [indiscernible] execution at Oak Street, and so we\u2019ve been able to largely offset the increased outpatient costs through a roughly 4% reduction year-over-year in admissions per thousand, so we\u2019re able to offset the increase in outpatient with continued strong performance in keeping our patients out of the hospital and decreasing inpatients. Shawn Guertin : Great, so turning back to \u201923 first, as I mentioned, Medicare did come in probably about 220 basis points worse than expected for the quarter. Given the way costs have emerged, it\u2019s more instructive to look, I think, at the first half of the year, which is off 100, 110 basis points versus our guidance expectation.  As Dan mentioned, there are aspects that some of this could be from a pent-up demand bubble involving discretionary and deferrable services, which if true, would potentially its course and lessen over time, and some preliminary July data does show some of that improvement. However, at this stage in the absence of any compelling evidence to the contrary, we think it\u2019s appropriate to be cautious in our outlook and have assumed that the 100 basis points of pressure observed in the first half of \u201923 persists through the second half of the year. The result of this is what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that the HCB MBR would be up about 50 basis points at the high end of our guidance range. In terms of 2024, 2024 will come down to two things : where does the 2023 year settle out, which serves as the baseline to go into 2024, and then what level of trend do we experience off that baseline. Our 2024 MA bid did contemplate a degree of higher utilization, but if trends persist at the levels we\u2019ve experienced in the first half as contemplated in our current guidance, we will have already consumed that higher utilization assumption. If a higher level of medical cost trend then persists again in \u201924 or, said differently, if we don\u2019t see an abatement in medical cost trend, we would then be pressured on our bid assumptions. In the absence of a clear indicator that utilization is abating and out of an abundance of caution, our revised 2024 guidance assumes that we have an incremental headwind in 2024 over our revised 2023 guidance baseline. To the extent utilization does abate and costs develop more favorably in 2023 than we project, that could serve as upside to our outlook for both 2023 and 2024. AJ Rice : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Gill from JP Morgan. Lisa, your line is now open. Please proceed. Lisa Gill : Great, thanks very much, and good morning. First, Shawn, I want to say thank you for revising 2024 - I think that that\u2019s a very realistic expectation and I like the words of potential upside. With that said, let me move to my question, and that\u2019s really around GLP1s. As I think about the different components of the business, I heard you and Dan both talk about the fact that commercial was in line, but just given the strength of what you\u2019re seeing on your pharmacy side of your business, is there not any impact on the medical side of your business due to GLP1s, and then secondly, as we think about both GLP1s, biosimilars, the strength in the Rx services component of the business, can you maybe just walk through what some of those components are? Are we starting to see more rebating activity around GLP1s? I know Karen had made a comment around programs around obesity and diabetes. If you can talk anything around that as to how we think about that going forward and the pharmacy services business, and then just lastly on the pharmacy services business, any incremental comments on how to think about the \u201924 selling season and how that went? Karen Lynch : Hi Lisa, it\u2019s Karen, and I\u2019ll start and hand it over to David Joyner and the rest of the team here. As you mentioned, we have seen, consistent with the industry, higher levels of utilization in GLP1 drugs across each of our businesses. In HCB, what we saw was that--you know, we have seen increased utilization but we feel like we have priced appropriately for it, and so we feel like the risk is manageable in that business. As you look at the pharmacy services business, we believe this is going to be a competitive category for us over time, and quite frankly is the reason why, as you know, PBMs exist. We have the opportunity to create competitiveness, provide lowest net cost, give additional programs like the programs I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Also, what we\u2019re seeing in the PCW business is it is generating very strong revenue there, but as you know with branded drugs, there is not a lot of margin with those kinds of drugs, so kind of overall, each of the businesses kind of have GLP1 in them and they are impacting them in a variety of different ways. But I would just re-emphasize the importance of the PBM and how we will continue to drive lowest net cost, and this is a perfect category to do that in. Let me turn it over to David to talk about what he\u2019s seeing on growth in the pharmacy services business and the selling season. David Joyner : Sure. Lisa, this is David, and thanks for the question.  As we look forward into 2024, we obviously have the headwinds of the partial termination of Centene, and obviously we\u2019re working close with the orderly transition of both the Medicare and Medicaid lines of business. As a result of Centene, our health plan business will be down year-over-year as we continue to focus on pricing discipline for both prospective customers and renewing our in-force customers.  As I look at 2024 net new business and the pipeline, it\u2019s definitely weighted more towards the employer business this year, and we\u2019ve had a particularly strong year in the national employer accounts as we won close to 60% of the clients that have changed PBMs for \u201924. We\u2019ve seen success with enterprise accounts as well, where we share common customers with Aetna. We continue to believe we offer the best PBM operating model in both cost of goods and service levels in the industry, and are confident in our long range growth outlook as we wrap up the 2024 selling season and turn our focus towards growing in 2025 and beyond. Finally, I would just suggest we continue to focus on leveraging our full suite of CVS Health assets, including the most recent value-based care acquisitions of both Signify and Oak Street, as we continue to offer a differentiated value prop in the multi-payor marketplace. Karen Lynch : [Indiscernible] talk about the biosimilars [indiscernible], another one of her questions. David Joyner : Sure, it was a multi-faceted question. Let me just add on the biosimilars, because we obviously have not announced our position for the coming year. But that said, we\u2019ve had a very thoughtful and planned approach to the Humira biosimilar launch, and it\u2019s been planned for several years now, so as a result, our customers have already benefited from the competition and with the much lower spend in the category.  As we prepared for the formulary launch, we\u2019re committed to the same lowest net cost strategy that we employ across our formulary and will be using the additional competition to create even more value for our customers and members.  I\u2019d like to offer two additional points. The first is we have a unique track record in the biosimilar-like market, so as you recall several years ago, where we removed Lantus from our formulary and added a lower list price biosimilar-like product, called Basaglar, we were able to convert 97% of the volume and delivered more than 21% savings to our customers. While we haven\u2019t announced our formulary strategy yet, we took a similar approach in the hep-C category by announcing last and was also able to deliver the lowest net cost and the most innovative solution for our customers. Not only will we continue to provide our clients and members optionality, we\u2019re also ensuring that we\u2019re providing the lowest net cost options and that our selective strategy helps our clients truly realize the savings.  Bottom line, and this speaks to the broader biosimilar marketplace, we\u2019re committed to establishing a viable and durable biosimilar market and believe we\u2019re well positioned to deliver innovation in the AI class, and we look forward to providing more clarity around Humira in the coming weeks. Lisa Gill : Great, thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Michael, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Good morning and thanks for all the details so far. Maybe if I can just dive in a little bit more on Medicare Advantage and the exchange business relative to the long term outlook. Shawn, obviously not looking for anything beyond what you gave on the color, but the build includes clearly your work and your investments in STARs, your work and your investments in the exchange business. Can you just give us a broad-based update on those two sides, on where things are progressing, and especially as we head into the fall, how you think about that push and pull dynamic relative to positioning for STARs for fiscal \u201925? Karen Lynch : Yes Michael, let me start on STARs and Shawn can fill in the details on the numbers. As you know, we had made significant efforts and had made significant investments in making progress in our STARs performance. We\u2019ve been very focused on our remediation efforts, our contract diversification strategy is well underway, and all of our internal indicators are positive and show progress. But having said that, having this by such a narrow margin last year, I think we all recognize that it all comes down to the CMS coupling, so we\u2019ll know better in October but our internal measures are positive from how we measure it. Shawn Guertin : Michael, on exchanges, we\u2019re another quarter in and things are still looking positive, and as I mentioned, we continue to be cautious in our outlook in terms of what we\u2019re planning on that from this year. But both the revenue and the utilization side have been in line with our expectations, and so I think that that really is something to think about as an opportunity for the future. We have a million member book now, probably something like $5 billion in revenue potentially this year, and it\u2019s not making a meaningful contribution. One of the benefits of getting to scale so quickly is, I think, we can now turn towards at least getting some contribution of profitability from that business, and that would be our plan for 2024 and beyond, that that would begin to be a profit contributor for us, so I do think it\u2019s one of the growth levers that we have. Michael Cherny : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Justin, your line is now open. Please proceed. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. A couple questions.  First, just on the MLR, Shawn, maybe you could give us a little more color in terms of, at least relative to our estimates and consensus, it looked like you missed the quarter by 150, 175 basis points, yet you\u2019re raising guidance by 50. There might have been some intra-year development, I know the quarter had some prior year in it as well, so just trying to kind of isolate what\u2019s going on there, if you can help us with some of that bridge, I\u2019d appreciate it. Then on the guidance change, by my math, your $500, $800 million of OI, can you give us some increase clarity on where you\u2019re seeing that, for instance how much of that is tied to MA assumption versus where you would typically be, etc. If you can break that apart for us as well, that\u2019d be helpful. Thanks. Shawn Guertin : Yes, there\u2019s a few pieces going on in the quarter that are worth calling out. I did mention one - obviously, we had Medicaid pass-throughs, that sort of has pushed on the MBR a bit in the quarter. We actually did have unfavorable PYD this quarter, so we recognized that in the quarter - that\u2019s sort of pushing the number. But the biggest--you know, the biggest thing that\u2019s driving our guidance increase for the year is the change in outlook on our Medicare MBR, and that, like I said, for the quarter is probably off a little more than 200 basis points and I think it\u2019s more instructive, as I mentioned, to look at that for the first half, and that\u2019s largely what we\u2019ve assumed. If you look at HCB going down about $400 million of adjusted operating income, obviously there\u2019s other moving parts under the surface, but most of that\u2019s the 50 basis points on the overall HCB MBR. Again, the other lines of business are largely in line, if not even a little better, than our expectations on HCB. Offsetting that, obviously, was our increase in the health services segment driven by pharmacy services - that is about $500 million better, and again that is driven by sound fundamental performance that Karen and David discussed. You\u2019ll recall that we did talk about the underlying pharmacy services performance in Q1 was strong, and we\u2019ve now carried that strong first half performance for the full year. As was mentioned earlier in response to the question, we have decreased our outlook on PCW by about $100 million, considering the impacts we observed towards the end of the second quarter - you know, softening consumer demand in particular we talked about, so those are the moving pieces. Inside overall AOI is pretty much flat to where we were, but those are the moving pieces under the covers. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Kevin, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks. Shawn, I think you mentioned that you planned on opening more Oak Street clinics than originally planned, but I got a sense that that was also an incremental headwind. Does that mean that you\u2019ll be using less off-balance sheet, or you had talked about potentially if you increase using off-balance sheet metrics to do so, is that still the case or has that changed? Shawn Guertin : Yes, so I do want to talk about that. You\u2019re correct in your assessment. Obviously this is a very important and strategic investment in our future that we\u2019re making, and we continue to believe that there\u2019s high demand for more access to the differentiated Oak Street care model. Our analysis has consistently shown that accelerated clinic growth is the right thing to do in terms of optimizing the long term returns on this investment and expanding access for at-risk populations, and as Karen mentioned, we\u2019re going to do so in 2024, targeting 50 to 60 clinics, and Oak Street will and already is working closely with their payor partners in identifying the key geographies. As you mentioned, our updated outlook for 2024 includes the full impact of this accelerated expansion without the benefit of any structured transaction. We are still evaluating the details and the merits of such a transaction and we\u2019ll update you if anything definitive and material develops on that front. Karen Lynch : Kevin, I just want to make a couple comments on Oak Street. We\u2019ve made significant progress already, having closed not that long ago, on driving patient growth and really leveraging the overall assets of the entire enterprise. We\u2019re using Signify to use the--recommend if people don\u2019t have a primary care to Oak Street, we\u2019re helping Aetna Medicare members that don\u2019t have a primary care and recommending them to Oak Street. We\u2019re using connections in our pharmacy as well, so I\u2019m really encouraged by the opportunity and the growth, and really excited about what we\u2019ve seen. We have more conviction now that the meaningful value that we thought we could unlock will surface over the course of the next couple years. Kevin Caliendo : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Nathan, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Great, good morning, and thanks for the question. Shawn, on the restructuring program, could you maybe talk about how much of the savings are in the \u201923 guidance, and do you see the full run rate for 2024? Then on the new 2024 guidance, you mentioned a number of buckets that drove the guidance revision - the higher utilization, reduced outlook for retail given the macro environment, I think COVID and Oak Street were the other two. Could you maybe just help us think about the magnitude across each of those major buckets in terms of what drove the guidance revision? Shawn Guertin : Yes, sure. On the restructuring charge, there\u2019s the timing of all of this that will have minimal impact the actions we take on 2023, to the extent there is any impact. We\u2019ve thought that through in our reaffirmation of guidance. But really, this was a major step forward in delivering the $700 million to $800 million of G&A savings that we talked about in May, and the job OMs alone, as we mentioned, contributed probably close to $600 million of that benefit, but there\u2019s other things we\u2019ve done in terms of shutting down projects. Obviously there\u2019s been open positions we\u2019re not going to hire for as well, and so we have a high degree of visibility into getting the effect that we committed to for 2024. On 2024 guidance, you\u2019re correct - there are really, I would say, three kind of performance items, some of which have a lot to do with the external environment, and then obviously the one decision. The positive item, obviously, is we do expect some of the outperformance in pharmacy services that we\u2019re experiencing in 2023 will pull through favorably into our 2024 performance. I would note that not all this favorability will pull through as it will naturally work its way into client pricing as contracts reset in 2024, so you can see the magnitude of our increase for this year, it\u2019s obviously not that much because we\u2019re not going to pull all that through, but it\u2019s a meaningful positive item for next year. Similarly, I think on the headwind side, the largest provision we\u2019ve made in our guidance has to do with the Medicare Advantage performance. We\u2019ve sort of sized the impact of that for this year and have made provision for potential headwind on that, so I think you can kind of get in the neighborhood there, that would be the biggest other one. Then the other one is in PCW, we\u2019ve made some provision for the softening consumer demand to persist into next year, as well as potentially more decline in COVID for next year - we have factored that into our guidance, and as I was mentioning on the previous question, we\u2019ve built in the full effect of the Oak Street acceleration as well. Obviously that\u2019s a choice we\u2019re making in an investment in the future. Karen Lynch : Nathan, just to comment, I want to be very clear that we took a very thoughtful and careful approach to this restructuring. We were very deliberate in making sure that we had non-customer facing roles and that we weren\u2019t taking any action that would risk the execution of our long term strategy. Shawn Guertin : Yes, and just one housekeeping thing in that, again as always, we\u2019re removed the PYD that\u2019s close to a nickel, probably, where we are on a year-to-date basis, and so we\u2019ve taken that out as well for 2024. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Josh, your line is now open. Please proceed. Josh Raskin : Great, thanks for squeezing me in here, and good morning. How are you thinking about the operating income contributions from Oak Street and Signify - I assume those are different directions in 2024, and specifically in light of the risk change--risk model changes, I would assume there could be some benefit in Signify, some headwind for Oak Street. If you could also maybe size the impact to the risk model changes on the MA segment in the Aetna business in reimbursement, that would be helpful too. Shawn Guertin : Yes, I can talk a little bit about the segment, and then I can have Mike talk a little bit and Dan talk a little bit about the changes for 2024. It\u2019s an important question because as part of our strategy that we\u2019ve talked about, the growth in the earnings from these two assets is an important part of increasing our long term earnings growth rate, and we do expect to have a meaningful contribution of earnings improvement from these two assets from their base in 2023 into 2024, and everything we\u2019ve seen in our first quarter of ownership, I think has been consistent with that, and I think we\u2019re even more--have stronger conviction about the value that we can bring, so they will be a positive contributor in our estimation of earnings growth in 2024. I\u2019ll turn it to Mike and Dan to talk a little bit about the risk model and the changes for 2024. Dan Finke : Yes, on the HCB side, I would think about it in this way. First of all, the model\u2019s being phased in over time. We were pleased with that decision. Our modeling overall was very similar in the aggregate to the modeling of CMS, and frankly with our size of book, it allows us to really manage the impact over time, so minimal impact to HCB. Mike Pykosz : From Oak Street\u2019s perspective, I think the thing to remember is a lot of the changes in the risk model changes were driven by less specific codes being replaced by more specific codes, so you\u2019ll have less documentation codes with a lower coefficient on a high number of patients and higher coefficient codes on a lower number of patients. The impact is going to be net of those changes, right, not the gross impact of that, and one of the advantages of Oak Street is we have the same operating model and the same technology in all of our centers, so it allows us to react faster to those types of changes and we are already implementing new protocols, new clinical guidelines, etc. to be aware of that I\u2019d really like to point out, Oak Street has been very successful across programs with different risk-adjusted methodologies. We were part of the Medicare shared savings program and we were a top 1% performer in that. We are the top performer in the ACO REACH program, and those have different risk-adjusted methodologies, CAF, etc., so this just goes to the fact that if you\u2019re doing a great job taking care of people and keeping them out of the hospital and lowering medical costs, that will be durable across any risk-adjusted methodologies, so we\u2019re pretty confident in our ability to keep generating great results going forward. Dan Finke : Yes, and just from a Signify standpoint, it\u2019s absolutely been a tailwind for us. Our clients and partners team up with us because we help manage this industry change for them. We stay ahead of the risk model changes, we help build new things into the Signify in-home business. We\u2019ve seen a surge in demand for additional diagnostic and preventative testing work. It\u2019s an opportunity for us to expand into more follow-on care, so we\u2019re actually very excited about it. It\u2019s also been a nice touch point for us as we\u2019ve integrated into the retail and pharmacy businesses at CVS. Managing medication inside the home is a huge unlock for us, and so we\u2019ve been bringing in a deeper consumer engagement model with our partners inside the retail space and in pharmacy, and we\u2019ve seen really great results with the kickoff there with that Aetna membership. Shawn Guertin : I would just quickly re-emphasize one thing Mike said in his. The ability to have a common care model on a common technology platform and the ability to operationalize this should not be underestimated, and in our view, that was a differentiating characteristic about their model. But that is a very important point in my opinion that Mike made there. Josh Raskin : Makes sense, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore. Elizabeth, your line is now open. Please proceed.  Elizabeth, your line is now open. Please proceed. You might want to check if your microphone is muted. Karen Lynch : Bruno, she might have dropped. Let me just wrap it up here by thanking our colleagues for their commitment and dedication that they show every single day, supporting our customers, our clients and our patients. As we demonstrated today, we continue to execute on our bold goals and deliver outstanding performance despite the challenging environment that we\u2019re in, and I really believe and I know the team believes that this is a testament to our consistently strong execution and our resilient business model and gives us the confidence that we can continue our momentum throughout 2023 and 2024. Thanks for joining the call today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand the floor to Larry McGrath to begin. So Larry, please go ahead when you are ready. Larry McGrath : Good morning, and welcome to the CVS Health third quarter 2023 earnings call and webcast. I'm Larry McGrath, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations for CVS Health. I'm joined this morning by Karen Lynch, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Cowhey, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Following. Following our prepared remarks, we'll host a question-and-answer session that will include additional members of our leadership team. Our press release and slide presentation are being posted to our website, along with our Form 10-Q that we filed this morning with the SEC. Today's call is also being broadcast on our website, where it will be archived for one year. During this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently projected results. We strongly encourage you to review the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties. In particular, those that are described in the cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements and risk factors in our most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, the most recent of which was filed this morning and our recent filings on Form 8-K, including this morning's earnings press release. During this call, we will use non-GAAP measures when talking about the company's financial performance and financial condition and you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in this morning's press release and then the reconciliation document posted to our Investor Relations portion of our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Karen. Karen? Karen Lynch : Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Today, we reported strong third quarter results, highlighting the power of our diversified business model. We delivered adjusted EPS of $2.21 and adjusted operating income of nearly $4.5 billion. Our consolidated revenues for the quarter of almost $90 billion reflect an increase of nearly 11% over the prior year. And once again, we generated outstanding operating cash flows, bringing our year-to-date total to $16.1 billion. We are reconfirming our guidance range for 2023 adjusted EPS of $8.50 to $8.70, this reflects execution against our strategy with strong performance in our Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment and continued momentum in our Health Services segment, offsetting incremental Medicare Advantage medical cost pressures in our Health Care Benefits segment. The power of our integrated model is clear. We demonstrated this with the significant progress made in restoring our Medicare Advantage Star ratings. Our 2024 rating show that we will have 87% of our Medicare Advantage members and plans rated 4 stars or better. We accomplished this in a very short period of time by utilizing the full breadth of CVS Health touch point with our members. We improved CAP stores by an average of two-thirds of a point by driving powerful consumer insights to design experiences that address the unique needs of our members. We also made improvements beyond CAP. For example, to address HEDIS and patient safety measures, our Medicare Advantage team worked closely with CVS Pharmacy and Caremark to help members improve medication adherence, remove costs and transportation barriers and ensure members completed critical tests, screenings and preventive services. As a result of these efforts, among many others, Aetna was the top performer in both the Part D patient safety and HEDIS domain. Our 2024 Star ratings will improve our position in the '25 plan year and will enhance our position well into the future. Medicare Advantage is a key strategic growth area for our business. While it's still early in the 2024 annual enrollment period, we are confident that our competitive offering and attractive benefit design will meet consumer expectations. Aetna continues to be a leader in zero-dollar premium product and approximately 84% of Medicare eligibles will have access to Aetna plans in this category in 2024. We are also expanding the breadth of our D-SNP footprint and now cover more than two-thirds of Medicare eligibles, up 6% from last year. Our D-SNP strategy focuses on offering the coordinated medical management these members need to live healthier life, including introducing them to care delivery options such as Oak Street Health, where appropriate. Our ability to offer access to convenient sites of care and the integrated benefits that seniors value most will position us to grow at or above the market in 2024. Turning now to how we are unlocking sources of value in health care. This quarter we announced the creation of Cordavis, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CVS Health. We have an established history of innovating to find ways to lower drug spend and to ensure that people we serve have access to the medications they need to stay healthy. Cordavis continues that history of innovation, the biosimilar market in the U.S. is expected to be a $100 billion opportunity by 2029. It represents one of the biggest sources of drug cost savings for consumers and the U.S. health care system. Through Cordavis, we are working directly with manufacturers to bring a portfolio of biosimilar products to the market driving our growth and ensuring that our customers and clients will realize the significant savings potential available through biosimilars for years to come. Let's turn to our performance in the quarter. In our Health Care Benefits segment, we grew revenues to more than $26 billion, an increase of nearly 17% and delivered adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion. Medical membership in the third quarter grew to 25.7 million, an increase of 1.4 million members versus the prior year, reflecting growth across multiple product lines, including individual exchange, Medicare and commercial. We continue to experience elevated utilization trends in our Medicare Advantage business, primarily in outpatient and supplemental benefits such as dental, behavioral health, OTC and flex card. Given the elevated cost trends that have emerged this year, we are executing on plans to unlock additional revenue, clinical and network opportunities to help alleviate these pressures. In our Health Services segment, revenues grew to near $47 billion, an increase of more than 8%. Adjusted operating income grew nearly 11% to $1.9 billion. These results once again reflect impressive performance in our Pharmacy Services business, where our commitment to lower drug costs and deliver innovative clinical solutions drive value for our consumers and our clients. In the 2024 selling season, our renewals are substantially complete and our retention remains strong in the high 90s, excluding the Centene contract. Our sales strategy for new business has been successful capturing over 60% of national employers that moved PBM. Turning to our care delivery assets. We are scaling capabilities to accelerate growth at both Signify and Oak Street. We are progressing on our initiatives to create integrated health experiences across multiple channels, including Aetna, Signify, CVS Retail Health and CVS Pharmacy. For Oak Street Health, we are using these channels to educate Medicare eligible adults about the health services they need and can receive in our primary care clinic. While it's still early, the results of these initiatives are encouraging, and we are excited to share more details at our Investor Day in December. For Signify Health, we are connecting more CVS Pharmacy patients to Signify for in-home evaluation and other services in the home. Our trusted relationship with 90 million patients at the pharmacy counter is a powerful connection and the most frequent engagement in health care. By utilizing our pharmacist connection, we have been able to reach more than 50% of Aetna members that Signify was previously unable to reach, enhancing the opportunity to more effectively engage these members in their care. This initiative has surpassed our initial conversion rate goals, and we are excited by the prospects of scaling our capabilities in 2024 and beyond. Turning to our Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment. Revenues grew to nearly $29 billion, up 6% versus the prior year. We generated $1.4 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter in line with our results in the prior year. Performance in our retail pharmacy business was strong. Same-store pharmacy sales increased nearly 12% versus the prior year, primarily driven by pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation. Same-store prescription growth when excluding the impact of COVID grew by 3.5%. Turning to our consumer engagement strategy. Our digital [Technical Difficulty] nearly 12% versus the prior year, primarily driven by pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation. Same-store prescription growth when excluding the impact of COVID grew by 3.5%. Turning to our consumer engagement strategy. Our digital platform is helping consumers navigate and simplify their health journey. Our digital reach continues to grow with now over 55 million unique customers an increase of nearly 20% versus last year. This strong growth has been powered by our focus on innovating and delivering on experiences that matter most for our customers. We have been removing barriers to digital adoption and making it easier for customers to access the services they seek such as pharmacy refills and advanced scheduling for immunizations online. Our strong digital engagement and enhanced capabilities will strengthen our ability to drive seasonal flu, COVID, an RFD immunization awareness and connect patients to our CVS locations for these important health services. Before I turn it over to Tom to discuss our financial results, I'd like to highlight some recent changes to our leadership team. As we previously announced, I would like to welcome Brian Kane as our new President of Aetna. Brian's extensive industry experience will be critical as he and his team worked to deliver consumer-centric, holistic health care to the more than 35 million members served by Aetna. In mid-October, we also announced that Shawn Guertin, our Chief Financial Officer and President of the Health Services business is taking a leave of absence due to unforeseen family health reasons. Tom Cowhey has been appointed to the role of Interim CFO, and Mike Pykosz has assume the role Interim President of Health Services. Both Tom and Mike are well positioned to continue to seamlessly execute on our strategy. Finally, I would like to thank our colleagues for the commitment and dedication they show every day to support our customers, our clients and our patients. I will now turn the call over to Tom to provide more details on our results and our guidance. Tom? Tom Cowhey : Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the power of our execution and the value of our diversified enterprise. This quarter, we saw strength across key metrics such as revenue, adjusted earnings per share and cash flow from operations. A few total company highlights. Third quarter revenues of nearly $90 billion increased by double-digit percentages over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong growth across each of our businesses. We delivered adjusted operating income of nearly $4.5 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.21, representing growth of approximately 2% versus the prior year. These increases were primarily due to continued strong execution in our pharmacy services operations, partially offset by pressure in Health Care Benefits and the inclusion of Oak Street Health results. Our ability to generate cash remains outstanding with year-to-date cash flow from operations of $16.1 billion. Cash flows benefited from the timing of CMS payments that are expected to normalize in the fourth quarter. Excluding this impact, our year-to-date cash flows from operations remained strong at approximately $11 billion. Shifting to the details for our Health Care Benefits segment. We delivered strong revenue growth versus the prior year. Third quarter revenue of $26.3 billion increased nearly 17% year-over-year, reflecting growth across all product lines, but primarily attributable to Medicare and our individual exchange products. Membership grew to 25.7 million, an increase of 54,000 members sequentially, reflecting growth in our individual exchange and Medicare businesses, partially offset by the impact of Medicaid redeterminations. Adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion in the quarter declined approximately 6% versus the prior year. This decline was driven by a higher medical benefit ratio, partially offset by higher net investment income. Our Medical Benefit ratio of 85.7% increased 230 basis points from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting lower prior period development as well as higher Medicare Advantage utilization inside the quarter. Utilization pressure was primarily attributable to the categories Karen highlighted earlier, including outpatient and supplemental benefits such as dental, behavioral health, OTC and flex cards. Further, we also experienced individual exchange growth in the special enrollment period that exceeded our expectations. These members, particularly when added late in the year, will drive a higher MBR. As a result, our higher individual exchange growth is also contributing to our updated MBR guidance for the full year. We continue to closely watch utilization trends in our other lines of business. But at this stage, we have not observed any other trends that we would consider inconsistent with our total expectations. Days claims payable at the end of the quarter was 50.3, up 3.4 days sequentially and reserve growth exceeded premium growth sequentially. Overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. Our Health Services segment, which includes our Pharmacy Services business and our Health Services operations, generated revenue of approximately $47 billion, an increase of more than 8% year-over-year. This increase was driven by pharmacy drug mix, growth in specialty pharmacy, brand inflation and the addition of Signify and Oak Street. These increases were partially offset by the impact of continued client price improvements. Adjusted operating income of nearly $1.9 billion grew approximately 11% year-over-year primarily driven by strong execution and improved purchasing economics, partially offset by ongoing client price improvements. Total pharmacy claims processed in the quarter declined by less than 1% versus the prior year, and were only down 40 basis points when excluding COVID-19 vaccinations. This decline was primarily attributable to the New York Medicaid carve-out and lower COVID-19 vaccinations, partially offset by net new business. Total pharmacy membership remains steady at approximately 110 million members. We continue to be encouraged by the performance and growth of our Health Services assets. Signify completed 655,000 in-home evaluations in the quarter, an increase of 7% versus the same period last year and generated revenue growth of 21%. The Oak Street ended the quarter with 192 centers and 191,000 at-risk lives. We've grown by 31 centers versus the prior year quarter and are on track to open a total of 35 new centers this year, ramping to 50 to 60 centers in 2024. Oak Street also significantly increased revenue in the quarter, growing 44% compared to the same quarter last year. Oak Street's clinical model continues to demonstrate exceptional performance. Last week, CMS released the 2022 savings performance of all ACO REACH participants. Oak Street was among the top 5% of program participants, generating a meaningful gross savings rate of 21%. Moving to our Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment. We generated revenue of nearly $29 billion, up 6% versus the prior year, nearly 9% on a same-store basis, reflecting the impact of pharmacy drug mix, increased prescriptions and brand inflation. These revenue increases were partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure, the impact of recent generic introductions, a decrease in store count, and decreased COVID-19 related volume. Adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion was in line with the prior year, driven by continued reimbursement pressure and lower COVID contributions, largely offset by improved drug purchasing, increased prescription volumes and lower expenses. Same-store pharmacy sales were up nearly 12%, driven by drug mix, a 2.7% increase in same-store prescription volumes and brand inflation. The increase in same-store prescription volumes, excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations was 3.5%. As we continue to execute on our store closure initiative, having closed 564 out of 900 planned stores. We encourage investors to focus on same-store metrics to understand underlying growth. Our front store business continues to exhibit resiliency in the face of industry challenges, underscoring the value we offer consumers. Same-store sales for the front store were down 2.2%, primarily due to declines in cough, cold and flu and OTC test kits. Excluding the impact of OTC test kits, same-store front sales were in line with the prior year. Shifting to the balance sheet. Our liquidity and capital position remains excellent. Our ability to generate cash flow remains a core strength of our organization and the enterprise continues to identify new opportunities to further optimize our balance sheet. Through the third quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $16.1 billion, including the CMS prepayment I discussed earlier. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion of cash at the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries. This quarter, we returned $779 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings while preserving flexibility to deploy capital strategically. Turning now to our full year outlook for 2023. We are reaffirming our adjusted EPS of $8.50 to $8.70. This primarily reflects our performance through the third quarter and the continuation of higher Medicare Advantage medical cost trend for the remainder of 2023, offset by strength in our Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness and Health Services segments. In the Health Care Benefits segment, we now expect our 2023 medical benefit ratio to be approximately 86%, primarily driven by the previously mentioned impact of higher Medicare Advantage utilization as well as the impact of higher than expected individual exchange growth during the special enrollment period. As a result, we now expect adjusted operating income for the segment to be in a range of $5.63 billion to $5.76 billion. Our individual exchange business is expected to reduce adjusted operating earnings in 2023, largely a function of late year growth. However, this business is now poised to reach an annualized run rate of more than $6 billion of revenue, and we are well positioned to earn a positive margin in this business in 2024 based on specific actions our teams are implementing including pricing adjustments. In our Health Services segment, we are updating our adjusted operating income guidance to a range of $7.18 billion to $7.31 billion, reflecting the strong execution year-to-date in our Pharmacy Services business, and our expectation of continued strength for the remainder of the year. In our Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment, we now expect adjusted operating income in a range of $5.76 billion to $5.86 billion, primarily driven by higher contributions from seasonal immunizations, partially offset by lower-than-expected script volume, primarily attributable to Medicaid redeterminations. Shifting to our cash flow. Given our strong performance year-to-date, we now anticipate full year 2023 cash flow from operations to be at the upper end of our range of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion. Our expectation for capital expenditures is now $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. We are also updating our adjusted effective tax rate to 24.9% and our share count to 1.291 billion. You can find additional details on the components of our updated 2023 guidance on our Investor Relations web page. Before I conclude my prepared remarks, I want to give you an update on the headwinds and tailwinds for 2024, starting with the headwinds. As we previously discussed, the decline in our Star ratings for benefit year 2024 will pressure our Medicare Advantage margins. We now expect the impact to be closer to the low end of our previously communicated range of $800 million to $1 billion. We continue to expect the current level of elevated utilization in our Medicare Advantage book to persist and at an abundance of caution, are maintaining a provision for further utilization pressure in 2024. As previously discussed, contributions from Centene will decline as the contract ends on January 1, 2024. We expect a lower contribution in our PCW segment related to COVID, consumer softness and incremental labor investments, and we expect the 340B headwind from 2023 to annualize in 2024. Shifting to the tailwinds for 2024. We expect underlying growth in our core businesses. We now expect the savings from our previously announced actions and cost initiatives coming at the higher end of our guidance. We expect a positive contribution from the pricing of our individual exchange business as well as commercial pricing actions. We believe we have the opportunity to capture value from our newly created for Cordavis business. And we expect incremental contributions from our Health Services businesses, net of the impact from previously discussed clinic expansion. At this distance, based on the sum total of these headwinds and tailwinds, including the uncertainty created by our recent utilization trends, we believe it is prudent for investors to ground their expectations for 2024 adjusted EPS at the low end of our previously communicated preliminary guidance range of $8.50 to $8.70. At our Investor Day in December, we will provide detailed 2024 guidance and updated views on our long-term growth algorithm. To conclude, we remain focused on operational execution and sustainable growth as we advance our goal of becoming the leading health solutions company for consumers. We look forward to providing more detailed updates on our progress against our strategy in December. With that, we'll now open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Justin, your line is open. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Wanted to see, if we can get some more color on Medicare Advantage cost brand, specifically, what did you see through the quarter, what did you assume for these value cards versus what kind of was expected? And then can you talk about how you think the business is going to perform in 2024, right? It looks like you invested in benefits there. So, maybe you could just tell us where you think margins are this year, where you think they're going to be next year, and then hopefully, walk us through where -- how investors should think about improvement in 2025 and beyond to as you reprice this business and get your stars back, et cetera. Thanks. Tom Cowhey : Good morning, Justin. Thanks for the question. Bear with me, there's a lot to go through here. So, let me walk you through a couple of ways that we'd like you to think about 2024, really make sure that you understand what's happened in '23, and then I'll turn it over to Brian to talk about some of your other questions. So, you remember on our second quarter call, we discussed that we were seeing 100 bps to 110 bps of Medicare pressure in the first half. And that was driven by higher-than-expected utilization in outpatient and some supplemental benefits such as dental and behavioral health. We carried forward that pressure into the second half, resulting in an increase for the total company of about 50 bps to the total year MBR guide. We further indicated that we had captured a portion of the outreach -- outpatient trend pressure in our bids in 2024 and that the remaining pressure we did not incorporate was reflected in the 2024 guide. We also put a placeholder in for additional utilization in our 2024 preliminary guidance range. So, as you look then at the third quarter, we're experiencing higher utilization than we anticipated. The main driver of this pressure continues to be Medicare Advantage, but a less impactful notable driver is continued strong growth in the individual exchange product through the SEP. So, this SEP membership, particularly when it's added late in the year, carries a higher-than-average MBR. So, if you look specifically then at Medicare, we've continued to see elevated utilization in outpatient, including additional pressure in the second quarter. We've also seen incremental pressure in supplemental benefits in the third quarter, particularly dental, behavioral health, and OTC and flex cards. So, OTC and flex cards is a differentiator for our 2023 plan design, but it's also an important part of how we're planning to grow in 2024 and part of our bid strategy. The cards allot members a fixed amount of cash typically on a quarterly basis that they can use for OTC as well as food among other purchases. To date, we've seen meaningfully higher levels of utilization in the use of these cards than we had anticipated in our 2023 pricing and in our initial outlook. If you roll that forward to the full-year guide, we've raised the MBR by 75 basis points to 80 basis points. 10 basis points to 15 basis points is primarily related to the exchange product growth in the SEP and its impact on our MBR. The remaining 65 bps is related to Medicare Advantage where we presume that the elevated level of trend we observed in the third quarter persist into the fourth quarter, net of some revenue offsets that represents about $550 million of pressure in Medicare. It's important to note, though, as you look at our full-year guidance, reduction in HCB, there are about 250 million of favorable non-MBR items, which include things like net investment income, fees, and also expenses. And a portion of these tailwinds are expected to persist into 2024. So, as we think about how the MBR pressure in '23 then impacts '24, as I mentioned, our '24 MA bid contemplated higher MA utilization for outpatient and supplemental benefits, although the current experience exceeds the pricing provision. As it specifically relates to OTC and flex cards, we recognized how customers value this benefit that it would be an important part of how we were going to market in 2024 in the sale of our products. And therefore, we proactively assumed higher utilization in those cards, which is much more consistent with how 2023 has actually played out. Consequently, 25 bps of the incremental 65 bps of the pressure this quarter was contemplated in pricing on account of the OTC and flex cards, while the remaining 40 bps was not. So, as you think about that 40 bps of exposure, there's a couple of things that we think are offsets. First, as we progressed our stars mitigation and contract diversification efforts, we're now projecting the 2024 stars will be at the low -- the impact will be at the low end of our expectations, or about $800 million versus the prior midpoint expectation of $900 million. Second, we've repriced our individual exchange members as we get into to move forward towards our target margins in 2024. The incremental individual exchange membership coming through SEP actually provides upside opportunity in '24 as these members get properly documented for risk adjustment. Third, the net investment income tailwinds that we've seen will almost certainly persist in light of the current macro environment, which was not previously contemplated. And finally, we expect to achieve the high end of our enterprise cost reduction initiatives, which we previously talked about being $700 million to $800 million next year. All together, we believe these tailwinds can offset a meaningful portion of the incremental 2024 Medicare headwind. But we're encouraging investors to focus on the lower half of our '24 guidance range until we understand where trends are going to stabilize. It's worth noting, out of an abundance of caution, we preserve the excess 2024 Medicare utilization provision that we talked about in the second quarter inside our updated guidance range for 2024. Brian? Brian Kane : Thanks, Tom. Let me talk a little bit about the utilization just to build on what Tom was saying and then we can talk about the benefit design, and Justin, your question on margins. With respect to utilization, just to echo what Tom said, obviously, we've been through the bids in detail really to understand all the detailed utilization assumptions. And I would just say, after all -- everything is fully baked in, including the utilization breakage that Tom discussed, the guide, I believe, fully reflects what's in our pricing as well as utilization break. So, I feel good about where we are for the 2024 guide that Tom laid out. Just with respect to some other categories, I think it's important to say that none of the other service categories, besides the outpatient and some of the supplemental benefits that Tom went through, are showing any pressure in-patient is well-controlled, for example, as well as other service categories. On the individual side, I think it's important to mention what Tom did, which is to say, we did get more members in the SEP period than we anticipated, which actually, I think, is a good thing for 2024. And so, while it's creating some pressure in 2023 because they come in late in the year and you don't have the opportunity to document their conditions, between the pricing increases that we put through, as well as our risk adjustment processes that will really ramp up for 2024, it's actually a nice tailwind for 2024. Our commercial business also is doing well, our Group Commercial business and our Medicaid business. So, there's no other pressures there. This is really a Medicare story. And as I said, I think we're fully covered with our 2024 guide. Justin, with respect to your benefits question, it was important for us coming into 2024 to maintain benefits stability for our members in light of, obviously, the stars pressure that we faced. This is an important strategic priority for Medicare. It not only impacts our business on the Aetna side, but also has wide-ranging impacts across the enterprise. And so, this was a business that we are committed to, maintaining benefits stability and being thoughtful in some of the investments that we made. So, for example, on the D-SNP side, that's clearly an area where we leaned in. Our focus was on the flex cards. And as Tom said, these are cards that our members can use for food, OTC, utilities, etc. We believe this is an attractive benefit. But importantly, the assumptions we used for 2024 effectively assume full utilization. And so, there's just not a lot of incremental breakage that can occur in 2024 relative to the D-SNP population. I'd also remind you that our D-SNP population is largely HMO, and so they weren't impacted by the stars challenges that we've had for 2024. So, as you think about marginal contribution and where our benefit design is and our anticipation to grow that book, actually, we expect marginal profit contribution on new members for D-SNP, and so, actually view that as a positive. And on the general enrollment side, we're very targeted in our investments, and the investments we made tended to be in new plans as opposed to existing plans, which actually was a thoughtful way of really driving opportunities for growth without earning the entire book with incremental costs. So, again, I feel good about 2024 where we're positioned. And I would say, as Karen said in our opening remarks, feel very good about our ability to achieve at or above-market growth on the Medicare side. And then finally, on your margin question, I'm clearly we're way below where we need to be on 2024 margins, we understand that. Our expectation for 2025 is that we'll take significant ground against our margin targets. Obviously, we need to see where the rate notice comes out, what the competitive dynamic is. But you should expect 2025 for us to see incremental margin improvement, and hopefully, material improvement in that regard. Operator : The next question comes from Lisa Gill from J.P. Morgan. Lisa, please, go ahead. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Great. Thanks very much, and good morning. I want to focus on the healthcare services side of the business, and I really had a few questions here. One, when I think about Cordavis and I think about the opportunity around biosimilars, is there a way for you to maybe frame how big that opportunity is? Secondly, when we think about things like GLP-1, I would think that as being a positive for this business. Can you help us understand that? And then thirdly, there is expectation that there'll be some level of PBM, maybe a bill this year when we think about the reconciliation. Can you talk about what you're seeing right now and is that built into your expectations around your business for 2024? Karen Lynch : Hi, Lisa. Let me take a couple and then I'm going to ask Prem to talk about Cordavis and I'll ask the team to talk about GLP-1s. But just generally on the PBM bill, obviously, there's a lot of unrest going on in the legislative body of the U.S. We don't -- we may see something at the end of the year and the end of the -- in that reconciliation bill. Our best thinking now is that is transparency which we are fully aware of and have contemplated in, in our business. So -- but it remains to be seen what really will happen in that year-end reconciliation package. I think, there's a lot going on in Washington. So, it's unclear what will happen. Relative to Cordavis, we view that as a significant opportunity, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. This is an opportunity for us to bring a healthy biosimilar market to the U.S. so that we can really bring lower drug costs to our customers. Prem has been doing a lot on this opportunity, and I'll ask him to talk about kind of the magnitude of it. But we are excited and we are in a position to really have an impact. It is a $100 billion opportunity by 2029. So, we have the opportunity over the next few years to really make significant improvement in lowering drug costs, and obviously, in the performance of our company. And then relative to the GLP-1s, what I would say is that this is an area that has demonstrated and proven that we can see significant weight loss and improvement in health, but it comes at a very hefty price tag. And it is the reason why PBM exists, to really have the opportunity to reduce overall costs for GLP-1s. That's what we are very focused on doing by creating competitive environment. It is a significant -- it could cost U.S. a $1 trillion if every American that is considered obese, and that's about 70 million Americans, were prescribed these GLP-1s, that would put significant pressure on the U.S. healthcare system. So, it is imperative for us as a PBM to really reduce the overall cost of those drugs, and we're working very closely with our customers to do that. As you can imagine, our customers' top priority is really understanding the cost of GLP-1s and David will talk about that. But let me turn it over to Prem to talk about Cordavis. Prem Shah : Yeah. And just to add to what Karen said, Cordavis is an extremely exciting opportunity for us. And Lisa, you've been around the PBM industry for a long time. And if you think about the competition that was created in the early part of the 2010s as it relates to the generic pipeline, we view the balance of our pipeline as the competition for the specialty drugs. And if you think about the amount of pharmacy spend that's in specialty drugs, it's greater than 50% at this point. So, it's really important for us to be able to create that competition in biosimilars. And as I think about what Cordavis is really intended to do, it's going to work with manufacturers to bring these products into the U.S. pharmaceutical marketplace. One of the big, big pieces that we need to ensure is, what I'd say, is continuity of supply of these products in the marketplace. And that's one of the things that Cordavis will work for. So, our first product that we'll launch, as we mentioned earlier in the year, is going to be a contract with Sandoz to co-manufacture and commercialize Hyrimoz and its biosimilar product called Humira. And we'll be launching that in the first quarter of 2024. And recall, we mentioned that we are going to launch it at a list price that's greater than 80% lower than the current list price for Humira. So, again, it creates lower cost for consumers, better access, and affordability across the board. And as we look out into 2024 with Cordavis, we intend to have a full portfolio of products as we see other biosimilar competition coming in the specialty marketplace to facilitate the broader access with these products in the U.S. And I'll hand it over to Tom to talk about some of the questions on the financials on that. Tom Cowhey : Yeah. Thanks, Lisa. You asked about kind of the GLP-1 impact. But I think it's important to just talk about what the enterprise impact is there. And then David can talk some more about some of the specifics on how the PBM helps here and some of the challenges that our self-insured customers are facing. In Pharmacy Services, the GLP-1 is -- are a class of drugs that are uniquely suited to the value of the services what a PBM provides. And so, we do have a positive margin contribution from the GLP-1s in that segment. On the Aetna side, it's really about whether or not we captured utilization in our pricing. But most of that pricing is really capturing indications for diabetes, not for weight loss. For weight loss, that's really something that our self-insured customers making individual-wise decision on, or it's a buy-up for our insured book. And we believe that for 2023, we've appropriately priced that and we -- we're taking our latest thinking into our pricing for '24. On the flip side, branded products pressure margins in the PCW business, so the GLP-1s are generally a headwind to that business. Maybe David, you could provide a little bit more context on kind of the PBM impacts? David Joyner : Sure. Thanks, Tom. So, as Karen mentioned, the GLP-1s are certainly at the top of every client's list in terms of areas that they're concerned about going into '24 and beyond. Good news is that PBM actually plays a critically important role in managing this category of drugs. So, we really have three different ways in which we're trying to drive savings for our customers. The first is formulary, so we create competition. And obviously, as new entrants come into the market, it serves as an opportunity for us to continue to reduce the cost for our customers. Secondly, as utilization management, so focusing on the appropriate use of the medications, including off-label utilization. And then lastly, there is a significant investment being made in our advanced care management solutions, which is looking at the holistic view of the conditions in which we're treating, and it's essentially complementing the drug therapy and it's giving us an opportunity to focus on the underlying causes of the conditions. So, as we look at the results, at least year-to-date, you look at the combination of our formulary management in addition to the utilization management, we're saving nearly 70% of costs for our commercial clients. So, again, it's a great proof point that we've been able to take cost out of the system as we're looking obviously at this growing cost of medications. The area that I would say we're focused on in '24 is there is still a sizable percentage of our customers that have included obesity or weight loss. And it's an area that's probably growing 6x what the non- or the diabetic utilization is. And so, there is a big focus right now on the -- both the ROI as well as making sure as new competitors come into the market that we're using these opportunities to focus on reducing the unit pricing of the product and then more specifically focusing on the overall ROI for the services that it's delivering. Brian Kane : So, maybe if I could just pivot one minute on the Cordavis because I just -- I knew it was a three-part question, Lisa, and I know we're trying to answer it in a variety of different ways. But I think the Cordavis is a really important unique opportunity for us in the market. So, as Prem said, Cordavis is brought to market a low list price product as the PBM. We have a formulary that looks at both clinical efficacy as well as driving low net cost for our customers. The good news is, is that we -- when we have influence, we actually are moving to a product with the low list price, as Prem mentioned, 80% below the current list price of the brand, Humira. So, it does require a change in the market. So, if you look at our -- how we're looking at the opportunity going into '24, it's, can we move enough share in order to create value for our customers. In our models, we believe we can take 50% of the 2022 cost out for this category by moving aggressively to a low list price product. So, we have to then look at what gives us confidence that we can actually move the share. So, we've mentioned, obviously, in previous calls that we've had success with moving Lantus to Basaglar. We had 97%-plus conversion for that product back in -- many years ago. And if you look at one example, which is a client in Medicaid that has chosen to exclude the coverage of brand as Humira, we've been able to move upwards of 90% of the product by -- within the last 30 days. So, I think it's become a proof point that, one, we can actually move to low-cost biosimilars, we can actually reduce the cost of the category for our customers, and ultimately, make sure we're preserving the experience for our -- for the members. So, I think, again, we're pretty bullish on our opportunity of changing the marketplace and capitalizing on bringing new innovative therapies to market. Lisa Gill : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Nathan, your line is open. Please, go ahead. Nathan Rich : Great. Thanks so much for the questions. It sounds like Oak Street is kind of scaling in line to maybe a bit better than your expectations. I guess, could you maybe just update us on how you're thinking about the incremental platform contribution next year? And what you see as the kind of biggest opportunities for practices in terms of how they need to adapt just given the tougher rate environment that we're going to be in for Medicare next year? And from a capital deployment standpoint, can you talk about your appetite for additional M&A from a care delivery standpoint? Is that something that you're looking at currently, or do you need to kind of allow the existing kind of assets to mature more before you'd look to build further? David Joyner : Yeah. Maybe I'll start on the operational priorities and turn it over to Tom on the financials. The biggest thing for us is keep focusing on what we do best, which is keep our patients healthy out of the hospital. We know if we apply our care model, we'll do that, and we have the proof points whether it's the Medicare Shared Savings Program, a couple years ago, we were top 1% performer, whether it's the ACO REACH program which has risk score caps, or whether it's an MA that we can create a lot of value by keeping our patients healthy and then capturing that savings. And so, that's the biggest focus at Oak Street is running our care model, running it well, running it every day, running at every center, and keeping that culture intact. And if we do that, we'll be in great shape. And I actually think that if you think about the medium or longer term, I think the changes in how they're doing risk adjustment will be a tailwind for us, because it's going to make sure that you're doing the right things to care for patients. And that's what's driving your business and if it's harder for others, I think that'll just further differentiate the Oak Street platform. So, that's our focus. Tom Cowhey : Thanks, Dave. As you as you think about the financial impact, and I think you're specifically referring to V28 on the risk model, which is something that we spent a tremendous amount of time thinking through and diligence, we think that there's a lot of opportunity here over the long term as we think about the ability of Oak Street, their people, their process, their technology, to really adapt to a changing regulatory environment. And so, we have a lot of confidence in their model. We have a lot of confidence in their ability to execute this. The issue as you think about this is really going to be what's the timing impact of this. They've eliminated a lot of more generic codes and they've added a lot of HCC indexes to more complicated codes where they think there is a higher correlation with costs. And so, we've got to both set the systems up to ensure that we're capturing the appropriate data to help not just think about what the gross impact is, but what the net impact is, and then we need to have the encounters happen to actually capture that data. And there's lots of other mitigants. I think as we looked at Oak Street, we're pretty comfortable that they're in a better shape than a lot of other participants in the industry. But because of kind of the timing of the implementation of these changes, it is only a third phased in next year, but we think we'll probably have about a 2% revenue impact. But we actually think that, that gap will shrink over time even as V28 is more fully implemented. And so -- and all of that is captured within our preliminary guidance range. Overall, we actually feel really good about Oak Street's model, its ability to deliver exceptional care. I think the ACO REACH results is just another great example of how their model is differentiated versus what else is out in the marketplace. And so, we feel really great about the long-term prospects, which is why we've actually doubled down and we're going to grow 50 to 60 centers next year and probably accelerate after that as we look to expand that footprint more aggressively. You asked also about capital in M&A. I think we've done a lot of acquisitions this year. I mean, our focus in the near term is really on execution, execution in growing those businesses which are well on track for '23, and execution in continuing to drive synergies and growth. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Kevin, your line is open. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Just as -- I go on to the retail segment a little bit. The pharmacy growth still remains elevated. Love to hear the competitive dynamics driving that, if there's anything in particular? And then also exactly how much the increased vaccine is contributing to the change in retail this year and what you expect for next year? You called out a couple of the headwinds and tailwinds broadly, but specifically just for the retail segment, how should we think about any micro headwinds and tailwinds within that segment for '24? Thanks. Tom Cowhey : Sure. Why don't I start and then Prem can give you a little bit more color on kind of the competitive environment. You asked specifically about some of the tailwinds in that segment. I think there's two things that I'd call out. The first is just strengthen our immunization franchise and the second is I think that as you think -- as you look at where the consensus was for that business, I don't think that we're getting enough credit there for some of the actions that we took to restructure quorum last year and some of the benefits that would provide some of the store closures, which continue to ramp and some of the benefits that you're starting to see from that particularly as we've exceeded all of our goals on employee retention, but importantly, on script retention and also front store retention. So we've done really well and kudos to that team on the execution there. But as you think maybe about the immunization franchise, we did just under 8 million vaccines in the quarter. Flu represented probably about half of that total with COVID probably about a quarter, and the remainder is a variety of different vaccines, but also included the new RSV vaccine, which we saw a strong growth in. Performance across that book was quite good, and a lot of that actually has to do with some of the efforts of our trade team, which helped to really drive some of the strength in the quarter. We project that vaccines are probably going to peak early in the fourth quarter before declining in 2024, and that's primarily due to COVID softening versus part of the early part of '23 when the public health emergency was still in effect. As COVID moves into the endemic phase, our plan is that we're going to talk about the vaccine franchise more holistically and but we do think that there's going to be pressure there because COVID is going to wane. And I think as you think about next year, we've anticipated that the current level of performance is not going to persist partially because of COVID, partially because of the typical dynamics of just rate and reimbursement pressure but also about a little bit of a provision for consumer softness. Prem, maybe you could talk a little bit about -- more about kind of the script growth and underlying dynamics in the market. Prem Shah : Yeah, sure. Sure. Thanks. So our retail pharmacy business continues to be execute and deliver strong results across scripts service and our transformational initiatives. If you think about our same-store scripts, we grew 2.7%. And if you exclude COVID, we grew 3.5%. So continued strong momentum on script growth. On the service front, we continue to measure NPS, and our NPS year-to-date is about 40 basis points higher than prior year. So continue to have strong service. And we know that service is a primary reason to retain and grow scripts. And then lastly, I think the transformational initiatives that we're focused on, first and foremost, how do we lower our cost of goods and then also continue to think about our engagement with consumers through our innovative omnichannel strategies. And we continue to think about ways in which we can make the consumer experience easier. One of the things that we did during COVID was we did group scheduling as well as multi vaccine scheduling this year that had very good results for our consumers in the marketplace. Lastly, we continue to look at our operating model. We have to continue to invest in our colleagues and working to really scale, scale innovative technology solutions can make the pharmacy easier for our colleagues in our stores, and we continue to do that with some of the things that we're doing around sharing work across stores as well as some of the other model changes that we're doing in 2024. And lastly, it's incredibly important for us to continue to deliver payer value in terms of our clinical and value-based programs for consumers focused on things like our Stars rating. So we work very closely with our MA partners, including Aetna, on that to drive adherence and patient outcomes and be the number one national chain really across those measures. And really, what's really important is also leveraging our engagement in these stores to connect into our other businesses whether that's into our payer businesses or into Oak Street or into Signify to really streamline and make those consumer experiences better. As it relates to front store, we continue to grow share and help consumers what I would say is navigate the challenging market conditions through convenience and value in health and wellness products, and we've continued to see that business perform really well. If you exclude COVID OTC test kits, our front store same-store sales are about -- are flat, and we continue to grow drug share about 41 basis points even despite the softening traffic we've ever seen. Karen Lynch : Yeah. I just want to take this opportunity, Kevin, you talked about the competitive dynamics, and there's a lot of discussion around the labor market. And what I would say is that as a company, we are committed to providing the best place to work for all of our colleagues, including our pharmacists and our pharmacy techs. Over the last year or so, we've made a number of investments for our labor. By the end of the year, we'll have wage investments of over $1 billion. We continue to invest in our technology to support our teams in the field so that they can have streamlined workflows and smoother operations. We are committed and continue to hire. It's a tight labor market, but we've been having very good success in hiring. Our attrition numbers are stable. And we are actively developing new training programs as well for the ongoing development of our colleagues. But as I said at the top of -- the top here, we are committed to making sure that this is a powerful and -- we are an employer of choice. Kevin Caliendo : Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Eric, your line is open. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. I want to come back to the headwinds and tailwinds for Health Services in 2024. For '23 after we've seen pretty significant outperformance after that 340B headwind early in the year, and you've attributed this to sourcing specialty and drug mix, and I'm reading the letter as rebate outperformance on GLP-1 and biosimilar. The question one is, were sourcing benefits outside '23 versus '22 or the outlook for '24? And then question two is, do you expect that drug mix or rebates will be on par or better in '24 versus '23, given what we saw on biosimilar induction this year? And is Cordavis really a tailwind in '24 itself or is it as share shifts over time? Tom Cowhey : A couple of things in there, Eric. So let me start, and David can add any color commentary. Sourcing benefits, our trade teams are exceptional. They continue to execute every year. Some of the strength that we saw in the vaccine franchise as part of their efforts and some of -- planning some of their strategies to what we do more broadly. So I wouldn't say that there's anything exceptional or except for the fact that, that team is exceptional every day. Your point on drug mix and rebates, I think is spot on. GLP-1s are a category that particularly with enhanced competition is going to present an excellent opportunity for us to continue to drive lowest net cost. But the way that, that's developed this year has made some of our guarantees less onerous to hit. And as we think about Cordavis in 2024, we absolutely believe that there will be a benefit as we drive volume through that organization. Operator : Final question we have time for today is from Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Elizabeth, please go ahead. Your line is open. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I also wanted to return to some of the headwinds and tailwinds you talked about. I think previously for the HSS segment, I think you talked about sort of the poor AOI growth being like mid-single digits for 2024 and the assumptions that you put through. So I was wondering, if you still -- like given all those headwinds to tell that you're saying that would be sort of how you would still that business? And then secondarily, I hear what you're saying about some of the labor investment. How do we think about that on more of a like quantitative level in terms of '24 versus obviously some of the cost savings that you mentioned on the more corporate level? Thank you. Tom Cowhey : Yeah. There's -- Elizabeth. So, I think that as you think about core growth, I think that's probably the best way to start to think about this. So we do think that you should see mid-single-digit core growth out of the business. But then you've got some very specific items that kind of are pluses and minuses against that. So the first would be the loss of the Centene contract and that we've sized that for folks in the past or implicitly. But I think as you think about how well that business has performed this year, that number has become a little bit larger. We also, as we talked about, we have the annualization of 340B. And so both of those will help the pressure that -- and offset some of that core growth. Offsetting that, you are going to see incremental value from Cordavis and you'll also see some of our overall cost savings that will be in the Pharmacy Services segment that will help to offset that. But I think you're probably looking at a low-single digit growth as you think about the AOI there. I mean we'll provide a lot more details on that as we get to Investor Day. As we think about the labor investments, I think there are other places that we can look to try to offset those. It's clear based on the environment that this is the right thing to do, and we're committed to doing that. I would also note that over the last few years through next year, we\u2019ll have made over $1 billion investment in wages. And so we\u2019re committed to continuing that strength and making sure that we\u2019re a destination for employees. Elizabeth Anderson : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : This concludes today's Q&A session. So I'll hand the call back to Karen Lynch for any concluding remarks. Karen Lynch : Thank you for joining the call. We will see you in December.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand the floor to Larry McGrath to begin. So Larry, please go ahead when you are ready. Larry McGrath : Good morning, and welcome to the CVS Health fourth quarter 2023 earnings call and webcast. I'm Larry McGrath, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations for CVS Health. I'm joined this morning by Karen Lynch, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Cowhey, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll host a question-and-answer session that will include additional members of our leadership team. Our press release and slide presentation are being posted to our website, along with our Form 10-K filed this morning with the SEC. Today's call is also being broadcast on our website, where it will be archived for one year. During this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently projected results. We strongly encourage you to review the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties. In particular, those that are described in the cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K we filed this morning. During this call, we\u2019ll use non-GAAP measures when talking about the company's financial performance and financial condition and you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in this morning's press release and in the reconciliation document posted to our Investor Relations portion of our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Karen. Karen? Karen Lynch : Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. In 2023, we made strong progress on our journey bringing together integrated health solutions that meets the needs of consumers where and when they want healthcare. We successfully navigated a challenging environment and delivered on our financial commitments, a powerful testament to the strength of our diversified company. We are building America's health platform, enabling access to high quality, convenient and affordable care that supports individuals in building healthier lives. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we delivered adjusted operating income of $4.2 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.12. For the full-year, our total revenues were $358 billion, an increase of 11% versus the prior year. We delivered adjusted operating income of $17.5 billion and adjusted EPS of $8.74. We generated $13.4 billion of operating cash flow, demonstrating the power of our business model and supporting our strategy. This morning, we revised our full-year 2024 guidance for adjusted EPS to at least $8.30 and cash flow from operations to at least $12 billion. While utilization pressure in Medicare Advantage continues to be attributable to the same categories we have previously highlighted, a part of which was contemplated in our 2024 guidance, we are taking a cautious stance on our outlook for Medicare Advantage utilization until we have further clarity of these industry-wide trends. Tom will provide additional details on the components of our guidance. While the Medicare Advantage market has been challenged recently, our view of the long-term opportunity offered by this business remains unchanged. As we discussed in December, we are committed to achieving our targeted 4% to 5% margin in Medicare Advantage over time and we will begin that journey in 2025. At CVS Health, we have both the scale to transform how healthcare is delivered, and the ability to personalize care and coverage for each individual we serve. By bringing together the powerful capabilities of our brands, including Aetna, CVS Pharmacy, CVS Health Buyer and Caremark, we can deliver significant value to the customers and communities we serve and unlock tremendous potential for our shareholders. When all of our assets work together we are able to lower the total cost of care, improve health outcomes, deepen patient engagement, and increase loyalty. We are able to unlock up to 3 times to 4 times more enterprise value when we engage members in more than one CVS Health business. Today we have more than 55 million CVS Health customers that engage with at least two of our offerings. We see tremendous opportunities to expand engagement with customers across CVS Health through our multi-payer capabilities and vast consumer reach. We're also creating new value in healthcare with innovative models and offerings that create more transparency and choice for consumers and clients. In December, we unveiled our new CVS CostVantage model in our pharmacy and consumer wellness business. This model proactively addresses the persistent reimbursement pressures in the retail pharmacy industry. It eliminates cross-subsidization and creates a more durable and transparent pharmacy business that is fairly compensated for value delivered to customers and patients for all prescriptions dispensed. We have made notable progress since we announced the new model in December. We recently delivered initial terms and conditions to several PBM and are actively engaged in constructive discussions. CVS CostVantage is a dramatic change to the current reimbursement model and will provide a clear pathway to greater transparency, while passing along our industry leading cost of goods improvements. We've reached preliminary agreements with multiple cash discount card administrators to begin using CVS CostVantage on April 1. This is a foundational step that sets the stage to create more predictable pricing at the pharmacy counter for consumers. We also announced our new CVS Caremark TrueCost model. This innovative client option offers pricing that reflects the true net cost of prescription drugs with continued client visibility into administrative fees. Simplified pricing will help consumers be more confident that their pharmacy benefits provides the best possible price and ensures members have stable access to our national pharmacy network. Finally we continue to drive greater adoption of biosimilars and increase the affordability of these critical specialty drugs for our clients and their members. Beginning on April 1, Caremark will remove Humira from its major commercial template formularies. Through Cordavis, we will offer a co-branded Humira product. Cordavis plays an important role in reducing drug costs while helping to ensure a consistent supply of affordable, high-quality biosimilars for the patients we serve. These steps are truly innovative and will be pivotal as we look to unlock the tremendous value that new pharmacy models and offerings will deliver for our clients and their members. We are passionate about expanding access to care, lowering costs, improving health outcomes, and creating more transparency and choice for consumers. Our colleagues are committed to this important purpose and will deliver on these goals. I'll now turn to the highlights from each of our businesses in the quarter. In our healthcare benefits segment, we continue to navigate through elevated utilization trends in our Medicare Advantage business. In the quarter, we grew revenues to nearly $27 billion, an increase of over 16%, and delivered adjusted operating income of $676 million, medical membership ended the year at 25.7 million an increase of 1.3 million members versus the prior year reflecting growth across multiple product lines, including individual exchange, Medicare and commercial. Medicare Advantage is integral to the CVS Health Strategy, after a very successful 2024 annual enrollment period, we expect to add at least 800,000 new members in 2024. Our success was driven by targeted investments that were strengthened by CVS Health assets and allowed us to create differentiated value for members. We are improving member experiences by focusing on simplicity, offering unique designs and maintaining stable networks. Last week, we received the proposed 2025 rate notice. The funding level was broadly consistent with our expectations, which we do not believe is sufficient to cover current medical cost trends. We believe that the changes to Part D as a consequence of the Inflation Reduction Act necessitate additional funding to cover the comprehensive member benefits provided and the increased risk that plans are assuming as a result of the redesign. We look forward to providing our comments to CMS in the coming weeks. In our Health Services segment, CVS Healthspire, revenues grew to more than $49 billion dollars in the quarter, an increase of more than 12%, reflecting strong growth in our Pharmacy Services business, as well as the acquisitions of Oak Street and Signify Health. Adjusted operating income grew more than 4% to nearly $1.9 billion. In our Caremark business we recently completed a highly successful welcome season we onboarded more than 3 million new members and ensured our patients had access to their critical medications and specialty therapies. Our consistent ability to deliver exceptional customer member experience is what makes Caremark a leader in the marketplace. We continue to drive success in our healthcare delivery business. We have tremendous momentum engaging multi-payer Medicare Advantage members with Oak Street Clinics through our extensive CVS Health touchpoints. Oak Street ended the year with 202,000 at risk lives an increase of 27% versus the prior year. Through January, the number of Aetna members enrolled in Oak Street Clinic has doubled. Signify Health continues to demonstrate the value of its in-home capabilities for all of our multi-payer Medicare Advantage partners. Signify completed 649,000 in-home evaluations in the quarter, an increase of 20% versus the same period last year. Among our Aetna customers, we are broadening our addressable market utilizing Signifys\u2019 strong capabilities in other products, including individual exchange and Medicaid. We will be expanding these capabilities with other clients and we\u2019ll deliver value by engaging consumers and the health across multiple channels. In our pharmacy and consumer wellness segment, which serves more than a 120 million customers, revenues grew to more than $31 billion an increase of nearly 9% versus the prior year. We generated $2 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, up nearly 10% versus the prior year. PCW's performance in the fourth quarter was driven by strong operational execution. We continue to play an important role in providing access to critical immunization in the communities we serve and delivered on pharmacy performance measures for our health plan partners. We made progress executing on our store closure initiative, having closed 630 stores to-date and are on track to close 900 by the end of the year. On a comparable basis, total same-store sales were up more than 11% versus the same quarter in the prior year. Same-store prescription volumes in the quarter were up more than 4% versus last year. 2023 highlighted our exceptional execution and the power of our diversified business. Our financial performance and differentiated strategy creates strong momentum into 2024. Our integrated health model grows in relevance and importance every day to the consumers, customers, communities, and the shareholders we serve. I will now turn the call over to Tom to provide more details on our results and our guidance. Tom Cowhey : Thank you, Karen and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter results truly highlight our unwavering focus on execution and the power of our diversified businesses. We ended the year with strong results in key metrics such as revenue, adjusted earnings per share, and cash flow from operations. A few total company highlights, fourth quarter revenues of nearly $94 billion, increased by nearly 12% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong growth across each of our businesses. We deliver adjusted operating income of approximately $4.2 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.12, representing growth of approximately 4% versus the prior year. These increases were primarily due to strong results in our pharmacy and consumer wellness and pharmacy services businesses, as well as lower corporate expenses, partially offset by continued pressure in healthcare benefits. Our ability to generate cash remains outstanding, with full-year cash flow from operations of $13.4 billion. Shifting to details for our healthcare benefit segment, we deliver another strong quarter of revenue growth versus the prior year. Fourth quarter revenue of $26.7 billion increased more than 16% year-over-year, reflecting growth across all product lines, particularly in our individual exchange and Medicare businesses. Membership was $25.7 million, a slight decrease of 29,000 members sequentially, reflecting the impact of Medicaid re-determinations partially offset by growth in individual exchange. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $676 million. The decline in adjusted operating income versus the prior year was primarily driven by growth in the individual change business, including the related impact of seasonality, and increased utilization and Medicare Advantage, partially offset by higher net investment income. Our medical benefit ratio of 88.5% increased 270 basis points from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting higher Medicare Advantage utilization and a lower contribution from positive prior-period development. Utilization pressure continues to be attributable to the same categories we highlighted in the previous quarter, including outpatient and supplemental benefits such as dental and vision. We also saw an uptick in cost related to seasonal immunizations, including the newly launched RSV vaccine. Other categories remained largely consistent with our previous medical cost trend assumptions. Days claims payable at the end of the quarter was 45.9, down 4.4 days sequentially, and returning to normalized levels consistent with what we experienced in pre-COVID periods after adjusting for the impact of Medicaid pass-through payments. Overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. Our Health Services segment, which includes our pharmacy services and healthcare delivery businesses generated revenue of approximately $49 billion, an increase of more than 12% year-over-year. This increase was driven by pharmacy drug mix, growth and specialty pharmacy, brand inflation, and the addition of Signify and Oak Street. These increases were largely offset by the impact of continued client price improvements. Adjusted operating income of nearly $1.9 billion, f approximately 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by improved purchasing economics and growth in specialty pharmacy partially offset by ongoing client price improvements. Total pharmacy claims processed in the quarter increased slightly versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by net new business and increased utilization. The increase was largely offset by the impact of the New York Medicaid carve-out. Total pharmacy membership as of January 1, 2024 is approximately 89 million members, down primarily due to the previously announced loss of a large client. We continue to be encouraged by the performance and growth of our healthcare delivery assets. Signify generated revenue growth of 39% in the quarter, compared to last year. Oak Street ended the quarter with 204 centers, an increase of 35 centers in 2023. We continue to expect to add 50 to 60 centers in 2024. Oak Street also significantly increased revenue in the quarter growing 36%, compared to the same quarter last year. Shifting to our Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness segments. We generated revenue of over $31 billion, up nearly 9% versus the prior year and over 11% on a same-store basis. Reflecting the impact of pharmacy drug mix, increased prescription volume, brand inflation and increased contributions from vaccinations. These revenue increases were partially offset by the impact of recent generic introductions, continued reimbursement pressure, and a decrease in store counts. Adjusted operating income was approximately $2 billion, an increase of nearly 10% versus the prior year, driven by improved drug purchasing, increased contributions from vaccinations, the increased prescription volume described above, and lower operating expenses. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure. Same-store pharmacy sales were up 15.5% versus the prior year and same-store prescription volumes increased by 4.4%. Same-store sales in front store were down by about 3% versus the same quarter last year. Shifting to the balance sheet, our liquidity and capital position remain excellent. Our ability to generate cash flow remains a core strength of our organization. Full-year 2023 cash flow from operations were $13.4 billion. We ended the year with approximately $735 million of cash of the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment grade ratings while preserving flexibility to deploy capital strategically. In the fourth quarter, we returned $779 million to shareholders to our quarterly dividend. We also entered into a $3 billion, $6 accelerated share repurchase transaction, which became effective on January 3, 2024. Turning now to our full-year outlook for 2024 in recognition of the marketplace uncertainty around utilization trends and Medicare Advantage, we revised our 2024 adjust EPS guidance to at least $8.30. In the Healthcare Benefit segment, we now expect our 2024 medical benefit ratio to be approximately 87.7%, an increase of 50 basis points from our previous guidance. As I already noted, we observed elevated medical cost trends in our Medicare Advantage business in the fourth quarter, which pressured our full-year 2023 medical benefit ratio by approximately 10 basis points relative to our prior guidance. The remaining pressure in the quarter was largely a function of mix and higher revenue offset than we previously projected. Based on our review of our recently completed fourth quarter 2023 medical cost trend analysis, we are prudently assuming that the elevated medical cost trends we observed in the fourth quarter will carry forward into 2024. Accordingly, we have increased our full-year 2024 MBR guidance by approximately 40 basis points to account for this pressure. As discussed throughout 2023 we had included a provision for elevated utilization in our 2024 medical benefit ratio guidance and we'll continue to hold that provision until we have more clarity on the Medicare Advantage utilization environment. Our revised outlook also reflects an expectation of at least 800,000 new Medicare Advantage members in 2024. As we have previously discussed, the profile of these new members is attractive, with nearly three-quarters of these members switching from other Medicare plans and about a third of members expected in D-SNP plans. We continue to expect these new members will be neutral to earnings, but the mix impact from incremental new membership, represents approximately 10 basis points of today's 2024 MBR guidance revision. When combined with the additional 40 basis points of medical cost pressure we are projecting, we have increased our 2024 MBR projection by 50 basis points to 87.7%. We anticipate a number of favorable items will partially offset the impact of the expected elevated utilization levels, including higher investment income and higher than previously projected commercial membership. Adding up all the pieces, we now expect adjusted operating income for the Healthcare Benefit segment to be at least $5.4 billion, a decrease of $370 million from our prior estimates. In our Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness segment, we now expect a portion of the out-performance from the end of 2023 to persist into 2024. As a result, we now project adjusted operating income of at least $5.6 billion, an increase of approximately $90 million from our prior guidance. In Health Service segment we are updating 2024 adjusted operating income to at least $7.4 billion, a decrease of approximately $90 million. While our healthcare delivery businesses were able to successfully manage through medical cost trend pressures in 2023, we think it is prudent to recognize the potential for emerging risk our pair partners until we have further clarity on 2024 utilization trends. Finally, we've made a corresponding adjustment to cash flow from operations which we now project to will be at least $12 billion to ship. As you think about the cadence of earnings in 2024, we expect to generate less than 50% of our adjusted EPS in the first-half. More specifically, we expect to generate roughly 20% of full-year adjusted EPS in the first quarter. This pattern will look different than 2023, primarily due to the way Medicare Advantage utilization emerged over the course of 2023, and the timing and impact of prior period developments. As a result, Healthcare Benefits 2024 MBR will see the largest year-over-year increase in the first quarter and the smallest in the fourth quarter. You can find additional details on the components of our updated 2024 guidance on our investor relations web page. Beyond 2024, we are committed to returning our Medicare Advantage margins to our target of 4% to 5%, while also preserving the projected returns on capital for our 2023 acquisitions. Our stars recovery in 2025 will enhance our earnings trajectory, even as we work to adjust our plans or count for the preliminary 2025 Medicare Advantage wait notice, which does not adequately cover recent medical cost runs. For 2025 our goal is to deliver low-double-digit adjusted EPS growth of our updated 2024 guidance. We expect to update investors later this year on our progress against this goal. To conclude, 2023 was a year where CVS Health demonstrated the power of our diversified enterprise. As we begin 2024, we remain focused on operational execution and sustainable growth, as we advance our goal of becoming the leading health solutions company for consumers. With that, we'll now open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Lisa Gill from JP Morgan. Lisa, please go ahead. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning, Tom. Thanks for all of that color. But I just want to go a little bit deeper and just really understand how do I think about what happened in the fourth quarter, how that is influencing how you're thinking about 2024, what happened from your Investor Day in December that's really influencing this? Did you see claims coming in throughout December that's influencing how you're thinking about \u201824? And then you touched a little bit on this around the new members and the fact that they're switchers and the impact there. But just wondering if you can give us any more color on how to think about their risk coding and the level of comfort that you have there just dipping just 10 basis points with adding so much membership? And then just lastly, how do I think about medical cost trend versus supplemental benefits, when we think about \u201924? Tom Cowhey : Sure, maybe -- thanks Lisa. Maybe I'll take the first part of that, and I'll ask Brian to take the back parts. So as you think about what changed from our Investor Day, we actually saw really high levels of paid claims in the back half of December. And we noted that when we appeared at your conference in January. As we dove deeper into what went on in the fourth quarter, maybe let me just walk you through kind of what we've seen in aggregate. So if you start with the fourth quarter of 2023 and just let's think about its impact on the full-year performance. So we ended the year at 86.2%, which was about 20 basis points higher than our guidance. Roughly half of that pressure is things that we do not believe should carry into 2024. So key drivers of that would be things like Medicaid pass-through payments and also higher SEP membership. As you know, once redeterminations start to end in the first-half, we shouldn't see that same sort of pressure in the back half of this year. And we've also repositioned our portfolio across the board in individual. As you think about the other half, that 10 basis points, that's all related to the trend pressure that we saw in Medicare. So it's a lot of the same categories, though, that we've been talking about all year and that we've been trying to actively get ahead of in our guidance. So outpatient trend accelerated slightly in the fourth quarter, so hips and knees. We also continue to see elevated trends in supplemental benefits, but really it's more dental and vision than the OTC cards that we talked about earlier this year. And finally, we saw some pressure in the quarter from vaccinations, which is really RSV related. As we look across the other categories, the cost trends themselves on a dollar basis, they're essentially in line with where it is that we thought that they would be. So how does that translate then into '24? We've taken that 10 basis points of pressure, and we've pulled it through into the 2024 baseline. So accordingly, we've increased our estimate for medical costs by over $400 million in our forward guidance for '24. With the additional mix impacts from the new members, that additional 200,000 plus that we've talked about since Investor Day, we think that, that gets you to about a 50 basis point increase, which is the totality of what we've done this morning. As I said in the prepared remarks, I'd just remind you, when we first started talking about our guidance for 2024 at the second quarter call, we talked about putting an additional provision into 2024 for enhanced utilization. We've maintained that provision in our guidance. And so we hope that, that will be a prudent posture but we want to see where trends are going to settle. I'd also just note that as you think about the Medicare business now, that book is now only projected to be marginally profitable in 2024, and that's something that we will actively be looking to address with our 2025 bids. I'll turn it over to Brian. Brian Kane : Yes. I would just add on the new members, Lisa, to your question. There's nothing that we've seen in those new members that would give us pause. The risk orders look reasonable. The fact that so many of the members are switchers is a really important component of that. The fact that we have a big portion that are D-SNPs, 1/3, as Tom mentioned in his remarks, matters because we don't have a Stars issue in that book of business. So overall, we feel good about the new membership. And I would just add that, that new membership also has a very important tailwind for 2025 as those members get coded next year and as the cost of the distribution wear off for 2025. So we feel very good about the new members that we received. There's nothing that we've seen that gives us pause there. And we think everything is fully reflected in our 2024 guide, as Tom went through. With respect to your question on supplemental benefits, we believe we've fully reflected the cost of those benefits in our '24 guide. We mentioned on the last quarterly call that we've effectively assumed full utilization of those flex cards that were giving us a lot of challenges this year. And the dental- and vision-type pressure has also been fully reflected in our guide. Again, we feel good, as Tom said, that we fully reflected the '23 baseline in our \u201824 numbers. We put a normalized, very reasonable trend on top of that baseline. And today, we put additional dollars on top of that through the increase in the MBR. So all and all, we feel good about how we're positioned for '24. Karen Lynch : Yes. And Lisa, I just want to reemphasize the point that Tom made about 2025, and I said this in our prepared remarks, that we are committed for margin recovery in Medicare Advantage for 2025, and we'll account for that in our bids. Lisa Gill : Great. Thank you for the comments. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Justin, your line is open. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the 2025 bidding strategy. And specifically, I know you're going to have some tailwind in margin improvement from Stars in 2025. I wanted beyond that. I found your comments helpful on the rates, and I know that could be a pressure and that's going to cause benefit reductions. But beyond that, do you expect to cut benefits beyond whatever the rates would suggest to start recapturing margin beyond Stars for the higher cost trend? How should we think about that positioning for 2025? And how quickly do you think you get back to that 4% to 5% margin? Thanks. Karen Lynch : Hey Justin, it's Karen, and I'll hand this over to Brian in a second, but I just want to comment on the rate notice because that's critical to how we think about 2025 bids. There's kind of three things I would say here. One is we believe it's in line with our expectations relative to being flat. However, we do not believe it covers overall cost trends that have been emerging in Medicare Advantage. We also know that there's complexity around the risk model. And so we'll be contemplating that as we think about our bids. And then finally, there's some uncertainty around how the Inflation Reduction Act impacts Part D, and that we'll be taking that under consideration when we do our bids as well and providing comments to CMS relative to these points. So all of those will factor in to our bid process, but we will be driving for margin recovery. And let me have Brian specifically answer your detailed questions. Brian Kane : Sure. Thanks, Karen. And I'll just reiterate again that we are committed to the 4% to 5% margin. It's top of mind and extremely important that we get there. As we've said multiple times, it will be a multiyear journey to get there, but we intend to take significant ground against that target in 2025, while also being very disciplined and reflecting the trends that we see in our business to make sure that's fully reflected in the pricing. Karen mentioned some of the headwinds with respect to the rate notice and that we don't believe it fully reflects medical trend. There are some issues around Part D that we need to work through as the benefit has been meaningfully enhanced as part of the IRA. And also we, as an industry, are taking on a meaningfully more risk in the catastrophic layer that will have to be reflected in our bids, and that's something we intend to do. We are also limited, as you know, by TBC or Total Beneficiary Change limitations that we are working through that could, to some extent, constrain what we're able to do. That being said, we do intend to take additional margin actions. Our goal is to do so in excess of our Stars tailwind that we have. I would also note, as I mentioned in the prior question that Lisa asked, it's really important to think about this 800,000 members that we're getting as a meaningful tailwind to 2025 again, because these members haven't been fully documented from a coding perspective, and because the distribution costs are very expensive throughout the year that will wear off in 2025. And so you get a nice tailwind there. The last point I'd make, which I think is important is that although the IRA did enhance the benefits, as we said on Part D, the result will likely be, notwithstanding some of the risk model changes that were made for PDP, will likely result in meaningful premium increases on the PDP side, which we believe will actually help the relative attractiveness of MA. And I think that's an important component as we think about the attractiveness of MA for 2025. And the last point I'd make, which I think is important, as an industry, not only does MA offer superior benefits, and we believe that even with some of the changes that we intend on making, it will still be a compelling value proposition for our customers. But the thing that doesn't get talked about enough is the significant benefits around care coordination, around navigating the health care system that our members get as a result of choosing MA plan that is far superior to traditional Medicare fee-for-service plan, and that's something that we will be top of mind for us. And our intention is to continue to enhance that experience, especially with our new members to make sure that we retain them for 2025. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Kevin your line is open. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I want to go maybe a little bit further on Justin's question. And when you think about getting to 4% to 5% over time, I guess what we're all trying to understand or worried about or just trying -- maybe it's the strategy, like your positioning. Can you still take share and enhance margin, knowing what you know? Maybe talk a little bit about how CVS is positioned in their ability to bid versus others in the marketplace. What are your advantages and disadvantages? And can you, with Stars coming back or not, but can you get to your margin targets and still grow in line or better than the expected market growth? Brian Kane : Well, look, I appreciate the question. There's still some questions out there. We got to see where the final rate notice obviously shakes out in terms of overall where margins can go and of course, get a real handle around where we think trend will be for 2025, be very disciplined about that. And so that will be an important calculus as we think about margin recovery. As we think about relative share, look, we believe that we have a compelling value proposition as an enterprise with all the various assets we can bring to bear for our Medicare members. We do think that our Stars coming back does on the margin, provide an advantage there. As I will reiterate again, the significant membership growth that we got in 2024 also gives us some tailwinds going into 2025. But I will tell you, we are first and foremost on recovering margin and market share gains is a secondary consideration. Obviously, we want to grow, as I said in the prior question. We believe this is a compelling space. We believe it's compelling for members. And we believe we have the assets to be able to manage those members and provide superior customer experience relative to the competition. As a consequence, I think we're very well positioned to grow our business and over time take share. Operator : The next question comes from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Nathan, please go ahead. Your line is open. Nathan Rich : Great. Thank you. Good morning and thanks for the questions you know, it\u2019s obviously been challenging this year for many companies to kind of get their hands around utilization. So I don't know if you have any kind of early comments on how January played out maybe relative to the fourth quarter on both the outpatient trend, as well as supplemental benefits? And then as it relates to the 2024 MBR now, I think, being up 150 basis points. I guess at a high level, would you be able to break that increase down between utilization pressure, the impact that new members will have, the Stars headwind that you face? And is there a pressure also in there from the risk model? Or is that something that you price for, just as we think about the different components that contribute to the '24 MBR? Thank you. Tom Cowhey : Nate, why don't I take the second part of your question first, and then I'll turn it back over to Brian. So as you look at the year-over-year MBR increase, almost the entirety of it is related to the Medicare Advantage business. So there are some smaller items. So we have an improvement in our individual exchange business. And then there's some other offsets there. But we also -- as we think about our guidance, we never project prior year reserve development. And so that's that -- those two, for the most part, net. And so what you were left with is the vast majority of the increase is related to Medicare. And so about 65 basis points of that specifically relates to the $800 million Stars headwind that we have. And then the remainder is a combination of provisions for the new member mix, because we're assuming a higher MBR there and that, that will be plus or minus breakeven and then the rest of it is really a provision for Medicare utilization pressure. Brian Kane : And with respect to January trends, it's really way too early to comment on that. There's nothing that we've seen in our January data that gives us pause relative to the guidance that we've given today. Obviously, we're going to monitor it very closely, as you can imagine. And as we get more information, we will absolutely share that with you. I would comment just on the risk model, just make a quick comment about the V28 visions, and we talked about this at our Investor Day, not every player is impacted the same way by this. And as we've said, we have a relatively low portion of duals and D-SNPs. It's obviously something that we're growing significantly this year, but we're way over -- way under-indexed to D-SNP relative to some of our competitors. And I think that's an important element because that's a population that's been impacted more by these risk model changes. We also -- and we think this is ultimately an opportunity, but we also are underpenetrated when it comes to our full-risk VBC relationships. And those types of relationships also result in, I would say, bigger impact on V28 relative to a non-VBC type relationship. This is something, again, we want to expand over time, and it's a critical strategic priority for us. But with respect to the risk model change, we're actually benefited by the fact that we have a much lower penetration than some of our peers. Tom Cowhey : Nate, I might just say one of the things that we spent a lot of time looking at specifically was inpatient. And there are some puts and takes there. But on the whole, that category remains consistent with our expectations. Now we did make a provision in both our bids and therefore -- which is incorporated in our guidance for the changes that would happen in January from the two midnight rule. That's fully encapsulated inside the guide, and it's something that we're obviously watching very closely because of -- to make sure that our estimate is consistent with what we're going to see come through the system. Operator : The next question comes from Ann Hynes from Mizuho. Ann, your line is open, please go ahead. Ann Hynes : Great thanks. Maybe I'll shift away from MLR and focus on retail and just the new pricing model. I know you discussed in your comments, but can you just give us any more details on the initial feedback you're receiving from payers. Have your discussions changed your view on the ability to change the model of the timing? And just to clarify, this is a mandatory program. So payers basically have to switch with you. And I guess, what's the risk of payer relationships that they don't want to? Thanks. Karen Lynch : Yes, I would say that the comments and the feedback have generally been positive with the discussions. Initially, obviously, there's a lot of details to go through and to work through. But we're really pleased with sort of the initial reaction. And I'll ask Prem to give you a little bit more detail here. Prem Shah : Yes. Thanks for the question, Ann. And what I'd say is we launched model at Analyst Day and really excited about the progress we've made. We've been able to, over the course of the last week, delivered the initial terms and conditions to several of the pharmacy benefit managers are and we're engaged in constructive discussions with all of them. What really excites me is we're leading the way in providing greater transparency in drug pricing and passing through our leading cost of goods through to payers in our new model. So this is not about effectively raising prices. It's about continuing to pass through our size and scale and the acquisition costs that we received back to payers and provide a transparent model that can benefit consumers and payers as we go forward. Remember, one of the biggest challenges as you think about the health care ecosystem, the problems we face is the rising cost of brand drugs. And if you think about what the biggest pain point for our payers is, it's the fact that these brand drugs and specialty drugs now constitute the majority of -- that kind of get passed through to the payers and plan sponsors. It's not the pharmacy reimbursement that's driving that. So -- and just some quick data points on that. If you think about the impact of GLP-1 2022 to the system, it was about $14 million, right? And that continues to grow. So from my perspective, we continue to be -- have good discussions with payers. We're driving forward on eliminating some of the key problems in the systems such as cross subsidization and creating an easier path and a much more transparent path to allow payers and consumers to receive their pharmacy pharmaceuticals in the U.S. and more to come as we make progress over the course of the next couple of quarters. Karen Lynch : And Ann, I would just remind everyone that the industry has continually talked about the importance of driving cost transparency and affordability and simplicity. And with this model and our TrueCost model, we are really kind of leading at the forefront to support those items. And I think as Prem has been out in the market, there is a lot of support for this. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Josh your line is open, please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Thanks. Good morning here with Eric as well. I'm going to hopefully close the loop on the MA side. So can you speak to just your philosophy overall on MA bids? And do you consider the benefit of the enterprise from growth? Or does the HCB segment have to stand on its own when you talk about that 4% to 5% margin? And can you speak to the impact of growing your Healthspire assets and how that impacts your MA bid strategy? I'm specifically thinking about growth in Oak Street probably creates a short-term headwind but long-term enterprise value? Karen Lynch : So Josh, the way we think about it is 4% to 5% margin needs to be at HCB. And then we get the benefit of our growth from all the other assets that we can bring to bear for the company. So that's our philosophical approach to MA bids. And then relative to how the Healthspire assets can support MA, I'll ask Mike to give you some comments on that. Mike Pykosz : Yes. So one of the key parts of the partnership we have with Aetna, but with all of our payers as we have additional levers we can pull at HCB to positively impact patient care quality, positively impact outcomes and then lower medical costs, right? And that can be Signify delivering in-home assessments to identify patient disease burdens we can treat it appropriately. And that can be on Oak Street Health having more levers of PCP defer the lower MOR. So our job is for all of our payer partners to provide substantially better care. And so obviously, when our payer partners are growing and taking share, right, a lot of that growth trickles down to us and becomes a tailwind for us. But one of the advantages I think we have as health care delivery organization is the more levers to pull. And one example for the group is we bought a company at Oak Street called Rubicon MD a couple of years ago, and we leverage e-consult to help provide better access to specialty care and lower cost. And we fully implemented the e-consult program in 2023 at Oak Street. And through that implementation, we were able to lower trend 1% across our entire book. And that is one reason we were able to hit our expectations to Oak Street on MLR and profitability despite the increase in a lot of the utilization categories that Tom discussed and we saw as well. And so I think a lot of our strategy is dependent upon being able to drive higher quality and lower cost through those levers. Tom Cowhey : Josh. Maybe let me wrap this up. The -- as we think about this from the enterprise perspective, all of our businesses need to earn their cost of capital and they need to earn their return on that capital. And so as you think about Medicare, it's a mid-$60s billion revenue business that we targeted a 4% to 5% margin on for 2023. We clearly didn't achieve that. And as we look at our projections for 2024, as I noted, it's only marginally profitable. As you think about that business, we're putting a high-teens percentage of dollars and risk-based capital behind every dollar of premium. And so it's imperative that, that business earn its margin to earn its cost of capital and returns on capital. That's just how we think about it from an enterprise perspective. And we've spent a lot of money over the course of 2023 to develop capabilities, which we believe will be additive. And we have been very specific with investors about what we expect those returns on capital to be over time, and we're committed to achieving them, which means we're committed to achieving target margins in each of those businesses that we acquired. Operator : The next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Elizabeth, please go ahead. Your line is open. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I wanted to maybe dig into the Pharmacy Services profit guidance for 2024 in a little bit more detail. Can you just go through sort of what are the key tenets of your assumptions that changed there versus the guidance that you gave at the Investor Day in December? Thank you. Tom Cowhey : Elizabeth, did you mean the Health Services segment, I presume. So really what changed there... Elizabeth Anderson : [Multiple Speakers] Yes. Tom Cowhey : Yes. As you think about that, I noted this a little bit in the prepared remarks, as we think about what the external utilization environment looks like, we felt it was prudent to recognize that as a multi-payer business, that there could be impacts outside our ecosystem that might pull through into that business. As Mike said, we spent a lot of time -- he spends a lot of time thinking about what the reserving practice are and what their medical cost trends are inside the Oak Street and also our ACO businesses. And we try to supplement that as we can with other insights about what it is that we're seeing across our book. But as we thought about what we're hearing in the marketplace, what we saw in our own book in the fourth quarter, we thought it was prudent to pull through some of that potential utilization pressure into our outlook, primarily at our Health Care Delivery assets. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Stephen, your line is open. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Yes. Hey, thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on that question precisely. When we look at the guidance reduction for the services business, it does look like it's less than, I think, the kind of implied 100 basis point guide up on MA MLR that you're talking about for your own book of business. So just hoping you could expand a little more specifically what's included in the increased loss ratios for the Oak Street business? And then are you potentially also carrying some of the 2023 outperformance into your 2024 outlook as an offset? Tom Cowhey : Yes, Steve, I think that it's important as you think about the guide that you realized two things. Number one, Health Care Delivery is part of a much larger segment, right? And so we believe that we've made appropriate provisions in the segmental guidance there for what the potential pressures might look like. The second thing I would just remind you is that we had a very successful 2023 in those businesses. And so those businesses were able to successfully manage through the pressures that we and most of our peers saw in Medicare Advantage and still achieve the targets that we were looking for out of those businesses in 2023. So we were very pleased with that performance. And -- but we took a prudent outlook and cautious hopefully, outlook as we thought about where 2024 might land based on the external environment. Operator : The next question comes from Allen Lutz from Bank of America. Allen, your line is open. Please go ahead. Allen Lutz : Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. One for Tom or Prem. On the retail pharmacy side, pharmacy script volume was really strong. So how should we think about growth there through the end of the year and ex-COVID? And then are you seeing any noticeable benefits from the bankruptcy of one of your peers? Thanks. Prem Shah : Thanks for the question. I'll tell you a few things. One, as we've entered this year and throughout Q4, we've had extremely strong service in our pharmacy businesses. And as we mentioned before, pharmacy relationships are sticky, and they really are driven by the great experiences we can provide at the counter. So we feel really good going to this year as it relates to our service. And there's been a few market disruptions, as you mentioned in the marketplace. From our perspective, we continue to make sure that we invest in our stores in the right way, prioritizing experiences, as I said. And we'll look at certain markets for opportunistic -- buys, if they make sense, as we've historically done over time. But we feel really good about our script performance coming into the year, and it's in line with our expectations as we look at this. Tom Cowhey : [Nate] (ph), as you think about this business, one of the things that we've said that we've tried to consistently is to grow share to help to offset reimbursement pressures. And as you look at the fourth quarter, we certainly had -- I'm sorry, that was Allen, we certainly had -- we had same-store growth. You got to really think about what the impact of store closures might be as you think about our overall market share. But we had same-store growth in prescriptions that was in the high 4% range versus a market that grew in kind of mid-2s. And so we feel like the teams really continue to execute really well in helping to drive to the results that ultimately get us onto the long-term trajectory that we outlined at Investor Day. Karen Lynch : And Allen, I'd also note, and we said this in the prepared remarks that we've been making good progress on our store closures, and we've been retaining scripts and retaining colleagues, which was critical to the success of those store closures as well. Operator : The next question comes from Charles Rhyee from TD Cowen. Charles, your line is open. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Oh, yes. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to CostVantage a little bit here. And when we think about how you're setting up those acquisition costs, can you talk about sort of the reaction compares little bit more in regards to how they're seeing what costs that you're passing through? I think one of the issues or concerns have been raised is the potential for sort of perverse incentives, right, a pharmacy could prefer a higher acquisition cost drug because the market is higher and one of the solutions that we've heard mentioned was potentially setting up maybe global caps on reimbursement for class of drugs, just making up numbers here, no more than, let's say, AWP minus 990 for generics or something like that. Is that something that you are discussing with the payers? And what are sort of the measures that you are contemplating to ensure sort of the incentives are aligned because I imagine payers are really interested in that? Prem Shah : Yes. I think the -- first and foremost, I think there's a few parts to your question. For -- we've -- delivered our terms and conditions. So the payers now have the ability to understand how our model will work. As a reminder, our model is based on a simple transparent formula that's built upon the underlying acquisition cost of the drug, defined by -- plus a defined markup and dispensing fee. To your point on there's many different ways in pharmacy pricing. My perspective on this is the way we've approached this is in a very transparent way so that payers can receive the benefits of someone like CVS Retail Pharmacy, where we have the operating scale and the operating discipline to drive further acquisition costs down on generics through our procurement and other strategies. And so we will always be held accountable for reducing acquisition costs, deleveraging our scale and size to do that and also performing and delivering services at the lowest price possible. At the same time, payers also need a viable pharmacy marketplace across the community that can provide what I would say is consistent care across all the communities that we serve. So it's critical to meet both of those. And look, it's February 7, so we're still early in this journey, but we're excited about the progress we've made since Analyst Day, and we're going to continue these payer negotiations and payer discussions over the course of the coming weeks and months and we'll provide an update as we go forward. And all the things that you're describing are things that we're contemplating and discussing with payers in a very transparent way to eliminate some of the challenges that this industry has had over the course of the last few decades. Operator : The next question comes from [John Ransom] (ph) from Raymond James. John, your line is open. Please go ahead. John Ransom : Hey, good morning. I got a new name, John Branson. That's right. The question I have is just RSV. It's a good guy to your retail franchise. It's a bad guy at HCB. How do we think about the net benefit or net drag to the enterprise for fourth quarter? And what's embedded in your '24 outlook just for RSV? Thanks. Tom Cowhey : Hey John, I don't know that we're going to give a specific on that as you think about RSV. I would say net because of the relative market share differences between our pharmacy business and the Aetna business. That tends to be a net tailwind for the enterprise. We did see pressure inside fourth quarter in the -- in particular, in our Medicare business, but also a little bit in the commercial business inside Aetna as you think about those vaccinations. Correspondingly, we saw more of a benefit in the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment. As we think about 2024, given the newness of some of these vaccines, what we've tried to do is take a little bit more cautious outlook as we thought about what the pull-through might be for that outperformance in the fourth quarter. And that's why the beat doesn't match the raise as you think about \u201824. We'd like to see a little bit more history here before we lean in on that projection. Karen Lynch : And John, strategically, I wouldn't just think about one type of RSV vaccine. I want you to think about kind of an immunization franchise that the retail business has really developed and which is really creating strong value for that business. Operator : The final question today is from Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Erin Wright : Great thanks. On Cordavis, I'm just curious how meaningful is the contribution to segment profit? Or how meaningful is that embedded in your guidance? And how is that just generally playing out relative to your expectations? And then just a quick one on just PBM and transparency. Just your latest thoughts on regulatory changes potentially across the PBM, what you can -- what we could potentially see this year in terms of what gets passed and ability to manage around that? Thanks. Tom Cowhey : Thanks, Erin. Maybe I'll start with Cordavis. I'd say we've been very pleased with the progress to-date. And we do have a projection for a positive contribution from that business inside the Health Services segment. And we'll continue to give more details on that as we get through the year. But we haven't disclosed that specific contribution at this point. And maybe I'll turn it over to Karen to talk a little bit more about PBM transparency. Karen Lynch : Yes, relative to what's going on in Washington, obviously, this is -- continued discussions are going on there. I do think that they're talking about transparency. If anything does get passed, I think it will be around transparency. But I would tell you that given some of the actions that we have taken with both TrueCost and CostVantage, that is resonating with the legislators and is helpful in driving overall cost transparency. And I can't predict what's going on in D.C., but I know that we're taking action to improve overall outcome. Operator : This concludes today's Q&A session... Karen Lynch : Yes. Thank you for all joining the call today, and I want to thank our colleagues for their continued commitment to deliver on our performance. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you very much for your attendance. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] I'm now going to hand over to Larry McGrath to begin. Larry, please go ahead. Larry McGrath : Good morning, and welcome to the CVS Health First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call and Webcast. I'm Larry McGrath, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations for CVS Health. I'm joined this morning by Karen Lynch, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Cowhey, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll host a question-and-answer session that will include additional members of our leadership team. Our press release and slide presentation have been posted to our website, along with our Form 10-Q filed this morning with the SEC. Today's call is also being broadcast on our website where it will be archived for 1 year. During this call, we'll make certain forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently projected results. We strongly encourage you to review the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are described in the cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements and risk factors in our most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed this morning and our recent filings on Form 8-K, including this morning's earnings press release. During this call, we'll use non-GAAP measures when talking about the company's financial performance and financial condition. And you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in this morning's press release and in the reconciliation document posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Karen. Karen? Karen Lynch : Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. This morning, we announced first quarter results that were burdened by utilization pressures in Medicare Advantage, which materially impacted our Health Care Benefits segment. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.31, which fell short of our expectations. As a result of this performance as well as our updated expectations for the rest of 2024, we are lowering our full year 2024 guidance for adjusted EPS to at least $7. Tom will go through these results and our revised guidance in more detail. I want to start our discussion this morning by focusing on the challenges we are seeing in our Medicare Advantage business and what we are doing to address these pressures. When we last gave 2024 guidance, our outlook assumed normalized Medicare Advantage trends on top of the elevated baseline we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2023. It is now clear that the first quarter 2024 Medicare Advantage trends are notably above this level. Like others in the industry, our visibility in the quarter was impaired by the cyberattack on Change Healthcare. At the close of the quarter, we established a reserve of nearly $500 million for claims that we estimated we had not received. This represents our best estimate of missing claims with approximately half of the reserve attributed to our Medicare business. As we closed the quarter, it became apparent we were experiencing broad-based utilization pressure in our Medicare Advantage business in a few areas. Outpatient services and supplemental benefits continued to be elevated in the first quarter and exceeded our projections. We also saw new pressures in the inpatient and pharmacy categories, some of which were seasonal or onetime in nature. April inpatient authorizations and admissions appear to have moderated. In response to these pressures, at a time when we have seen very strong enrollment growth, we implemented a series of actions to ensure our clinical operations are performing at levels consistent with our expectations. We formed multidisciplinary teams to do a retrospective review of our claims data, searching for condition-specific, geographic or facility-based outliers as well as to uncover any selection bias in our new and existing membership base. We ensured clinical teams are staffed for current volumes by redeploying nurses from across CVS Health and increasing hiring where necessary. And we evaluated opportunities and implemented actions to optimize our pharmacy benefit spend. In addition to those efforts, we are accelerating enterprise productivity initiatives to streamline and optimize our operations, ensuring our costs are aligned to the business operation, environment and conditions. We are implementing these actions with speed and urgency, utilizing the broad resources and experience across CVS Health. We have a track record of successfully navigating complex industry pressure, and we'll continue to demonstrate our resilience. We will provide updates throughout the year on these efforts. I also feel it is important to discuss our long-term outlook for Medicare Advantage. We recently received the final 2025 rate notice. And when combined with the Part D changes prescribed by the Inflation Reduction Act, we believe the rate is insufficient. This update will result in significant added disruption to benefit levels and choice for seniors across the country. While we strive to deliver benefit stability to seniors, we will be adjusting plan-level benefits and exiting counties as we construct our bids for 2025. We are committed to improving margins. Despite the recent challenges in Medicare Advantage, we firmly believe the program can remain a compelling offering for seniors and a very attractive business for Aetna and CVS Health over time. Medicare Advantage will continue to deliver significant value to members as well as better outcomes and patient experiences. Over the next few years, we are determined to improve our positioning in Medicare Advantage. The combination of our internal efforts and the multiyear repricing opportunity gives us confidence in our ability to return to our target margin of 4% to 5% in 3 to 4 years. Our top priority in the near term is addressing the pressures faced by our Medicare Advantage business. However, I urge you not to lose sight of the power of our enterprise. The strength and diversity of our business positions us for growth in 2025 as we deliver value to our patients, customers and shareholders. We are ensuring a viable biosimilars market in the U.S. with our Cordavis business, which will drive lower cost for our customers, savings for consumers and will lead to higher retention and growth. On April 1, we implemented our unique and meaningful formulary change related to Humira. We have already made a significant impact in the first month since the formulary change, dispensing more biosimilar Humira prescriptions than the entire U.S. market in 2023. This accomplishment truly highlights the combined strength of our CVS Caremark, CVS Specialty and Cordavis businesses to accelerate biosimilar adoption and our commitment to customers to lower pharmacy costs. Our Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness business delivered strong performance this quarter, highlighted by our ability to grow pharmacy share despite softening consumer demand in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Our CVS Pharmacy locations continue to serve an important and expanding role in communities across the country. Since we unveiled CVS CostVantage and TrueCost, we have seen a tremendous interest in these more simple and transparent pharmacy models. We are engaged in active discussion with PBMs to roll out CVS CostVantage for commercial contracts on January 1, 2025. Additionally, we signed CVS CostVantage agreements with multiple third-party discount card administrators that were effective on April 1 and represent more than 50% of all CVS discount card volume. We continue to have constructive dialogue with our partners and look forward to updating you later this year. In our Health Care Delivery business, we are seeing meaningful progress in our integration efforts. This quarter, Signify had the highest volume of in-home evaluations in their history. Oak Street at-risk patients grew nearly 20% over the same quarter last year, supported by our ability to utilize touch points across CVS Health. In Aetna, our Commercial business had several wins with large group clients with 2025 effective dates, demonstrating our ability to deliver integrated benefit solutions with our diversified portfolio of offerings. In our Medicaid business, we have been successful in several RFPs, including Virginia, Michigan and Texas, where our CVS Health assets were highlighted as differentiators. These represent a few recent highlights from across our businesses and demonstrate the value and positive momentum across our broad-based portfolio of assets. The current environment does not diminish our opportunities, our enthusiasm or the long-term earnings power of our company. We are confident that we have a pathway to address our near-term Medicare Advantage challenges. While recent results have been pressured, our actions will return our earnings to their appropriate levels and will result in a stronger CVS Health. We remain as committed as ever to our strategy and believe that we have the right assets in place to deliver value to our customers, members, patients and our shareholders. Tom will provide details on the results of each of our businesses and the components of our updated guidance. Tom? Tom Cowhey : Thank you, Karen, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. In the first quarter, our revenues were approximately $88 billion, an increase of approximately 4% over the prior year quarter. We delivered adjusted operating income of approximately $3 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.31. We also generated cash flow from operations of $4.9 billion, a lower result compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to the timing of Medicare payments. Each of our segments and the enterprise as a whole are focused on executing against their goals and delivering on their financial targets. However, our Health Care Benefits and enterprise results are being materially pressured by the level of Medicare Advantage utilization that we are experiencing. Clearly, this is a disappointing result for us. Let me walk you through some of the drivers and help you understand how we expect them to impact the remainder of the year. In our Health Care Benefits segment, we delivered revenues of approximately $32 billion, an increase of approximately 25% year-over-year. Medical membership was 26.8 million, up 1.1 million members sequentially, reflecting growth in Medicare, Individual Exchange and Commercial group products, partially offset by the impact of Medicaid redeterminations. Adjusted operating income for the first quarter was $732 million. This result reflects a higher medical benefit ratio, partially offset by higher net investment income and the impact of favorable fixed cost leverage due to membership growth. Our medical benefit ratio of 90.4% increased 580 basis points from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting higher Medicare Advantage utilization, the premium impact of lower Stars Ratings for payment year 2024 and unfavorable prior year development as compared to the prior year. Digging into the drivers of Medicare Advantage cost trends, we saw meaningful increases in utilization. We continue to see elevated trends in the same categories we discussed at the end of 2023, including outpatient and supplemental benefits, categories that appeared to be moderating earlier in the quarter, but which completed at levels and, in some cases, exceeded expectations. Adding to the outpatient and supplemental benefits pressure, we saw new pressures emerge from inpatient categories, RSV vaccines and other pharmacy benefits. Inpatient admits per 1,000 in the first quarter were up high single digits versus the first quarter of 2023. While a portion of this increase was anticipated because of the implementation of the Two-Midnight Rule, this result meaningfully exceeded our expectations for the quarter as inpatient seasonality returned to patterns we have not seen since the start of the pandemic. In our Medicaid business, we experienced medical cost pressures, largely driven by higher acuity from member redeterminations. We are working closely with our state partners to ensure the underlying trends are reflected in our rates going forward. Medical cost trends in our Commercial business have not shown the same pressures we are experiencing in Medicare. Inpatient bed days are favorable to expectations, although higher than prior years. Mental health and pharmacy trends remain elevated, but overall performance of the commercial block is consistent with our projections. Individual exchange medical costs are elevated, but are consistent with projected membership mix and lower revenue payables in 2024. Our Individual Exchange business remains on target to achieve its profit goals this year. We will continue to monitor both of these blocks closely, but their performance to date is consistent with our prior projections. Days claims payable at the end of the quarter were 44.5 days, down 1.4 days sequentially. This decrease is primarily driven by the impact of membership growth and higher pharmacy trends, which tend to complete quicker and reduce DCP, as well as other typical seasonal items. Premiums and reserves both grew sequentially approximately 20%. As a reminder, DCP is an output of our reserving process. And overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. In early April, we saw multiple days of high paid claim activity, which is consistent with the restoration of Change Healthcare and the associated backlog from that disruption. While the final impact of the Change Healthcare disruption will not be known for several months, our most recent interim reporting suggests that our March 31 reserve balances are stable and could show modest levels of positive development, which is not incorporated into our current outlook. Our Health Services segment generated revenue of approximately $40 billion, a decrease of nearly 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by the previously announced loss of a large client and continued pharmacy client price improvements. This decrease was partially offset by pharmacy drug mix, growth in specialty pharmacy and the acquisitions of Oak Street Health and Signify Health. Adjusted operating income of approximately $1.4 billion declined nearly 19% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued pharmacy client price improvements, lower contributions from 340B and a previously announced loss of a large client. This decrease was partially offset by improved purchasing economics. Total pharmacy claims processed in the quarter were nearly 463 million, and total pharmacy membership as of the end of the quarter was approximately 90 million members. We continue to drive growth in our Health Care Delivery assets. Signify generated revenue growth of 24% compared to the same quarter last year. Oak Street ended the quarter with 205 centers, an increase of 33 centers year-over-year. We continue to expect to add 50 to 60 centers in 2024. At-risk members at Oak Street ended the quarter at 211,000, an increase of 34,000 year-over-year. Oak Street also significantly increased revenue in the quarter, growing over 25% compared to the same quarter last year. In our Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment, we generated revenue of approximately $29 billion, reflecting an increase of nearly 3% versus the prior year and over 5% on a same-store basis. Drivers of this revenue growth in the PCW segment included increased prescription volume with increased contributions from vaccinations as well as pharmacy drug mix. These revenue increases were partially offset by the impact of recent generic introductions, continued reimbursement pressure, a decrease in store count and lower contributions from OTC test kits. Adjusted operating income was approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of approximately 4% versus the prior year, driven by increased prescription volume, improved drug purchasing and lower operating expenses, including the impact of store closures. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure. Same-store pharmacy sales were up over 7% versus the prior year, and same-store prescription volumes increased by nearly 6%. Same-store front store sales were down by about 2% versus the same quarter last year, but up 1% when excluding OTC test kits. As a reminder, the public health emergency was still active during the first quarter of last year. Shifting to liquidity and our capital position. First quarter cash flow from operations was $4.9 billion. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion of cash at the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries. In the first quarter, we returned $840 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend. We also completed our $3 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction, retiring approximately 40 million shares in the quarter. We do not expect to repurchase any additional shares for the remainder of 2024. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 4x. This leverage ratio was higher than we expect to maintain on a normalized basis. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings. Turning now to our full year outlook for 2024. As Karen mentioned, we revised our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance to at least $7 to reflect our first quarter results as well as our updated expectations for the remainder of 2024. In our Health Care Benefits segment, we now expect adjusted operating income of at least $3.6 billion, down from our previous guidance of at least $5.4 billion. We now expect our 2024 medical benefit ratio to be approximately 89.8%, an increase of 210 basis points from our previous guidance. In the first quarter, Health Care Benefits medical costs, primarily attributable to Medicare Advantage, came in approximately $900 million above our expectations. If we break that down further, we estimate that roughly $500 million of that variance is specific to the quarter or seasonal, including the larger-than-expected impact of seasonal respiratory and RSV costs and a return to inpatient seasonality patterns that look much more like pre-pandemic periods. As Karen mentioned, early indicators for April inpatient authorization support our current seasonality projections and their return to pre-COVID patterns. We have also raised our expectations for RSV-related costs in the second half based on our experience in the first quarter. The remaining approximately $400 million of medical cost pressure in the first quarter is driven by elevated utilization trend that our guidance now assumes will persist for the remainder of 2024. The primary drivers of this projected variance include outpatient service categories, such as mental health and medical pharmacy, as well as supplemental benefits such as dental. Partially offsetting some of this pressure is better-than-expected volumes, expense management and increased net investment income, which together are expected to contribute approximately $500 million more than we assumed in our previous full year guidance, with roughly half of this offset occurring in the first quarter. In our Health Services segment, we are updating our estimate for 2024 adjusted operating income to at least $7 billion, a decrease of approximately $400 million. The majority of this adjustment is attributable to health care delivery, predominantly in our CVS Accountable Care business, driven by Medicare utilization and some out-of-period pressure. We also saw some modest utilization pressure on Oak Street during the quarter and are including a provision for higher trends for the remainder of the year in our updated guidance. The remainder of the pressure is in our other businesses in the Health Services segment, primarily driven by volume and mix trends and the associated impact on our ability to deliver on network and client guarantees. Our expectations for the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment remain the same with adjusted operating income of at least $5.6 billion. This outlook incorporates a cautious stance on consumer activity over the remainder of the year due to slowing front store activity in the first quarter. We now expect 2024 share count to be approximately 1.265 billion shares and our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25.6%. Finally, we updated our expectation for cash flow from operations to at least $10.5 billion in 2024. You can find additional details on the components of our updated 2024 guidance on our Investor Relations web page. We plan to share more detailed 2025 guidance later this year. But in an effort to help investors build reasonable expectations for next year, we wanted to share some preliminary thoughts on our outlook. Within Health Care Benefits, our Medicare Advantage business is projected to generate between $65 billion and $70 billion in revenues in 2024, but will experience significant losses. We are committed to driving meaningful improvements in our Medicare Advantage margins in 2025. Given our projected baseline performance, 2025 will be the first step in a 3- to 4-year journey to get back to our target margins of 4% to 5%. Improved Star Ratings in 2025 could represent a $700 million tailwind depending on membership retention levels, but also reduces our ability to adjust certain benefits. The remainder of our margin improvement in 2025 will be a function of pricing actions in an environment where we are facing headwinds from an insufficient rate notice and prescription drug coverage changes that substantially increase plan liability. We will take material pricing and benefit design actions for 2025, and the impact of those changes will depend on how cost trends develop in both 2024 and 2025 and how the market responds to those trends. In Health Care Benefits' other business lines, we are building strong momentum. We are planning for another year of margin progression in our Individual Exchange business. We've seen success in the group commercial selling season this year and were recently awarded several key Medicaid RFPs. In our Health Services segment, early progress of our Cordavis business is encouraging and supports our innovative approach to the biosimilar opportunity, driving differential savings for our PBM customers. In our Health Care Delivery business, we are committed to improving margins in CVS Accountable Care. Oak Street's margin trajectory will be supported by meaningful patient enrollment and a realignment of Medicare Advantage benefits as the market adjusts to elevated utilization. Signify continues to show impressive growth and is building momentum into 2025. We have received a strong early reception to our new pharmacy [ model ], which creates potential for outperformance in our PCW segment. As Karen mentioned, we are accelerating multiyear enterprise productivity initiatives to streamline and optimize our operations. Finally, our framework contemplates a stable share count in 2025. While many uncertainties remain that could drive a wide range of outcomes, including our 2024 baseline performance and the potential that medical cost trends subside as compared to our current outlook, at this distance, our goal remains to deliver low double-digit adjusted EPS growth in 2025. Our team remains committed to executing against the opportunities to outperform this guidance. With that, we will now open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : A couple of questions here. First, on the cost trend in the first quarter, would like to get some more detail on the $500 million that you said is in Q1 that's not going to reoccur, right? I think everyone would like to get comfort that the $7 is a baseline that we can be comfortable with. So if that's not reoccurring, can you just walk us through what the moving parts are there? For instance, it looks to me like your PYD was $200 million below the last couple of years. Maybe that's a big part -- that's clearly a big part of it. How much was RSV? Any other moving parts? Anything you could do to get us comfortable that, that $500 million is seasonal would be a good start. Tom Cowhey : Justin, it's Tom. So the largest impact within that -- within the quarter is the seasonality adjustment on inpatient. And as I noted in the prepared remarks, our April authorization data supports our updated seasonality projection as we did experience some negative prior year development in the quarter, and that is clearly part of the $500 million. But as you look at where that occurred, that was really in some of our inpatient categories where the trends restated negatively. And so you saw the beginning of that uptick. You saw an uptick, again, January admits were higher than our expectations. February was improved versus January. March was improved versus February. And so we've seen really a -- we saw a spike earlier in the quarter, which really started, in hindsight, in the fourth quarter. And as you look at that pattern, it very closely resembles what we would have seen in a 2018, 2019 period trended forward. And so that gives us a lot of comfort as we look at what we're seeing now versus what the historic patterns pre-COVID looked like that a lot of this was actually seasonal. So if you take out the prior period developments, you also had some provider liabilities that were settled inside the quarter. As we did have some policy liberalizations that took place inside the quarter, I mean, they've been reinstated since the quarter end, so that should not be an ongoing impact. And then there were some other onetime impacts, including the initial reserve build for some of our new membership growth that would be incorporated inside that $500 million. We also -- as you noted, we did see some RSV in the quarter. We did make a revision for some of those costs of the $500 million to recur in the back half of the year, but we're not projecting that the vast majority of those costs are going to be part of the run rate, unlike the $400 million that we're pulling through. Justin Lake : Got it. And then just some color on the Medicare Advantage margin and improvement in any offset. So right now, it looks like, if I estimate your MA margins, I was thinking minus 3%, minus 4% negative. Is that the right ballpark? How much of an improvement -- you said material improvement, that would seem -- if you got a couple 100 basis points there, by my estimate, that's $0.70, $0.80 alone. So can you talk us through how much improvement would you think is material to get back that trajectory to the over 3 to 4 years? And anything that would be an offset there, any kind of onetime benefits this year, like bonuses, things like that, that would work against it would be helpful. And I'll jump on the queue. Tom Cowhey : Justin, great question. So as you think about Medicare Advantage, as I said, it's a $65 billion to $70 billion revenue portfolio today. And our goal for next year is that we would get about 200 basis points of margin improvement in that business or up to that amount. And we obviously haven't finalized our bids yet. You're in probably the right ZIP code as you think about what the margin is on the -- or implied margin is on the Medicare business. As you think about that business, we talked last quarter about the fact that it was going to be breakeven in our current projections, and we lowered the guidance in Health Care Benefits by $1.8 billion, and so the majority of that is related to Medicare. So we've given you all the pieces to kind of understand why we think it will lose a significant amount of money this year. But as you think about improvement there, obviously, there's a lot of work that we still need to do to understand what benefits we're going to adjust and what ones we can and can't. Our Stars is a tailwind, but also impacts our ability to adjust because it lowers our TBC availability on that national PPO contract. And maybe, Brian, do you want to give a little bit of color how you're thinking about bids and margin improvement? Brian Kane : Sure. Thanks, Justin. So I would talk about 2025 in terms of headwinds and tailwinds. Let me just walk through those. So obviously, we have a very significant high trend that we are absolutely going to incorporate into our pricing. And so the trends that Tom talked about for 2024, we will reflect again in 2025. So that's clearly a headwind, but we're not going to miss on trend. We've talked in the past about the Part D changes, which is a really important element here, and there's really 2 elements of that. One is that the benefit has been enriched pretty significantly by the IRA. And then secondly, the plan is on the hook for greater liability in the catastrophic layer in that we get less reinsurance than we used to. And so we intend to price for that and be very thoughtful around that. Third, as we -- as Karen mentioned in her remarks, the rates that we received were clearly disappointing and not sufficient to make up the trend pressures and IRA pressures that we're seeing. And then finally, as Tom mentioned, around TBC, that's clearly a limitation that we need to be focused on. It's focused on the general enrollment block. It does not apply to D-SNP, and it does not apply to certain supplemental benefits as well, which we'll be very focused on to make sure we rightsize for 2025 pricing. As we think about tailwinds, though, Tom mentioned the Stars tailwind, which is about $700 million, assuming a stabilized membership, and I'll come back and talk about that a little bit. With respect to the pricing actions, we're going to be very focused on taking those pricing actions, as I mentioned, to incorporate the trends, but also be mindful of how we think about TBC. Stars does impact TBC in that it reduces the amount of allowance we have under the regs. But as I mentioned, there are opportunities we have to trim benefits around TBC, and we will be very focused on doing that. On the D-SNP product, our intention is to reduce our supplemental benefits in certain areas, including some of the kind of FlexCards that we put in the market this year. And so you'll see us reduce those benefits, and that allows us to capture margin without impacting TBC, and so that's important. The other point I'd make, and Karen and Tom alluded to it, we will be taking actions around certain service areas. So to the extent that we don't believe we can credibly recapture margin in a reasonable period of time, we will exit those counties. We will also be looking at areas where we believe that it makes sense to actually discontinue a specific product, then reintroduce a new product where TBC won't apply. And we'll be looking at those opportunities as well, being mindful of the member disruption and some of the churn that you might see. And so as we step back, we are very focused on margin over membership. Obviously, we're trying to create a stable book with respect to our membership. As we think about the membership impacts, I think there are several things that go into that calculation. One is we believe there will be significant disruption in the PDP market. And the med sup market, we're going to see prices go up. We're going to see people exit certain plans, and we know prices are increasing on med sup. And so that will be a tailwind to our membership projections, offset by the fact, as I mentioned, as we've all mentioned, that we're going to be taking significant pricing actions. And really, it's going to depend on what our competitors do. We believe that they're rational. We believe they're seeing similar type trends, and so they're going to price as well for some of these pressures. But that's something that we'll have to calibrate as we get into pricing. And as I mentioned, there will be some service area reductions. But again, the focus is on margin over membership. If there's a membership reduction, it's relatively small impacts on margin, and we're focused on making sure we price this product appropriately for 2025 and beyond. Karen Lynch : Yes. Justin, I'm just going to reiterate what I said in my prepared remarks. We are committed to improving margin in Medicare Advantage, and we will do so by pricing for the expected trends. We will do so by adjusting benefits and exiting service counties, and we are committed to doing that. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : I just want to follow up on a few things that you said. Brian, I want to go back to your comment around membership and your expectation that the decline in Medicare Advantage membership could be small. Is that based on the assumption that the pressure we're feeling is for everybody in Medicare Advantage and that, therefore, everyone will readjust? And again, to Karen's point, you'll look at certain counties and adjusting certain plan levels, so you could lose some membership, but you're not expecting a large membership decline as you think about 2025, just with the increased cost and changing benefits, et cetera. I just want to make sure that I understand that to start. Brian Kane : Sure. And thanks for the question, Lisa. So I would say there are 2 elements here. There's the what's going to happen from an industry perspective in growth and then what we at Aetna are going to do. So on the industry side, as I mentioned, I think there are some clear tailwinds from the perspective of what's going to happen in the traditional fee-for-service market, i.e., PDP and med sup. And so as members -- potential members are evaluating their choices, they're going to have to take a look at what are the price increases and some of the disruption that's going to happen in the traditional fee-for-service market. So that would be a tailwind. I do think, though, that the industry broadly is going to be trimming benefits, in some cases, significantly and exiting from certain counties that aren't profitable. I think that's an industry issue, and I think it's clearly an Aetna focus as well. And so how that calibrates where we ultimately end up on membership is something that, again, we've got to work through bids and pricing to sort of estimate what we think our competitors are going to do. So it's hard to say right now that we won't have a meaningful decrease in membership. It's certainly possible. What -- the message we're trying to communicate is we are focused on margin over membership. And to the extent that we do have a larger-than-desired membership reduction, then that will occur, and we'll focus on the margin side. But again, I think our competitors here are rational. I think they are facing a number of similar pressures. Obviously, we have our own unique elements that we need to address as well. And so I think that calibration as well as what happens to the broader industry will really dictate where our membership goes next year. Tom Cowhey : Lisa, from a very high level, as you think about what the potential -- List, just as you -- from a very high level, as you think about what the impact of membership loss is, just when you think about the comments that we made about margin restoration relative to the implied losses in the book, and so losing additional members doesn't necessarily contribute to lost profit in 2025. Lisa Gill : And then, Tom, if I can just understand the cadence of 2024. And you, obviously, you talked about low double-digit growth in 2025. How do we think about that cadence as we're continuing throughout 2024? Anything you would specifically call out as we think about the rest of '24? Tom Cowhey : Yes. One of the things that I think is worth talking a little bit about, as you think about the Health Services segment, we do have some pressures in there that we think are Medicare market-related in the Health Care Delivery business. We also saw some timing and mix-related impacts in our other Health Services segment businesses. And we've taken a cautious stance right now on in-year recovery on those, and that's because we lost a large client there. We had some in-sourcing activity at another large client. We've had some supply shortages in some other categories. We also delayed the initial launch of our biosimilar product to April 1 from our initial plans. So accordingly, as we look at the seasonality of earnings, we think -- we currently expect that you'll see probably more like 55% to 60% of our earnings in the second half of 2024 to adjust for some of that sloping. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Rich of Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : I just wanted to follow up on some of the drivers for 2025. I guess from this point in the year, I mean, can you talk about how big of a shortfall the final rate was relative to what your current view of kind of cost trend will be for 2025? And then how are you thinking about the change in profitability for the Part D business next year in light of the benefit design changes that you've talked about? Tom Cowhey : I might leave it to Brian to talk about the Part D changes and their impact on profitability. There is a very substantial change in plan liability there, which will result in much higher premiums, which we think is going to impact both overall benefits within the bids. But also, as we think about those seniors that are currently in the market to purchase a bundle, that the cost of that bundle is going to rise pretty dramatically for them, which may, even with a less robust set of benefits, make Medicare Advantage an attractive option in 2025. The bid itself for 2025, what we received from CMS, the pricing was just disappointing. It's -- clearly, as we look at our trends, as we look at the market trends, we don't think that the rate sufficiently reflects that. We have another year of the phase-in of the risk adjustment model. There's no flexibility that's been given to date on TBC despite the material changes that we are experiencing because of the Inflation Reduction Act on Part D. And so the combination of those things just makes a tough year for 2025 pricing harder when we don't see the pull-through of what most of the market participants are experiencing into the bid baseline. And Brian, maybe you could talk a little bit more about that. Brian Kane : Sure. I mean, first, with respect to Part D, I think Tom articulated it well. There's just incremental benefits that are being offered and significant increase in plan liability. And while there'll be an increase in direct subsidy, and we're expecting that, it really isn't sufficient to cover that increased liability that the plans have. And so there's going to be a lot of discussion, I imagine, in the industry, certainly here at Aetna, about what product is ultimately viable for us as we think about the potential risks and volatility that could result from putting out a product and the impact of potential adverse selection in terms of who you attract. The types of members who use brand utilizers, specialty utilizers, et cetera, creates additional uncertainty, particularly because of that enhanced liability and the fact that the benefits are so rich that typical traditional views of insurance and getting low price and those sorts of things may or may not apply in the same way as it did. And so those are the types of things we're thinking through. And obviously, as we come back on the next quarter call, we'll give you more color about our perspective on the Part D market. We do think there's going to be disruption. We do think it's going to necessitate premium increases. And that's why there's just some uncertainty about where the ultimate industry goes from an MA perspective in terms of membership. With respect to your first question on the trend delta, look, it's obviously very significant. We've been very clear that the trends that we're seeing in 2024, which are really consistent with 2023, we expected some measure of break to a more normalized trend, as Karen and Tom said. And frankly, I think we were conservative on what a normalized trend would be. If you go back historically, even before the pandemic, for many, many years, trends were in the 3% to 5% range. We saw trends in 2023 approaching 10%. We're seeing trends in 2024 mirror those levels, exacerbated even more so by some of the seasonal factors that Tom mentioned in the first quarter. And so we're going to continue those trends into 2025. Now we have really not seen 2 years, let alone 3 years of those levels of elevated trends without break. But it's imperative that we include that in our pricing, and we intend to do that. And our expectation is our competitors will be thinking about it in a similar fashion. And so we need to think hard about how we're going to make up that delta between what we got in the pricing and what we got in trend, what we have in trend. And there are a number of levers we're going to pull. Benefits is one that clearly we're going to be focused on. Tom Cowhey : And if I just think about stepping back from your question, Nate, revenue in that product per member is clearly going to go up. It's just not clear exactly what's going to happen to the overall membership base, but we're going to price for a profitable product and what's ultimately going to be a higher premium product on Part D. Nathan Rich : Okay. Great. And sort of where I wanted to go with the follow-up, you talked, Tom, about the 200 basis points of margin improvement in the MA business next year. So that's around $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, depending on where membership shakes out, and half of that is the Stars tailwind. I think if we just look at the other $700 million on a PMPM basis, it's $10 to $15 PMPM. But it sounds like there may be some cost headwinds that are maybe offsetting the change in benefits. And so I guess I wanted to see if you could give us a rough sense of maybe the type of reduction that you're talking about in terms of the benefit design as we think about next year and then what the opportunity would be as we think 3 or 4 years down the road. Tom Cowhey : Yes, Nate, I think for competitive reasons, I don't want to get into any more than we've already given relative to the improvement or any more granularity there other than to say I think we've made it clear that everything is on the table. So there are TBC benefits that will probably get adjusted. There are non-TBC benefits that will get adjusted. We'll look at all -- like this is not an acceptable result where we're going to be for this year in terms of profitability on this block of business. And so we're going to look at everything that we can do to try to improve profits for next year and maintain some level of stability inside the book. As you're doing the bridge between '24 and '25, there are some variable expense items that are clearly going to come back in 2025. That's part of the reason that we've talked about how we're going to accelerate some of our expense efforts to try to offset any restoration of expense that would come back in 2025. It's a little early days to try to talk about what that will yield in 2025, but we're committed to taking action to help offset any headwinds there. And we'll give you more updates on that as we get to next quarter. Karen Lynch : Yes. Nate, I would just add that we continue to evaluate our overall cost structure with respect to operations, process, productivity. And we began a comprehensive review of that last year, we took actions, they're showing up this year and now we're going to accelerate other initiatives over the next few months. And as we continue to size those efforts, we'll update you throughout the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo. Stephen Baxter : Another follow-up on Medicare Advantage. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that I think you spent time looking for potential selection bias, either with new members or inside of your existing book. I'm not sure if you talked about what you actually found when you did that. So just trying to understand whether you saw greater-than-expected switching from your own members or if the step-down in profitability across the broader book was mirrored in your new membership or maybe that was something in excess of that to consider. Brian Kane : Yes. So we've looked at it very closely, as you can imagine, trying to understand whether the new members are creating disproportionate impact on our results. And we've analyzed it every which way we can. And when you look at basic results such as their emissions per thousand or their pharmacy spend or their risk or other categories of care, we're really not seeing a material difference between the new members and the old members. And so what we're really seeing is a pressure on our entire book that we are having to take action against ultimately. We looked at things, of course, and I know there's been a lot of discussion around the fitness benefit, for example. That was clearly something that was appealing to our members on the general enrollment block. It's just some of the general enrollment block in terms of selecting that benefit. When we look at the financial impact of that, actually, it's pretty modest. It's actually running in line with our pricing expectation. Some of the dental benefit enrichment that we did, we are seeing some pressure, as Tom mentioned, on that supplemental benefit. We are seeing more members use that benefit and use more of it. And so -- but that's really across the book. And so again, I don't see a selection bias between old and new members, but rather pressures throughout that we need to address for 2025. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Cherny of Leerink Partners. Michael Cherny : Maybe I'll step to Health Services for a second. I'm sure others may come back to other MA questions. But as you think about the performance in the quarter and the dynamics you're seeing about prepping both for changes in members, changes in the customer losses in terms of the large customer rollout, how do you think about the scaling dynamics of your purchasing capabilities and how that's ramping into Cordavis as you've launched that? And I guess you gave some early look there. But are there any additional signs you can give us on how you think about the financial contribution of Cordavis baked into either this year's guidance or in terms of the targets for next year? Tom Cowhey : There is a contribution from Cordavis that's embedded in our Health Services guidance. We haven't disclosed the date, Michael, what that impact is, other than to say versus our initial projection because we delayed the formulary change to 4/01, we had hoped to do it a little earlier in the year. That did have a little bit of a timing impact inside the quarter, but the adoption there has been fabulous. The client reception has been fabulous. And maybe, David, you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing there. J. Joyner: Sure. Thanks, Tom. And before I get into the actual results for the biosimilar change, maybe I'll just spend a second talking more broadly about the question you asked around control and kind of our confidence on the ability to continue to have purchasing advantages in the market. And so I go back to the strength that we have in specialty. So most of all the success we've delivered is because of our leadership position, specifically in the specialty marketplace. So we have unmatched access both across mail, retail and in the home infusion space. We have broad set of products, both in the pharmacy and the medical benefits side; continue to be a leader in the limited distribution category; continue to be a leader in the new developing cell and gene therapy marketplace. So that, combined with the technology that we've invested, has allowed us to be kind of the leading provider in this space. So that is the foundation, allowed us to have the confidence to make the change for the formulary position on April 1. So if you look and what was mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've actually had a change as of 4/01, removing Humira from the formulary and replacing it with a low list-priced biosimilar. And as we said earlier, in just 3 weeks' time, we've actually surpassed all the biosimilar volume in all of 2023. So that's -- we've been able to hit what is important in terms of control and towards the purchasing, which is that we've been able to migrate more than 90% of the volume in the first month. And then when you look specifically inside the CVS Specialty Pharmacy, where we had a set of new services around technology, access to the prescribers and the members, we've been -- we've actually had a 94% conversion rate. So it's a really powerful outcome, and I think it speaks to obviously the strength of our business. And as that translates into savings for our customers, we had mentioned that we're delivering a 50% savings on the [ 22 ] run rate for this drug. And then as you translate that into the member benefits, because we've actually moved to a low list price product and we've actually had clients adopt what we would call an intelligent benefit design, we've been able to have 80% of the members with a $0 out of pocket. So again, I think if you look at what we've done, it's a clear win for our clients, our patients, and we've also made a considerable investment in the durability of the biosimilar market. So I think all of that then contributes to the question you originally asked, which is size and scale really is generally driven, and what I would believe the strength in our purchasing economics is the ability to control and move market share. And again, this is another evidence in the market that we hope to continue down that path. Karen Lynch : Yes. Mike, I would just say on the biosimilars, obviously, it represents one of the biggest opportunities to reduce overall pharmacy cost for the U.S. health care system. As you know, it's a $100 billion market by 2030. And as you can see in the very first few weeks of our launch, we've had incredible adoption, and we continue to evaluate the pipeline of opportunities. So we are excited about the potential in the future of the biosimilar market. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Joshua Raskin : Here with Eric as well. So my question is -- well, first, just a numbers question. The $400 million in Health Care Services guidance reduction, how much of that is specifically Oak Street? And then on the MA, I hear still committed to 4 to 5, the journey starts in '25. That's very, very clear. How much of your membership is in counties that you're contemplating exiting, just sort of wholesale leaving of the market? And then also, how does the repricing of MA fit into your overall enterprise strategy as, obviously, lots of your assets sell into that channel as well? Tom Cowhey : Let me start with the HSS question, Josh, and then we can try to get to the other ones. So as you think about HSS, and we took it down by about $400 million, the majority of that reduction is the Health Care Delivery business. And the largest driver in there is unfavorability on CVS Accountable Care that came through in terms of the savings rate, which is driven by Medicare utilization, and that includes an out-of-period charge that was taken in the first quarter that's embedded in there. I'd say the remainder of that piece of a piece is really Oak Street. But as we think about the first quarter, the performance in that business was reasonably good. And so as we think about what we've seen in the broader market, we made a provision that perhaps some -- there could be some lag there in our forward outlook. We'll obviously have to see how that ultimately develops. As you think about 2023, the business did an excellent job of navigating some of the broader headwinds in the marketplace with some of their new clinical programs and how they played out over the course of the year. We're hopeful that we could see some favorability to that number over time, but we have to see how that all manifest itself in the results. Mike, I don't know, anything else that you would add? Michael Pykosz : Yes, Tom, I think you summed it up well from a financial perspective. And the thing I would add when I think about Health Care Delivery more broadly and specifically Oak Street is for the rest of '24 and really in '25 and beyond, I think there's a huge opportunity that Brian and I are working really closely on, on how do we leverage the quality of care and the ability to really bend med cost trend and drive MLR improvement, how do we leverage that more broadly across Aetna with Oak Street. And so there's a lot of things we're doing, both from adding membership from Aetna to Oak Street centers, but also leveraging some of the out-of-center capabilities we have around transitions programs and care in the home that we use at Oak Street today. Let's use that for more Aetna members. So there's a lot of opportunity here that we'll see play through in the coming years. Brian Kane : And I would just add to Mike that, as you said, we are working very closely together. And for example, while obviously, we're not going to provide color today on specific counties and the extent which counties will exit, we wouldn't do that in an Oak Street footprint as an example, right? So we're going to be very thoughtful about how we trim our book with the goal of, over time, retaining the margins and attaining the margins that Tom articulated. I'd also remind you that every 100 basis points is worth more than $500 million on a trend basis. And so if we think about where historical trends have been, if we think about where trends are today, we're in no way baking this into our assumptions. But as you think about recovery here, this has the potential to bounce back and retain those, get back to that profitability as well, which I think is important to mention. But we're going to be very thoughtful about how we think about our membership footprint. And again, the ultimate goal is membership stability, but we're going to favor margin over membership for next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore ISI. Elizabeth Anderson : I was wondering, can you talk about sort of care management tools and sort of the impact that you are thinking about in terms of their impact on '24? And then any sort of changes you're making in '24 that you think will have an impact as we think about the 2025 results for HCB? Brian Kane : Well, clearly, care management is an important tool that we use to engage our members. And we spend a lot of time sort of segmenting who our high-risk members are, who are the members who would benefit most from care management. We're actually using a lot of really advanced AI tools to identify those members. We really think we have excellent analytics to be able to pinpoint who those members are and how are we best able to engage with them or the types of things that will get them to engage with us, and then also make it easier for our care management nurses at the point of care to be able to provide the level of advice and support that a member needs. And so it's something that we're very focused on. I would tell you that we continue to roll out some of these AI capabilities that makes these programs much more effective with much better ROIs. And so while there'll be modest impacts in '24, over time, we expect that to be a differentiator for us. And so we're very focused there. Michael Pykosz : Yes, I would just add to that, and this is where the partnership between Health Care Delivery and Aetna comes in. Between Signify and some of the capabilities we have at Oak Street, there's a lot of boots on the ground, in-market capabilities that we have to really change the health trajectory of patients, whether that be readmissions to the hospital or managing your most complex chronic patients. And so this is where I think a lot of that partnership plays out is in that space of getting a deeper level of impact because we have the resources, we have the programs, we have the know-how. Now we can extend those over a lot more members. And so I think both Signify and Oak Street will bring a lot to the table over the coming years on how we can really bend that cost trend. Operator : Our final question comes from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Ann Hynes : You talked about pharmacy services. There were some pressure on mix and also your inability to make prior guarantees. Can you just elaborate on both comments? Is the prior guarantee a diabetes issue given the GLP class? Tom Cowhey : It's not a diabetes issue. Think of it as the -- we have to have projections about what the mix looks like to ensure that we appropriately hit all of our client guarantees. And with the changing mix inside the quarter, given some of the disruptions that we saw not only with the loss of a large client, but with the in-sourcing of another client's business and some of the disruptions in the marketplace in terms of volumes, specifically GLP-1s was part of that, we were -- we missed our guarantees by a little bit. We'll see how we're able to recoup that over the remainder of the year. But at this point, what we've assumed is that, that first quarter is permanent and that we can get back to our previous projections for the remainder of the year. David, anything you'd add to that? J. Joyner: No, I think that's consistent with the way we see it. I will just add one thing on GLP-1. Obviously, it's -- there's been a lot of volatility, one, because of supply constraints that we've experienced and, obviously, a lot of work around managing what we would see as this unprecedented demand, combined with a very challenging price point, is leading to a lot of energy around how to best manage this category through whether it be formulary, more aggressive utilization management and then the broader care management wrappers on this. But this category alone is driving obviously significant costs for our clients, and it's also driving significant expense within our organization just to support what is now one of our highest drivers of call volume around people trying to find access to the product and making sure that we get consistent supply in the market. So we believe we've got a really strong set of programs and services to manage the category. And we believe once there's competition and adequate supply, we'll be able to have more consistency around how we manage this category. Karen Lynch : And as we close the call, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank our colleagues for their many contributions, and we look forward to providing you updates throughout the year. Thank you for joining the call today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect [ your lines ].",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning or good afternoon all and welcome to the CVS Health Q2 2024 earnings conference call. My name is Adam and I\u2019ll be your Operator today. If you\u2019d like to ask a question at the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, you may do so by pressing star followed by one on your telephone keypad. I will now hand the floor to Larry McGrath to begin. Larry, please go ahead when you\u2019re ready. Larry McGrath : Good morning and welcome to the CVS Health second quarter 2024 earnings call and webcast. I\u2019m Larry McGrath, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations for CVS Health. I\u2019m joined this morning by Karen Lynch, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tom Cowhey, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll host a question and answer session that will include additional members of our leadership team. Our press release and slide presentation have been posted to our website along with our Form 10-Q filed this morning with the SEC. Today\u2019s call is also being broadcast on our website, where it will be archived for one year. During this call, we\u2019ll make certain forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently projected results. We strongly encourage you to review the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties, in particular those that are described in the cautionary statements concerning forward-looking statements and risk factors in our most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed this morning, and our recent filings on Form 8-K, including this morning\u2019s earnings press release. During this call, we\u2019ll use non-GAAP measures when talking about the company\u2019s financial performance and financial condition, and you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in this morning\u2019s press release and in the reconciliation documents posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Karen. Karen? Karen Lynch : Thank you Larry. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call today. Today we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.83 and adjusted operating income of $3.7 billion for the quarter. Our total revenues were more than $91 billion and we generated $8 billion of operating cash flow in the first half of the year. We are also updating our full year 2024 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $6.40 to $6.55, based on the continued pressure in our healthcare benefits business offset by strong performance in health services and the pharmacy and consumer wellness business. The majority of our businesses are performing well and we continue to drive the integrated value of our company by executing on our strategy to connect people to the care and the coverage they need. However, we are disappointed by the current performance and outlook for the healthcare benefits segment, and I have decided to make leadership changes. Effective immediately, Brian Kane is leaving the company. In the interim, I will assume direct leadership of the healthcare benefits segment. As you know, managed care has been an integral part of both my and Tom Cowhey\u2019s professional careers and we will be overseeing the day to day management of this business. In addition, Katerina Guerraz, our Chief Strategy Officer will become the Chief Operating Officer of the healthcare benefits segment. Katerina is a 20-year Aetna veteran with extensive commercial and Medicare experience and has a track record of operational excellence. We are committed to returning healthcare benefits to its rightful place and will drive execution and address the challenges facing this business. Looking across the enterprise today, CVS Health serves more than 186 million people, and we are making continued progress in proving that our integrated model creates value. When individuals engage with two or more offerings, we can deliver better health experiences and outcomes. Over the first half of the year, we expanded the number of consumers accessing two or more CVS Health offerings to 57.7 million, an increase of nearly 2.5 million consumers. We grew the number of Aetna medical members utilizing CVS pharmacies to 9 million, an increase of 8% from the prior year. We also now have 13.8 million Aetna medical members who are covered by Caremark, an increase of 13% compared to last year. We extended our digital reach with nearly 60 million unique digital customers utilizing our platform to schedule health services appointments, fill prescriptions, and purchase wellness products, all contributing to the growth in our business. We are committed to transforming the industry with innovative pharmacy models that create greater transparency, reflect the true cost of drugs, and align incentives across stakeholders. We are driving significant progress on the adoption of CVS CostVantage and CVS Caremark TrueCost. To date, we\u2019ve signed CVS CostVantage agreements with eight pharmacy benefit managers, including CVS Caremark, who combined make up more than 50% of our commercial scripts. Discussions with our large CVM partners are active and constructive as we move forward with full implementation for our commercial contracts on January 1, 2025. Our TrueCost offering is resonating with commercial clients as they strive to ensure pricing simplicity and transparency for their members. We firmly believe that TrueCost will reshape the future of pricing for every drug, every condition, and every member. Additionally, we implemented this model for CVS Health\u2019s more than 300,000 colleagues. Biosimilars create a meaningful opportunity to deliver additional pharmacy savings to our clients. Through Cordavis, we introduce our biosimilar products at a price more than 80% lower than a reference brand, and we are the only company to move biosimilar share. We have processed approximately 100,000 Cordavis biosimilar prescriptions since we launched our formulary change on April 1, which has contributed to nearly $400 million in net savings for our clients and their members. Cordavis and its success in the biosimilar market was possible because of the combined assets of CVS Health. We will continue to expand our offerings and drive greater access and savings for our customers. Before I share updates on performance in each of our segments, I want to provide an update on the enterprise productivity initiatives we discussed on our last call. We identified a multi-year opportunity to deliver $2 billion in savings. These savings will be driven by further streamlining and optimizing our operations and processes, continuing to rationalize our business portfolio, and accelerating the use of artificial intelligence and automation across the enterprise as we consolidate and integrate platforms. We will be thoughtful and deliberate as we execute these actions to ensure we continue to meet consumer needs. These savings will create both capacity to invest in our businesses and opportunities for outperformance. Now let\u2019s look at our businesses in detail. In healthcare benefits, revenues for the quarter grew to over $32 billion and we delivered nearly $1 billion in adjusted operating income. Medical membership was nearly 27 million, primarily reflecting growth in our Medicare and individual exchange businesses. Our medical benefit ratio for the quarter was 89.6%. Utilization in our Medicare business remained at elevated levels but was largely in line with expectations. Following the close of the second quarter, we saw indications of potential trend acceleration which we have contemplated in our revised guidance range. Similar to others in the industry, we saw an increase in the dislocation between Medicaid acuity levels and rates. We will continue working closely with our state partners to advocate for rates that more closely align with changes in acuity. Within the quarter, our MBR also reflected the impact of the final 2023 risk adjustment for our individual exchange business. Tom will provide additional details on utilization and the risk adjustment update. In June, we submitted our bids for the 2025 Medicare Advantage plan. Our bids went through a rigorous internal review and we are confident in our pricing for 2025, which reflects prudent assumptions for utilization trends. The actions we took are expected to drive 100 to 200 basis points of margin recovery in 2025 off of our current baseline and start the multi-year pathway to achieving target margins of 4% to 5%. As we have previously discussed, we expect to see a decline in Medicare membership in 2025 driven by our margin recovery efforts. In our commercial business, we expect membership growth in 2025 driven by new business wins and strong retention, both of which are running ahead of where we were at this time last year. Our retention rate is in the high 90s with our national accounts business. In our pharmacy and consumer wellness business, we effectively navigated a changing consumer environment and delivered another strong quarter that exceeded our expectations. We grew revenues for the segment to approximately $30 billion, up nearly 4% versus the prior year, and generated $1.2 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter. Our growing pharmacy share, now at a record high of approximately 27.2%, was a meaningful contributor to these results. We continue playing a key role in delivering important community health services, as demonstrated by the approximately 2 million immunizations we administered in the quarter. We are on track to achieve our three-year goal of closing 900 stores by the end of this year, with 851 stores closed to date. We continue to exceed our goals for both colleague and script retention. As we look at the standalone stores we have remaining across our national footprint, substantially all are profitable. This measure highlights our leadership in this business and our ability to operate nationally while delivering unmatched levels of consumer service. Our position will only improve as we continue to optimize our footprint and implement innovations like CVS CostVantage. In our health services segment, we generated revenues of more than $42 billion and delivered $1.9 billion in adjusted operating income. Our pharmacy services business, the largest component of the health services segment, delivered strong results driven by the execution on core principles of this business, lowering drug costs and creating savings for our clients. We have retained approximately 99% of employer clients in the 2025 selling season. I want to take a moment to address the interim 6(b) study released by the FTC. We fundamentally disagree with the FTC\u2019s position. When you look at the data, there is clear evidence that PVMs play a crucial role in reducing drug costs. We have a decades-long track record of protecting American businesses, unions and patients from rising prices on prescription drugs. We use competition among manufacturers to help keep drug costs affordable for our members. The FTC\u2019s report focuses on issues of the past. We are leading the industry as we innovate our business model with our TrueCost offering. We believe our model helps ensure greater transparency and pricing and helps consumers to be confident in their pharmacy benefit that is providing the best possible price. Additionally, our programs help patients affordably access critical drugs like insulin. Our members on average pay less than $25 per insulin. Through our reduced Rx program, we provide access to $25 insulin to every customer, whether insured, under-insured or uninsured. We are committed to delivering value every day to our clients and our members. In our healthcare delivery business, we are driving meaningful progress connecting patients to health services across all of our channels : primary and acute care, health services in the home, and clinical programs. Signify exceeded expectations, delivering another quarter of record volume. We also continue to grow our patient base among Medicare Advantage members with our primary care clinics. Oak Street at-risk patients grew to 235,000, up nearly 30% over the same quarter last year. We are accelerating opportunities that drive integrated value by connecting Signify and Oak Street to CVS Health assets, such as Aetna, MinuteClinic, and CVS Pharmacy. Since we closed our healthcare delivery acquisition, Signify now serves nearly twice as many Aetna members and to date, the number of Aetna members at Oak Street clinics has more than tripled. We expect this number to further expand as we introduce co-branded Aetna and Oak Street plans in the 2025 annual enrolment period. We continue to use the powerful relationship we have with patients at the pharmacy counter. This quarter, we saw a seven-times increase in the number of pharmacy scheduled IEGs compared to last quarter. We have many points of differentiation that position CVS Health to win. Our biggest differentiator is how we are bringing our assets together to deliver integrated solutions for our customers. We are working effectively to address the challenges we face in 2024. The steps we are taking include our disciplined approach to Medicare Advantage pricing, progress on our innovative pharmacy model and our biosimilar strategy, early wins in both CareMark and Aetna selling season, and accelerating the integration of healthcare delivery assets. These actions combined with our multi-year productivity initiatives and improved operational performance in our healthcare benefits segment give us the confidence that we are building positive momentum as we look to 2025 and beyond. I will now pass it over to Tom for a more detailed view of our second quarter results. Tom? Tom Cowhey : Thank you Karen, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I\u2019ll start with a few highlights on total company performance. Second quarter revenues were approximately $91.2 billion, an increase of approximately 2.6% over the prior year quarter, reflecting growth in our healthcare benefits and pharmacy and consumer wellness segments. We delivered adjusted operating income of over $3.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.83. We also generated year-to-date cash flow from operations of approximately $8 billion, a lower result as compared to the same period last year, primarily due to timing of Medicare payments and the impact of Medicare utilization. Let\u2019s look at some of the performance of our segments. In our healthcare benefits segment, we delivered strong revenue growth versus the prior year. Second quarter revenues of approximately $32.5 billion increased by over 21% year-over-year, reflecting growth across all product lines. Medical membership grew to nearly 27 million members, an increase of 200,000 members sequentially, reflecting growth in Medicare and Medicaid products including the Oklahoma Medicaid contract, which went live on April 1. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was approximately $938 million, down year-over-year due to a higher medical benefit ratio, partially offset by an increase in net investment income. Our medical benefit ratio of 89.6% increased 340 basis points from the prior year quarter primarily reflecting higher Medicare Advantage utilization, the premium impact of lower Star ratings for the payment year 2024, the impact of higher acuity in Medicaid, and the change in estimate for individual exchange risk adjustment accrual for the 2023 plan year. These increases were partially offset by the favorable year-over-year impact of prior period development. In Medicare Advantage, strong prior period reserve development improved our first quarter medical cost trend estimates, but we continued to see elevated trends in the second quarter largely in the same categories we previously discussed, including in-patient, supplemental benefits such as dental, and also in pharmacy. Following the close of the quarter, we have seen some evidence of an acceleration of trends in these same categories, which informed our view of risks for the remainder of 2024. We also experienced medical cost pressures in our Medicaid business. This pressure is largely driven by higher acuity resulting from member redeterminations. We believe this dislocation will self-correct over time as we continue to work closely with our state partners to ensure the underlying trends are reflected in our rates, but we have not assumed material improvement in our 2024 outlook. During the quarter, we received final 2023 risk adjustment data for our individual exchange business. As a result, we increased our risk adjustment accrual for the 2023 plan year by approximately $225 million. We were disappointed to see such a large change in the final update. We believe this change was in part driven by the significant growth and disruption in the market, particularly late in 2023. For 2024, our population contains a significantly higher proportion of renewing members, and we continue to enhance our revenue integrity efforts to ensure we are appropriately capturing their acuity. As a result of this update, we now expect margins for our individual exchange business to be below breakeven this year; however, we are confident that our 2025 submitted rate filings, which we further enhanced following the 2023 risk adjustment update, will place us back on our multi-year margin trajectory. Medical cost trends in our commercial business remain elevated but are broadly in line with our expectations and pricing. Days claims payable at the end of the quarter were 43.1 days, down 1.4 days sequentially and 3.8 days from the prior year quarter. The decrease versus the prior quarter was primarily driven by elevated reserves held in the first quarter of 2024, including the impact of the Change Healthcare cyber attack. The year-over-year change in DCP was primarily driven by growth in our Medicare business and the impact of increased pharmacy trends. We remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. Our health services segment generated revenue of approximately $42.2 billion, a decrease of approximately 9% year-over-year primarily driven by the previously announced loss of a large client and continued pharmacy client price improvement. These decreases were partially offset by pharmacy drug mix, increased contributions from our healthcare delivery assets, and growth in specialty pharmacy. Adjusted operating income of approximately $1.9 billion increased over 1% from the prior year quarter, reflecting improved purchasing economics partially offset by continued pharmacy client price improvements and the previously announced loss of a large client. Total pharmacy claims processed in the quarter were approximately $471 million, and total membership as of the end of the quarter was approximately 90 million members. We continue to be encouraged by the performance and growth our healthcare delivery assets. Signify completed its second consecutive quarter of record volume and generated revenue growth of 27% over the prior year. Oak Street also significantly increased revenue in the quarter, growing approximately 32% compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting strong membership and clinic growth. Oak Street ended the quarter with 207 centers, an increase of 30 centers year-over-year. Despite a challenging and dynamic operating environment in Medicare, we continue to see strong profitability of mature clinics and a consistent ramp in profitability of our newer clinics. We are encouraged by Oak Street\u2019s performance, which remains in line with our prior outlook, and remain committed to growing our center footprint and expanding access to this leading care model. Our pharmacy and consumer wellness segment generated revenue of approximately $29.8 billion, reflecting an increase of 3.7% versus the prior year and 6.4% on a same store basis. The primary drivers of this revenue growth were increased prescription volume and pharmacy drug mix, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure, the impact of recent generic introductions, and lower front store volumes. Adjusted operating income was approximately $1.2 billion. This result was lower than the prior year quarter due to continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure, decreased front store volume, and the timing of certain Medicare payments related to a CMS request. These impacts were partially offset by increased prescription volume, improved drug purchasing, and pharmacy drug mix. This quarter, same store pharmacy sales were up over 9% versus the prior year, and same store prescription volumes increased by 6.5%. We continued to increase our script share during the quarter, achieving a 27.2% retail pharmacy share. Our results continue to demonstrate we are the best run national pharmacy chain in the country. Same store front store sales were down by about 4% versus the same quarter last year. Excluding OTC test kits, same store front store sales were down about 2%, reflective of general softening of consumer demand. As a reminder, the public health emergency was active through mid-May last year. Shifting now to liquidity and our capital position, through the second quarter, we generated year-to-date cash flow from operations of approximately $8 billion. During the quarter, we returned $858 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend and ended the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion of cash at the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings. Turning now to our full year outlook for 2024, as Karen mentioned, we are lowering our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $6.40 to $6.65 per share. This revision reflects our performance through the second quarter and our latest expectations for the remainder of the year. Let me walk you through the major drivers of change. In our healthcare benefits segment, we now expect adjusted operating income in a range of $2.25 billion to $2.55 billion. We expect HCB\u2019s full year medical benefit ratio to be in a range of 90.6% to 90.8%, an increase of 80 to 100 basis points versus our prior guidance. At the midpoint, our MBR shows a 150 basis point increase from the first half to the second half of 2024, consistent with historical patterns. In our Medicare Advantage block, first half results remain largely in line with our prior expectations, although they have developed differently than we previously projected. Medical cost trends remained elevated in the second quarter at levels consistent with our restated first quarter experience, which benefited from strong prior period development; however, early indicators for July suggest we may see incremental pressure, particularly in in-patient. As a result, our updated guidance range now reflects the trends in the second half of 2024 could be higher than levels seen in the first half. It is worth noting that if trends persist at elevated levels, we may be required to take an in-year 2024 premium deficiency reserve in our Medicare business. While this premium deficiency reserve should not have an impact on our revised full year expectations for the healthcare benefits segment, it could change the cadence of earnings between the third and fourth quarters. At this time, we have no expectation that we will need a premium deficiency reserve related to our Medicare Advantage block for 2025. Our updated guidance also reflects the continuation of the Medicaid acuity pressure we saw in the second quarter. Our teams are working closely with state partners to align Medicaid rates with higher acuity; however, we are assuming no material improvement in the dislocation between rates and acuity through the second half of 2024. In our individual exchange business, given the magnitude of the negative surprise we experienced in our 2023 update, our outlook now reflects a provision for potential variability in our 2024 risk adjustment position as our data matures over the remainder of the calendar year. As noted, we believe this variability has been appropriately reflected in our recently updated pricing for 2025. In our health services segment, we are increasing our estimates for 2024 adjusted operating income by a range of $200 million to $250 million, or $7.2 billion to $7.25 billion. This increase reflects the return to strong performance in our pharmacy services business in the second quarter, as well as the continuation of this exceptional execution through the remainder of the year. There is no change to the outlook for our healthcare delivery assets as these businesses continue to perform in line with our expectations. In our pharmacy and consumer wellness segment, we now project adjusted operating income to increase by $100 million to $150 million, or to $5.7 billion to $5.75 billion. While we recognize that there have been macro shifts in the economic and consumer dynamics, our pharmacy and consumer wellness segment continues to highlight the importance of our community health locations to the consumers we serve, reflected in our growing pharmacy market share. As a result, we are pulling some of the strong first half performance into our expectations for the full year. Finally, we updated our expectation for cash flow from operations to approximately $9 billion in 2024. This decrease is primarily driven by the timing of reinsurance premiums from CMS primarily related to our standalone prescription drug products, and the impact of lower HCB earnings. The Part D receivable increase will be repaid by CMS during the fourth quarter of 2025. You can find additional details on the components of our updated 2024 guidance on our Investor Relations webpage. We plan to share more detailed 2025 guidance later this year, but I wanted to provide some updates to our previous expectations for 2025. In Medicare Advantage, we remain committed to driving meaningful improvements in our margins in 2025. As we look at the sources of pressure we discussed in our updated 2024 guidance, not all of these sources will translate into pressure on our 2025 bids. Notably within our 2025 bids, we made meaningful adjustments to our offerings, including supplemental benefits and Part D, both sources of incremental pressure in 2024. We currently project that we will improve Medicare Advantage margins between 100 and 200 basis points in 2025. This will be a significant first step to achieving our target margins of 4% to 5% over the next several years. For our individual exchange business, we had the opportunity to re-file our bids to reflect the latest risk adjustment data and prudently reflected those updates in our 2025 bids. As a result, we continue to expect profit improvement in that business in 2025. In Medicaid, we believe the dislocation between acuity and rates is temporary and will be largely resolved through the next pricing cycle. In Karen\u2019s remarks, she highlighted the work our team has underway to deliver on a multi-year enterprise productivity initiative. In 2025, we expect savings from this initiative to drive at least $500 million of adjusted operating earnings. We are encouraged by our deliberate efforts to strengthen our outlook and generate meaningful positive momentum for 2025 and beyond. As is our customary practice, we will give more formal guidance later this year. With that, we will now open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] The first question today comes from Lisa Gill from JP Morgan. Lisa, please go ahead, your line is open. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much, good morning Karen and Tom. I just wanted to start with the health benefits business. If I go back to last quarter and we talked about the level of visibility that you had around cost trends, and then I heard your comments, Karen, that as you closed Q2, the trend accelerated, so really two questions here. One, can you talk about the level of visibility that you have when we think about the trend going into the back half of the year, and then secondly, can you talk about what was included in the 2025 bids? You talked about your level of confidence that you have that you\u2019re prudent in those bids, but if you were seeing the trend accelerate coming out of Q2, were you able to capture that in the bids for 2025? Karen Lynch : Yes Lisa, I\u2019ll start with the 2025 bids. I feel like we have a high degree of confidence that we caught the trend for 2025 bids. We took a very prudent approach - we talked about that last quarter, relative to elevated trends and that we expected elevated trends for the rest of the year and into next year, so we feel very confident. I had a cross-enterprise team looking at the bids throughout the entire bid cycle, and we feel good that we\u2019ll achieve the 100 to 200 basis points of margin recovery - that\u2019s what we expect. Relative to utilization in the quarter, I\u2019ll ask Tom to comment on that. Tom Cowhey : Hey Lisa. As you look at the trends, there is a lot of things going on inside the quarter. The first quarter re-stated quite positively. A lot of that, we think was a function of change. We actually saw some strong restatement in in-patient in first quarter trends, but then as we looked at what happened in the second quarter, we actually--the Medicare trends quarter-over-quarter, they were roughly flat but at a lower level than what we experienced, or thought we\u2019d experience in the first quarter. In-patient trends were consistent but at an elevated level, and then we continued to see some elevated trends in outpatient. We saw some pressure in supplemental benefits, such as dental, and also in pharmacy. We also saw some categories such as--we talked a little bit about the outpatient pharmacy, that we had seen that pressure in the first quarter. We saw some positive restatement there and actually some deceleration of trends, which was a nice offset. Our current outlook, we think prudently incorporates where we are for the remainder of the year, but as you think about the bids, part of the question here is where exactly does this manifest? We had a substantial amount of contingency as we look at our 2024 baseline for those bids, and remember for 2025, we assumed that same level of trend persists for effectively a third year in 2025 at essentially a double-digit rate, very, very high abnormal trends. When you step back and look at where we\u2019ve seen some of the pressure this quarter, dental for example has been completely restructured in our 2025 bids, and so if we see pressure there throughout the remainder of the year, it\u2019s unlikely to translate. Part D, as we all know, has been completely restructured for 2025, and so we\u2019re not--we don\u2019t believe that\u2019s some of the pressure that we\u2019re seeing there is also going to carry over, because those bids have been rebuilt from the ground up. I would also highlight, you saw some of the changes in CMS Star ratings. We did actually get a nice tailwind in that one of our important HMO contracts done in Florida flipped over to four stars, which will also create an incremental tailwind, and so we feel good about the range of outcomes that we\u2019ve talked about, 100 to 200 basis points of margin improvement, and there are many scenarios where we think the high end of that range is entirely achievable. Lisa Gill : Tom, you\u2019ve talked about membership declines, I think Karen mentioned that today also, and you\u2019ve said in a public forum up to 10%. Should that be our assumption for \u201925, that you could lose up to 10% of your membership in MA? Tom Cowhey : I think when we were out earlier last quarter, we talked about a range of 5% to 10%. That\u2019s a good baseline, but I also want to just highlight, why is it that we expect to lose that membership. It\u2019s because there were some county exits - that\u2019s a small portion of what we think the lost membership will be. As you think about, though, where our assumptions have made some significant dislocation is where we\u2019ve had--we didn\u2019t have a product that we thought we could get back to target margins over the time period that we have, and so we pulled those products, and then we re-filed a new product with a different set of benefits that we would not have been able to achieve by just changing our existing benefit structure. We believe we\u2019ve been fairly prudent given the level of disruption that is likely in the marketplace next year and assuming that those terms and resells are going--those resells are going to happen at a much lower rate than what we have historically experienced, but should we see some upside from that, it is likely going to be, in terms of membership relative to that range of 5% to 10% down, it\u2019s going to be in products where we restructure the benefits, so we don\u2019t necessarily feel that\u2019s a bad thing. In other words, I don\u2019t know that losing membership is part of the path to profitability, we think that a lot of that has been incorporated just simply into the bid pricing. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Lake at Wolfe Research. Justin, please go ahead, your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. First question is on 2025. You previously talked about double-digit EPS growth next year. Is that still the target off your updated estimates, and what are some the key headwinds, tailwinds there beyond the 100 to 200 basis points of MA improvement you\u2019re talking about? Karen Lynch : Yes Justin, thanks for the question. Our goal obviously is double digits, and we\u2019re striving to achieve that - that\u2019s the goal. We\u2019ll provide more detailed guidance later in the year, but let me have Tom walk you through the headwinds and the tailwinds as we think about 2025. Tom Cowhey : Yes, I talked a little bit about this in the prepared remarks, Justin, but I think just highlighting again, our goal is to grow double digits, but we want to see how the remainder of the year plays out, and we\u2019ll provide guidance as we normally do officially later this year. I would say as you look across the businesses, I just would remind investors that we\u2019ve seen strong performance in health services, we\u2019ve seen strong performance in pharmacy and consumer wellness, and we are encouraged by the momentum in both of those businesses. The real question then, of course, becomes Aetna, and so let me break down a couple of the big pieces in there that I think we would like you to focus on. First, the individual business - we made significant price increases in our baseline for 2025. That is likely to yield a slightly lower membership base, but with a much higher profit margin than where we are this year. When we then learned about how 2023 risk adjustment had backed up on us, we actually--as part of the process when that happens, you actually have the opportunity to re-open your bids, and so we worked with our state partners and we put incremental rate into certain key states after receiving the 2023 risk adjustment update, so we feel good about our ability to make progress there. In Medicaid, there are price increases that will go into effect on nearly half of our book on January 1, 2025, and we\u2019re also--I would say there are some isolated pockets on some very specific issues in certain states, where we\u2019re seeing some isolated pressure, and we\u2019re working with those states to see what we can do to enhance some of our medical management to try to improve the trend outlook there as well, so we feel good about our ability to improve the outlook for that business. Now, I will also just note, we do have a large win in Texas that will have some start-up costs associated with that next year. In Medicare Advantage, I talked about this, we did make meaningful adjustments to our offerings. We feel good about our ability to get 100 to 200 basis points in improved margin in 2025, and then if medical costs were to subside from our current outlook, which effectively carries this very high level of trend and then a little more based on what we saw in early July throughout the remainder of the year, if some of that were to subside, there\u2019s obviously upside from that because we\u2019ve been very explicit about what our trend assumptions are. We have line of sight to over $500 million of incremental cost savings in 2025, and we believe that we have the opportunity to drive $2 billion worth of cost savings over time. Those efficiencies are going to allow us to drive results both for shareholders but also invest in our products, processes, infrastructure. We think these are the right things to do. A lot of them were underway, but we really accelerated our focus on delivering near term value to help improve our outlook. When you pull all of that together, again we feel like we have a lot of positive momentum. Our goal is to grow double digits and we\u2019re going to update investors later this year. Justin Lake : Then just a quick follow-up on the question around Medicare Advantage. You mentioned, Tom, cost trends elevated, you saw more in July. Where is Medicare cost trend running coming out of July? What are you assuming for the back half of the year, and remind us what you put into your bids for next year relative to that number. Then lastly, can you share just what percentage of members in 2025 in MA will see their products pulled, or have to change products? Thanks. Tom Cowhey : I\u2019ll answer the last one first. You\u2019ll have some better insights into that when we see the open enrolment period and the landscape files later this year. Obviously how our membership is impacted is going to be highly dependent on competitor actions, and so we\u2019ll give you a better sense on what that looks like later this year. As you think about medical cost trends, remember there are certain things this year that are specific to some of the pressures this year, and so when you think about trends in the bid, we think about some of the core trends and then we look at some of the things, like supplemental benefits, separately. But we\u2019re experiencing all-in, including pharmacy, double-digit trends this year, and when you look at the core trends associated with the baseline in the bids and the baseline that we carried into 2025, it\u2019s consistent with the experience that we are seeing year to date, that we\u2019ve carried through for the next 18 months. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Stephen, your line is open, please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Yes, hi. Thank you very much for the question. I just wanted to ask about the expected MA margin improvement of the 100 to 200 basis points - obviously you\u2019d expected that closer to the 200 basis points range on the last call, so can you just talk about now, seeing where utilization is exiting the quarter, what do you think would get you to the low end of that range and what do you think would be required to drive you towards the higher end of the range? Thank you. Tom Cowhey : I think there\u2019s a wide range on the remaining results for the year, and it\u2019s really a function of how much credibility you want to assign to some of the early indicators we saw in July on the Medicare business. At the low end of that range, I think 200 is pressure; at the higher end of that range, I think 200 is very achievable. Really, Stephen, it is a function of where some of the trends over the remainder of the year manifest, so to the extent that they occur in areas where we\u2019ve restructured benefit, we clearly are going to get a reset off of that, that is not going to carry forward into 2025 I\u2019d just again highlight, though, we believe we\u2019ve been very conservative in both the baseline and the trend that we assumed in 2025, and so even at the low end of that range, depending on how it manifests itself, we still might be able to get 200 basis points of improvement next year. We really need to see just how the baseline matures over the course of the next couple of months to give you more firm guidance on that. Operator : The next question comes from Ann Hynes at Mizuho. Ann, your line is open, please go ahead. Ann Hynes : Hi, great. Thank you. In your prepared remarks, you talked about the retail cost plus [indiscernible] gain in traction with about 2% of claims, I think you said, renegotiated. Can you just give more of an update on negotiations with the last two PBMs, like maybe handicap if you think you\u2019ll be able to strike a deal with them? Just any update on negotiations, that would be great. Karen Lynch : Yes Ann, just a reminder on CostVantage. We really introduced this model to simplify and address the pharmacy reimbursement model, and Prem and the team have been working with PBMs to really contract and address those pharmacy reimbursements and have had success, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks - we have eight PBM contracts already signed and underway. I\u2019ll let Prem talk more specifically about those contracts and where we\u2019re headed. Prem Shah : Yes, appreciate the question, Ann. Look - we continue to have active, productive discussions with our large PBM partners and continue to make progress in transitioning all of our commercial contracts for January 1, 2025. At the end of the day, if you think about the retail pharmacy reimbursement landscape and how it works, what we\u2019re doing with CVS CostVantage allows pharmacies to be reasonably compensated for the care and the value that they provide in the local communities, so I would say more to come in the next couple quarters, but we remain positive about where we stand at this point with CVS CostVantage and how it\u2019s resonating in the marketplace. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Eric, your line is open, please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. I\u2019d like to ask for a little bit more on the Part D marketplace, given the initial bid direct subsidy exposure and the demo program. Can you give us an idea for your response to that program, does the Part D demo help to de-risk this marketplace? Karen Lynch : Eric, we\u2019re really pleased that CMS has offered this Part D program to really stabilize the Part D premium. We have applied for the demonstration and are looking forward to working out the details, but we really do think that this was the right answer and we\u2019re very pleased. We were talking with CMS over the course of the last several months, we felt like we had influence over that and feel good about what we were able to accomplish. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Cherny from Leerink Partners. Michael, your line is open, please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Maybe to go back to Ann\u2019s question and ask it from a different direction, seeing nice traction obviously on CostVantage, and the logic behind that is fairly sound. Is your intention, if you don\u2019t get full compliance from the remaining almost 50% of the plans in place, that you\u2019re going to have a dual reimbursement structure on the commercial side, and how exactly will that work functionally for the organization in terms of your pricing mechanisms, your sourcing, etc.? Tom Cowhey : Today we have multiple reference price models in the marketplace with payors. Our intention is to move all of our commercial contracts, as I stated previously, to our CostVantage model. It benefits both payors and us in the predictability and the way cost of goods are passed through, and provides predictable, what I would say is reasonable margins for the pharmacy as it relates to that. Our expectation is that we will move the commercial market over to this. We will still have a dual market, right, because the Medicare and Medicaid contracts still exist on another platform, and as we\u2019ve said prior, we\u2019re going to move the commercial marketplace over on 1/1/25 and follow that with the Medicare and Medicaid markets at some time in the future. From my perspective, we\u2019ll be able to handle that, but our expectation is that we\u2019re moving the commercial marketplace over for 1/1/25. Operator : The next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson at Evercore ISI. Elizabeth, your line is open, please go ahead. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi guys, good morning, and thanks for the question. Maybe just to piggyback one more off of what Mike was just saying, is your expectation for those contracts, the commercial contracts that you\u2019ve moved over for 1/1/25, that those would have flat margins versus 2024? Tom Cowhey : Yes, we\u2019re not providing guidance at this point. Our expectation is to, as we\u2019ve said over the long term, if you think about what\u2019s happened with reimbursement pressure going all the way back to our analyst day, we\u2019ve talked about how it\u2019s been a headwind for retail for a very long time in this industry. What CVS CostVantage will do is over time, it will flatten that out to basically allow payors to have the benefits of our industry-leading cost of goods to get passed through in a more transparent fashion, and flatten out the reimbursement pressures over time. We haven\u2019t provided 2025 guidance yet, but the expectation of CVS CostVantage is to really do that over time and provide a floor in retail. Karen Lynch : I might ask David to talk a little bit about how that\u2019s translating on the PBM and the TrueCost and how that\u2019s flowing all the way through. David, why don\u2019t you take it? David Joyner : Yes, so Elizabeth, I think it\u2019s important that you see both sides of the equation. There\u2019s clearly recognition that there are pain points in today\u2019s price model, so you have this average market basket pricing and what we see in cross-subsidization, so both what Prem is solving for on the retail side is exactly what we\u2019re solving for in our TrueCost model with our clients. The fact is that we\u2019re hitting what I believe are the issues head on by trying to drive a new price model that both serves our customers in eliminating the price variability, and creating more simplicity and transparency at the member or the consumer level. The good news is that we\u2019ve launched TrueCost for our employees on 6/1. We launched it, what we believe is very successfully. It helps create a platform and a demonstration that the product will actually work effectively for members on a high deductible plan, and we\u2019re also beginning to evolve this and roll this model out to the rest of our book, so we\u2019re looking obviously at waves or attributes of the model and we suspect that we will have close to two-thirds of our customers on at least a couple of the attributes as we try to rebalance and create more transparency at the member level. We feel really good about the fact that we\u2019re aligning both what\u2019s happening at retail and how it then connects with how we\u2019re basically driving the model in the payor community. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Kevin, your line is open, please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. If I\u2019m just thinking through some of these--some of what we learned today, right - we have $500 million in operating savings that will flow through next year, we\u2019re going to have 100 to 200 basis points of margin in MA, you have cash flow, you also have some benefits potentially from HIX. All of those combined are well in excess of what would be 10% earnings growth off this new base, and that\u2019s not even including Stars. I\u2019m just wondering, is your expectation for Stars still the same as it had been, the Stars benefit in 2025? Is there anything that changed there? That\u2019s my first question. Karen Lynch : Yes, nothing has changed relative to our Stars. It actually improved given some of the changes that occurred earlier this quarter, and Kevin, you described what we feel is very positive momentum going into 2025. As both Tom and I talked about, we feel good about 2025 relative to that positive momentum; in addition, we have very strong retention in our Aetna book and in our CareMark book relative to client accounts, so generally speaking we feel good about 2025. But as Tom said, we want to see how the rest of the year plays out before we give formal guidance for 2025, which is typical of what we do anyway. Tom Cowhey : Kevin, one just point of minor clarification, the 100 to 200 basis points has always been inclusive of the Stars tailwind next year, but as you think about some of the pressures that we\u2019ve seen or could see, based on what we\u2019ve heard and some of our early reads in July, really as we think about what\u2019s happened in June and get more data there, one of the positive offsets to that potential trend inside that range is further momentum on Stars because of that change, particularly to our Florida HMO contract. Operator : The next question is from Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Lance, your line is open, please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Great. Can you talk a little bit about the leadership changes for Aetna, in particular with you taking control of that, what are the changes and priorities you\u2019re going to be establishing there, and what are going to be some of the changes in management processes and any sort of org changes, and how much of the $500 million of incremental cost savings that will fall to the bottom line would come through Aetna? Thanks. Karen Lynch : Thanks. As you asked, the financial performance of this business was not meeting my expectations and I decided to make a change. Relative to the priorities there, I will be establishing a very strong management process, driving execution of improved financial and operational performance, and those will be my key priorities. Tom Cowhey : Lance, just one quick follow-up, we\u2019re not parsing out where some of the $500 million in synergies comes from - that\u2019s all bottom line. A reminder, though, as you think about 2025, we do have some expenses that are deferred, that will come back in 2025, and this will at that level help to offset that. We\u2019re not done yet - we\u2019re still working through what other opportunities we have this year, so I think of that as a floor that will help to improve the outlook for next year. Operator : The next question comes from Charles Rhyee from TD Cowen. Charles, your line is open, please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Hello, yes. Thanks for taking the question. Karen, I wanted to ask, you mentioned earlier about the way that CareMark health saves money and the role that PBMs play in really lowering drug prices for both employers and consumers. I get all that, and obviously we can debate the issues within the FTC interim report, but what does seem clear, though, is that that message doesn\u2019t seem to be resonating, particularly on the Hill, and certainly when you look at how the media portrays the PBM industry, can you talk about what CVS is doing, maybe in conjunction with PCMA to really kind of amplify the message of the PBM industry, and why has that not resonated or has that not gotten through to folks, particularly the FTC let\u2019s say ahead of this interim report, to kind of understand the role that PBMs play, and what can we do about that? Thanks. Karen Lynch : Yes, I think a couple things. One, we\u2019ve taken a very aggressive approach to educating Congress on the role of the PBM. We\u2019ve been doing a lot relative to communications. One of the things that--you know, both David and I have spent a lot of time on the Hill, and what we realized, it is an education thing, and we\u2019ve been amplifying our message and you can see that. What I would say is that we have demonstrated and proven over time that we are saving money, and the results reflect that. I think the FTC was very targeted - you know, they took certain data and not the holistic data to really amplify their story versus the real story, and we feel confident that--you know, we continue to have discussions. As you can see, nothing has happened in Congress because there\u2019s a lot of discussion going on around the PBMs. I do think that, if anything ever does happen, it will be on transparency, but we continue to drive and educate Congress, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, and continue to--. I\u2019ll ask David to see if there\u2019s anything else he wants to comment on here. David Joyner : Maybe just to reinforce, Charles, this has been an industry that continues to innovate, adapt and evolve, and I think we\u2019re listening to the critiques and/or the concerns, and just to look specifically, what we\u2019re seeing in DC, the focus is for the most part what the out-of-pocket costs are for members - that is the consumer, and when you look at 90%-plus generic dispensing rates and average out-of-pocket costs of $8, and actually that cost is actually less than what it was in years past, I think we\u2019re doing our job. To your point, the message has not resonated as effectively because everybody is focusing on the high cost of brands, which is what we\u2019re solving for specifically with our customers, so that last 10%. If you look specifically at what we did with the biosimilars, we were the only PBM and we\u2019ve actually got a lot of credit and recognition for this in both DC and among our customers, and that we saved $400 million-plus by converting a high list price Humira brand to a low list price product to save our customers money, and then the members ultimately ended up paying close to zero dollars out of pocket. If you demonstrate the fact that we are evolving and continuing to create value for our customers, which results in a high retention rate and a high growth rate, then our customers will ultimately begin to create the voice for making sure that they\u2019re protecting and actually continuing to--you know, what I think is reinvest in the things like the PBM tools and the programs that we\u2019ve delivered in the past. I think the last piece I\u2019ll just say, which I mentioned earlier, is that the price models need to evolve. Prem has recognized that at retail, and I think within CareMark on the PBM side we recognize the need to continue to evolve the price model, which is why we believe TrueCost is critical for the future success and what I believe is the transformation of how pricing ultimately is delivered both to the customer and ultimately down to the consumer. I think the facts remain clear - the PBM industry and specifically CVS CareMark creates significant value, and I think once the actual empirical evidence is there and actually begins to get passed into those that are actually at the legislative branch and ultimately those that are actually writing about this industry, that the numbers will speak for themselves. Karen Lynch : Yes, and I just want to emphasize the point that David made - you know, we are leading the industry in changing the way pricing is done, both at the retail counter and through CareMark, and I think that we\u2019ve set the standard for future innovations, and I think that\u2019s an important part to changing the dialog and the landscape in this business. Operator : Our final question today comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Brian, please go ahead, your line is open. Brian Tanquilut : Thanks. Tom, maybe just as I think about the revised guidance, obviously you\u2019ve adjusted it a few times already, how would you get investors\u2019 confidence that this is the right number at this point, that you\u2019ve baked in enough trend and prudent conservatism, and maybe any color you can share on what buckets of in-patient you saw the trend uptick in July. Thanks. Tom Cowhey : Sure Brian, thanks for the question. Maybe just let me take a step back and just talk about the quarter, because I think as you look at the quarter, it looks stronger than I think it is. We had $150 million worth of prior year reserve development, we had strong prior period reserve development off the first quarter, particularly as claims normalized after the Change cyber attack. We had some revenue pick-up in Medicare, we had some positive provider settlements. Going the other way, we had to increase the risk adjustment payable, but there\u2019s more positives than negatives as you look at the quarter, which I think got us to the printed results inside the quarter but really masked some underlying pressure. We took the opportunity to really step back and re-evaluate what we saw in the second quarter, and really over the full first half now that we have a more complete period, and really tried to pull that forward into the remainder of the year. If you look at the last five years at the very highest level, you say the MBR tends to pick up the back half, how much was the pick-up? So off a printed first half, you tend to see four out of the last five years, the one exception being 2020 when COVID really masked the underlying trends, you see 150 basis points of pick-up in the MBR in the back half - you know, deterioration that goes up the MBR. At the midpoint, that\u2019s exactly where this guidance is - that\u2019s at the very highest level. I hope that that should give investors some confidence. Then as you look at the specific risks, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve taken the presumption that the trends in Medicare that we\u2019ve seen throughout the first half, that they will persist throughout the remainder of the year and that they could modestly increase. As we noted, the first quarter did restate positively, but we continue to see elevated medical cost trends in the second quarter and we did have some indications of pressure in July. We don\u2019t believe that that is an increase into midnight [ph], it\u2019s just we\u2019ve seen broad-based in-patient pressures. The range of outcomes for the remainder of the year on the Aetna business is primarily driven by a very early read on an uptick in a long July, so that\u2019s part of the reason for the range, is to try to incorporate what some of that variability is off a very early indicator. In our exchange business, our outlook incorporates the potential for additional risks over the remainder of the year, particularly if we\u2019re not successful in maintaining our risk adjustment trajectory on the 2024 block, and lastly, we incorporated the risk that the dislocation between Medicaid acuity and rates that pressured us inside the quarter persist throughout the remainder of the year. Maybe the easiest way to think about it is at the low end of that range, the AOI range for healthcare benefit, the risks are probably all roughly equivalent in magnitude, and they\u2019re really the primary drivers of the change in outlook. We think that we\u2019ve captured it, but we\u2019re obviously watching the data very closely but we tried to incorporate as much prudent into the outlook as we thought was appropriate. Karen Lynch : Thank you for joining our call today. I want to take the opportunity to thank all of our colleagues for their continued contributions and working to improve the health of all the people that we serve. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you very much for your attendance. You may now disconnect your lines.",

My name is Bricka and I\u2019ll be your moderator for today. All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Larry McGrath at CVS Health. Thank you, you may proceed, Larry. Larry McGrath : Good morning and welcome to the CVS Health third quarter 2024 earnings call and webcast. I\u2019m Larry McGrath, Chief Strategy Officer, and I\u2019m joined this morning by David Joyner, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tom Cowhey, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll host a question and answer session that will include additional members of the leadership team. Our press release and slide presentation have been posted to our website along with our Form 10-Q filed this morning with the SEC. Today\u2019s call is also being broadcast on our website, where it will be archived for one year. During this call, we\u2019ll make certain forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently projected results. We strongly encourage you to review the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties, in particular those that are described in the cautionary statements concerning forward-looking statements and risk factors in our most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed this morning, and our recent filings on Form 8-K, including this morning\u2019s earnings press release. During this call, we\u2019ll use non-GAAP measures when talking about the company\u2019s financial performance and financial condition, and you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in this morning\u2019s press release and in the reconciliation documents posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to David. David? David Joyner : Thank you Larry and good morning everyone. Before I begin, I would like to thank Karen Lynch for her years of leadership, dedication and strategic vision. Karen is a friend to me and many others across the CVS Health organization, and we wish her all the best. I am incredibly honored to lead CVS Health during this critical time. My entire career is deeply connected with this enterprise. When I returned to CVS Health in 2023, it was because of my strong belief in our purpose and strategy. Today, CVS Health serves 185 million people across the U.S. and we are uniquely positioned to help them navigate their healthcare journey. In the past few weeks since I took on this role, I have seen firsthand the dedication, pride and commitment of our employees to CVS Health and our vision to deliver lower cost, better experiences, an better health outcome for our members, clients and patients. I began my career at Aetna and have spent the last 37 years managing healthcare services teams with a focus on driving innovation, strong execution, and consistent financial performance. My career has been defined by navigating through change and evolving markets. As the leader of Caremark, I engaged with health plans, employers, pharmacies and the broader healthcare delivery system in our country. These experiences gave me a diverse set of perspectives on the challenges and opportunities inherent to our system. I\u2019ve mobilized teams who have helped re-shape the pharmacy benefit landscape by lowering costs, increasing transparency, and driving greater accessibility. Many of those innovations have been made possible by integrating the assets across this enterprise. At CVS Health, each of our businesses is formidable in its own right. We have the leading PBM, the best run pharmacy in this country, a storied franchise through Aetna, and industry-leading healthcare delivery assets. Our collection of businesses and omnichannel capabilities allows us to lead the industry forward with innovative and market-moving solutions. We were pioneers in advancing the biosimiliar adoption by establishing a co-manufacturing capacity through Cordavis, making the necessary formulary changes with Caremark, and executing through our CVS specialty operations. Through our leadership and innovation, we were able to drive down commercial specialty trend for clients that use our integrated biosimilar approach to 1.3%, the lowest level in recent history. We continue to expand our product offering and drive innovation for Aetna\u2019s self insured customers. Last month, we introduced Simple Pay, a differentiated offering for our commercial customers that provides greater price certainty before a visit or treatment. Instead of bills and benefit details, members receive just one simple monthly statement that summarizes all of their medical and pharmacy claims. This offering provides a simpler end-to-end member experience and access to affordable quality innovative healthcare for members and plan sponsors. In addition, this product has been shown to drive a 60% increase in the use of top quality providers and a 12% total cost of care savings for employers and members. Last month, CMS released its 2025 star ratings. CVS Health\u2019s integrated teams helped Aetna deliver an exceptional result. We built upon our strong momentum from last year with 88% of our Medicare Advantage members in four-star plans or higher, and more than two out of every three Aetna MA members in a plan rated 4.5 stars. Our commitment to outstanding service resulted in our highest ever member experience score since CMS launched the quality bonus star program in 2012. This was an impressive result particularly as CMS continues to raise the bar on what it takes to achieve a four-star rating. Our success in this crucial area was achieved by enhancing our cross-enterprise processes and driving focused and deliberate execution, strengthening our position for the future. This framework and approach are critical elements as I look to lead this organization through the opportunities and challenges ahead. It will also require the right leadership team. Today, we announced two leadership appointments that will help us drive better performance across the enterprise and at Aetna specifically. First, Prem Shah, who has been running our pharmacy and consumer wellness business, is elevated to Group President and will now also be responsible for the health services segment. Second, we appointed Steve Nelson as President of Aetna. Steve is an industry veteran who has successfully led diverse managed care companies and driven innovation and growth throughout his career. Steve was a former CEO of United Healthcare and held several leadership roles with a proven track record of delivering growth, profitability, improved employee engagement and customer satisfaction. I am confident both Prem and Steve will help us advance our strategy and enable us to realize opportunities across our businesses. Shifting now to the results in the third quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.09 with total revenues for the company of more than $95 billion. CVS Health is made up of three attractive operating segments which are all critical to the healthcare system. Two of those segments continue to perform consistent with our expectations. Our health services segment had another strong quarter while delivering on our commitments to lower drug costs to our clients and members. Our pharmacy and consumer wellness business continues to be the best run national pharmacy in the country, increasing its share of scripts filled and delivering important community health access across the nation. Results in our healthcare benefits business remain challenged as a result of continued elevated levels of utilization. While we are clearly underperforming at HCB today, this business has incredible earnings potential and is an essential element to our strategy. We expect the elevated levels of utilization will continue to pressure our 2024 performance and as a result, we are not providing a formal outlook today, although Tom will provide some comments on what we may expect directionally. I appreciate and understand your desire for us to provide guidance at this stage. Establishing credibility and earning your trust is one of my top priorities as the new leader of CVS Health. I recognize that in order to achieve that, any guidance we provide should be achievable with clear opportunities for outperformance. This must be a core principal, and in order to deliver on that commitment to you, I want to spend more time understanding the complexities and challenges facing our Aetna business and will provide an update when appropriate. There are clearly both macro and company-specific factors driving the challenges within our Aetna business. The entire industry has seen pressure, including elevated utilization coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic and higher acuity as a result of the Medicaid redeterminations; however, I recognize that we have been more acutely impacted than others in the industry. As a result of our disappointing star ratings for 2024, we began the year with a known and temporary reimbursement challenge. When we priced our Medicare Advantage business for 2024, we clearly underestimated the medical cost. In this rising trend environment, we offered rich benefits which exacerbated our utilization pressures and grew membership rapidly. Our individual exchange business, another area where we had a large increase in membership, has seen pockets of higher utilization and several disappointing risk adjustment updates. These miscalculations during the 2023 bid processes have significantly burdened Aetna\u2019s current results. This performance is unacceptable; however, I am confident in the long term prospects of Aetna. We will make the hard choices and take the necessary actions to drive a multi-year earnings recovery at Aetna. Our benefit design and price changes in Medicare Advantage and the individual exchange are down payments on this enduring commitment. We are making marked progress to realign the Aetna organization and enhance management processes. We have taken meaningful steps to ensure the stability of the Aetna business and strengthen the leadership team. In addition to the appointment of Steve Nelson, we also recently added Andreana Santangelo, a seasoned managed care CFO to the Aetna organization who has also been working closely with me, Tom and our Chief Operating Officer, Katerina Guerraz to help drive operational enhancements, improve forecasting and greater accountability. Our risk management processes have been restructured to pull underwriting and pricing authority out of the business units and into the financial chain. This realignment will help improve transparency and accountability as we execute our margin recovery and drive profitable growth. Of course, Tom and I will work closely with Steve, Katerina and Andreana to scrutinize and support the underwriting and pricing decisions going forward. We have also been making operational changes, identifying and prioritizing those gaps and inefficiencies that create the most significant impacts to performance. Our teams have been addressing the challenge of strained clinical operations by improving staffing and training. We are utilizing technology to automate and streamline processes; for example, through the power of AI, we have simplified clinical case preparation and meaningfully reduced the amount of time our care managers spend on case prep. We are improving our services and claim operations, increasing our accuracy, and reducing abrasion for members and providers. By utilizing technologies, we are driving greater insights across Aetna, including expanded integration with the Caremark team to understand and manage pharmacy spend and enhance data insights to improve our ability to rapidly identify emerging utilization trends. The work at Aetna is underway, and we are confident we are taking the right steps to address the underlying issues and drive improved performance with Aetna. Turning to our pharmacy and consumer wellness business, we continue to effectively navigate a challenging and dynamic consumer backdrop. Our performance reflects strong execution and the benefit of strategic investments in our workflows and our colleagues. This quarter, we achieved another record high retail pharmacy script share at 27.3%, an impressive accomplishment as we continue to optimize our store footprint. By the end of November, we will have completed our previously announced three-year store optimization initiative targeting 900 stores and expect to close approximately 270 stores in 2025. We recognize the importance of retail pharmacy in the communities we serve and will continue to be thoughtful and deliberate as we execute on our footprint optimization efforts. We are progressing our transition to the CVS cost managed model and have reached agreements covering more than half of our total commercial scripts. The ongoing discussions with our large PBM partners remain active and constructive as we move forward with the full commercial contract implementation on January of 2025. We have also been deliberate in enhancing the durability and strength of our store operations to ensure we consistently serve our role as a community health destination. This was clear in the aftermath of the recent hurricanes. Our colleagues were instrumental in ensuring our operations were back online quickly, with most stores open with 48 hours. We utilized our dynamic approach to workload sharing, a capability used across most of our fleet allowing us to rapidly recover impacted stores, ensure patient access to critical medications, and provide continuity of care for our customers. In our pharmacy services business, we had another very strong quarter delivering on our commitments to our clients and customers. In spite of the intense scrutiny and rhetoric that Caremark and the PBM industry faced, we continue to play a crucial role in managing drug costs in this country. I\u2019ve highlighted the progress we\u2019ve made on the biosimilar space and our customers continue to see the value that we\u2019re delivering with our capabilities. We are once again positioned to close out a robust selling season, achieving a retention rate in the high 90s. We continue to offer our clients choice and innovation, and our TrueCost offering is resonating in the market. For 2025, clients representing 70% of our commercial lives have chosen to implement multiple elements of the TrueCost model into their benefit sign options. Finally in our healthcare delivery business, we continue to progress our strategy of delivering superior care to the patients we serve. Signify delivered another strong quarter. Aetna members served by Signify have nearly doubled compared to last year, supported by our ability to utilize touch points across CVS Health. Our enterprise connections also continued to accelerate patient growth at Oak Street. Our at-risk membership is up 32% from the same quarter last year, and the number of Aetna members enrolled at Oak Street has approximately quadrupled since the close of the acquisition. Through thoughtful benefit design, we continue to introduce Aetna members to high quality providers like Oak Street Health, allowing us to improve member experiences and deliver better health outcomes. As we look ahead to 2025 and beyond, there are reasons to be optimistic and I\u2019m excited about our path forward. We have implemented a disciplined approach to Medicare Advantage benefit design, we continue to accelerate progress on our innovative pharmacy models and biosimilar strategy, we\u2019ve delivered wins in both Caremark and Aetna selling season, and we are rapidly advancing the integration of our healthcare delivery assets. We are making the necessary changes to return our business to profitable growth in 2025. We are committed to a disciplined financial policy and with improved profitability expect to strengthen our balance sheet. We have strong leadership across the country, we have a powerful collection of businesses operating in some of the most critical areas of healthcare, which provide us with a unique opportunity to deliver value for our customers, colleagues and shareholders. I also want to extend our appreciation to our over 300,000 colleagues. I\u2019m grateful for your continued dedication, for our collaboration to drive continuous improvement, and for all that you do every single day for the millions of customers and members that we serve. With that, I\u2019ll pass the call over to Tom. Tom? Tom Cowhey : Thank you David, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I\u2019ll start with a few highlights on total company performance. Third quarter revenues were approximately $95.4 billion, an increase of approximately 6% over the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting growth in our healthcare benefits and pharmacy and consumer wellness segments. We delivered adjusted operating income of approximately $2.5 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.09. Year to date cash flow from operations were approximately $7.2 billion, a lower result as compared to the same period last year primarily due to the timing of CMS receipts and the impact of higher utilization on HCB earnings. Let\u2019s look at the performance in each of our segments. In our healthcare benefits segment, we grew revenues to approximately $33 billion, an increase of over 25% year-over-year, reflecting growth in all lines of business. Medical membership grew to approximately 27.1 million, an increase of 178,000 members sequentially, primarily reflecting growth in Medicare and individual exchange. During the quarter, the segment generated an adjusted operating loss of $924 million. This result includes the impact of premium deficiency reserves of approximately $1.1 billion recorded primarily in our Medicare and individual exchange businesses. As a reminder, PDRs generally measure variable losses in a product and do not contemplate fixed expenses. The aggregate of the PDRs was comprised of approximately $670 million of healthcare costs and $394 million of operating expenses specifically related to the write-off of unamortized deferred acquisition costs. Substantially all of the charges were associated with the 2024 policy year, shifting the earnings cadence between the third and fourth quarters. Our medical benefit ratio of 95.2% increased 950 basis points from the prior year quarter, including the 220 basis point impact from the PDRs. This increase was primarily driven by higher utilization, higher acuity in Medicaid, the premium impact of lower stars ratings for payment year 2024, and an update to our 2024 individual exchange risk adjustment accrual. Medical costs remain elevated in our Medicare book and at levels above what was contemplated in our previous guidance. The pressure was largely attributable to the same categories we discussed last quarter, including in-patient, outpatient, supplemental benefits, and pharmacy. During the third quarter, we also saw unfavorable development of 2024 medical costs primarily related to second quarter dates of service, which has adversely impacted our trend outlook for the remainder of the year. Medical costs in our individual exchange business also accelerated during the quarter with broad levels of higher utilization above our prior expectations. The pressure we\u2019ve experienced thus far has been primarily driven by certain high cost geographies where the combination of our growth in middle tier mix has led to higher medical costs. During the third quarter, we also received updated risk adjustment data for our individual exchange business. As a result, we increased our risk adjustment accrual for the 2024 plan year by approximately $275 million in the quarter. We will continue to evaluate our revenue accruals for potential additional pressure as we receive updated data on our risk scores later this year and into early 2025. In our Medicaid business, consistent with others in the industry, we continued to experience higher acuity related to the impact of redeterminations. We believe the level of dislocation between acuity and rates stabilized towards the end of the third quarter. We continue to work closely with our state partners to align rates with changes in acuity. Although the engagement with our state partners has been constructive and we have seen some rate updates in the second half of 2024, they remain inadequate to cover current levels of elevated acuity. In light of the utilization pressures we have seen across the healthcare benefits segment in 2024, we continue to closely watch our group commercial business. To date, pressures in this business have largely been manageable as we have proactively pushed rate to cover emerging medical costs trends. This will result in lower commercial risk membership in 2025, hindering our ability to grow earnings in this business. Days claims payable at the end of the quarter was 44.6 days, up 1.5 days sequentially, primarily driven by the impact of the premium deficiency reserves. DCP was down 5.7 days from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by growth in our Medicare business and the impact of increased pharmacy trends. We remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. Our health services segment delivered another strong quarter. We generated revenue of $44.1 billion during the quarter, a decrease of approximately 6% year-over-year primarily driven by the previously announced loss of a large client and continued pharmacy client price improvements. These decreases were partially offset by pharmacy drug mix, increased contributions from our healthcare delivery assets, and growth in specialty pharmacy. Adjusted operating income of approximately $2.2 billion increased 17% from the prior year quarter, reflecting improved purchasing economics partially offset by continued pharmacy client price improvements and the previously announced loss of a large client. Total pharmacy claims processed in the quarter were approximately $484 million and total pharmacy services membership as of the end of the quarter was approximately $90 million. We continue to be encouraged by the growth of our healthcare delivery assets. As David mentioned, Signify continued its strong performance in the quarter, generating revenue growth of approximately 37% over the prior year quarter. Oak Street revenue increased significantly in the quarter, growing approximately 36% driven by strong membership growth. At-risk members increased by approximately 32% compared to the same quarter last year, supported by our ability to use touch points across CVS Health. We are encouraged by Oak Street\u2019s performance in this challenging environment. During the quarter, our pharmacy and consumer wellness segment generated revenue of approximately $32.4 billion, an increase of over 12% versus the prior year and over 15% on a same store basis. Adjusted operating income of nearly $1.6 billion increased approximately 15% versus the prior year, driven by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccines and improved drug purchasing, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and lower front store volumes. Same store pharmacy sales in the quarter increased by nearly 20% versus the prior year, and same store prescription volumes increased by approximately 9%. As David mentioned, we continued to grow our retail pharmacy script share position, achieving share of approximately 27.3%. Same store front store sales were down approximately 1% versus the same quarter last year. One other item I would like to highlight for investors is that we took a restructuring charge of nearly $1.2 billion in the quarter. This amount reflects several components, including impairment charges for approximately 270 stores we expect to close in 2025, costs related to the discontinuation of non-core businesses, and costs associated with workforce optimization. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet, for our third quarter we generated year-to-date cash flow from operations of approximately $7.2 billion. During the quarter, we returned $837 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend and we ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of cash at the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 4.6 times, which is above our long term target. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings and expect our leverage to return to more normalized levels as we execute on margin recovery in the Aetna business. As David mentioned, we are not providing a formal outlook for 2024 at this stage; however, we would like to provide some directional commentary to help you better understand how we see the moving parts. Starting with our health services and pharmacy and consumer wellness segments, as we have previously highlighted, those businesses continue to deliver strong results. In PCW, while the immunization season got off to a stronger start than we expected, shifting demand into the third quarter, strong script growth continues to give us confidence in the previous outlook we share with investors. In the health services segment, Caremark\u2019s earnings progression in 2024 started slow but has steadily built momentum over the second and third quarters. While we maintain a cautious outlook on our healthcare delivery business as we evaluate the potential for additional Medicare trend-related risk, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on the health services segment earnings outlook we shared with investors on our second quarter call. Within healthcare benefits, we continue to grapple with both environmental and company-specific challenges, as you have seen with our third quarter results. Similar to others within the industry, Medicare Advantage utilization continues to be elevated. We have also grown membership very rapidly with a very rich benefit offering, which has resulted in benefit-induced utilization. Medicaid continues to be pressured by the dislocation between acuity and rates, as well as seeing some pockets of higher utilization. We have also seen rapid growth in our individual exchange business, which has led to several disappointing updates on risk-adjusted revenue and, in some states, higher than expected utilization. To date, the combination of these factors has challenged our visibility and our 2024 outlook. While we are not providing formal guidance today, let me walk you through one potential scenario. If trends develop unfavorably and persist at the significant levels we have experience in recent months, our fourth quarter reported NBR could increase by over 700 basis points as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally in this scenario, we would likely need to take a PDR on our group Medicare Advantage business related to 2025 dates of service, which would further pressure 2024 results. Despite challenges in 2024, we have taken deliberate actions that position us for growth in 2025 and beyond. While we will not give formal 2025 guidance until next year when we have better visibility on our 2025 medical cost baseline and our changing membership, I want to provide an update on some of the key headwinds and tailwinds. Starting first with the headwinds, in our PCW segment we expect earnings to decline in line with our long term guidance framework. As David mentioned, we are encouraged by the adoption of CVS CostVantage and the shift of commercial scripts to this model on January 1. We expect 2025 to be a transition year that positions us for outperformance of our long term growth target in future years. We also remain cautious in our outlook for front store sales, which have been pressured in recent quarters, consistent with the broader macroeconomic backdrop. As we previously discussed, we expect a return of certain variable corporate expenses. We also expect higher interest as we annualize the expense from our May 2024 financing, a decline in net investment income, and modest dilution from the increase in our share count. Shifting now to the tailwinds, we expect improvement in contributions from our healthcare benefits segment. We believe our deliberate approach to our 2025 Medicare Advantage bids and our focused changes to our footprint, which we expect to result in membership disenrollment of 5% to 10%, when combined with our improved star ratings will result in margin recovery. This is a significant first step on our journey back to target margins of 3% to 5%. We continue to view the dislocation between acuity and rates in Medicaid as temporary and expect this to be resolved over subsequent pricing cycles; however, we do not expect the dislocation to be fully resolved before the end of 2025. We expect improvement in our individual exchange business as a result of our pricing actions and deliberate product repositioning, which we project will decrease membership in this block of business in 2025. We will continue to refine our product offerings for long term sustainability. We also expect underlying growth in our health services business, including growth in pharmacy services as we continue to drive value for our clients and incremental improvement in our healthcare delivery businesses. We expect our initial outlook for this segment will be below our long term growth framework but will prudently provide opportunities for upside over the course of the year. Finally, we have executed the first step of our multi-year cost savings initiative that we expect will generate over $500 million next year, helping to offset the return of variable expense in 2025. Taking a step back, 2024 has been a disappointing year for performance in our healthcare benefits segment. We could experience mid-single digit percentage losses in our Medicare business. Our foray into the individual exchange business could result in negative margins that approach double digits. We are also projecting modest negative margins in our Medicaid business. It is possible that our healthcare benefits business could show operating losses in 2024 after generating over $5.5 billion of adjusted operating income in 2023. Conversely, this means that there are well over $3 of embedded adjusted EPS if we could return Aetna profitability to 2023 levels. Open enrollment for both Medicare Advantage and individual exchange has demonstrated that we took meaningful action in curtailing benefits, adjusting products, and where appropriate raising prices. While we are confident we have taken the right initial actions, the road to recovery will take time. We look forward to providing more details on our 2025 outlook and those first steps on our journey when we have more clarity on the moving parts in our healthcare benefits business next year. With that, we will now open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator instructions] We have the first question on the phone line from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. You may proceed. Lisa Gill : Great, thanks very much, and thanks for the detail. Tom, I just wanted to make sure that I understand a couple of things. One, when I think about the MA bids that you put in for 2025, you talked about, and we all saw in the plan finder the cuts, can you maybe just talk about--I know we\u2019re only one month in, but are you seeing the disenrollment that you expected, and two, just given the size of the surprise that we\u2019ve seen here in the back half of the year, the level of confidence that you have around the bids that you did put in for 2025, if I could understand that. Then just secondly, you talked about pharmacy, we\u2019ve heard others talk about pharmacy trends here in the back half of the year really shifting and changing because of the Inflation Reduction Act and changes around kind of [indiscernible] coverage. Just curious, one, did you see that as well specific to those changes, and is it benefiting perhaps some of the other sides of your business? I know obviously you have a really big specialty business and you talked about the strength in the pharmacy business. Tom Cowhey : Let me start with your first question. We\u2019re early in the open enrollment season, but I did reiterate the guidance that we\u2019ve been giving for a couple of months now. Our early indicators would suggest that we would be down in that size of 10% range on the total book. We\u2019ll have more stability on the group book, so that\u2019s a higher percentage as you think about the individual and the dual eligible populations that we\u2019ll see declines on, but we feel reasonably good about how the membership is coming in and that it would be within that range that we\u2019ve been guiding investors to. As you think about ability and confidence in the bids, the bids are clearly designed to improve results next year, and maybe there\u2019s a couple of things I can talk you through at a high level, just to give you a framework to think about that. The first is improvement in stars, and so because of the contracts that we have that are now going to be four stars or better for 2025 payment year, that\u2019s going to be about an $800 million headwind, no matter what the baseline is--or excuse me, tailwind - I keep doing that. It used to be a headwind, and now it\u2019s going to be a tailwind next year. On the individual blocks of business, we have made deliberate benefit design changes to supplemental benefits which will fundamentally change how these benefits function in 2025, which will also improve margins. Finally, we\u2019ve both exited underperforming counties and we\u2019ve pulled underperforming products that will impact nearly half a million members. Those changes should also improve profitability in \u201925 as many of those members will chose newly designed products that will have an improved margin profile. We expect that those changes are going to drive margin expansion, and when we have a better understanding of what that membership mix looks like for 2025 as well as our \u201924 baseline, we\u2019ll be able to better provide specifics on the level of anticipated improvement next year. David Joyner : Lisa, this is David. Maybe just one additional follow-on here. I think one is we are feeling very good about the improvements that we\u2019ve made going into \u201925, so recognizing obviously the challenge in \u201924, we believe we\u2019ve made the appropriate course correction. Then as it relates to pharmacy, which was your last question, I think this is the unique opportunity at this enterprise. The goal here is not to be surprised, especially as it relates to pharmacy costs. We think we\u2019ve anticipated and contemplated the changes both at IRA as well as the broader macro trends that we see within pharmacy, and the goal here, especially now with the addition of both Steve and Prem, we\u2019re going to see further integration, not just the pharmacy benefit integration but more importantly the medical pharmacy, which is a piece that obviously I think is driving some of the increased cost in the back of the year. Operator : Thank you. As a reminder, we do ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, and if you have any further, to please re-join the queue. We have our next question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. First, just wanted to clarify the 4Q commentary - Tom, you said it\u2019s potentially up 700 basis points, or I\u2019m getting to about 95.5% MLR. Does that include the 3Q PDR and the potential Medicare Advantage PDR you mentioned? Then more importantly, how should we think about framing 2024 run rate earnings into 2025? I\u2019m trying to understand--you know, your MLR looks like it\u2019s obviously a lot higher in the third quarter and going to be a lot higher in the fourth quarter. Do we need to run rate that back into the first half, so let\u2019s just say $0.75 of earnings decline? Just trying to understand the run rate versus--you know, you\u2019re going to report a number for 2024, but what\u2019s the real run rate that we jump off of into 2025? Is there a framework to think about that? Thanks. Tom Cowhey : Yes Justin, let me touch on some of your other questions first. I think part of the question that we need to answer, and that I think you need to ask yourself, is how much of this benefit and this trend that we\u2019re seeing is because of the benefits that we put out into the market and what kind of utilization is being induced because of that, what kind of membership did we attract, and how much will that profile change with the changing benefits next year. That\u2019s part of the open question in answering your question, that I think we want to take a little bit more time to understand. But on your MLR specific comments, that is inclusive of the release of the PDR, that you can see that 700 basis point increase, but not necessarily inclusive of a PDR in group, which will depend on a variety of factors. But let me walk you through--give you a little bit more commentary and color on what we outlined here. First, I think it\u2019s important to just continue to reiterate, we feel very good about our ability to achieve the guidance we gave last quarter on both the PCW and the health services segments, so the open question here is healthcare benefits. For our larger lines of business, second quarter trend appears to be the high point, but the third quarter dates of service are still immature, so there are three components to the scenario that we laid out. First, across all of our major business lines, we assume that third quarter trends would develop unfavorably, moving them to the highest levels we\u2019ve seen over the last few months, and then assuming that they persisted at those levels throughout the fourth quarter. Second, we assume we saw further deterioration in our risk adjustment accruals on our individual exchange business in the fourth quarter, call it an additional point on gross revenue. Third, we made a provision that there could be some modest induced utilization, particularly in Medicare as individuals looked at their changing benefits in \u201925 and seek to utilize benefits that will no longer be available next year. Then finally, we noted the group Medicare trend levels, that if they persisted at that level, I just referenced that could cause us to take additional PDR in the fourth quarter, but that will really depend on what we think baseline is for \u201924 and how it is that that\u2019s going to persist into \u201925, so more to come on that. I would note finally, our reserve balances through October, they have been modestly positive, but we\u2019ve continued to see pressure in the more recent dates of service, for example the third quarter. Operator : Thank you. We now have Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, when you\u2019re ready. Stephen Baxter : Yes, hi. Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones. You did mention in response to that question, it\u2019s important to differentiate the incremental trend that\u2019s coming out of benefits that have already been restructured for 2025 versus more potentially core areas of utilization, so maybe can you help us understand better what you saw in the third quarter? Then just on the PDR commentary for 2025, you\u2019re citing you potentially need one for group MA but you\u2019re not saying you need one for individual MA, or potentially the exchanges. Just wondering why or why not that would be the case. Thank you. Tom Cowhey : Let me answer the second part first. The way the PDRs are calculated is partially based on how those products are sold, and so our individual Medicare products are differently grouped than how our group Medicare products are. As you can imagine, the nature of the contracts in the group business tends to be multi-year and so there\u2019s less ability to make improvement year-over-year, and so that business has a different profile going into \u201925 than the individual business in Medicare does or the individual exchange business does. We haven\u2019t really talked a lot about the exchange business, but that\u2019s a $10 billion block of revenue in 2024 with over 1.9 million members. As David noted, we unfortunately grew that business too fast. We\u2019re suffering significant losses in \u201924, mostly led by our SEP members. This pressure was compounded by unfavorable middle product mix, which skewed to certain geographies. We have taken, as I believe we\u2019ve previously discussed, double-digit rate increases across this book for next year, and as a deliberate consequence of that rate action, we expect we could shrink that book by as much as 20 to 25% next year, so those actions combined with some of the operational improvements that the teams are making on the ground should also help to improve performance next year, which is part of the reason that at this point, we don\u2019t anticipate that we would need a PDR in that individual business. As it relates to trend, we have continued to see supplemental benefit trends be elevated throughout all of 2024, and that persisted into the third quarter. Where we\u2019ve also seen trend pressure, as I noted in the prepared remarks, has been in all the usual suspects this year - it\u2019s been in in-patient, it\u2019s been in outpatient, although the types of procedures that we\u2019ve seen have shifted somewhat. We continue to see pressure on things like medical pharmacy, particularly on some of the oncology drugs, and so it\u2019s a lot of the same things that we have been talking about throughout the whole year. The piece that I was mentioning in terms of the bridge is there is a large portion of that trend increase that is a function of some of the supplemental benefits that we have offered, and those have been fundamentally restructured next year for our individual Medicare products. We\u2019ll give you better insight as to what that was worth when we have a better sense as to how the mix has come out and what the baseline is for \u201924. David Joyner : Stephen, this is David. Maybe just a quick follow-on here - this is the third question on the Q4 jump-off, and I think it\u2019s important to recognize that we know what the problems are. Clearly we\u2019ve stated them in the prepared remarks, we understand the broader issues that are challenging the \u201924 performance. The good news is we are proactively addressing those, as you\u2019ve seen in terms of how we structured the product design and the benefits. You\u2019ve seen changes in how we\u2019ve structured our leadership teams, seen changes in terms of how we structured our risk management and pricing controls, so we believe that we\u2019re on the path of actually getting to an improved performance. The quicker we can move past \u201924 and into \u201925, I think the better it will continue to be for the collective group. Operator : Thank you. We now have Michael Cherny with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Good morning and thanks for all the color. Maybe I\u2019ll try and take this in a different direction and talk about pharmacy services. You talked about, Tom, next year being a bit below long term plan. Can you break that down within the health services segment between [indiscernible] services versus the health delivery assets, and specifically type of pharmacy services, how are you thinking about both specialty utilization as well as the continued contribution of Cordavis as you sit here today, thinking through where the jump-off point for fiscal \u201925 again for the health services segment can go? Tom Cowhey : Thanks Mike. As you think about the health services segment, we had a little bit of a slow start in 2024, but that business--you know, that team has done an exceptional job of really driving momentum, that we\u2019ve seen that momentum accelerate into the second and into the third quarters, which has really given us a lot of confidence in the outlook as we think about this year. As we think about next year, I\u2019d say given that slow start, we don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves, and so while we\u2019re not providing formal guidance today, we want to make sure that we appropriately set expectations, given how that was a little bit choppy out of the gate last year. David Joyner : This is David. Obviously now, the division I know much better in terms of the performance, and I will say we\u2019re going to finish \u201924 strong. If you look at the \u201925 year, we\u2019re actually heading into a really strong selling season, a tremendous amount of momentum as it relates to the success we\u2019ve had on the biosimilar launch, changing and disrupting the market as it relates to pricing models, client satisfaction and member NPS scores are as high as they\u2019ve been, so I believe just collectively this business is running really well, and I still feel very strong about its continued performance into \u201925. Operator : Thank you. We now have Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a clarification on the PDR, Tom. I want to make sure I understood what you said, that no PDR has been contemplated for 2025, so MA and hicks [ph] lost money in totality in \u201924 and it will be positive in 2025? I just want to make sure we\u2019ve got that right. Then more importantly, can you speak to your updated Medicare, both MA and PDP distribution strategy, and I\u2019m specifically interested in your commission strategy with external brokers and feedback you guys are getting on that. Tom Cowhey : Thanks Josh. On the PDR, the PDR is a pretty esoteric accounting rule, and so it looks at the business and looks at it on a variable cost basis, and as we look at and think about our projections for next year, with the improvements that we are expecting across those books, the only one that we think might be close to the line is the group Medicare business, which is why we highlighted that for investors; but I wouldn\u2019t take that to mean that we are necessarily going to be profitable, because you have to allocate out those fixed costs, which are fairly substantial as you think about the fixed costs associated with those two large businesses. As you think about our strategy for both MA and PDP, we are going to shrink membership in PDP. We do use a lot of broker channels. Only about 15% of what we do is actually from internal channels, the rest of it is from external channels where we have large, long and established relationships. We\u2019re generally very pleased with where it is that our early sales are coming out. We obviously throughout this process of open enrollment, we make tweaks to that as we look at where geographies are coming in and think about where we want to grow and where we might not want to grow as quickly, but overall where AEP is coming out as of the end of last week is very consistent with where we had mapped it, maybe a little bit of mix difference but generally in line with--you know, in the aggregate with where we had thought about it, and so we were pretty pleased with the performance to date. Operator : We now have Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi guys, thanks so much for the question this morning. Maybe just one question about the PDR opex mechanics that you guys talked about on the third quarter--for the third quarter PDR. Does that from an opex perspective, does that flip and become a positive to your numbers in the fourth quarter? That would by my first question. Then secondarily, can you just maybe dig in a little bit more on the PCW strength? How do we expect that cadence to change as we think about the pull forward from COVID, and then any kind of seasonality you guys are thinking about for the fourth quarter? Thank you. Tom Cowhey : Maybe I\u2019ll take the PDR mechanic and then Prem, you can talk a little bit about the PCW strength. On the PDR mechanic, the way that this works is that you look at what the potential losses might be on a variable basis, you record the PDR, and really how you record it is that one of the first places you have to look is you have to look at any deferred acquisition costs that you have hung up on the balance sheet. You accrue for that, you take those down first - that means that while you\u2019re not really reversing a reserve, you don\u2019t have expense that you otherwise would have anticipated having in the fourth quarter, so it is an expense benefit and an MLR benefit, so the vast majority of that $1.1 billion will come back in the fourth quarter. Prem Shah : On the PCW strength, I\u2019d say a few things. First and foremost, we had a really strong quarter. Part of that was driven by immunization season coming sooner than we expected - it started in mid-August versus later that month or early September, and we had a first market mover there, we were ready for that, our teams were prepared. We\u2019ve been preparing for that season for the most part of the year. The second piece, I would say is around our core service levels continue to remain very strong. We\u2019ve continued to improve our NPS levels, up hundreds of basis points year-over-year, and that\u2019s turning into what I would say is strong script growth as it relates to our pharmacy business now, around 27.3%, up 70-plus basis points year-over-year, so another great example of the strong service driving script growth in our pharmacy segment of that business. Then on the front store, as Tom alluded to, there was some front store pressure, but our front store business continues to improve in a difficult market environment, and we continue to do the right things around focusing on gaining customers and increasing foot traffic on that business as we go into it, and really kind of mitigating some of the challenges we had earlier in the year. The PCW segment, really proud of our results, really proud of the leadership team and all the results that they\u2019ve driven in that area, and it continues to be a strength of our business. David Joyner : Yes, and this is David. Maybe just to reinforce Prem\u2019s point here, obviously the retail sector is pressured, lots of headwinds in this market, and if you look at what Prem and the team have been able to deliver and execute, it\u2019s really incredibly impressive - share growth while you\u2019re contracting footprint, service levels are up, and this is all despite obviously pressures around the sector, so I\u2019m incredibly excited about Prem\u2019s expansion of his role and responsibility to take that same focus on execution and operational excellence into the broader business. Operator : Thank you. We now have Andrew Mok with Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Mok : Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow up on Medicare Advantage margins. With the lower margin level that you\u2019re seeing today, was hoping you could give us an update on how you\u2019re thinking around the pace of MA margin improvement over the next few years. In your prepared remarks, you noted the journey back to target MA margins of 3% to 5% - that\u2019s a slight change from your previous target of 4% to 5%, so just curious what drove that change and why 3% to 5% is the appropriate margin level. Thanks. Tom Cowhey : Let me answer the second part first, because the answer to that question is really primarily mathematical. As you think about the IRA changes to the Part D program, significant dollars that were previously recorded as reinsurance are now going to get recorded as premium, which increases the denominator of the calculation, so at constant dollars of margin, that change alone is significant to drive a 4% margin down into the 3s. As you think about the longer term, it\u2019s a challenging question to answer. We understand and we made deliberate changes to benefits to be able to drive improvement in margin next year. We anticipate that we\u2019ll be able to continue to do that into 2026, and our star scores will help there, right? We had great stars performance. Two-thirds of our members will be in four and a half star plans that will provide a little bit of additional tailwind as well, but we really need to understand what the rate environment looks like to be able to answer that question, but our goal would be to increase margins again in 2026 in that business. David Joyner : Just as it relates to the focus, obviously my near term focus is driving and accelerating the performance of that business. As Tom mentioned, the stars tailwind will be very positive for both \u201925 and into \u201926. There will be a very strong focus on total cost of care, so as we know what the pricing and the benefits are for the risk that we\u2019re managing, to make sure we have the underlying clinical resources and total cost of care models to manage the risk appropriately. Then lastly, you\u2019ll see an acceleration of how we integrate the assets within this business to help us drive down the cost and improve the overall experience for the members that we\u2019re serving, so again just reinforcing the fact that this is a really important product for our business and one that we\u2019re going to have the collective enterprise focused on execution. Operator : Thank you. We now have John Ransom with RJS. Your line is open. John Ransom : Hey, good morning. Signify and Oak, are they tracking in line with your expectations, and do you think that trend will change in any way next year? Tom Cowhey : Signify has had a great year. As we noted, the volume was up, I think 37% year-over-year inside the third quarter. That business has continued to perform very well. Oak Street overall has performed in line with the guidance that we gave at the earlier part of the year. They\u2019re a Medicare focused business, and so they\u2019re not immune to some of the pressures that others have seen in that marketplace, the nature of that membership, but we\u2019ve been very pleased with how they\u2019ve performed. They\u2019ve maintained a risk-adjustment headwind that\u2019s plus or minus--a little bit below 3%, which we feel is a great first step, given the first year of the implementation of D28. We think that there could be some nice tailwinds in that business next year as we think about some of the changes that competitors and ourselves have made as we continue to grow our share of Aetna members inside those clinics. David Joyner : Yes, and just to reinforce the importance of both of those acquisitions, Oak Street obviously is managing the costs far better than the rest of our book, so the fact is the model works and it works in underserved markets specifically for the population that\u2019s important to this business. The integration between Aetna and Oak Street is improving, so we\u2019ve had a 4x increase in the members since the acquisition, so proving out the fact that when we put the collective efforts of the business, we can actually see performance. Same thing on Signify - we\u2019ve seen a 2x increase in the members served within Aetna. The goal here is obviously to use Signify as a platform. The sophistication and the technology that they\u2019ve invested around logistics and in reaching members in their homes, it is a platform which we can certainly build beyond just the in-home assessment, so that will be the message and the focus of the business, to continue to serve people both in the care delivery setting as well as in the home, and we believe we have the appropriate assets to be able to execute that. John Ransom : Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good morning, and thanks for the update on the CostVantage program. Just curious what those discussions have been like and how did the contrast shake out in terms of what you expected pricing structures to look like versus what 50% of the book looks like, and how are you thinking about the opportunity or the ability to increase that number before we get to January 1? Thanks. Prem Shah : Yes, so first and foremost, as you recall, last year we launched CostVantage with the very intentional reason to solve one of the biggest industry challenges we had around reimbursement pressure, and so we\u2019ve made really good progress, as David and Tom alluded to in the prepared remarks. We have over 50% of our clients in the program. We expect to have our commercial book, 100% of our commercial book signed by the end of this year. We\u2019re really excited about what it brings to the marketplace and how we end some of the cross-subsidization that exists in pharmacy as it relates to this, so we continue to make really good progress. As it relates to the financial outlook from CostVantage, we\u2019ll come back to you early next year with what we\u2019re seeing, but we continue to see really strong performance, as I mentioned earlier, in our retail pharmacy business. We\u2019re really excited about what CostVantage will bring to the marketplace and how it\u2019s going to transform the way we price pharmaceuticals in this country, and lastly the benefits that it brings to consumers as well, so more to come. But at this point, I would say we continue to make really great progress here across the board of moving the industry. David Joyner : I\u2019d just follow on to Prem\u2019s comment about CostVantage. If you look at the complexity of pharmaceutical pricing in this country, this is obviously one of the paths on which to address the confusion and the complexity of how drugs actually are priced at the consumer level. Prem\u2019s move in the retail setting combined with the TrueCost drive within the PBM, we believe is a--it\u2019s a concerted effort to address what we know is a headline around the confusion and the complexity of the pricing. This elimination of cross-subsidization, the ability to get to a more stable and less variable pricing strategy will help us solve what we know is a headline risk, and more importantly allow us to serve our members and our clients more effectively. With that, this ends the call, and before closing here, I just want to thank all for joining the call today. I\u2019m incredibly excited and humbled by the opportunity and the potential of this combined enterprise. We have clear line of sight into the issues and a plan is in place to address them. We look forward to providing updates on our progress going forward, and I also just want to thank again the 300,000 colleagues that help us serve our customers and our patients day-in and day-out, so thank you for that support. Operator : Thank you all for joining today\u2019s conference call with CVS Health. I can confirm today\u2019s call has now concluded. Please enjoy the rest of your day, and you may now disconnect from the call.",
