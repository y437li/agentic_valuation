Ltd., Research Division Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Gee Lingberg : Thanks, Jessica. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Host Hotels & Resorts' first quarter 2014 earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our website at hosthotels.com. With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our first quarter results and then will describe the current operating environment, as well as the company's outlook for 2014. Greg will then provide greater detail on our first quarter performance by markets and our balance sheet. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, here is Ed. W. Edward Walter : Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. Before I get started, I'd just like to say that we appreciate this opportunity to see many of you in our Investor Day 3 weeks ago, as we shared our insights on the industry and, hopefully, provided you with a better understanding of both our company and our management team. So in terms of the first quarter, we are pleased to report that 2014 is off to a strong start with another quarter of outstanding results for the company. Consistent with our commentary on the year-end call in February, hotel demand continues to grow, particularly in our group business, allowing us to drive rates across all segments. In addition, the solid group demand we experienced this quarter drove exceptional growth in food and beverage. We continue to feel good about industry fundamentals that contribute to our improved outlook for the remainder of the year, which I will discuss in more detail in a few minutes. First, let's review our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $308 million, which reflected an increase of 8.8% over last year. Our first quarter adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.33, which exceeded consensus estimates and reflects an 18% increase over last year. These strong results were driven by several factors. First, RevPAR for our comparable hotels on a constant-currency basis increased 6.8% for the quarter, as our hotels benefited from strong rate growth and an occupancy increase of 1.5 percentage points. Our group business was exceptionally strong as our group revenues increased by 11%, as demand increased by more than 6% and average rate improved by nearly 4.5%. All segments of our group business benefited from rate increases, and our corporate demand was up by more than 10%. While the calendar change of Easter to April clearly boosted group activity, we saw a solid demand improvement throughout the quarter. Given the strong increase in group activity, our transient room nights were essentially flat to 2013. But we experienced overall rate growth of 3.5%, driven by both rate increases and positive mix shift, especially in our higher-priced segments. Transient revenues increased by 3.3% for the quarter. Second, the surge in group activity translated to a 13.5% increase in our banquet and audiovisual business, which is our largest quarterly increase during the entire recovery. Banquet revenue per group room night jumped by more than 5%, suggesting that at least for this quarter, groups were willing to spend more. In total, we generated a 9.5% increase in comparable food and beverage revenues, also our best performance in more than a decade. Catering activity was exceptionally strong in New York, driven primarily by the Super Bowl, as well as in a number of our West Coast hotels. The combination of strong rate and RevPAR growth, plus exceptional food and beverage activity on flow-through, led to comparable adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 120 basis points and comparable hotel adjusted operating profit growth of 12.5%, which exceeded our expectations. We also experienced very strong performance in our noncomparable hotels, especially our 2 large Florida assets in Naples and Orlando, where RevPAR growth exceeded 10% and EBITDA growth exceeded 35%, as we benefited from both the strong demand and capital investments made over the last year. After a busy period completing a series of transactions at the end of the year, some of which extended into Q1, our activity has been relatively light since our last call. Our investment activity in the first quarter included the purchase of the previously announced Powell Hotel in San Francisco for $75 million. We invested $6 million in ROI CapEx as we completed the expansion of the Willow Stream Spa at The Fairmont Kea Lani in Maui. We also invested $5 million in a series of energy conservation project and the repositioning of the Cast & Plow Restaurant at The Ritz-Carlton, Marina del Rey. Finally, we invested more than $13 million in the Novotel, ibis in [indiscernible], Brazil and our Maui timeshare community as both of these projects continue to be on schedule and on budget. Today, these projects represent a total investment to date of approximately $105 million. Looking forward, while we have a few assets currently on the market for sale and continue to pursue acquisitions, given the difficulty in predicting the timing of completing these transactions, our guidance does not assume the benefit of any transactions other than the ones we have already closed. Now let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2014, as there are a number of factors that keep us optimistic about future results. First, demand growth throughout the U.S. should continue to be strong, as key economic factors of GDP growth and business investments trend positively through the full year and international travel continues to demonstrate robust growth. With the exception of the New York market, we continue to see supply to be constrained, especially in the upper price points. Overall, we expect average supply growth of less than 1% in our primary markets, excluding New York in 2014. Overall, occupancy in the portfolio is ahead of our 2007 peak, suggesting that our hotels should be able to drive rate growth over the next several quarters. We expect group demand to remain strong throughout the remainder of the year. While second quarter group activity will be lower, primarily because of the year-over-year Easter holiday shift, our booking pace for 2014 continues to be quite strong as revenues are up 5.5% compared to last year. We were also pleased to see that room night bookings in the first quarter for the remainder of the year exceeded last year's pace by more than 4%, with bookings for the month after April up nearly 10%. With roughly 85% of our full year expected group bookings on the books, we expect -- we feel confident about our group business for this year. The combination of a great first quarter and solid group trend suggest that banquet activity will continue to be strong, other than in the second quarter, leading to improved F&B growth and profitability, which will help increase margins. With all these in mind, we continue to expect that our comparable hotel RevPAR growth for the year will be between 5% to 6%, but we expect comparable food and beverage revenue to increase 4% to 5%, which is a full point above our prior estimate of a 3% to 4% increase. On the margin side, given expected rate growth and positive group demand at our first quarter results, we believe we can drive incremental profitability and strong flow-through. As a result, we are increasing our adjusted margin guidance to 70 to 120 basis points for the full year. Based on those improved operating assumption, we are increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance by $10 million to $1.360 billion to $1.4 billion and our adjusted FFO per share for the year to $1.41 to $1.46. In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and remain confident about our outlook for the remainder of 2014. Based on our expectations for industry fundamentals, including a supply growth forecast that remains below historical averages, we continue to believe that the current growth cycle in lodging will be sustained. Our portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from continued improvement in the economy, particularly given the significant investments we have made in our assets in the form of maintenance capital expenditures and ROI and repositioning investment. Thank you, and now let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail. Gregory J. Larson: Thank you, Ed. We are very excited about another impressive quarter. Our overall strong performance was predominantly driven by the outperformance of our properties on the West Coast, which increased the RevPAR by nearly 14%. This was achieved with a 4.5 percentage point increase in occupancy and a 7.2% growth in average rate. Our San Francisco, Denver, Seattle and San Diego hotels all achieved high-double-digit RevPAR growth. The outstanding results were due to robust market demand and a benefit for renovation activity at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis in the prior year. Our 5 hotels in the San Francisco market grew RevPAR by over 25%, outperforming the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR by 10 percentage points. Group and transient room nights increased 16% and 8.5%, respectively, while contract room nights decreased over 30%. This mix shift allowed the properties to drive ADR, and ADR increased in all segments by almost 16% in the quarter. We expect our hotels in the San Francisco market to continue to outperform the portfolio for the rest of the year. The hotels in Denver grew RevPAR in the quarter by 19.3%, benefiting from excellent city-wide, which allowed the properties to shift transient to higher-rated segments. The Seattle hotels increased RevPAR by 18.5%, driven equally by occupancy and ADR gains. The increase in RevPAR for these hotels exceeded the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR by 7 percentage points. The Seattle hotels also have an impressive food and beverage revenue increase of 31%. The restaurant renovation at the Westin Seattle and the leading space renovation at the W Seattle Hotel contributed to the outstanding growth in food and beverage revenues. The San Diego hotels' RevPAR increase of approximately 16% exceeded the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR by almost 6 percentage points. The strong results were due to the completion of the rooms renovation at the Manchester Grand Hyatt and the San Diego Marriott Mission Valley hotels. In addition, the solid group pace of these hotels allowed the managers to drive transient ADR. For the full year, we expect the RevPAR at our San Diego hotels to outperform the portfolio, but not to the extent that the first quarter outperformance and RevPAR will be negatively impacted by the meeting space renovation scheduled at the Hyatt for the fourth quarter this year. For the full year, we expect the West Coast properties to continue to outperform, particularly in San Francisco, Seattle, Phoenix and Hawaii. RevPAR growth in our central and south locations, while only 2.5%, was better than our expectations for the quarter. The anticipated weak first quarter convention calendar, combined with the unexpected winter weather, impacted Chicago hotels where RevPAR declined 2.8%. Four of the hotels with a combined RevPAR increase of 4.6% had fewer vacation travelers due to the Easter holiday shift. We expect these hotels to show improved results in April. Our comparable results for Florida exclude our 2 large assets, the Orlando World Center Marriott and The Ritz-Carlton, Naples. RevPAR on a combined basis at these 2 noncomparable hotels increased over 11% in the first quarter. Including these 2 assets, RevPAR increased almost 7.5% in the quarter. In the central and south locations, we expect RevPAR growth to exceed that of the first quarter results and perform in line with the portfolio, with the exception of the JW Marriott Houston and the Houston Airport Marriott hotels, which will be negatively impacted by the extensive room renovation and repositioning efforts scheduled to begin in the second half of 2014. Our properties on the East Coast underperformed our portfolio in the first quarter with a RevPAR increase of 2.6%. Hotels in Boston had a RevPAR decline of 2.7%, while Washington, D.C. was relatively flat to last year. New York hotels' RevPAR increased 4.2% and exceeded the STAR upper upscale market result of 0.1%. The 2.7% RevPAR decline at our Boston hotels was attributable to a room's renovation at 2 of our 5 hotels. The Sheraton Boston's room renovation began in December and was completed in that April. And the Westin Auckland completed its room renovation in March. Excluding these 2 hotels, the other hotels' RevPAR increased 5.6%. Our D.C. hotels' RevPAR was relatively flat. It was negatively impacted by the 2013 inauguration. In addition, the Hyatt Westville [ph] Hotel was under renovation in the first quarter of this year. We expect that our D.C. hotels will remain challenged in 2014 due to the opening of the Marriott Marquis in May and the JW Marriott rooms' renovation that begins in Q4 2014. The RevPAR growth of 4.2% for our hotels in New York underperformed the portfolio, but as I mentioned, materially outperformed the STAR upper upscale market by 4 percentage points due to the strategy of pursuing group business for the Super Bowl. Both our New York Marriott Marquis and Sheraton New York hotels served as the headquarter hotels for the NFL and the media during the Super Bowl. This strategy also significantly contributed to a food and beverage revenue increase of almost 18%. This exceptional food and beverage result was also due in part to the meeting space renovation at the Sheraton New York, as well as the new ballroom and great room at the New York Airport Hotel. Now let me move to our international portfolio, which had an outstanding quarter. In constant currency, first quarter RevPAR for the consolidated international portfolio grew 10.3%. All of our Latin American hotels achieved double-digit RevPAR growth in the first quarter and grew RevPAR by a combined 21%. Our JW Marriott Rio benefited from demand that shifted into the first quarter in anticipation of the World Cup to take place this summer. JW Marriott Mexico City was a large contributor to the solid RevPAR growth as the hotel is benefiting from strong corporate demand and the rooms renovation completed last year. We expect our Latin America hotels to continue to outperform the portfolio with the World Cup in Brazil this summer, strong city-wide in Chile and a strong corporate demand in Mexico City. The Asia-Pacific portfolio grew RevPAR 8.2% due to solid convention group and increased transient business. Our Hilton Melbourne had a robust double-digit increase in RevPAR as the hotel benefited from the group demand generated from the closing of the Sydney Convention Centre. This increase in group demand allowed the hotel to drive transient rates, which were up 9% in the first quarter. It is estimated that the Sydney Convention Centre will remain closed for its major redevelopment efforts for the next several years. Overall, first quarter RevPAR performance of our consolidated international hotels is very impressive. The comparable hotel RevPAR for the European joint venture increased 2.8% for the quarter in constant euros. The notable statistics for our European joint venture results in the first quarter is the double-digit EBITDA growth on a RevPAR growth of 2.8%. The outstanding EBITDA growth rate is due to the strong increase in food and beverage revenues and the hotels' ability to control cost. Food and beverage revenues increased 9.5% in the first quarter, mainly as a result of an 18% increase in banquet and AV revenues. The strong banquet performance was driven by increased corporate catering demand at 11 of the 18 hotels. In addition, the Sheraton Stockholm, which is not in the comparable results, performed extremely well with double-digit growth in RevPAR and food and beverage revenues. Despite the higher-than-expected utility cost associated with the harsh winter, our first quarter comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin increased 120 basis points due to a rate-driven increase in RevPAR and excellent food and beverage sales and flow-through. Our first quarter food and beverage flow-through was an impressive 58.5%. Looking to the rest of 2014. While we believe there is still room for occupancy growth, especially in our group business, we expect that RevPAR will continue to be driven primarily by rate growth, which should lead to solid rooms flow-through. We also expect food and beverage revenue to improve a full point above our previous guidance, primarily in banquet and catering due to improving group demand. Based on the strong results for the first quarter and our improved outlook for food and beverage revenues and profit, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to increase 70 basis points at the low end of the RevPAR range and 120 basis points at the high end of the range for 2014, resulting in a 10-basis-point increase in our margin guidance. At this point, we are forecasting that approximately 28% of our full year EBITDA will be earned in the second quarter. This suggests the resulting EBITDA for the second quarter will be lower than the last year due primarily to the following 3 reasons : First, as you will recall, in the second quarter of last year, we sold land adjacent to the Newport Beach Marriott Resort and Spa and recorded a $21 million gain. Second, we lost EBITDA due to the timing of numerous asset sales completed after the second quarter of last year. And third, the $5 million per quarter negative impact from the Hyatt Maui timeshare sales that we brought to your attention on the last call, where we reduced our second and third quarter EBITDA. But for the full year, we estimate that the timeshare project will increase EBITDA by approximately $12 million. During the first quarter, we redeemed or repaid $675 million of debt with available cash. We ended the quarter with approximately $392 million of cash and $782 million of available capacity under the credit facility and a debt balance of $4.1 billion. In summary, we are excited with our first quarter results as this is a great way to start the year. As you know, we have the best balance sheet in the history of the company with the lowest leverage, the highest fixed charge coverage ratio and the lowest annual cash interest expense in our history, resulting in meaningful free cash flows. As I stated at our Investor Day last month, we are in an incredible position with a powerful and flexible balance sheet with all options open to us as we progress through the cycle. We will continue to focus on creating value for our shareholders. This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from Andrew Didora. Andrew G. Didora - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Ed, I guess, the recovery of group has obviously been a common theme out there over the past few months. I'm just wanting to get your thoughts on some of the deeper trends here. I guess, when you look at your future bookings, are you seeing group strength spread outside of the top gateway markets into more resort locations or areas, like Arizona and Hawaii? And if so, do you see any difference outside the room spend between these locations and the -- maybe some of the top gateway markets? W. Edward Walter : I could tell you that we, certainly, are seeing growth across all of our markets. This particular quarter, it was centered more in New York and the West Coast, but we also saw some pretty solid group growth down in Florida, in both Orlando and in Naples. That's a big part of what drove the activity at those hotels that I commented on. And so I feel comfortable that we're seeing it across different price points. As it relates to the spend, we've been encouraged that -- for the catering contribution. So that's the amount of F&B per group room. It has been up for the last 2 quarters. I think that still is something that tends to jump around a little bit, but I've been encouraged by the fact that, that grew as aggressively as it did in the last quarter. And then maybe, at least an early signal that companies -- I think the bigger swing here is in the corporate group activity. The companies are getting a bit more comfortable in spending more associated with their group event. Andrew G. Didora - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. And then my second question. We'd certainly like to get your thoughts here on New York. I know Greg gave some of the statistics in his prepared remarks. You guys obviously helped perform the market nicely in 1Q. What are you seeing in terms of both the high growth this year in the market? And how are your group and transient bookings looking for the rest of the year in New York? W. Edward Walter : I mean, I feel -- certainly, there is no secret that supply in New York is pretty heavy this year. I think the numbers that we're looking at across all segments are in the mid-7% range. And unfortunately, it looks like 2015 is also going to be fairly strong on the group side. I think our current estimate now is somewhere north of 5%. I would say that group activity in New York continues to be solid. I wouldn't say it stands out one way or the other compared to the other markets that we're involved with. It's obviously in the first quarter because the Super Bowl did quite well. But I think looking longer-term, I think in our portfolio, it seems to be consistent with the rest of the portfolio. As I -- it was going to be -- the problem with that much supply is that despite the fact that New York is one of the most exciting, strong demand-generating markets in the country, probably in the world, that's a lot of supply to overcome. And I think we're all going to be struggling a little bit to generate rate growth in that environment. Operator : And our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Ed, you've mentioned earlier that there really is not much to report from a transaction side of things. Maybe you can just talk about why do you think the transaction market has been relatively quite ablated by the seller or buyer issue, waiting on playing the cycle a little bit longer before putting more stuff out for sale? And then I have a follow-up. W. Edward Walter : Yes. It's -- that's a very good question. I think pricing is slowly but surely working its way back up, not quite to the levels that we saw during the last cycles but, certainly, has been improving. So you would think that, that would start to draw more sellers out. I think the fundamental problem, perhaps, is the fact that there is a universal perception that this cycle has a fair amount of time left to run. You've got low supply for the next week, the next 2 years, and I would still be guessing that 2016 supply will be below demand. So as -- and again, I think that's fairly well-known. So there -- I think the desire on the part of people to sell is probably driven more by strategic reasons than a sense that they -- the time is to -- now is the time to act in order to get out before the cycle starts to go the other direction. So you haven't seen -- just not seeing that impetus behind that higher activity. Overall, though, I think we've been seeing each year. We've been seeing the amount of transaction activity slowly creep up. My general sense from conversations with the brokerage community in the beginning of the year is that they expect activity in 2014 to exceed the activity that we saw in 2013. And so I think we'll probably have a little bit better clue on that as we work our way through the summer because there seems to be the way the cycles work the last couple of years. That activity begins to heat up as we get into some of that NYU conferences and some of the others that tends to be a focal point for folks to put assets on a market with the desire of closing those transactions before the end of the year. Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Great. And then, Greg, with respect to your '14 guidance -- and you gave some great commentary on the group trends. With regard to your food and beverage revenue guidance or increase, does that also incorporate an increase in F&B revenues in the 2Q through 4Q? Or are you just kind of adding back in the increase with the better-than-expected results in the 1Q? Gregory J. Larson: Yes. I think, primarily, it's because of our great results in the first quarter. Right, we obviously incorporated those great results in our full year guidance. And then so I'd say that was the main part of increasing our F&B guidance for the full year. But I think we also feel because of that business success that we had in the first quarter, I think we also feel just a little bit better for the rest of the year as well. Operator : And our next question comes from Ryan Meliker with MLV & Company. Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division : Just to talk a little bit more about the acquisition environment out there. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of private equity capital being raised. Leverage seems to be plentiful for private equity. So I'm just wondering, as you guys are eyeing acquisitions right now, are you looking at things that maybe there aren't a lot of institutional buyers interested in right now, whether that be one-off select service assets, similar to what you did in Nashville with White Lodging or whether that'd be resorts in the Caribbean that, maybe, don't appeal to as many others? Or more international, et cetera? Just help us understand where you guys are focusing your efforts on the acquisition strategy. W. Edward Walter : Well, I'd say we are certainly looking internationally, although its competitive in that environment too. I think as we look -- start to think about the United States. We are looking -- we'd love to do some more transactions that might set up similar to the Powell Hotel acquisition in San Francisco. We'd be open to more limited service. I don't know how much more limited service development we would end up doing, but I think in a few select markets, we would be open to that. So one thing I would say is we have no particular plans to be buying in the Caribbean. There may be opportunities there, but our past experience in that market would suggest that, that's a market better avoided. Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then, with regards to things like the Powell or one-off development opportunities that become available, at what point in the cycle do you decide that those types of investments don't make a lot of sense, just given the remaining duration of the up cycle? W. Edward Walter : That decision ends up being a market-by-market analysis. I think that, certainly, in the timeframe that we're in today with some of the commentary that I gave and the answer to a prior question, I would certainly feel comfortable about pursuing and repositioning in those markets in the U.S. And there are, I think, markets that show really good demand growth, you could see an opportunity to do new development, although, again, I don't want to suggest at all that, that's the priority for us. So I think for a select service development, there is an opportunity to move forward with something in that area and feel comfortable that you're delivering still at -- in a point in the cycle when it's trending positive. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citi. Kevin Varin : This is Kevin Varin with Michael. You mentioned last call that 1Q EBITDA would account for around 21% of full year EBITDA. So just based on that commentary, it would imply you beat internal expectation by roughly $20 million. So just considering that EBITDA guidance was only raised $10 million at the midpoint, is it fair to say that Host is tracking at the high end of the ranges where we stand today or is there something else that we should be looking for with -- in the remainder of the year? Gregory J. Larson: [Audio Gap] and multiply it by -- I think where the consensus runs for the year, I think, that would suggest that we're really beat by about $17 million to $18 million, so close to your $20 million, but a little bit lower. The other thing that I would add is when you look in the income statement, you'll notice that we had $3 million gain, insurance gain, which we had -- we had forecasted that gain, but not in the first quarter, right? So I -- that sort of takes your $17 million to $18 million down to $14 million or $15 million. And then, as you correctly pointed out, we increased our full year guidance by $10 million. So it's a little bit maybe left on the table. And then, that's one of the reasons why I think when we look at our RevPAR guidance for the year today of 5% to 6%, we do feel a little bit more comfortable at the mid- to high-end of that range than we did a quarter go. Kevin Varin : Okay. And then just one last question. Can you guys quantify the benefit of the holiday calendar shift in 1Q and maybe how much of an impact it will have on -- as we think about 2Q? W. Edward Walter : I don't know that we've really run that specifically on that. I think we've been suggesting that we would expect the second quarter to be weaker than the first quarter primarily because of the holiday shift. I don't know that I have a specific percentage to give you, though, for -- to quantify the impact of it. Operator : And up next, we'll take Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Maybe if you could just talk about the balance of dividend versus opportunity to buy assets. And could we look for -- what would -- what is the gaining issues that keep you from maybe raising that dividend over the next -- for the next 12 to 24 months? And then, separately, you've given some color on RevPAR strength, but maybe talk a little bit about brands and location, more on brands. Are there certain brands where you're seeing greater strength? I know you don't normally talk about that, but maybe give us some sense on that. W. Edward Walter : Yes. Steve, let me answer these in reverse order. I think we're going to shy away from any specific commentary on brands within our portfolio. Yes, I think that they all report on their own, but I don't -- so you get a good sense as to how they're performing on a relative basis, but I don't -- we've not provided disclosure on that in the past, but I don't think this would be the time to change. On your question on the dividend, I'd say, broadly speaking, we would be expecting, as EBITDA continues to grow, we would be expecting in general for our taxable income to continue to increase. And so that in and of itself should require that our dividend continue to grow. So then the second part of the question becomes what to do with the free cash flow that we're generating, which, as we've talked about in the past, is north of $300 million a year, and how do we think about applying those proceeds going forward. And I think the question is you sort of identify, kind of comes down a bit to what do the acquisition market look like and what are the opportunities and whether it's acquiring properties or whether it's investing in the properties that we already have. That -- I think to the extent that we can find investments of either type that meet our return the parameters, and I'd say that at this stage of the cycle, that would still be our first choice in a lot of ways, but to the extent that we do not identify those opportunities or to the extent that the sales [indiscernible] we generate from asset sales exceed the amount of the investment opportunities, then we're going to look at ways to return that capital to our shareholders. I think certainly one way to do that is an increase in the dividend. And at some point, another alternative would be to repurchase stocks. But I think we're open to looking at each of those as we work our way through the year and into 2015. But I'd still say that given -- we still want to continue to grow through investment if we can, but if not, we'll look to return capital. Operator : And up next, we have Robin Farley with UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So just looking at the outperformance in Q1 RevPAR, I'm just curious why full year RevPAR guidance wouldn't move up to -- are there factors that you think won't recur because it sounds like the group trends -- and I know you were cautious about Q2, but just overall for the year, group tends are positive, so I guess why not higher RevPAR growth for the year? W. Edward Walter : I think, Greg sort of answered that question to some degree. And I think, you're also right that we're -- we'd probably feel more comfortable raising that after we get -- the halfway point in the year. But we certainly, given the strength of our Q1 performance, which was better than what we had anticipated in February, we certainly feel more comfortable in the higher end of the range of RevPAR that we provided. We'll look at that when we get into July for our next call. Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And then, just looking at the outperformance, I had expected that maybe it was other markets that was made up for Washington, D.C., given that the market was weak, but you outperformed the market so much in D.C., and just kind of what was behind that. W. Edward Walter : I think that what ended up happening in Washington is that there was just better overall transient activity and some group strength, especially in March, that helped Washington do better than we had expected at the beginning of the year. Yes, the other thing too is inauguration, while a bit of a hill to climb, was not as beneficial in '13 as we would have hoped. So it's still a challenge for the market for this year, but perhaps not as big as in the historical context. Operator : And up next, we have Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Can you help us think about what your banquet in F&B revenue per room is versus prior peak and just how we should think about the trajectory of the segment growth longer term? W. Edward Walter : To be honest, I don't have -- some of this is -- our reporting and our statistical analysis has really improved significantly since the prior peak, so I -- that's a good -- that's something we should look into a little bit more directly. I don't really have an answer for you on where our banquet revenue would match compared to the prior peak. On food and beverage overall, we're still -- we finished the year running about 10% behind where we had been at the prior peak. So I would be expecting -- for this particular quarter, I'm sure we were beginning to approach where we had been before for the full year. Given the guidance that we've given, we probably are still -- we are still looking to be 5% to 6% behind our prior peak level food and beverage activity. Gregory J. Larson: Yes, I think another way to look at food and beverage, especially if you look at it through the end of last year, typically, food and beverage growth is about -- the growth rate is about 50 basis points lower than our RevPAR growth. And what we've seen so far during this recovery is that food and beverage growth, about 150 basis points lower than our RevPAR growth. So obviously, food and beverage really underperformed with groups so far during this recovery, and then, except for, obviously, in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year when group really performed, because of that our food and beverage growth was quite strong. Operator : And our next question will come from Anthony Powell from Barclays. Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Research Division : The result of Seattle and Denver were very impressive. Can you talk about the availability of assets in those markets? Are hotels for sale there and are there any new development opportunities in those markets for you? W. Edward Walter : We have looked at a couple of transactions in Seattle. I don't know that we have looked at anything in particular in Denver in the last 12 months. There are a few new developments being contemplated in Seattle, probably, the largest of those is the convention center hotel that a local developer is attempting to finance and get off the ground. So I think -- but overall level of activity in both markets is probably about market average right now. I wouldn't say that there's been a big surge in activity there. Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Great. And on Chicago, it's kind of underperformed, I think, the market over -- U.S. overall. What do you think has driven that result and how do you view your booking trends there both this year and next? Gregory J. Larson: As we mentioned during the quarter, I mean, obviously winters in Chicago are never great, but this year, I think, with the polar vortex and 50 degrees below 0, the weather was quite extreme. And so I think that explains some of the weakness in Chicago for the first quarter. I think we think that, that will -- Chicago will perform better as we move throughout the year. W. Edward Walter : Yes, I think generally though, in Chicago for this year we are -- we're not seeing as -- this is not a strong of a convention year [indiscernible]. This market tends to move a bit in the cycle. This is not one of the [indiscernible] Chicago. And so we probably expect lower levels of performance there for the full year. Operator : And our next question will come from Chris Woronka. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : You guys noted a pretty good benefit from renovations completed, I guess, last year at several of your larger West Coast hotels. If we look out a bit, I mean, how does your renovation pipeline look, if you will? Is there a drop-off in that benefit at some point or does it remain pretty constant? W. Edward Walter : My guess is that, well, certainly, we'd get a benefit as we enhance the hotel in terms of both one part as you get a little bit of a year-over-year benefit from not having a disruption, but more importantly, you get a benefit from having enhanced the asset. I think we're looking at relatively consistent levels of maintenance level spending over the next couple of years. It should -- we should see a surge in disruption other than at particular hotels. And we hope we continue to spend intelligently on those hotels, we should continue to see lift. But I don't know that I would expect anything remarkable one way or the other for the next couple of years. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay, fair enough. And then, maybe you could contrast a little bit for us the international and domestic markets in terms of the transaction market and how the buyers and sellers differ and what they're looking for and also maybe how much time you guys spend internally looking at international versus domestic deals. W. Edward Walter : The latter really tend -- we have distinct team so we have a European team that's focused on Europe. We have a Latin America team that's focused on Latin America. And then, of course, we have our office in Singapore that focuses on Asia investments. And then, in the States, everything right now has been out of assessment. So I'd say from a standpoint of time, each of the offices is pretty -- is 100% focused on activity within their region. And then, as that bubbles up, Greg and I and Struan and the other folks that are on our investment committee, that tends to vary based on the month depending upon what's hot in a particular jurisdiction. Overall, I would say, we'd still find that we've spent the majority of our time talking about investments in the U.S., but the international piece of it is a meaningful component of what we're looking at. In terms of the buyers internationally, yes, I'd say that our world is becoming more and more of a global marketplace from investments. And so capital from Asia is interested in the U.S. Capital from the Middle East is interested in the U.S. and Europe. Certainly, the Asian markets are very active with Asian capital directly. So we run into different types of investors in different markets, but certainly, some of the larger players, especially some of the sovereign wealth funds, are active across really in every jurisdictions and we will -- we run up against them on transactions on a consistent basis. Operator : And our next question will come from David Loeb with Baird Investment Banking. David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : This is really for Greg. On the gain on sale, which must be Philadelphia, can you talk about why there was such a large gain, why the tax effect on that was relatively small? Do you have some plans related to that 10/31, whatever, or will you need to have some dividend related to that? Gregory J. Larson: Yes, David, you're right on Philadelphia. But when we think about our dividend for this year, the gain associated with that asset is sort of already baked in to our philosophies for the dividend this year. So when we talk about increasing dividends, and Ed talked about it earlier, it's really going to come from 3 things. Obviously, as our EBITDA increases and taxable income increases, our dividends certainly will increase. I also think that with subsequent asset sales we will expect to have gains, and those gains will, we don't like kind of exchange, will obviously be added to our dividend and could increase the growth of our dividend. And then, as Ed also mentioned, if we're not -- we can't find acquisitions, then our free cash flow -- if you look at our free cash flow today before we make a dividend payment or before we make investments, that's actually over $750 million. So again, if we can't find investments, that will go towards an increased dividend as well. So all those things matter, but Philly, there's really not much to talk about from the gain on Philly. David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. So no plans to defer that one, no temporary arrangements? Gregory J. Larson: Correct, correct. Operator : And our next question will come from Nikhil Bhalla with FBR. Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : Just a question on your group pace for the rest of the year. Did I catch that right that your pace at around 5.5% is somewhat consistent from what it was about 2 months ago? W. Edward Walter : Yes, yes. I would say that we're generally consistent with where we've been. But I think we were pretty encouraged by the -- by what we saw on the group side kind of both activity in the quarter, for the quarter and looking forward. Our in-the-quarter, for-the-quarter activity was up about 19% compared to what we had experienced in 2013, so that was a good jump. As we look at the -- as I commented, as we look at the rest of the year, we saw an increase in activity of -- north of 4% in terms of room nights for the remainder of the year, but if you leave out April, where the -- where activity was down because of the Easter holiday, the activity after April was up nearly 10%. So I think, when we kind of watched what was happening in-the-year, for-the-year-type activity, we felt pretty good about that and that made us increasingly comfortable with how group will play out for the full year. Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : Got it. So it's fair to characterize, I guess, that just given that second quarter is so much bigger, the impact of Easter seems to have a little more disproportionate -- disproportionately larger impact other than have-it-fallen kind of the opposite reign in the first quarter. W. Edward Walter : Perhaps. I mean, there's sort of pluses and minuses of the holiday being in April. I mean, Mike, I'm not certain I would completely agree that the impact is disproportionate in the second quarter, because I think that the second quarter overall is a bigger quarter for us, and so the losing of the 2 weeks, and losing some group activity there is probably in some ways potentially less impactful in Q2 than it would be in Q1, which tends to run at a lower overall level of volume. The benefit of it being extended in a full year context is that it does tend to -- later Easter tends to extend the spring break season. And so again, it wont show up in a year-over-year number for the -- for April or for Q2, but in the long run, it stretches out the Easter -- or the spring break season, which tends to be a positive in Florida. So I think all in all, we'd rather see Easter occur in April if we had a chance to control the calendar. Operator : And our next question will come from Harry Curtis with Nomura. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : Just a quick follow-up. What percentage of your portfolio do you think needs more CapEx or return on investment CapEx spend? When -- sort of what inning are you in do you think? W. Edward Walter : Harry, I don't know that we -- I mean, if you -- when I think of that question, I think of that in the context of assets that might have some deferred CapEx, because of course, we're always in a situation where we are reinvesting in our hotels. I don't know that I have a real accurate specific number to give you, but I would say that I would view it, from a deferred CapEx perspective, as very small. And the bottom line is we've been consistently investing in our portfolio. As we've talked about in the past, we took advantage of low pricing back in 2010 and 2011 to accelerate our capital program in an effort to try to both improve the quality of our hotels, but more importantly, do it for less money. And I think we're still seeing the benefits of that in terms of our performance. So I'm sure if I sat down and looked at the list of our hotels that -- there's a half a dozen where you could say we've under invested. Some of that -- in general, if that situation exists today, it's because we didn't see an economic benefit from making the investment. And so typically, those are assets that we might be contemplating on selling while we don't think it's -- where we think the buyer would probably prefer to control that CapEx decision. On the ROI front. Those are the things that we are constantly looking at. Of course, we've spent some time at our Investor Day trying to highlight the fact that we felt that there are a lot of opportunities within the portfolio. So as you look at what we're -- this year, we've talked in terms of $70 million to $80 million. I would view that as a target in my own mind about what we should be trying to do on a consistent basis going forward. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : Okay, fair enough. And then the second piece is, with that in mind over the last 12 months, the lodging sector -- or in the lodging, the 2 stocks that have returned the most capital to shareholders have been Hyatt and Marriott, and those are the 2 that have outperformed, while the 2 that have been more reluctant to increase shareholder returns, Starwood and Host, are up about half as much. And so Mike, what I'm wondering is, do you recognize that more capital return would lead to higher investor interest? And given that you have meaningful free cash flow, what gets you to move on this? Gregory J. Larson: Ed, before you answer, I just want to correct one thing. From our last quarter call through today, Host has been the best performing lodging stock by far. Go ahead, Ed. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : I was looking at that over the last 12 months. W. Edward Walter : I mean, I don't know that I have a lot to add these on what I said in -- I think I was responding to Steve's question before. I don't know that it's so much of a performance question that would drive us to do with. I mean, I think we've been pretty clear that we thought it was important to achieve certain balance sheet objectives before we start to contemplate any -- paying a dividend that would be larger than taxable income. As we've been indicating over the course of the different -- whether it's calls or investor presentations, during the first 4 months of this year, we have made great progress in strengthening our balance sheet and are feeling that we're going to be accomplishing our objectives in 2014 on that front, so that does provide us with the opportunity to think about deploying the free cash flow that we generate in different ways. As I said before, I still hope, because I think the cycle has got room to run, that we can find ways to invest that profitably in assets that will grow, that will generate a return in excess of our cost of capital and that will drive improve shareholder return. The extent that those opportunities don't present themselves, then we'll look at the alternatives. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : Basically, from the -- reading between the lines, just given that you want to find assets to invest in, we really shouldn't be expecting any meaningful lift in the dividend. Is that fair? W. Edward Walter : I think the answer is -- unfortunately, it depends. I mean, we have -- I think one of the things that sets us apart in our industry has been our discipline in investing capital. And we try to highlight that at our Investor Day in terms of discussing our performance compared to our competitors. So it will come down to that decision, that opportunity. And I wouldn't -- it's just -- I think it's early in the year to try to reach a conclusion on that one way or the other. Gregory J. Larson: Yes, I'd also add that right even -- if you look at it over the last couple years, right, just -- it depends on, I guess, your definition of significant dividend increase. But even just -- certainly, our dividend have increased with taxable income, which has been about $0.16 increase each year. And then, in addition, I would say, as we fill assets, we'll have further gains and that -- it certainly increase our dividend as well. So -- I think some of it depends on how much we invest in assets, but I think even if we find out what to invest in, certainly, our dividend is going higher. Operator : And our next question will come from Patrick Scholes from SunTrust. Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : I wonder if you can break down by month how your group business faired as far as RevPAR for the first quarter. And then, how did April end up for you? W. Edward Walter : We don't know April yet. I mean, that's a month that have just ended yesterday, but we don't have the reporting for the first few days -- the last few days of the month nor do we have segmentation, but I'm sure it will be weaker than last year just because of the calendar shift. In general, if you look at the overall level of group -- increase in group activity that we had, which was really north of 6% group increase and group room nights, I would roughly say that January would probably been -- kind of was the weakest of that time period and really just reflected a small increase. February was slightly above 6%, and then, as you get to March, we were -- I think we were north -- we had double-digit group room night growth in March. Operator : And our next question will come from Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Looking at the transient rate growth in the quarter, just over 3%, and with group being so strong, did you leave money on the table there? Or is there weather-related low-rated business you were taking? W. Edward Walter : Yes, I think that's a great question. We spent some time trying to study that. I think you're right at one level, is that we did have some weather disruption and we had the weather disruption in some of our higher-priced markets, so that affected the statistics of it. I think the other factors that affected transient rate growth is if we actually look at the transient rate growth that we were seeing at individual hotels, it was stronger than the 3.5% that we've just discussed in our comments here, but part of what we saw happened in the quarter is that we had stronger group business in some of our higher-priced markets and we had -- we certified an increase in our transient level business in some of our lower priced markets. And so when you actually work your way through the math, it has the effect of understating our transient rate growth for the overall portfolio. But as I talked with our revenue management team about what was actually happening in market, they were seeing higher levels of growth than what we actually disclosed here. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And now turning to the balance sheet, you have a few 6% notes via the Vs and the Zs about $800 million, any of that prepayable? Gregory J. Larson: Yes. We can call both of those notes in 2015. So that certainly -- if interest rates remain low, that's certainly something we will look at. Operator : At this time, Mr. Ed Walter, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. W. Edward Walter : Great. Well, thank you, all, for joining us on the call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our first quarter results and outlook with you. We look forward to providing you with more insight into how 2014 is playing out on our second quarter call this summer. Have a great rest of your day. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Operator : Good day everyone, and welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts, Incorporated Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Gee Lingberg : Thanks, Jamie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Host Hotels & Resorts' second quarter 2014 earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our website at hosthotels.com. With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our second quarter results and then will describe the current operating environment, as well as the Company's outlook for 2014. Greg will then provide greater detail on our second quarter performance by markets and our balance sheet. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, here is Ed. W. Edward Walter : Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of solid operating results driven by strong rate in demand growth across our business. Combination of our strong operations through the first half of the year and our continuing optimism about the state of the lodging industry have resulted in improved full-year guidance which I will discuss in a few minutes. First let's review our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $411 million for the quarter and $819 million year-to-date, which exceeds consensus estimates. Our adjusted FFO per diluted share was in line with estimates at $0.43 per share for the second quarter and $0.76 year-to-date. These strong results were driven by several factors. First, for the quarter, our portfolio achieved a cycle high occupancy level of 81% which allowed our hotels to thrive rate increases exceeding 4%, resulting in an improvement in comparable hotel RevPAR on a constant currency basis of 5.1%. As Greg will describe in greater detail our consolidated comparable international hotels continue to perform quite well generating RevPAR growth of more than 16% in the quarter. Our growth in the second quarter was driven primarily by our transient segments as group demand moderated primarily because of the shift of the Easter holiday, from March of 2013 to April of 2014. Transient demand increased 1.6%; transient rate jumped 5% which lead to a transient revenue increase of more than 6.5%. As expected, the holiday shift resulted in a smaller increase in group business, as group demand increased by just 0.8% and group revenues increased by slightly more than 2%. Looking at our results for the first half of the year, which eliminates the noise generated by the higher holiday shift, provides a clear insight into the health and character of our business. For the first half of the year, group demand increased nearly 3.5%, rate increase by more than 2.5% and group revenues increased by more than 6%, one of our best performances since the last peak. The primary driver of these excellent group business trends with corporate group which benefited from a 5% plus increase in demand and a 5% increase in rate, leading to a revenue increase of more than 10.5%. The increased group bookings limited transient demand growth to 0.7%, but allow hotels to push transient rate increases that average nearly 4.5% leading to transient revenue growth of more than 5%. With these two key elements of our business performing quite well, comparable RevPAR growth on a constant currency basis for the first half of the year was 5.9%. Matching the strong group demand our banquet revenue increased 6.6% for the first half of the year leading to total comparable F&B revenue growth of 4.8%. The increase in banquet spending fueled more than a 50% flow through in the food and beverage department. That combined with the rate driven RevPAR growth resulted in adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 60 basis points for the quarter and 80 basis point for the first half. Overall, we are quite pleased with our results for the first half of 2014. On the acquisition front, we continue to look for opportunities to increase our investment in our target markets; we do have an active pipeline at this juncture and expect to complete additional transactions before year end. However, given the timing and certainty of these \u2013 given that the timing and certainty of these transactions is difficult to predict, we've not included any additional acquisitions in our forecast. On the disposition front, we continue to actively market properties and we expect to close on one or more transactions by the end of the year, in this incidence while the sell market is also difficult to predict, the guidance I will discuss in a few minutes does assume that we will complete incremental sales of approximately $200 million by year end. Turning to capital investment, this quarter we invested over $90 million on a variety of projects that we believe will enhance the competitiveness and value of our portfolio. Specifically, we invested approximately $71 million on renewal and replacement projects including the renovation of the Sheraton Boston 428 room South Tower. In addition to 2700 square feet of restaurant and public space at that hotel. On the value add side of the equation, we invested $4 million into our recent acquisitions. And more importantly $18 million on ROI capital expenditures, including the repositioning of 10,000 square feet of restaurant and public space at Denver Marriott West. Looking at total capital expenditures for the first half of the year, we spent over $180 million on our properties, resulting in improvements to 2800 guest rooms over 100,000 square feet of meeting space and 60,000 square feet of public space. Of that amount $147 was spent on renewal and replacement CapEx, $7 million on acquisition CapEx and $29 million on ROI investments. For the full year we would expect to spend $330 million to $350 million on renewal and replacement CapEx. $25 million to $30 million on acquisition CapEx, and most importantly $65 million to $75 million on redevelopment and ROI CapEx. We remain focused on this last piece of capital investment as we believe it provides an opportunity to drive superior returns from our already strong portfolio. Now let me spend some time on our outlook as there are number of factors that keep us optimistic about the remainder of the year. While full-year expectations for GDP growth have obviously tempered most economists expect second half growth to be quite strong. That, supplemented by better job growth and continued strong inbound travel, bodes well for strong demand growth. Supply growth in most of our markets, excluding New York continues to be constrained especially in the upper upscale segment. Our year-to-date occupancy is running well north of 77% and well above our 2007 peak which suggest that we should benefit form strong rate growth. Our group booking pace for the remainder of the year is quite strong, with revenues exceeding the prior year's pace by more than 6%. This is an improvement over our position at the end of Q1. Bookings in Q2 for the quarter and the remainder of the year ran better than 14% ahead of the prior-year's pace. It is worth noting that our third quarter bookings are trending better than our bookings in the fourth quarter which generally attribute to year-over-year comparability challenges, to change in holiday timing, and some increase in a renovation activity at a few large group hotels. Overall in addition to providing a foundation for strong RevPAR growth, this group base should also support solid banquet activity, leading to good F&B flow-through. The combination of these factors some easier expense comps, reduced insurance expenses, and lower unallocated costs suggest that second-half margin should increase to the better rate than we experience in the first half of the year. With that in mind, we expect the comparable hotel RevPAR for the full year will increase between five and three quarters in 6.25% and adjusted operating profit margin growth will range between 100 and 130 basis points. These assumptions result in adjusted EBITDA of between $1.380 billion to $1.405 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.44 to $1.47. The midpoint of this updated guidance reflects a $12.5 million increase in adjusted EBITDA and a $0.02 increase in FFO per share, compared to our prior guidance. I should note that this guidance also includes a reduction to account for the $200 million in sales we expect to complete in the fall, but does not include the benefit of any of the acquisitions we might complete. In summary, we are pleased with our results for the first half of the year and remain confident about our outlook for the remainder of this year and into 2015. We expect the fundamentals in our business will remain solid and with continued low supply growth, we will continue to deliver meaningful growth. Thank you and now let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our dividend increase and operating performance in more detail. Gregory J. Larson: Thank you, Ed. I am pleased with our solid performance this quarter, which exceeded our expectations. Our Latin America hotels were the best performing hotels in the quarter with an impressive constant currency RevPAR increase of 40%, as our JW Marriott Rio that benefited from the World Cup and our JW Marriott Mexico City benefited from the completion of its renovation. A few hotels combined to grow RevPAR 53% in the second quarter. More specifically, June RevPAR at the JW Marriott Rio increased 182% to over $790. The World Cup continued to boost RevPAR in Brazil through mid-July, with strength in Rio and Mexico City's post renovation lift, we expect our hotels in Latin America to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter. As expected, the West Coast was once again the strongest performing domestic region with RevPAR growth of 7.1% for the quarter. The increase in RevPAR was driven primarily by average rate, which grew nearly 7%. The San Francisco market continued to lead our West Coast market, with RevPAR growth 12.4% for the quarter. This was predominantly driven by an ADR increase of 11.3%, as our properties have benefited from the positive mix shift from lower rated special corporate and contract business to higher-rated transient and group. We expect our hotels in San Francisco to continue to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter. Seattle and Phoenix both had a great quarter with RevPAR growth of approximately 9.5% in each market. Our Seattle hotels increased ADR by 8.8% by positively shifting the mix from lower rated contract business to higher-rated transient business. Our Phoenix hotels RevPAR growth was driven by both occupancy and ADR gains. Our hotels in Phoenix had strong weekday group business which enabled the hotels to drive better transient mix. For the third quarter, we expect our hotels in San Francisco to continue to outperform the portfolio with a strong group phase and continued positive mix shift. And our Phoenix hotels should perform inline with the portfolio with good group and leisure demand. Our hotels in Denver exceeded our expectations with a RevPAR increase of 7.5% for the quarter driven by strong business transient demand which translated into transient ADR gains. Based on the strong group business on the books for the hotels in Denver, we expect these properties to outperform in the third quarter. The Hawaii market underperformed in the quarter, with RevPAR growth of 2.9%, due to the negative impact of the timeshare construction next into the Hyatt Maui hotel. With stronger group activity and projected increase arrivals to Maui, we anticipate the performance of the hotels in Hawaii to improve in the third quarter. Generally, we expect our West Coast properties to continue to be our best performing markets in the third quarter. As expected, Florida was the bright spot for the southern region. And our Florida hotels benefited from the Easter shift with RevPAR growing 16.5% in April, and 13.5% for the quarter. Since the summer months typically not strong months in Florida we expect our Florida hotels to perform inline with our portfolio in the third quarter. Houston RevPAR grew only 2% in the quarter, as hotels lost 2.3 percentage points in occupancy while growing ADR by 5.1%. The occupancy loss was due both to a difficult comparison at the JW Marriott in Houston and attrition related to city-wide conferences. Due to the lack of city-wide events for the remainder of the year, and our planned renovations at the JW Marriott Houston and Houston Airport Marriott in the fourth quarter, we expect the Houston market to underperform the portfolio for the rest of the year. Atlanta and Chicago both reported declines in RevPAR of 0.5% and 1.8% respectively. Atlanta experienced a difficult comp with the NCAA Final Four in April of 2013, while Chicago had a weak city-wide calendar when compared to last year. In fact, June 2013 was a record month with five city-wides, those events did not repeat this year which resulted in the RevPAR declined for the Chicago hotels. We expect improvements in the third quarter for both Atlanta and Chicago, as city-wides for both markets improve. RevPAR in Boston increased 7.8%, driven by an average rate growth of 8.3%. Our properties in Boston were able to shift from group to transient business and raise the average rate. With reduced activity at the Heinz Convention Center, we expect our Boston hotels to underperform the portfolio in the third quarter. RevPAR in New York grew 5.5% exceeding our forecast with better an expected occupancy, offsetting weaker average rate growth. A strong May drove the quarter's group volume increase of 13.8% and contributed to the 8.5% improvement in food and beverage revenues for the quarter. Despite the strong group business in New York, supply growth in the market hampered our ability to increase transit rates. We expect the New York market to experience similar growth in the second half of the year as the first half of this year. Washington DC and Philadelphia RevPAR declined 2.4% and 2.7% respectively for the quarter. The decline in Philadelphia was related to the loss of group room nights due to a decrease in city-wide events in the second quarter. As expected our hotels in Washington DC are having a challenging year. The majority of our hotels experienced ADR decline versus last year with the entire deficit in group ADR. For the quarter, group room nights were down 9.2% compared with last year. For our DC hotels were able to replace the loss in group nights with transient and contract rooms, we have done so at lower rates. We expect Washington DC hotels will continue to lag in the third quarter. The comparable hotels RevPAR for the European joint venture increased 0.6% for the quarter and 1.5% year-to-date and constant Euros. F&B revenues grew 2.5% for the quarter and 5.7% year-to-date, the strong banquet revenue growth of 7.2% in the quarter and 12.3% year-to-date. We continue to be impressed with our European hotels ability to increase food and beverage revenues as well as controlled costs and to drive EBITDA growth. EBITDA grew 3% in the quarter and 4.5% year-to-date. International travel from the U.S. and other parts of the world for both leisure and business travel should have a positive impact on the rest of the year. We expect the second half RevPAR to significantly outperform the first half of the year. During the second quarter, we refinanced the loan secured by three properties in Brussels at a very attractive initial all-in rate of 2% and extended and extended the maturity to 2019. Comparable hotels adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 60 basis points in the quarter and 80 basis points year-to-date. Lackluster group performance due to the Easter holiday shift in the second quarter resulted in a slight increase in comparable food and beverage revenues and modest margin growth. However, our second quarter results were anticipated and do not represent a trend going forward as we had indicated that full year comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin growth is expected to be over a 100 basis points. Based on RevPAR growth that is driven by stronger ADR growth, easier comparisons for certain room expenses, and decreases in our insurance, utilities and repairs and maintenance expenses, we expect to achieve a full year margin forecast of 100 to 130 basis points which will result in second half margin growth well in excess of the first half. We anticipate 22% of our full-year EBITDA will be earned in the third quarter. During the quarter, we amended and extended our existing credit facility. The borrowing capacity on the credit facility remains the same. Under the amendment the maturity was extended to 2019, including extension and we reduced pricing by 30 basis on the revolver and 32.5 basis point on the term loan. U.S. dollar denominated revolver borrowing today would result in an initial all-in rate of 1.35%. At this time, we have approximately $220 million outstanding under the revolver and $500 million under the term loan. Based on our outlook for the industry and our operating performance, we have determined that we can sustain a meaningful dividend increase. Therefore, our Board approved a 33% dividend increase to $0.20 for the third quarter.  Given our strong extended operating outlook and significant amount of free cash flow, we anticipate this will be the dividend for at least the next several quarters. In addition, to ensure that a dividend represents 100% of our taxable income including gains from potential asset sales, we may need to pay a special dividend at the end of the year. Finally, as we have indicated previously while we intend to use available cash predominantly for acquisitions or other investments in our portfolio to the extent that we are unable to find appropriate investment, we may elect in the future to use available cash for other uses such as a special dividend, which would be in excess of taxable income. In summary, we are excited to have the best balance sheet in the history of the Company. And we are in a remarkable position with all options open to us as we progress through the cycle. We will continue to assess the best use of our free cash flow and ensure that we are focusing on creating value for our shareholders. This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering questions you may have. Operator : (Operator Instruction) and we will take our first quarter from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin M. Farley \u2013 UBS Investment Bank : Great. Thanks. Looking at your North American RevPAR performance and just kind of looking at the FTR data, there is a couple hundred basis points of difference. And I wonder if you could address that and it may just have to do with the comp set. You're seeing a same-store comp set and SCR is not seeing a same-store comp set. And if that's the case I wonder if you could kind of characterize your RevPAR increase in \u2013 using the same kind of non-comp set, just to give us a sense of how it's tracking versus the overall US number? W. Edward Walter : Yes, I think that certainly is a question or your question is one that\u2019s been highlighted on some of the other calls and I think that this particular last quarter, the differences between say the top markets, the top 19 or 20 markets in the country and the rest of the industry as a whole, that gap has expanded a little bit from a performance perspective. I think what you're seeing is a variety of things. I think number one is I think right now secondary markets have, in the last couple of quarters have performed better, compared to some of the leading markets. I think that may just be a natural evolution of the lodging cycle. I think that we also are seeing that in this most recent quarter, the fact that the leisure segment was probably a bit stronger, in part because of the shift of the Easter holiday and the fact that our economy is growing at a better rate, ultimately led to some increased leisure travel, but it showed up significantly in some of the lower price points. As we look at how we are performing compared to our comps and compared to our markets and leaving out some of the hotels that \u2013 including in our portfolio that might have had significant work done to them last year and so this year are benefiting from a big move in terms of RevPAR growth and you can see that in our results in some of our non-comp hotels had double-digit growth. The reality is that we are running \u2013 for the full year we're running slightly ahead of our comp set in terms of yield index. So we are pleased to see that we picking up share. Robin M. Farley \u2013 UBS Investment Bank : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And just my other question is, in your opening remarks you mentioned your guidance does not assume any additional acquisitions between now and the end of the year. And I wonder if you could just give color on is that due to the transaction market or to kind of a change in your approach to being a net acquirer this year? W. Edward Walter : No I think it\u2019s just reflective of the fact that we haven\u2019t \u2013 you know we don\u2019t have anything to announce at this point in time. We do what I view as a reasonably active pipeline. And frankly I would be surprised if we didn't complete a few acquisitions before year end, but since the timing of those is not completely set and they are not done yet, we didn\u2019t want to try to adjust our guidance to reflect the fact that we might be acquiring an asset. I think in terms of how the year is going to play out, we still feel good enough about the overall length of the cycle that we would love to be an investor, but we're disciplined about this. And if we can't get the returns that we want from the acquisition then we won't be completing those acquisitions. Robin M. Farley \u2013 UBS Investment Bank : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Bilerman with Citi. Kevin J. Varin \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Hi. This is Kevin Varin with Michael. Just carrying along with the acquisition pipeline, can you just give us a little bit more color on the pipeline and what you're kind of looking at the time? Because I know you've alluded to in the past that you've weighed international expansion. Just based on what we're seeing in the transaction market, is the pipeline skewed more U.S. or international? W. Edward Walter : It\u2019s still a mix, it\u2019s still a mix and I think we are seeing decent activity in Europe. You're seeing both banks and certain funds look to begin to liquidate some assets in Europe. So we are certainly looking at a couple of opportunities there. We are also looking at a number of opportunities across both, what I call the higher end of select service segment and the full service segment in the U.S. Activity in Asia has been much quieter of late and so there is nothing \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say there is anything imminent in Asia today. Kevin J. Varin \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Okay. And then just turning to asset sales. Can you go into more detail on the potential timing of the sales? Is it more backend loaded more in 4Q or is this something that can transpire in the next couple months? W. Edward Walter : It\u2019s really hard to say. I think that it\u2019s really \u2013 the reality is we have a number of hotels that are now. So I would be expecting that we closings throughout, really the fall and into the early winter. Kevin J. Varin \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Wesley Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Wesley K. Golladay \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Good morning, everyone. Looking at the group business, can you give us a little more color on that? And are you starting to see the increase in lead time for booking events? And when do you think you'll get more pricing power on the rate side. It looks like you had 2.5% for the first half and I imagine some of that's due to mix shift. W. Edward Walter : Yes, you\u2019re right about that. We have been consistently seeing here now for the last year a pretty significant bump in corporate business and that has certainly happened throughout the second quarter and has happened throughout the year as I mentioned in my comments. So as overall as we step back and look at our group business, we were quite pleased with the level of booking activity that transpired in the second quarter. Our room nights that were booked in the quarter for the quarter were up about 9% and as I mentioned in my comments, our room nights for the rest of 2014 \u2013 our room nights were up about 5% for the rest of 2014 and our revenues were up 14%. The rate growth for the rooms that were booked during the second quarter for the rest of the year in 2014 was up 18.5%. So the bookings that we\u2019re getting done now are considerably higher rates than the business that we would have booked last year. Now, obviously our rate in itself in our group business is not going to go up anywhere near 8% because we obviously have a number of \u2013 the bulk of our rooms are already on the books. But I have to say we have been quite encouraged by the booking pace that we have been seeing. Wesley K. Golladay \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. Can you give us an update on what you have for 2015 on the books? How much of those higher ADR group might flow into next year? W. Edward Walter : I think that the answer is it still a little unclear as to how \u2013 exactly how that's going to play out for 2015 \u2013 first half of 2015 looks quite good on both the rate and the occupancy side. I think as you look at the second half of 2015 which his obviously much further out. We are not showing is bigger than increase in room nights yet. And that also the rate growth there is still a little lower too. Wesley K. Golladay \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay thanks for taking the question. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew G. Didora \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Ed, I guess I'll follow-up on your potential acquisitions. We've been noticing a nice pickup over the last several quarters just in terms of overall pricing out there in the transaction market. Can you maybe give us a sense of, in terms of the opportunities you are looking at, what kinds of discounts to replacement cost you're seeing now? And maybe how this could compare to what you guys were seeing at the last cycle, say I kind of the 2005, 2006 timeframe? W. Edward Walter : You really want me to open up my memory banks to try to remember exactly where it was back then. I think the answer on that varies so widely by market that it would be hard to really give you a realistic number, in terms of where things are trading compared to replacement costs. I would generally say that in most markets, if you're looking at full-service product, it is still better to be a buyer than a developer, which would generally tell you that you're at a point where assets are still trading at discounts to replacement cost. Certain of the markets that have had stronger recoveries, some of the West Coast markets and probably \u2013 and maybe Miami \u2013 have started to show pricing that's beginning to approach replacement cost. But I'd still say it falls shy \u2013 or falls short of actually getting to that. If I were trying to compare more generally the market today versus 2006 and 2007, I would agree with the general sentiment that pricing has gotten stronger in 2014. I think it's following a normal pattern, which is the further you work your way into the cycle the strong pricing tends to become. I would not say that we are yet at the levels of 2006 and early 2007. Where, at that point in time, we were finding that as we would evaluate acquisitions, the prices that others were prepared to pay routinely 15% to 20% ahead of what we saw was reasonable. And certainly there are occasions where that happens right now, but I'd say the market today \u2013 it's certainly more rational than it was back then. Andrew G. Didora \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. That's helpful. And then my second question just relates to, in your prepared remarks you talked about how your occupancy levels are now at, or slightly above, prior peak. Could you maybe just remind us what your prior peak EBITDA was on your portfolio as it stands right now? And do you see any impediments to maybe getting back to those levels this cycle? W. Edward Walter : Greg you have that number? Gregory J. Larson: Yeah, if you go back 2007, our peak EBITDA was \u2013 call it $1.48 billion, so it was close to $1.5 billion and obviously Andrew we\u2019ve acquired \u2013 quite a few hotels since then and we sold some hotels as well. So I would that\u2019s not really a comparable number. But that's where our peak EBITDA was back then. Andrew G. Didora \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right. I guess I was asking what peak EBITDA was on your current portfolio. If you had owned your current assets back in 2007. W. Edward Walter : Andrew I think we are going to need to get back to you on that number. I just don\u2019t think we have right now. Andrew G. Didora \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Anthony F. Powell \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Could you update us on our your F&B spend per group night trended in the second quarter versus the first quarter? And how do you expect that to trend for the rest of the year? W. Edward Walter : It was up strongly in the first quarter. It was about flat in the second quarter. I think as we look at the second half of the year, we are expecting it to be up reasonably well in the third quarter. It\u2019s hard to tell on the fourth quarter right now because the lot of the F&B spending doesn\u2019t get pen down until relatively shortly before the events going to happen. Most of the growth we are seeing right now is in corporate F&B and the pattern that we are hearing is the top to the hotels about how the F&B part of the booking occurs, is that they typically booked sign the contracted one level, but then as they get closer to when the event actually occur, they then finalize exactly how big of F&B program we are going to see. So we have generally been seeing corporations making the decision to spend a bit more on food and beverage once they\u2019re having the event. And so we\u2019ll have \u2013 that\u2019s I feel relatively confident to spending in the third quarter should be fairly strong. A little harder to predict what\u2019s going to happen in the fourth quarter. Anthony F. Powell \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. My second question is, you mentioned that there were some upscale full-service hotels in your pipeline. Given some of the RevPAR strength was on the second quarter, how much of a priority is it for you to increase your exposure there? Thank you. W. Edward Walter : I don\u2019t know that for us right now investing is really just assumption of expanding our presence in our target markets if we find investments that achieve reasonable premium to our cost of capital. And I think as we look at the various opportunities that we reviewed where comfortable buying full service hotel \u2013 upper upscale hotels and upscale hotels. I think just by virtue of the fact that upscale hotels tend to be smaller that as you look out over our \u2013 look at the way our portfolio was structure over the next couple of years. You are not going to see a meaningful increase in an overall context in terms of the representation of upscale hotel, but we\u2019ve had good success with ones that we\u2019ve acquired so far. And we certainly are open within our designated markets to acquiring more. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Anto M. Savarirajan \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co: Hi. Good morning. This is Anto Savarirajan on for Steve Kent. First question on the European JV portfolio. RevPAR of 60 basis points for those 18 hotels. Can you provide us some color as to what you're seeing there? And how that 60 basis points compares to what others are seeing there in the market? And if there is any major topic that we need to be aware of? And again, when you say the second half should outperform the first half, what are the factors driving that? W. Edward Walter : Yes. I think what we have seen in Europe, for the first half of the year is somewhat similar to what we have seen in the U.S. Where we've noticed, especially in Spain and in the United Kingdom that the major urban centers that under performed some of the regional and the resort markets. I think they're for different reasons. I think a number of Europeans have been traveling inside of Europe instead of outside of Europe this spring. In part because some of the turmoil in the world. And so as a result, the Spanish resorts did quite well and the Spanish resort markets outperformed the Spanish urban centers. In the UK, I just think you saw an increase in regional activity, but some of that is a function of that in comparison to London that had a much bigger opportunity to grow. I think the fact that we were \u2013 our numbers were weaker in Europe is somewhat of a combination of both of those factors as well as some \u2013 sort of just the ebbs and flows of our business. There were a number of big events, whether it's the celebrations that happened in Venice or the air show that moved Paris, I think to London, this year. A couple of big group events that had happened in Amsterdam in 2013. They did not repeat on a year-over-year basis, and so unfortunately what that meant was that RevPAR growth in Europe and our portfolio was weaker. As Greg mentioned, we did have good solid food and beverage growth. And we were very pleased with the level of flow-through that we are able to achieve given our revenue increase. So all in all, we were happy with where the EBITDA came out, but a little disappointed with what the top line growth was. I think the second half of the year, some of those trends reverse. There are some markets that are picking up some group business, so that should be a favorable plus. And all in all, the sense that the hotels have \u2013 of Americans and others traveling to U.S. given some of the challenges and some of the other source locations around the world, they felt that their bookings for the summer and into the early fall are quite solid. Hence the sense that we have that RevPAR growth and revenue growth in general would be quite strong \u2013 but quite a bit stronger in the second half. Anto M. Savarirajan \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co:  Got it. Thank you. The second question is, some of your key markets are already running occupancies in the high 70s to low 80s. And we get the reference when you say most of the gains in RevPAR should come from rate. If there is any occupancy gain to be had, how should that look and where can that come from? W. Edward Walter :  I think that there certainly is still room for additional occupancy gain. But I think you're right in your general sense that most of RevPAR growth will come from rate increases as opposed to further occupancy increases. If you look across our portfolio, there's still room \u2013 the middle of the week we are running at very high 80%, almost 90% occupancy. So, the middle of the week is really about driving rate, which is great, because as we all know that flows through to the bottom line better. There's still room to drive occupancy on a Friday night or on a Sunday night to the extent that you can move group activity to those nights. And in general, as long as we continue to have the situation we have, which is demand is growing quicker than supply, ultimately that means occupancies countrywide have to go up. And I suspect it will be a benefit of that. But as consistent with what we've described, we generally think the bulk of our RevPAR growth going forward is going to happen generally through rate growth and not occupancy growth. Anto M. Savarirajan \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co: Got it. Thank you very much. Operator :  And, we\u2019ll take our next question from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas G. Allen \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: : W. Edward Walter :  Yes. It looks like this year we will probably end up in the low 50% range in terms of the number of hotels that pay incentive management fees. Our expected increase in incentive management fees this year is actually not particularly great. I think were generally looking at flat. A lot of that really stems from the fact that we have renegotiated a few of our contracts with our operators and achieved, for particular hotels, the meaningful reductions in incentive management fees. So the others are going up and there some more hotels that are paying it, but that's than offset by our negotiations. As we look out past that, I think we generally would expect that we would see historical levels of increases in IMF in 2015 and 2016. But nothing \u2013 I don't know that we'll continue to see that 50% grow. And I don\u2019t know that I necessarily have a sense as to what that looks like in say 2015 or 2016. But I suspect we'll start to approach the prior peak again in terms of the number of hotels that are paying incentive management fees. Thomas G. Allen \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: cute, : W. Edward Walter : I don\u2019t know that there's any particular reason for why \u2013 to be honest I haven't looked at our guidance in comparison to theirs, so it's hard for me to be articulate about that type of comparison. I think that we are very happy with the way the first half of the year came out. Our RevPAR results, both domestically and internationally, have come in better than what we expected at the beginning of the year. When we look at the second half of the year, we feel fairly encouraged by the trends that we're looking at. And are essentially comfortable in really taking our RevPAR guidance from what \u2013 to the high end \u2013 the midpoint today is the high end of where we were at the last quarter. So I think you should view that as a general endorsement of the fact that we think things are going quite well. We feel encouraged on both the group and the transient side. We're looking forward to the second half of the year. Gregory J. Larson:  I agree. And I think if you just look at the quarter results. I know some people, some analysts talked about Marriott producing 6% of RevPAR. But, if you look at their upper upscale luxury properties, I think they reported 4.4% growth in RevPAR, which was comparable to our RevPAR growth for our domestic hotels at 4.5%. And if you include are non-comp hotels \u2013 our growth was closer to 5%. Thomas G. Allen \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  Helpful. Thank you. Operator : And, we\u2019ll go next to Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joseph Greff \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co.:  Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. And it's been a busy earnings morning. So if you have already talked about \u2013 answered my questions I apologize. But Ed, with regard to your assumption of selling an asset for $200 million in the fall, which I think you referenced, how much EBITDA is coming out in the fourth quarter or in the back half of the year related to that asset sale? And then how much EBITDA have you recognized year to date and through the date of close of that asset as well? W. Edward Walter :  Joe, I think that in round numbers, we've assumed about $4 million of EBITDA for that asset. We're thinking of it as an asset, but again I want to sort of caution everyone that we are marketing a number of hotels. So what we've essentially done is put about a $4 million deduction in our numbers to reflect the fact that we expect a number of sales to occur. In round numbers, probably the EBITDA benefit from that for the first part of the year is probably in that 10% to 12% range. Whether it's an individual hotels or it's a combination of hotels. Joseph Greff \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co.:  Great. And then you referenced in the press release, explaining the year-over-year performance in adjusted EBITDA. Among those things you talked about cost, primarily selling expenses, associated with the timeshare in Maui. Can you quantify that for us? And do we expect that going forward? Gregory J. Larson:  Yes. Joe, I talked about it before, we are expecting to have expenses each quarter leading up to the fourth quarter. And then when we open the timeshare in the fourth quarter, we'll actually be able to recognize the revenues. And so when we think about the full year, we are looking for around $11 million or so of EBITDA from the timeshare. But I guess our point here is that, when we look at expenses for the second quarter of this year, we had timeshare expenses this year, but if you looked at our second quarter and the prior year we didn't have timeshare expenses. So that was one delta, sort of comparing our adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter this year to the second quarter of last year. Obviously the other two big differences \u2013 one was the sale of some of our assets, including the Philadelphia Convention Center. Obviously, a lot of EBITDA in the second quarter of last year are not in our results this year. And then last in the second quarter of last year we also sold some tennis courts at the Newport Beach Marriott for approximately $21 million. So that was in our EBITDA last year and not this year. Joseph Greff \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co.:  Okay. Operator :  And, we\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Meliker with MLV & Co. Ryan Meliker \u2013 MLV & Co LLC :  Hey. Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been answered, as well. But I was just hoping you could give us some color with regards to the acquisition environment. Obviously, we keep hearing that private equity is very active, leverage levels, seem to be back \u2013 kind of approaching where they were in 2006, 2007 when you guys were net sellers, more than net buyers. You've been pretty disciplined with your capital in terms of acquisitions over the past, call it, two years or so. How are you able to find opportunities that might be appealing in the back half of the year, as you mentioned? Is there something different? Are these repositionings, renovations? Help me understand what is going on there. Thanks. W. Edward Walter : Yes. I don't \u2013 I think it's \u2013 what you generally described is correct and there's no doubt that the environment as, net capital has become more available, there\u2019s no doubt that the overall environment has become more competitive. We are certainly trying to take advantage of that on the sales side, especially trying to sell assets that are in markets that are not core, from our perspective, for our future, as a way of really benefiting from the strengths and the liquidity in the market. Obviously, as you correctly analyzed, when you have those sorts of conditions, it's much more difficult to be an acquirer. I think what it just comes down to is, we're looking for opportunities where we can create value at this point. And so some of these transactions \u2013 you look at the Powell Street transaction that we did in San Francisco the Powell Hotel and that's an opportunity where we are going to invest meaningful capital in the building to try and create something new and different that we expect will be quite successful at a very attractive price. Some of the opportunities that we are looking at other places involve a change in operator or a change in brand. And so with that, with that new approach to a hotel there's an opportunity to generate better returns, than where the hotel is current \u2013 what the hotel is currently providing. And that allows it to satisfy our yield requirements. Ryan Meliker \u2013 MLV & Co LLC :  Ed, that makes a ton of sense. I guess when you think about whether it be a repositioning or some type of alteration. Are you looking at anything that's going to be materially lengthy, where it might take two years to get the massive renovation? Or it may take two years before you get the returns that you are looking for? Or are you more focused on things like you just mentioned were it's a simple rebranding or change in operator where you think things are being left on the table? W. Edward Walter : If I were to look at today's pipeline, I would say that we're probably focused \u2013 the couple that would fall into that category are probably more near-term than long-term conversion opportunities. But that doesn't mean we wouldn't look at things that would take longer, I would just say that what we happen to be looking at today tends to be more near-term. And then of course we have a few opportunities within our portfolio, like the Four Seasons in Philadelphia where there's going to be an opportunity to reposition that asset. That will probably by its nature take a bit longer. Ryan Meliker \u2013 MLV & Co LLC :  That make sense. And then lastly, the economy, albeit slowly, seems to be improving in Europe. Are you guys getting more acquisitive overseas with your joint venture partner? It certainly seems like there's a lot more hotels hitting the market that might be of institutional quality today than there were a year ago. W. Edward Walter : I think you're right in that assessment. We\u2019ve certainly seen a pickup in activity in Europe. And both we and our partners are certainly interested in looking at everything and then trying to decide which ones make the most sense. But we have \u2013 I think you're right in your assessment that there has a pickup in activity there and I will be disappointed if we don't get some transactions done in Europe in the second half of the year. Ryan Meliker \u2013 MLV & Co LLC :  All right. That's helpful. That's all for me. Thanks a lot, Ed. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) And, we\u2019ll take our next question from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. C. Patrick Scholes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey :  Hi. Good morning. Just two questions here. You briefly touched on your Hawaii project. I'm wondering what are your full EBITDA expectations from that project? W. Edward Walter : Well, I think as Greg noted, we are expecting this year to generate about $11 million in EBITDA at the end \u2013 by the end of the year. All of which will ultimately show itself in our fourth-quarter numbers. C. Patrick Scholes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey :  Okay. But how \u2013 I mean over the life of the project, what are your ballpark expectations for EBITDA? W. Edward Walter : I don't think that we have disclosed anything on that. And so I'd rather differ on trying to give an overall sense of that project. C. Patrick Scholes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. And then just a quick modeling question. From $200 million of asset sales, ballpark how many rooms? W. Edward Walter : You know what, I can't really give you a good number on that, because the reality is \u2013think about it \u2013 if it's a more expensive hotels, then it's not going to be as many rooms. If it's a combination of some older hotels that are at lower RevPAR levels, it'll be a lot more rooms. So unfortunately I don't think I can give you a really useful number for that. C. Patrick Scholes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. No problem. Thank you anyway. W. Edward Walter : All right, thanks. Operator :  And, we\u2019ll take our next question from Smedes Rose with Evercore. Smedes Rose \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.:  Hi. Thanks. I was wondering if you could talk about any of sort of large redevelopment or ROI projects that you have in your pipeline now, I guess, into next year? And as you think about spending $65 million to $75 million this year, would you expect that to kind of move up or down meaningfully next year in either direction due to those projects? W. Edward Walter : Smedes I would guess I mean we're looking at a number of projects. We talked about. We talked about the Houston Airport total renovation or redevelopment or before. We have the ballroom in San Diego, so that which is a considerable project that probably we\u2019ll run in the $90 million to $95 million. And that starts construction at the end of this year. We have a couple of other hotels that we are expecting to invest a fair amount of capital in, because they are appear to be some opportunities to redevelop those too, both out in the western part of the country. So I would guess today we are about to go \u2013 your question about a week early because we are about to review our entire capital budget next week \u2013 our capital budget for 2015 \u2013 next week. But I'm guessing our ROI expenditures for next year will probably go up slightly. Smedes Rose \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.:  Okay. Thanks. And then just curious about your view on the DC market over the next couple of years, what you guys are seeing? And is the new hotel and convention center, kind of doing \u2013 I guess \u2013 what the convention center had hoped? W. Edward Walter : I think the answer is so far, when you look at the bookings \u2013 the bookings for 2015 are modestly better. The bookings for 2016 are considerably better. The last time I looked the bookings for 2017 were looking quite good. And so I think the answer is the conventions \u2013 the new hotel is helping Washington to grow its convention center business. I have been quite encouraged by some of the more recent employment data that I have seen, which has suggested that job growth has started to return to the Washington area. And I'm generally very encouraged by just watching how the city is transforming itself over the course of the last, call it, 10 to 15 years. Where it really \u2013 Washington has become quite a different city from \u2013 the city that I remember when I first came down here in the late 70s. So, I think that the one negative, and it's a big one for Washington, continues to be what's been happening with the government. The combination both on the political side, the lack of activity on the Hill has to some degree stunted some business transient travel that we might normally have seen.  : So as an opportunity to create value and generate value, we still are pretty optimistic about Washington. But it will certainly \u2013 we're looking forward to getting that period of time our convention business starts to pick up again. And then hopefully at some stage here, we start to see \u2013 we\u2019re seeing a little bit more broader growth than what we've experienced the last couple of years. Smedes Rose \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator :  And, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019ll like to turn the call back to Mr. Walter for any closing or additional remarks. W. Edward Walter : Well, thank you for joining us on this call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our second quarter results and outlook with you. We look forward to providing you with more insight into the remainder of 2004 on our third quarter call in the fall. Have a great day. Enjoy the rest to your summer. Thanks. Operator :  And again, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you for your participation.",

Edward Walter - President and CEO Greg Larson - EVP and CFO Analysts : Andrew Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo Kevin Barron - Citigroup Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Rich Hightower - ISI Group Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley Joe Greff - JPMorgan Anthony Powell - Barclays Ryan Meliker - MLV & Company Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets Gee Lingberg : Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our website at hosthotels.com. With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our third quarter results and then will describe our current operating environment, as well as the Company's outlook for 2014. Greg will then provide greater detail on our third quarter performance by markets. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, here is Ed. W. Edward Walter : Thanks, Gee and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased to report another quarter of outstanding operating results driven by strong rate in demand growth especially in group business. Strong F&B and other revenue growth, combined with improved flow-through and better than expected margin performance led to earnings results that exceeded our expectations and which allow us to improve our full year guidance. We continue to feel quite good about the fundamentals in the business and our outlook, which I will discuss in more detail in a few minutes. First let's review our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $331 million for the quarter and $1.05 billion year-to-date. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 23% and exceeded a consensus estimate and our forecast for the quarter. Our adjusted FFO per diluted share grew 36% to $0.34 per share for the quarter and stands at $1.10 year-to-date. These strong results were driven by several factors. First, our portfolio continued to achieve high occupancy levels of nearly 80% this quarter, our highest third quarter occupancy level since 2000. The strong demand allowed our hotels to drive rate increases of 6.4% resulting in an improvement in comparable hotel RevPAR on a constant currency basis of 7.9%. Looking at our total portfolio, pro forma RevPAR growth for the quarter was 9.2%. As Greg will describe in greater detail, our consolidated comparable international hotels continue to perform quite well, generating RevPAR growth of 11% in constant dollars in the quarter. Our growth in the third quarter was driven primarily by strong demand in all of our group segments, especially our highly rated associated association group business, which increased nearly 14%. Our corporate business also performed well with a demand increase of more than 3.5%, complemented by a rate increase of better than 4.5%. While group trends were favorable for the entire quarter, the calendar shift related to the Jewish holidays helped cause our September group revenues to increase by more than 15%, which was the second strongest month of the entire year. Overall group demand in the quarter increased nearly 6%, rate jumped by more than 4.5% and group revenues improved by more than 10.5%. Not surprisingly the significant increase in group bookings limit the trends in occupancy, which declined slightly, but it positions the hotels to push trends in rate increases that average more than 6.5%, leading to transient revenue growth of more than 6%. Benefitting from the strong group demand, our banquet and AV revenues increased 8.4% for the quarter, leading to total comparable F&B revenue growth of 6.1%. The increase in banquet spending helped fuel better than 40% flow through in the food and beverage department, that combined with the rate driven RevPAR growth resulted in comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 305 basis points for the quarter. Year-to-date we've seen constant currency RevPAR growth of 6.6%, which when combined with F&B revenue growth of 5.2% led to comparable total revenue growth of 6% and adjusted margin expansion of 155 basis points. Overall, we're extremely pleased with our results for the third quarter. On the acquisition front, we continue to look for opportunities to increase our investment in our target markets. As we announced a few weeks ago, our European joint venture acquired a 90% interest in the 394 rooms Grand Hotel Esplanade in Berlin for a gross purchase price of \u20ac81 million. The hotel is a short walk from the city's leading high-end retail street and strategically situated between the historic and the new sections of the city in proximity to many embassies. This acquisition further diversifies the current European JV portfolio, provides new exposure to a target market in Germany and created relationship with the talented local independent operator event holding group. We also announced the acquisition of the B2 Miami Downtown Hotel for $58 million. The hotel is located in the heart of Miami's business and financial district within walking distance with the American Airlines Arena and situated on Biscayne Boulevard across from Bayfront Park ensuring that the hotel will continue to have unobstructed water views and long-term redevelopment potential. I should note that the B2 Miami Downtown is heart of our broader strategic initiative to increase our exposure to third party operators and/or independent or soft brands, in order to complement our existing portfolio of high quality brand manage assets in our target markets. We intend to convert this hotel to a true independent brand and have brought in Destination Hotels and Resorts to operate the property. Acquiring properties with management and brand flexibility whether it's in the recently acquired Powell Street in San Francisco or the B2, provides us with increased exposure to the growing urban lifestyle boutique segment and allows us to further differentiate and diversify our product in a given target market. Including the B2 Miami, we currently have seven hotels managed by third party operators and we're exploring opportunities for conversion to independent or soft brands with another three hotels we currently own. On the disposition front, earlier this month we announced the sale of the $719 room Tampa Marriott Waterside Hotel & Marina for $199 million, bringing our total sales for the year to nearly $0.5 billion. The sale of this property is consistent with our plan to reduce our exposure in non-core markets. In addition, our European joint venture sold the Sheraton Skyline Hotel & Conference Centre for \u00a333 million. We continue to actively market properties and we expect to close on one or more transactions in the next few months with potential total incremental sales amounting to $50 million to $150 million. These contemplated sales will have minimal effect on our 2014 earnings. Turning to our development and value enhancement projects, construction on the timeshare project at the Hyatt Regency Maui is nearly complete. It will include a 131 timeshare units, totaling nearly 240,000 square feet. It features an 8,000 square foot open air lobby with direct ocean site line, a 3300 square foot fitness center and owners lounge casual dining restaurant and pool side bar. We contributed excess land at the hotel as well as cash and exchange for a 67% interest in the timeshare venture. Sales efforts began in October of last year and we will expect they will continue to ramp-up as we approach the anticipated mid-December resort opening. We're also making progress on our development project in Brazil. The Ibis and Novotel hotels are substantially complete and in the process of final inspections and occupancy permit. The Ibis is scheduled to open in mid November. The Novotel should open in mid December. Turning to capital investments, this quarter we invested approximately $28 million on ROI capital expenditures and invested approximately $57 million year-to-date. Several of these projects have included the conversion of underutilized space in our existing hotels to more profitable users. For example, we completed the renovation of unfinished storage space on the 32nd floor of the Seaport Tower at the Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego into two 2400 square foot meeting rooms with spectacular views. In addition, 11,000 square feet of meeting space is expected to be added across three other properties by yearend. In total we invested approximately $8.5 million in these projects. I would expect to generate EBITDA lift of approximately $1.5 million per annum. Other ROI projects include brand conversion such as the Sheraton Memphis Downtown. At this property, we are at the final stages of the assets rebranding effort, which includes a full soft and case goods renovation of the rooms, lobby, restaurant and public space, exterior facade, portico share, and various mechanical and fire light safety projects. The hotel is now managed by Davidson Hotel Company, who has a deep understanding of the Memphis market. Since taking over management and completing the renovation plan, they have improved advanced bookings at this group oriented hotel by more than 38% at significantly higher rates. And finally we continue to invest in projects, which reduce our energy cost. We have or are investing more than $17 million in two projects that are too large New York hotels, the Sheraton New York and the Marriott Marquis at Times Square. It constructs low pressure boiler plants that will create steam that will create the steam we employ to heat the building and our hot water, allowing us to disconnect some of the local steam utility. Based on current utility cost, we would expect to save more than $3 million per annum from this investment. For the full year, we would expect to spend $85 million to $100 million on redevelopment ROI and acquisition CapEx. We also expect to invest approximately $330 million to $345 million on renewal and replacement CapEx, including several large projects such as the meeting space renovations at the Manchester Grand Hyatt in San Diego and the Grand Hyatt DC and room renovations at the JW Marriot DC, JW Marriot Houston, New Orleans Marriot and San Antonio Riverwalk Marriott. These projects are scheduled for the fourth quarter to take advantage of softer demand period, but it worth noting that approximately 50% of our CapEx spending related to projects causing disruption to our hotels will occur in the fourth quarter. Now let me spend some time on our outlook for the remainder of the year. We're extremely pleased with our third quarter results, which exceeded our expectations in part because of the strength of our group production. Following the pattern we experienced in the first half of the year, because of holiday shifts and renovation timing I just mentioned, we do expect a softer quarter from group business in the fourth quarter. This will likely result in flat banquet revenues compared to last year where F&B revenue growth was quite strong. Offsetting the lower groups demand, our trend in demand looks quite solid through the remainder of the year. Overall, we would expect that our second half of the year results will be better than the first half of the year, which allow us to increase our operating guidance for the year. With that in mind, we expect a comparable hotel RevPAR for the full year will increase 6% and 6.25% and comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin growth will be 120 basis points to 135 basis points. These assumptions resulted in an EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA range of approximately $1,400,000 to $1,410,000, which represents an increase of $12.5 million at the midpoint and adjusted FFO per share guidance of $1.47 to $1.49, which represents an increase of $0.250 at the midpoint. While it is premature to offer any specific guidance relative to RevPAR revenue growth for 2015, we do believe that the fundamentals for our business continue to be quite attractive. Low supply growth will remain a positive factor for the lodging industry with only a few markets trending above the longer term average. Demand growth in the industry bolstered by robust international travel into the gateway markets has significantly outperformed the long-term average for the last three years, growing roughly at 3%. If predictions of 3% plus GDP growth for 2015 prove to be correct, we think demand growth in 2015 could improve further. Domestic booking trends, adjusted to eliminate the impact of the Super Bowl in northern market are quite solid with both demand and rate up leading to booked revenue growth in excess of 4% and the first half of the year looks quite strong. Perhaps more impactful both rate and room booked in 2014 for 2015 exceeds the prior year levels by approximately 5%. In fact our most recent activity in the third quarter for 2015 is even stronger with rate growth in excess of 10% suggesting momentum holding into the new year. We expect to close 2014 with average occupancy in excess of 77%, which approaches our 2000 peak occupancy. As a result, we would expect that the bulk of our RevPAR growth going forward will be generated by increases in average rate and changes in business mix. Overall we expect that 2015 should be another solid year for the industry, both the topline and bottom line. More to come on this front next February. Thank you and now let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating performance in more detail. Greg Larson : Thank you, Ed. I am pleased with our impressive quarter, which was highlighted by the strongest quarterly RevPAR growth in the last three years and outperformance in comparable hotel adjusted margin growth and an exceptional increase of 305 basis points. Let me now provide our market results. Consistent with the last quarter, our Latin America hotel were the best performing hotels in the quarter with a 26% RevPAR increase. The World Cup final and the JW Mexico post-renovation lift continued to boost RevPAR for this region. Based on certain group business in Mexico, that will not repeat in the fourth quarter and the interruptions of business during elections in Brazil this month, we do not expect the outperformance to continue into the fourth quarter. The West region continues to outperform the portfolio with RevPAR growth of 8.9%, entirely driven by average rate and primarily a result of strong group business. Group revenues for the hotels in the West grew 11.4% enabling the hotels to drive rate improvement of 9.3%. Seattle, San Francisco, Denver and Los Angeles performed the best with double-digit RevPAR increases. On a combined basis, these hotels grew RevPAR 13% with a combined rate increase of over 13.5%. Solid group business create a compression that allowed our managers to shift our mix into premium segment by limiting special corporate and discounted rooms. This allowed them to drive rates in these markets. In the fourth quarter, we expect the hotels in San Francisco to continue to outperform our portfolio. We expect Seattle and Los Angeles to perform in line with our portfolio for the quarter and anticipate Denver will underperform the portfolio. Phoenix also had high RevPAR growth of 8.7%, resulting from their successful strategy to drive transient occupancy that summer. Transient occupancy increased 7.4% and rate increased 5.1% for this market. Based on a strong booking pace, we expect the strength to continue in the fourth quarter. Our Hawaii and San Diego markets underperformed the portfolio this quarter. The hotels in our Hawaiian markets were impacted by higher air fares during the summer, customer anticipation of two hurricanes in August and room renovations at the Fairmont Kea Lani. The San Diego hotels were affected by the meeting space renovation of the highest Manchester and the start of pre-construction efforts related to Marriott Hall at the San Diego Marriott. For the fourth quarter, our San Diego market will continue to be impacted by renovations at these two large hotels; however, the hotels in Hawaii are strategically replacing group room nights with rated transient business and we expect that this strategy should result in outperformance in the fourth quarter. The South Central region also posted great results with RevPAR of 7.9%. The hotels in this region had strong group performance as group revenues increased 11.9%. This led to food and beverage leverage revenue growth of more than 8% with an 11% increase in the more profitable banquet and catering business. The hotels in Atlanta and Chicago markets were the strong performers with RevPAR increases of 9.9% and 7.6% respectively. In Atlanta the four Buckhead hotels combined to grow both transient room nights and ADR by more than 7%. Group volume growth of 8% was particularly strong in Chicago resulting in group revenue growth of 10.4%. We expect these markets to continue to outperform the portfolio in the fourth quarter. The weakness at our hotels in Houston this quarter was primarily due to weaker than expected transient business at the JW Houston and St. Regis Hotels. As you know Houston has been one of our strongest outperformers and these hotels space difficult comparisons compared to 2013. Renovations at the JW Houston and Houston airport hotels will negatively impact the results for the Houston market in the fourth quarter. The East region reported a RevPAR increase of 6.6% with Boston up over 10% and Washington DC up 9%. Strong transient business led to transient revenues of 15.3% and 12.6% respectively and drove the outperformance in these markets. Boston Hotels grew transient rate by 14.2% and strong September city-wide events in Downtown DC boosted transient ADR and Downtown hotels by 10%. We do not expect the hotels in Boston or DC to continue to outperformance in the fourth quarter. Boston will have difficult comparisons from the World Series during the fourth quarter last year and renovations at the JW Marriot and Grant Hyatt hotels will negatively impact results for DC. The hotels in New York underperformed the portfolio with RevPAR gains of 4.1%. In the third quarter, the hotels of New York experienced an 8.5% gain in group revenues, which led to a 24.4% increase in banquet and catering business. However, the hotels in New York continue to be impacted by select service supply inhibiting rate growth in that market. The hotels in New York will continue to underperform the portfolio in the fourth quarter. The hotels in our European joint venture also had an excellent quarter with comparable hotel RevPAR and constant currency up 4.1% and total revenues up 5.6%. Food and beverage revenues increased 11.3%, with banquet and catering revenues up over 23%. These results led to impressive EBITDA margin growth. The RevPAR is driven by strong performance at the joint ventures hotels in Brussels and Spain. These two -- these hotels had double-digit total revenue increase and the two hotels in Spain had total revenue increase of over 20%. The strong banquet performance at the European joint venture hotels was driven by increased corporate catering demand at nine of our hotels. Food and beverage profits at the joint venture hotels increased approximately 46%. These meaningful improvements in part are driven by the deep dives performed by our asset management team. As you may recall from our Investor Day presentation, deep dives our productivity studies performed at our hotels to implement best practices found throughout our portfolio by examining daily routines and procedures to drive savings. For example the deep dive analysis of the food and beverage operations at our Sheraton Warsaw resulted in the restructuring of food and beverage labor model which drove profitability at this hotel. The food and beverage margins improved 850 basis points at this property. This hotel had negative RevPAR in the quarter posted a 90 basis point increase in its EBITDA margins. Another deep dive at our Sheraton Rome property led to over 1.4 million in annual savings also from restructuring, staffing mainly in the food and beverage operation. We intend to continue to conduct additional deep dives at both our international and domestic properties to further improve the margins at our hotels. Speaking of margins, our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins increased an impressive 305 basis points in the third quarter as over 80% of the RevPAR increase was driven by strong ADR growth resulting in excellent rooms flow through of over 81%. As described in our last quarter, RevPAR growth driven by strong ADR growth, combined with increases in our insurance and utility expenses have resulted in achievement of impressive operating profits margins. A full year margin guidance of 120 basis points to 135 basis points anticipates that the third quarter adjusted margin will be stronger than our fourth quarter margin. However, on a half year basis, margin growth in the second half of the year will significantly outperform margin growth in the first half of the year. As you may recall first half margins grew 80 basis points. We expect margins in the second half of the year to grow approximately 170 basis points. We're committed to sustaining a meaningful dividend given our strong extended operating outlook and significant amount of free cash flow. We increased the dividend to $0.20 in the third quarter and intend to maintain that over the course of the next several quarters. If we are unable to identify appropriate acquisition candidates with which to execute a tax free exchange for the Tampa Marriott Waterside Hotel, we will likely pay a modest special dividend for the fourth quarter. In summary, we are very excited about the strong RevPAR and EBITDA performance driven primarily by group business, which enabled significant rate increases in many of our markets. This dynamic boosted our margins and resulted in outperformance this quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks and we're now interested in answering any questions you may have. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll now take our first question from Andrew Didora from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Ed, maybe digging into your commentary a bit on the independent hotels, I guess why the shift right now in direction? Is this the right point in the cycle to do this? And my second question around that is, I know you see some conversions within your current portfolio. But do you see the ability to maybe acquire and roll up more of these assets over the next 12 months or so? Thanks. W. Edward Walter : As it relates to the shift to -- to look to purchase more of these, I think that sort of it ties in with our notion that we're trying to focus on a more limited number of markets, but then penetrate those markets more deeply. As we look to execute on that strategy in many of those markets we already owned some of the best convention oriented hotels, or larger group hotels, so it's sort of a natural consequence of expanding our presence in those markets to look for hotels that might be in different segments of the business whether that be the urban select service or lifestyle boutique type hotel. So I think that's really what's driving that. From a standpoint of future acquisitions and I think there is certainly given that as you can tell based on our recent history we're investing more in this area. We would certainly hope that we would be able to complete more acquisitions of this nature. It's not the easiest market to buy in right now. So we'll have to see what actually happens. Andrew Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Understood. That's helpful. And then, maybe my second question for Greg, after the strong group results thus far, this year, where does your group currently stand as a percentage of your revenue mix? And how does that compare to last cycle? Greg Larson : Andrew, if you look at our group business over a long period of time, it's usually right around 40%. At the peak of the last cycle, it was closer to 43% of our overall business and today it's closer to 37% of our business. Andrew Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : And we'll now take our next question from Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo. Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo : Good morning, guys. Actually, just building on that brand manager strategy, comment, I'd like to broader focus on independent brand and managed hotels. The first part is, where do you see that going as a percentage of your overall platform down the road? And do you think you get there predominantly through conversions of existing hotels or is it through acquisition? W. Edward Walter : While I am pleased that we've got a few candidates internally we should be able to convert I suspect that the growth will come more from acquisitions then it will from conversions within the portfolio. Yes, it's hard to put a number on that and I think we would certainly be comfortable in the long run with that becoming 10% plus of the portfolio in some ways, but a lot of that's going to be driven by the ability to execute acquisitions and what we're able to get done in the near term in the market. Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo : And just a follow-up on maybe capital allocation is Host hasn't been necessarily a big acquirer, if you will, this cycle. Is it too late to undertake acquisitions of maybe sort of a large-scale institutional hotel, in your view? And how do you weigh acquisitions at this juncture versus using your balance sheet capacity to instead return capital to shareholders versus -- via dividends or share repurchases? W. Edward Walter : That's a great question. We feel good enough about the length of the cycle that I think we would be -- we certainly are evaluating and pursuing transactions whether they're of a boutique type nature, the independent type nature or our more traditional branded type of a hotel. I think one of the challenges that we face though in going after those in each instance is the fact that we tend to look at things as we evaluate an acquisition over a 10-year timeframe and that has to -- when you're looking over that long of a period, you have to assume some period of time where operating results are a bit softer. And so I think because we're taking that into account and that how we do that will vary by market, but how we take that into account, that I think put us maybe a bit of a competitive pricing disadvantage to folks you might be looking at more buying now and selling in their minds before the cycle turns. And so that group which tends to use higher leverage and has a shorter holding period, I think is ending up being able to push pricing more aggressively than we would. So I think my shorter answer to your question is we would feel comfortable in buying. It would be based upon our conservative and disciplined underwriting criteria. To the extent that we are not able to complete acquisitions like that, I think we've been pretty consistently saying for a while that we've been looking to invest outside the portfolio or inside the portfolio first on theory that drives better returns, but as we complete sales, those will naturally result in higher dividends because of the taxable income associated with those sales. And to the extent there is not opportunities to otherwise invest in either in new -- existing or new hotels, we will be returning capital to shareholder either through a more dividend or by repurchasing stock. Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo : That's great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll now take our next question from Michael Bilerman from Citigbank. Kevin Barron - Citigroup: Hi. This is Kevin Barron with Michael. I just wanted to better quantify the renovation disruption in 4Q. Could you just give us a sense of what the RevPAR would be, backing out those hotels under renovation in the comparable portfolio? W. Edward Walter : I don't know that we have a precise number for how it would hit that. I can tell you that just in terms of the disruption it creates in our group business for the fourth quarter though, our group business would probably be roughly 4% stronger if we didn't have the renovation disruption. Kevin Barron - Citigroup: Okay. And then if you think about the group business momentum leading to more favorable mix shift, and then also in your opening comments you talked about the potential for better demand in 2015, we just wanted to get your thoughts on the potential for RevPAR accelerating next year from 2014 levels. Greg Larson : I don't know I see it as a ability, the conditions that would require RevPAR to accelerate next year from the strong levels that we've experienced in the last couple of years I think tie to what are the two primary drivers of our business right now. The two things that I think, the one would be the overall economic growth in the U.S. and secondly would be world-wide economic growth that helps generate international travel. So as I highlighted in my comments, we've been very happy, very pleased with the overall level of international arrivals into the U.S. over the last several years and we believe that's been a primary driver and why demand over the course of the last several years has outpaced historical levels kind of on a relative basis to GDP. So as we think about next year, we certainly are encouraged by the fact that once again most of the major forecasters are expecting stronger economic growth in '15 than what we've seen in '14. I would caution that we probably said that for the last three years in a row, so hopefully '15 is the year that that materializes and then if we also see continued growth on the international front comparable with better than what we've seen, that creates a condition for overall stronger demand growth. Supply does go up a bit next year not a lot. So we don't view supply as the near-term problem rather than a few markets, but overall I am not certain we would be sitting here expecting RevPAR acceleration for next year, but we certainly feel that we should see another strong year in the industry. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: And it's Michael Bilerman, I just wanted to follow-up on your comment about 4% in terms of the renovation, are you effectively saying, if group is call it 37% of the business which Greg did sort of said, that didn't have seasonal that wasn\u2019t in the fourth quarter that effectively there is a 1.5% drag on RevPAR just 4% behind what it normally would be? Is that effectively the math you want us to make? I just didn't know how to quantify what the 4% meant. Greg Larson : Yes I think that's -- what I was trying to highlight is that our group bookings would be about 4% higher if we didn't end the fourth quarter if we didn't have the renovation. So that it may not be too far off Michael. It's just that you got a trade off there that we will sell in some of that shortfall with Transient and so it's probably not quite as direct to what you have there, but that's probably directionally correct. W. Edward Walter : I think that's right. As you know Michael, if we could, if group business was stronger that would also help us on the Transient side as well because really not except some of the weaker Transient and really push the Transient also. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: Yes, and that would also all F&B and all the other\u2026 W. Edward Walter : That is correct. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: All right. So I just didn't know if you actually had an EBITDA number that we could sort of isolate for the fourth quarter where if he market disappointed with the fourth quarter guidance trying to put together the pieces that sort of get you from where the street was or where they were relative to where you think you're going to be? I think that's what we are trying to isolate? Greg Larson : We don't have that number right now. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: Okay. All right. Thank you. Greg Larson : Thanks. Operator : And we'll now take our next question from Rich Hightower from ISI Group. Rich Hightower - ISI Group : Good morning, guys. A question on the disposition side -- I am wondering if you can tell us within the portfolio, what portion of the hotels are either unencumbered by brand entirely, or are so far along in the contract such as the breakage costs might be minimal to a potential buyer that might be interested in converting those to something else. W. Edward Walter : Roughly about 40% of our domestic portfolio, we have either absolute contract flexibility or put it along the lines which you were describing very near term contract flexibility. And I would tell you that we in most instances the reason we have that is because we've negotiated for it over the years, but nor surprisingly the bulk of that flexibility fits within the assets that are in non-core markets entirely or non-core sub markets within our target markets. So I think roughly 75% of the assets that we have flexibility on are assets that we could -- we would be open to selling over the next few years. And we're well situated in part because over the years we've targeted to accomplish that to have contract flexibility for assets we would like to sell. Rich Hightower - ISI Group : Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks for the specifics there. And my second question concerns New York and D.C. Your revenue and EBITDA concentration in those two markets combined, I think it is still above 20%, maybe not as high as it was about a year ago. But just over time, with the puts in takes in the portfolio that you\u2019ve talked about, where do you see the ideal concentration in those two markets in the future? W. Edward Walter : I think over time we would be expecting to reduce our presence in New York. I don't think that as we look at these either some of our suburban assets in DC that we would be intending on selling, but we're not uncomfortable with the overall waiting in DC with using a long-term perspective, but I do think there is some reduction happening there. Over time I would like to see some reduction in New York too. Rich Hightower - ISI Group : Okay. That's all for me. Operator : And we'll now take our next question from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley : Hey, good morning. You talked a few times high level about the setup for the U.S. lodging industry heading into 2015. Given you also have international exposure, can you just give us some initial thoughts there, too? Thank you. W. Edward Walter : Yes, I would say if you look at where we have our biggest international presence, it's Europe and I think generally Europe has been difficult to predict frankly because there are fits and starts to their economic recovery has been challenging. I would point out though that one of the things that makes Europe a bit different than the U.S. is the importance of international travel throughout our European portfolio. Where in the U.S. we probably would think that plus or minus 20% of our demand comes from international travel. In Europe our portfolio probably gets 40% to 45% of its demand from international. So that helps pushing Europe from some of the weakness that we've seen in the economy. Overall I think so far this year we're running around 3.5% or so in Europe on RevPAR growth. I would like to think that next year we will reach that level, but I think we're going to need to see a little bit more -- we will be interested to see what develops as we go through the budget process, try to have some better insight in the back. Outside of that, I think in Latin America we probably will not see the same strength that we've seen this year for two reasons. One the World Cup will not be repeating in Rio De Janeiro -- in Brazil, which is going to probably drive those markets to be slightly down for next year and we've had extraordinary performance in Mexico City, but some of that's been construction delay meaning that we had construction the prior year. So I would expect that Mexico we will see growth that's roughly comparable with folks are expecting in the U.S. And then in our assets in Australia and New Zealand we don't -- I would say there we're probably looking at may be single digit RevPAR growth. Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley : Helpful. Thank you. And then, just one more question, playing devil's advocate here a little bit. Your RevPAR was up 8%, which is obviously very good and an acceleration from the trends we are seeing, but your peers saw it closer to 9%. Anything driving the slight underperformance for you guys versus them? Thank you. W. Edward Walter : Again if you look at how our entire portfolio performed in the year and you include all of the assets in our portfolio and don't exclude some that we would typically exclude because of the way we approach issues around comparability, our portfolio ran at 9% in the third quarter also. So I don't know that there was a big of a difference it may seem when you look at the numbers in a little bit more detail. I would say though maybe a little bit more broadly is that we're up against -- we're at this point now enjoying practically forever peak occupancy level and so one of the things that we're very focused on with our operators is looking drive rate. And so a big part of our success next year is going to come down to our ability to drive rate in all forms of our business. We're quite encouraged by the improvements we were seeing in our bookings in our group business in 2014 and especially more lately I highlighted some statistics that overall rate in our bookings in 2014, 2015 was up 5% late in the third quarter, bookings in 2015 was up 10%. As those trends -- if those trends continue and we certainly hope and expect that they will, that will certainly help us in pushing rate next year and that obviously is very beneficial on what it will do for the bottom line. Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley : So can one imply by those comments that you gave up a bit of occupancy index to drive rate index, which obviously benefited your EBITDA and drove the strong beat in the quarter? W. Edward Walter : I suspect -- yes, I think if you -- compared to the broader market, not compared to our individual comp set, but compared to the broader market, I think the broader market had slightly more occupancy improvement because it starts at a far lower base than us, but we had better rate growth. And at the end of the day, if I had a choice between the two, I would rather see higher rates. Greg Larson : Yes, as you said Thomas, that's certainly powerful on the margin front and that's one of the reasons why our margins were up 305 basis points, which frankly probably I think that's our best margin growth in over a decade. Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley : Yes congratulations. Okay. Thanks, bye. Operator : And we'll now take our next question from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Joe Greff - JPMorgan: Good morning, all. I have two questions, one on acquisitions and then one renovations. Ed, with the stuff you are looking to buy, single assets or portfolios, whether they are small or large, with what you are looking at right now would you characterize that as more fine-tuning your market and brand mix? Or is there anything in there that you would characterize as EBITDA needle movement? W. Edward Walter : It's probably more the former than the latter. Obviously the real issue there comes down to scale and size of the acquisition and we certainly have the capability to do something larger, but I stand on what we've said for a number of years, which is we don't need to be bigger just to be bigger, it's really just about improving overall levels of growth and improving earnings per share. So I think in the near term, it's always hard to predict the big deal is going to happen. We're certainly interested in looking, but I suspect that the more likely activity would be more along the lines of fine-tuning. Joe Greff - JPMorgan: Got it. And then, with renovations, I know you are not providing anything on next year. But just given what you know about next year and the project CapEx and work that you are thinking about for next year, when you think about next year, do you think the renovation disruption in '15 is the same or less than what you have experienced in full year '14? W. Edward Walter : I think we're going to have to wait until February to answer that. We obviously are having some disruption now. There are a couple of projects like what we will end up doing with the Philadelphia Four Seasons in converting that to a new -- a different brand or a soft brand and so things we're looking after some other projects that the actual way we proceed and whether or not there is an absolute closure of that hotel or not, will dictate to either whether the renovation effect next year is larger than this year or not. So it's certainly something we're focused on and obviously the benefits of any projects like that to the extent that they do hit '15 we should start to see some good benefit of that in '16. Joe Greff - JPMorgan: Thank you. Operator : And we'll now take our next question from Steven Kent, Goldman Sachs. Mr. Kent, your line is open. Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs : Can you hear me? W. Edward Walter : Now we can. Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs : Okay. Sorry about that. Can you talk a little bit about your renovation schedule? I still don't completely understand how different it is versus the years before. And, also, and how it's going to affect you? And then, the second is, you mentioned urban select service a couple of times. How do you see the portfolio mix between that full and select service over the next few years for Host? W. Edward Walter : See I think there are a couple of points we were trying to make about the renovation activity. In general, the way this year is playing out, is that about 35% of our CapEx is happening in the fourth quarter. So obviously on a weighted basis, that's a little bit higher, but more importantly as we step back and looked at which projects were being affected, we had a number of larger hotels and I had detailed them in my comments that we are undergoing either room renovations or somewhat disruptive meeting room renovations and those were happening in the fourth quarter. When we look more broadly at the activity that was happening in the fourth quarter and we had noticed this and we were aware that last quarter as I highlighted in my comments that we expected some renovation disruption in Q4, which is one of the reasons we were saying Q3 would be stronger than Q4 as we were finishing out moving at the end of the year there. We were saying that roughly half of the renovation CapEx that would be disruptive to our numbers EBITDA generation that's happening in the fourth quarter, I can't exactly compare that to prior years on the slide. But it's certainly higher then where we were last year because last year we just had lighter construction activity weeks of a disruptive nature in the fourth quarter. So I think that's really why we were highlighting that here and it's highlighted in the prior quarter. In terms of the growth of select service within our portfolio, it's still a very small percentage. I think the rate of growth will probably be meaningful in the sense that small numbers can easily be grown, but the reality is that in the near term, I don't think that it's going to rise to a significant part of our portfolio in part because these tend to be smaller properties too. So when you are a $20 billion company, obviously you got to buy a fair amount of something just to move it up to a 1% or 2% of the size of the company. So absent a portfolio transaction, which I would generally say it's unlikely in this arena, it will grow 1% or 2% at a time. Greg Larson : Yes, I agree with you Ed on the percentage because even if we are successful on acquiring several of these select service properties, at the same time, we could also invest in one or more upper upscale properties. So the percentages may not actually move much. Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs : W. Edward Walter : W. Edward Walter : Thanks. Operator : And we'll now take our next question from Anthony Powell form Barclays. Anthony Powell - Barclays: Hi. Good morning. On the stats you gave 2015, were they pace stats for overall or for group? And if they are for overall revenue, could you provide some color on how the group pace is trending for next year? W. Edward Walter : Those stats that we gave on the call were relative to group Anthony Powell - Barclays: Got it. Great. Thank you. And just on the Orlando asset, it seems like that's ramping up pretty well. Could you give us an update on where you are in that ramp up, after the renovation, and how much incremental growth that could drive maybe next year? W. Edward Walter : At this point we have finished all of the construction work at the Orlando asset. I think that some of the side work that we had -- that was so disruptive to operations was completed in the first quarter this year, but the remaining -- my sense in general is that the remaining three quarters of the year for that asset is generally not affected by construction. So I would say that we've had very big lift this year from that asset in out of its construction site and had its work done. I suspect we will get some minor lift in the first quarter of last year and after that it should be more normalized. Greg Larson : Yes, I think that hotel, it will have a good year next year and because of that, when we think about our hotels in Florida next year, those hotels should outperform our portfolio. Anthony Powell - Barclays: And, one final one on the Marriott Marquis in New York. How is the retail and the signage construction going? And how much incremental EBITDA could that generate next year? Thank you. Greg Larson : Again it's early to speculate on the actual impact of EBITDA next year because we're not exactly the marketing process has gone extremely well, but having said that Vornado has not announced any signed leases yet. But from a construction perspective we've talked previously about a $10 million to $12 million benefit rolling from the completion of that improvement. We'll see some of that next year, but it's more likely the full benefit of that is more likely to hit '16. From a construction perspective, my understanding is the sign is virtually complete and I think that there is probably going to be more noise and more press around that in the middle of next month, but we couldn\u2019t be happier with how that whole process has gone. We couldn\u2019t have been happier with having Vornado as a partner here and we're very excited to get the sign operational, get the retail space leased and open and a lot of the hotels have started taking advantages of those new outside observatory jacks that will sit on top of the sign. Anthony Powell - Barclays: All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll now take our next question from Ryan Meliker from MLV & Company. Ryan Meliker - MLV & Company: Hi. Good morning, guys. I just had a quick question. Most of mine have been answered. But I was hoping you could give us some color on the acquisition market and types of things you are looking for. Obviously, you guys have done a good job being particularly disciplined this year and last year as well, with regards to acquisitions, given where cap rates are and values have really grown. But, what you have bought and what it seemed to indicate in your press release, is that you might be a little more focused today on some smaller independent assets in gateway markets. I am just trying to figure out how you balance acquisitions of those types of assets with a like-kind exchange for a $200 million Tampa asset. Are you guys are going to be stretching valuations to try to find a like-kind exchange so that things work out from a taxation standpoint, or are you less likely to do that? Just help me think about the implications of that like-kind dynamic. Thanks. W. Edward Walter : Sure. I think as I suggested earlier, the market is competitive. I say that we have an active pipeline of deals that we're reviewing, but compared to that I might have looked at the well four years ago. My assessment of the probability that we actually complete those transactions would suggest that we will -- our hit rate is going to be a lot lower now than it was earlier in the cycle. I don't think there is anything about that that's unexpected that's what you would naturally expect as you work your way into the cycle that a lot of capital plays to the party and then tends to pay bigger prices, that's one of the reasons why we're active seller right now and we tend to be an active seller. As you think about the right king of exchange element of this, I think that your question is a great question and the short answer is that we're not going to stretch on purchases, jut to complete the right kind of exchange. Now I think we're not uncomfortable in paying a higher dividend. We're not uncomfortable in generating proceeds from deals and using that to either pay more of a dividend or buyback stock if that's the right answer. And so the reality is that I mentioned before, we're comfortable with the scale of the company. We're trying to refine the markets that we operate in. If the deal fits our parameters or presents a unique opportunity, then we're going to -- we would be happy to be an investor, but on the other hand to the extent that we don't, we're fine looking for ways to return capital or looking for other ways to return capital. Ryan Meliker - MLV & Company: Got you. It is good to hear that the like-kind dynamic isn't a driver of acquisitions. That's all for me. Nice quarter. Thanks a lot. W. Edward Walter : Thank you. Operator : And we'll now take our next question with Chris Woronka from Deutsche Bank. Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank : Hey. Good morning, guys. Just want to ask you, as you look up and down your portfolio, and certainly you have a number of kind of the large battleship and group hotels, but as you look at some of the smaller ones in nonunion markets, are you guys kind of evaluating any opportunities to almost convert those to limited service? That seems to be kind of where we are trending as an industry and just wanted your sense as to what is possible within your portfolio. W. Edward Walter : Yes, it's an interesting question Chris. You know what I would say is that I don't know that we would think about converting them to limited service in the sense of down branding them because I doubt that the risk on the rate would be worth that, but what we are trying to do and certainly this is something we've been trying to do for a while is try to pick up some of the best elements of limited service operation and apply them to our hotel. So in another words where we have hotels that in-house managed or operator managed food and beverage we're looking at opportunities to outsource that food and beverage platform or consolidate that food and beverage platform. So it doesn\u2019t make it a select service or limited service hotel, but what it does is to the extent that we can outsource that or reduce the importance of that to the hotel, we're at least looking at a way or trying to identify ways to improve our margins and reduce our risk on the food and beverage side, so that more and more of our hotel is based on the rooms operations, which is we all know tends to generate higher levels of profitability. So there are a few specific instances in our portfolio over the years where we have made the decision that best thing to do was to covert a Marriott to a courtyard and I think that's happened a couple of times. But generally I don't think that's going to be the preferred route, but looking for ways to modify the operating model to make the hotel more efficient to king of capturing the best of the limited service operating platform, while maintaining the full service rate. That's the strategy we would like to push wherever it makes sense. Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank : Sure. Great. Understood. And then, just as we think about the New York market, from where we sit, we probably think that the supply maybe is having more of an impact on the Marquis, given the number of rooms. Is that a fair assessment? And is it a very significant impact if we looked at New York RevPAR ex-Marquis? W. Edward Walter : No I wouldn\u2019t say that the Marquis is really struggling at all because of flex servicing let's say. The level of supply in New York has been high and I would say the entire New York market has felt some impact from the supply and I think most folks would describe that less about a occupancy problem and more about a challenge in being able to raise rate. But to be honest, the hotels like the Marquis that can accommodate larger groups and plus have that kind of a ground zero location within Times Square, we're still running comfortably north of 90% at the Marquis, which is where we've been running for the last several years. So I don't think I actually think that our in a lot of ways that you look at our performance was in New York. We've been doing slightly better than the market for the last two years and I think we're less affected by a lot of our select service supply that has come into New York then some other hotels might be and partly because we have the customer base for our key hotels is far more diversified than what a flex service hotel typically attracts. Greg Larson : And you can that even in the third quarter Chris, where our RevPAR in New York was up 4.1%, which obviously outperformed the star data for New York. Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Very good. Thanks guys. Operator : And we'll now take our next question with Jim Sullivan with Cowen and Group. Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company : Okay. And forgive me if this question relates to something you may be addressed in your prepared comments, Ed, but on the four seasons in Philadelphia, I am not sure if you\u2019ve finalized your budget or your plans there, so whatever you can give us in terms of an update on timing and cost for that conversion. W. Edward Walter : Jim we don't have that completely finalize right now. I would broadly say that the direction we're leaning there is going to be an independent hotel, but likely soft branded. It will be affiliated with one of the major brands and the exact timing for when we will start construction is not yet set, but I suspect that some of that work will start sometime in the middle of next year. Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company : And do you have some preliminary budget or some range that you could share with us? W. Edward Walter : Not at this point in time. We're still working through that with the operator that we're working with. Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company : Okay. The second question, just a minor question on the management fee. That line item group grew more than hotel revenues. Is that attributable to IMS in the period and can you give us an outlook for IMS as we go forward in what's a fairly robust topline environment? Greg Larson : Hey Jim, this is Greg. I think if you look at our management fees this year, I think in general obviously base fees have been increasing. I think that this year in particular incentive management fee year-to-date the increase has been fairly minimal and there are several reason for that. And Ed mentioned earlier in this call, we've had several negotiations with certain managers where we've been successful in sort of minimizing incentive management fees for this year. So I think when you look at it, our incentive management fees in the first half of the year were actually down on a year-over-year basis and in the second half of the year, our incentive management fees will be up around 4%. Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company : And when you look out to next year, I know obviously you're not giving guidance for next year in this call, but the environment is very positive. Supply in most markets, while it is increasing, remains below demand growth. Should we be assuming that IMS will increase for the full year next year, too early to say? Greg Larson : I think next year as you said, I think a lot of people including us were expecting very good results for next year on the topline and with EBITDA growth and I think with great EBITDA growth, we'll have sort of what I would consider normal incentive management fee growth next year. Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company : Okay. And a follow-up question on the earlier question about Europe. I wonder if you could talk to us about acquisition pricing in Europe, how it's moved this year versus acquisition pricing in the U.S.  And, as you think about the comparative growth rates over the next one to two years, how strong your appetite is? I know you just announced an acquisition in Europe, but how strong your appetite is to do more acquisitions over the next -- over the coming quarters? W. Edward Walter : Pricing in Europe is probably one way to think about it might be the cap rates there are 100 to 150 basis points higher in at least in the markets that we've been focused which would be Germany relative to what we're seeing in the U.S. pricing in London and in Paris is probably comparable to pricing in the best markets in the U.S. and so very aggressive. Now I think you're looking at sort of in the 4% to 5% range as it relates to cap rates for either in those markets. Given that our outlook for Europe would be for slower growth than what we would be expecting in the U.S. there is -- one of the reason why we are buying in Germany is we generally think that Germany will have better growth that the rest of Europe and we think the pricing levels make more sense relative to opportunities we might see elsewhere. I think that both Paris and London while they are spectacular long-term markets, but right now their capital is aggressively seeking assets in those markets is one of the reason why we sold the Sheraton Skyline and the pricing levels there are such that we would not view that as a good allocation of capital in the near term absent an unusual situation to be able to meaningfully create value at the hotel. I think our we're in the process of marketing some other hotels in Europe, but we're actually trying to take advantage of some of the optimism that the broader world has in terms of investing in European hotels to see if we can reduce the size of our portfolio. We're still interested in acquiring more, but it will be fairly selective in terms of the markets that we will enter. Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company : Okay. Just to kind of follow up in terms of what you just said, obviously, the long-term debt markets are very favorable in Europe. How do you balance the appeal of that with the desire to sell assets? We tend to think that assets that are not encumbered by debt are easier to sell. How do you balance those two contradictory factors? W. Edward Walter : That's a good question. Now as we stand currently, in Europe we tend to approach our financings on an asset by asset basis, but to some degree we're not forced to confront that issue in part because we've dealt with all the financings that we need to address over the course of the last couple of years. We've also built in the flexibility and most of those financings to be able to sell some of the assets earlier. Financing that offer tends to be shorter term than what we will typically see in the U.S. and what we would typically employ in the U.S. So I think that we're looking at the not unlike the way we're thinking about some of the assets we would like to in the U.S. but back in the financial markets have gotten a bit more aggressive and certainly I would say that the delta in Europe is even larger than what we've seen here not that they\u2019ve gotten that much cheaper than where we are in the U.S., but the delta compared to last year they\u2019ve got a lot cheaper. We're sort of a mind this is a good time to try to take advantage of that which is why we're marketing some of our properties there. We're not looking to sell our best assets, but I would say we're looking to sell some of the middle of the pack. Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company : Okay. And then finally for me and I think this is a Greg question, Greg, I wonder if you could walk us through the reasons for the difference between the $69 million positive impact of the litigation reserve reversal and the $59 million add back to get to the adjusted EBITDA? Greg Larson : Yes, so Jim as you know we're fortunate enough to win the San Antonio case. So we're in a great -- because of that we're not going to have to put out $70 million, which is a good thing. We had $25 million in the restricted cash account that was now back in our hands. So we're pretty happy to say the least. The other thing that happens as you pointed out is that there is a GAAP impact of $69 million, so you'll see that when you look at our GAAP earnings, but from an EBITDA perspective the impact is really, really just the interest that we've been accruing on this year. So we've reversed out the interest from this year and then we have some interest accruals from last year that also will flow through EBITDA and so as you correctly point out in total for San Antonio the $10 million EBITDA benefit, but the flip side to that is we have an increase in other litigation expense and so net, net when you take into account that benefit and the increase in the accrual on other litigation expense it's approximately a $4 million EBITDA benefit. And as you know, that's not -- that's not hotel EBITDA right and so obviously $4 million helps our entire EBITDA for the company, but had no impact on our margin growth -- hotel margin growth of 305 basis points. Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company : Okay. Very good. Thank you. Operator : And we'll now take our next question from Wes Golladay, RBC. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets : Hey everyone. Can you give us an update on the supply and demand picture for group on the prime nights for group? Are you seeing the ability to push some of the group business to the softer nights? W. Edward Walter : Yes, that one of the interesting challenges that we have as we get into this part of the cycle is that given how robust transient demand has been in a number of markets and given the fact that so many of our hotels are running very high occupancies in the middle of the week and on Saturday. And part of what's happening on the group side now is trying to -- try to push that business to what we would describe as a shoulder night. So it's hard -- we actually had an extensive discussion about that when we were going through our quarterly review with our asset management team and I wish I had a statistic to be able to describe how successful we're being with that, but the reality is that clearly for business being booked now for '15 and '16. Greg Larson : Yes, it's a great situation to put the group in a weaker time because you know what, when you do that, sometimes it could skew the rate growth that we are talking about for next year because if you're booking during the weaker time, that's a great outcome and allows us to book transient business in a stronger times, but if you looking at year-over-year rate growth in group, that obviously will impact and lower than number. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And can we go back to the Marquis asset? When will you guys be able to discuss the numbers more and the opportunity to dispose of the asset for the signage in retail? Is there a time we can get more color on that? Greg Larson : You mean as it relates to our options around exercising some ability to be able to sell the retail itself. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets : Yes. W. Edward Walter : To be honest, there is no reason for us to do anything there until we're comfortable that we have Vorando because they're in control of this and so Vorando has maximized the benefit of the retail space in this signage. So the retail space I would assume will get leased over the first part of next year, the signage part of this, the retail will not be taking all of the signage. So I think there is going to be some period of time where they continue to market the signage and users get comfortable with the fact that we've now created -- or they\u2019ve created that they get TV screen in one of the best market in the world from a publicity perspective. So I don't think that this is anything that we're going to be moving forward aggressively on in the near term in part because I think there is a big opportunity here and we would love to see that maximize it before we try to exercise any right. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. As we get to the opening of that, though, can you talk more about the value creation as maybe where you see it value at once it is opened? Or, it seems to be an ignored asset for you guys right now. W. Edward Walter : Well, it's not an ignored asset from a perspective of what it does for EBITDA, but I think it's a good question we could try to provide more color on that in the future. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. Thanks a lot everyone. W. Edward Walter : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time and I would now like to hand the call back to Mr. Ed Walter for any closing remarks. Please go ahead sir. W. Edward Walter : Great. Well thank you for joining us on the call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our third quarter results and outlook with you and we look forward to talking with you in February to discuss our yearend results and provide much more detailed insight into 2015. Have a great day everybody. Operator : This does conclude our conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Gee Lingberg : Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publically update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today\u2019s call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in today\u2019s earnings press release, in our 8K filed with the SEC and on our website at www.HostHotels.com. In our efforts to continually improve on our disclosures, we have added an EBITDA by market supplement to our website. You can find this information on our investor relations section of our website under financial information. We hope that this information is valuable in understanding and analyzing our company. Now with me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter results and then will describe the current operating environment as well as the company\u2019s outlook for 2015. Greg will then provide greater detail on our fourth quarter performance by market and discuss our margin results. Following the remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. Now, here\u2019s Ed. W. Edward Walter : As we predicted in October, our fourth quarter results were impacted by a combination of weaker group activity and disruption from renovations. Overall, we were pleased to record another very positive year for our company. Revenue growth was strong and superior cost controls led to another year of excellent margin improvement. In addition, we made significant progress on several value enhancement projects and on our asset sales initiative.  Before we get into the details, let\u2019s review our results for the quarter and the year. Adjusted EBITDA was $351 million for the quarter and $1.402 billion for the full year, representing a 7.4% increase over the prior year. Our adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.40 for the fourth quarter and $1.50 for the full year exceeding consensus estimates and reflecting a 14.5% increase over 2013. These results were impacted by several factors.  For the full year, our portfolio achieved a 77% average occupancy allowing our hotels to drive rate increases of nearly 5% resulting in an improvement in comparable hotel RevPAR of 5.7%. For the quarter comparable hotel RevPAR increased 3.2% due entirely to rate growth as occupancy declined by .6 points.  As outlined in our press release, we had a large number of room and meeting space renovations that began in the fourth quarter. These projects reduced our capacity to attract our customary level of corporate group business as well as some of our higher priced transient customers. Overall, we estimate that our renovation activity reduced our quarterly RevPAR by 160 basis points. More specifically, demand in our group segment declined more than 1% in the fourth quarter but was largely offset by a 1% increase in average rate.  As we explained in October, the timing of the Jewish holidays clearly accelerated association business into the third quarter which resulted in the decline in demand from this segment in the fourth quarter. Despite this headwind we were quite pleased with our bookings in the quarter for the quarter which improved by more than 12% with rates up 15%. For the full year group rate was up nearly 3% while demand was up over 2.5% resulting in an increase in group revenues of more than 5.5%.  Looking at our transient business, in the quarter we experienced some weakness from the shift in holiday timing and renovations, but much less of an impact from what we experienced in the group side. Demand decreased by less than 1% but importantly rate increased in all segments leading to an average rate increase of nearly 4% and revenue growth of over 3%. For the full year, our strong group demand allowed us to increase our transient rate by nearly 5%. Combining the rate increase with the slight increase in demand, led to a more than a 5% increase in transient revenues. Food and beverage revenues increased by .4% for the quarter and 3.8% for the full year. Banquet and AV revenues were up slightly in the fourth quarter but increased more than 5% for the full year, driving better margins in our food and beverage systems for both the quarter and the full year. The initial benefits of our latest round of cost cutting initiatives combined with lower incentive fees due to prior negotiations, resulted in comparable hotel EBITDA margin improvement of 15 basis points for the quarter and 120 basis points for the full year. Now, let\u2019s move to our transaction activity. On the disposition front, during the first quarter, we sold the Tampa Marriott Waterside, the Greensboro Highpoint Marriott and the Dayton Marriott for a combined total of $239 million. The latter two transactions were completed by taking advantage of franchise conversion rights we had previously negotiated with Marriott International and the buyers have committed to significant capital improvement as part of the management transition. For the year, we completed more than $515 million in dispositions. These transactions further reduced our exposure to non-target markets and to lower RevPAR hotels. We have one additional smaller asset under contract with an anticipated Q1 closing which has been included in our guidance for 2015.  On the development front in the fourth quarter we opened 149 room Novotel and the 256 room ibis Rio de Janeiro Parque Olimpico in Barra de Tijuca, both managed by Accor. The total investment in this project is $65 million. We expect to be active on both the acquisition and disposition front as we look to increase our investments in target markets and remain focused on reducing our exposure to non-core markets and hotels located in suburban locations or secondary markets. While we have active pipelines for both sales and acquisitions given the difficulty in predicting the timing of completing these transactions, our guidance does not assume the benefit of any additional dispositions or acquisitions.  As we highlighted at our investor day last spring, we continue to look for ways to extract value from our assets in various and creative ways including the development of underutilized space in hotels, [indiscernible] excess land, rebranding or repositioning, or by restructuring management agreements and ground leases. With an acquisition market that is growing increasingly competitive, these types of value add projects will allow us to continue to provide strong returns for the company. In 2014 we completed two notable value enhancement projects in the fourth quarter. First, in December we completed the development of the 131 Hyatt Ka\u2019anapali Beach, a Hyatt resident club resort adjacent to our Hyatt Regency Maui Resort in [Baja]. We recognized EBITDA of $7 million for the full year from this project. The second project was at our New York Marriott Marquis Times Square Hotel as part of the redevelopment and lease of the retail space to Vornado Realty Trust, the new 25,000 square foot eight story high definition digital boulevard was activated in November. The redevelopment of the entire retail space is expected to be completed late this year. For 2015, we plan to increase the pace and volume of these value enhancement projects to put us in a position to better drive long term outperformance in 2016 and 2017. These projects include properties where we will be completing a rebranding or transformational renovation that will reestablish the property in its marketplace and provide meaningful increases to the hotel\u2019s profitability going forward.  The first example of this is The Axiom Hotel in San Francisco which will be managed by Kokua, an operator we have previously retained for our Hyatt Place in Waikiki. As you know, we acquired the former Powell Street Hotel early in 2014. We closed the property on January 2nd to complete a transformational $30 million plus repositioning that will touch every corner of the hotel. We anticipate that the asset will reopen later this fall.  We are also very excited about our plans for the Four Seasons Philadelphia which will reposition the hotel as a contemporary independent luxury hotel in a vibrant part of the city. We have retained Sage Hospitality as the manager and intend to use their F&B expertise to completely transform their current offerings to better attract our guest and local customers alike. In addition to creating a luxurious rooftop lounge we are adding a high end coffee bar, and under taking a complete gut renovation of the spa and fitness center. We estimate the total project will cost $28 million to $30 million and we plan to shut the whole property down in June for the renovation and reopen at the end of 2015. In addition to these two projects, we are currently working on similar plans for a third hotel and hope to announce this exciting project later this spring.  Another major project is the development of the $106 million new Marriott Hall Ballroom and Exhibit Space at our Marriott Marquis San Diego Marina Hotel. Demolition of the existing Marriott Hall commenced in the fourth quarter and the new expanded meeting platform is expected to be completed in June of 2016. This state of the art meeting space will benefit not only the Marquis property but also our neighboring Manchester Grand Hyatt, as those properties will be able to drive group business through the utilization of this fantastic new meeting space. Finally, at the Denver Marriott Tech Center, we have converted the asset to a Marriott franchise with Sage Hotels to implement a transformational renovation which will include creating an executive level tower that will house our new concierge lounge and fitness center and the other tower we are combining rooms and reducing the room count to allow us to attract both family weekend business as well as extended stay customers. In addition, we will be upgrading the meeting space, F&B offerings, and creating a new lobby. The renovation is expected to begin in November and will cost $60 million plus. We continue to be optimistic about fundamentals in our industry as we expect overall supply to fall short of long term averages for at least the next two years. Expected continued growth in the economy, strong capital investments, and growth in domestic travel should lead to revenue growth that comfortably exceeds inflation at a long term industry averages. The results should be improved asset and company valuations in our industry. Our outlook recognizes the following factors. Given that we finished the year with occupancy at 77%, our highest since 2000, we expect that the great majority of our RevPAR growth in 2015 will come from rate increases. Our maintenance capital expenditures, which are projected to increase approximately 5% to $330 million to $350 million, will have a more disproportionate business interruption impact than normal, because the renovations often include extensive bath and shower conversions which are more time consuming, and we are enhancing several lobbies.  A significant portion of the business impact will be felt in our group business as meeting space and lobby renovations discourage group bookings. Despite this concern, overall group bookings for the year are up modestly with the first half of the year looking quite solid. Recognizing the inherent strength in transient demand, our focus over the last six months has been on pushing rate in our group business and our advanced bookings over that period reflect the nearly 7% increase in rate.  While we view the overall supply picture as favorable, two of our key markets DC and New York, are experiencing elevated levels of supply and in the case of New York, face significant year-over-year headwinds. As a result, these markets, which represent 27% of our revenues, our expected to underperform in 2015. With all of these factors in mind, we are expecting comparable hotel RevPAR for our portfolio to increase 4.5% to 5.5% in constant currency with our domestic portfolio to increase $475 to $575.  Four our international portfolio, primarily because of the extremely difficult comps JW Marriott Rio faces in the year after World\u2019s Cup, we are projecting RevPAR on a constant currency basis to be flat to up 2%. This RevPAR growth when combined with our [indiscernible] impacted margin increases of 20 to 50 basis points, will result in adjusted EBITDA of $1.420 billion to $1.550 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.52 to $1.55.  I should note the following when comparing our 2015 adjusted EBITDA estimates to last year\u2019s results. First, because our dispositions significantly exceeded our acquisitions in 2014, the overall net reduction in EBITDA compared to last year from investment activities is roughly $20 million. Secondly, while we expect meaningful long term benefits from the brand conversions and major capital investments we are implementing in 2015, our seven non-comp hotels are expected to experience a net reduction in EBITDA of $25 million compared to last year as a result of the closing of all or a portion of the hotel. Finally, while only 8% of our portfolio EBITDA is generated from international properties, the significant appreciation of the dollar is currently projected to reduce the nominal value of our international EBITDA by roughly $17 million. In summary, I am pleased to say that the lodging industry continues to be strong through the continued demand that exceeds low supply growth in most markets. Given the positive industry outlook and underlying economic fundamentals, we believe this cycle will continue to be strong throughout 2015. The capital we are investing in our hotels ensure that our portfolio is in excellent condition and has the opportunity to achieve strong NOI growth. Our industry leading balance sheet is only getting stronger, our cost of capital remains attractive. Thank you and let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail. Gregory J. Larson: Our hotels in the west continue to lead the portfolio in RevPAR growth. Excellent results from our properties in Hawaii, San Francisco, Florida, and Phoenix were offset by weaker results at our urban New York, DC, and Boston hotels. One thing to note, our urban assets, especially those in New York, are operating at very high occupancies and as such RevPAR growth has been limited to increases in average rates. With the abundant supply in New York, the growth in average rate has flowed and the flat room revenues at our hotels in New York impacted our portfolio RevPAR growth by 100 basis points in the quarter. In addition, as discussed during our third quarter call, a larger share of the renovations for 2014 occurred in the fourth quarter and the impact of those reservations have been greater than anticipated. While these capital improvements strengthen and create long term value in the portfolio, the negatively impacted the fourth quarter RevPAR growth results by approximately 160 basis points. Many of the disruptive renovations will continue into 2015 and will adversely impact our short term results.  Let me now provide some commentary around our markets. We posted very strong results at our Hawaiian hotels as the Hyatt Regency Maui strategically reduced group volumes as well as higher rate transient room nights [indiscernible] our owners. This contributed to an increase in occupancy of three percentage points and growth of ADR of 10.5% resulting in impressive RevPAR growth of 15%.  Our hotels in San Francisco grew occupancy 2.3 percentage points and grew average rate 8.5% resulting in RevPAR growth of 12% in the quarter. All five of our comparable hotels in San Francisco posted double digit RevPAR growth benefitting from the strong group demand in the market this quarter. Corporate group ADR increased 14% and transient ADR improved 10.4%. Our properties in San Francisco for the full year, grew RevPAR by an impressive 15%. Our Phoenix assets also had a strong quarter with an increase in RevPAR of 8.8% driven by strong group business that also led to robust food and beverage growth of 23%. In Florida, our hotels also outperformed our portfolio in the quarter by significant margin with RevPAR growth of 9.4%, primarily driven by a substantial transient rate increase of approximately 10%. We believe our Florida assets are poised for another strong year in 2015 as the group revenue pace is up over 9% in 2015.  As expected, RevPAR growth for the fourth quarter in New York, DC, Boston, Houston, San Diego, and Canada was challenged. The challenges arose primarily as a result of disruptive room, meeting, and public space renovations that were ongoing during the quarter at many of the hotels in these markets which negatively impacted RevPAR growth. New York and DC were impacted by supply increases that limited rate growth in those markets. However, it is important to note that even with New York\u2019s challenging supply environment, our hotels grew market share by 1%. In the first quarter of 2015, in addition to the continued impact of supply, the disruption to travel caused by severe snowstorms in the Northeast region will also impact RevPAR growth in New York. Further, we have difficult year-over-year comparisons in the first quarter as our hotels in New York strategically took on group business during the Super Bowl last year with both our hotels in Times Square serving as the headquarters for the media and the NFL. All these actors will combine to negatively impact 2015 first quarter results. In addition to the supply challenges, our hotels in DC had a disproportionate amount of disruptive capital expenditures in the quarter, limiting RevPAR growth. The JW Marriott was under rooms renovations and the Grand Hyatt was under meeting space renovations in the quarter which negatively impacted overall results for our hotels in the DC market. These renovations will continue into 2015 further impacted the operations of these hotels or the next couple of quarters. Boston, while not impacted by renovations this quarter, had less city wise at the Heinz Convention Center and difficult comparisons due to the World Series last year. For the first quarter 2015, the record breaking snowfall in Boston will negatively impact results. Houston and Calgary were impacted by falling oil prices in addition to the disruptive renovations at the JW Houston, Houston Airport, and Calgary Marriott hotels. The negative impact from renovations at these hotels and the falling oil prices will continue into 2015.  The 2.2% fourth quarter RevPAR growth for San Diego was primarily impacted by renovations at two large hotels in San Diego. Group business was negatively impacted by the meeting space renovation at the Manchester Grand Hyatt and the start of the Marriott Hall construction at the Marriott Marquis San Diego Marina. The construction of the Marriott Hall will be completed in mid-2016. The meeting space renovations at the Manchester Grand Hyatt have been completed and the hotel will benefit from those renovations in 2015. It is encouraging to see a 6.5% increase in our San Diego hotels 2015 group revenue [indiscernible].  Shifting to our European joint venture, our hotels in Amsterdam, Brussels, Nurnberg, and Milan had excellent RevPAR growth ranging from 8% to 15% in the fourth quarter. This strength was partially offset by weakness in many of our hotels in the other European markets resulting in a 2.9% increase in the European joint venture\u2019s comparable hotel RevPAR. Food and beverage revenues increased .8% which led to a total revenue increase of 1.7%. Even with a total revenue growth of only 1.7% for the quarter, with good cost control measures these hotels grew EBITDA by 5%.  Looking to 2015, lodging fundamentals in our domestic hotel market with the exception of New York, DC, and Houston, will continue to be strong in 2015. We expect all but these markets to have strong year of RevPAR growth that will meet or exceed the midpoint of our domestic RevPAR guidance for 2015. On the other hand, our own international properties will perform below our domestic portfolio primarily due to the expected significant decline in RevPAR at our JW Marriott Rio which is a result of the extremely difficult comp from last year\u2019s World Cup.  In addition, on a nominal currency basis, the strengthening US dollar will have a significant negative currency impact on our international properties affecting RevPAR as well as EBITDA generated from these hotels. For the hotels in the European joint venture with the continued economic challenges in many of the European countries, we expect comparable portfolio RevPAR to lag US RevPAR growth, however, the six month long international art exhibition returns to benefit this year and Milan is scheduled to host the World\u2019s Cup which is also a six month event in the city. These two large events will drive outperformance at our hotels in Venice and Milan in 2015. Moving our margin our comparable hotel EBITDA margins increased 15 basis points in the fourth quarter on RevPAR growth of 3.2%. Lower RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter slowed the strong margin expansion we still had on the third quarter. In addition, $4 million of severance costs associated with the Four Seasons Philadelphia and San Francisco Marriott Marquis further impacted margins by 35 basis points in the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, margins expanded a strong 120 basis points. During 2014, we were able to drive this increase through initiatives such as renegotiation of several management agreements. As a result, incentive management fees for 2014 decreased 4.1%. We renew our insurance each year and in 2015 we were able to decrease our insurance costs by 6%.  The cost savings realized from time and motion studies and deep dives conducted at various properties contributed to excellent rooms and food and beverage flow through of 76% and 48% respectively. We continue to expect that these third-party time and motion studies as well as the company initiated deep dives will continue to help improve our margins going forward.  Looking to 2025, we believe RevPAR growth will primarily be driven by average rate growth which should lead to solid rooms flow through. However, certain savings realized in 2014 will likely be difficult to replicate in 2015. Our incentive management fees will increase at a more normalized level and real estate taxes are projected to increase well above inflation as hotel values have grown. As I mentioned previously, we also expect the strengthening US dollar to impact our EBITDA for the year. With this in mind, we expect 2015 comparable hotel EBITDA margins to increase 20 to 50 basis points which equates to 40 to 70 basis points without the USALI adjustment mentioned in our press release.  As a reminder, our operators adoption of the updated Uniform System of Accounts for the Lodging Industry, USALI, affects the comparability of our results. These changes include declassification of items such as service charges which will now be included in both food and beverage revenues and expenses in addition to certain other reclassification. Accordingly, the adoption of USALI will negatively impact RevPAR growth by 10 basis points while food and beverage revenue will be positively impacted by 250 basis points. EBITDA margin will be negatively impacted by 20 basis points while growth in total EBITDA is unaffected. With regard to dividend, we paid a regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and a special dividend of $0.06 per share for the fourth quarter. Our total dividend for the year was $0.75 per share which represented a 63% increase over 2013. Today, we announced that our first quarter common dividend will be $0.20 per share given our strong extended operating outlook and significant amount of free cash flow we are committed to sustaining this meaningful dividend.  In summary, we expect overall lodging fundamentals to continue to be favorable in 2015. Having said that, our portfolio in 2015 will face a short term negative impact as we work to improve our properties through renovation and take advantage of other value creating opportunities. We believe these efforts will continue to create long term value for our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks, we are now interested in answering questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Smedes Rose \u2013 Citigroup. Smedes Rose : I wanted to ask just a little bit around the renovations having kind of an outsized impact for this year. When you think about that and the timing around renovations are they market dependent so the asset is just considered on its own and you need to do what you need to do, or can you look kind of holistically across the portfolio and maybe mitigate the impact better? I\u2019m just kind of curious how you think about that? It just seems you have a lot going on this year and I\u2019m just kind of wondering how you came about the timing on that? W. Edward Walter : I think it sort of breaks into two categories. The first is where the redevelopment, the conversions of properties such as what we\u2019re doing in San Francisco and what we intend to do at the Philadelphia Four Seasons and hopefully with a couple of other hotels, with those I think it really \u2013 we see such an opportunity to improve the cash flow from those assets that the timing simply was driven as much from the acquisition or in the case of the Marriott Hall it was when we were able to get the approvals to start the ballroom. In the case of Philadelphia it was both resolving contractual issues with the Four Seasons originally and then ultimately having the opportunity to have flexibility to change the brand and change the hotel. I think in those cases to some degree I look at those similar to an acquisition that the timing was right, the opportunity was great, and so we moved forward with those as expeditiously as possible. We do take into account with those \u2013 we try to look at what\u2019s the best timing in the year to commence the renovations. One of the reasons why \u2013 the timing in Philadelphia is to close in June is to take advantage of the spring season including the May wedding season and then we will roll into the renovation with the goal being done for the fall.  In the case of the San Diego ballroom, we\u2019ve actually had the approval to build that ballroom for quite some time now but we made a conscious decision to really plan far out in advance for when we would demolish the original ballroom and start to build the new one to give the hotel the ability to plan as much as possible around that timing and most importantly, from our perspective, to complete the renovations to the Hyatt meeting space next door so we were in a position where if we had in effect surplus rooms at the Marriott that they could take advantage of some of the meeting space that the Hyatt and have the two properties work together.  With respect to the overall large cap ex hit that we generally described, I think some of that is a little bit it\u2019s just this is the right time for each of those assets to pursue those renovations. You heard a lot of them start in the fourth quarter carry into the first quarter, that\u2019s all about trying to do these renovations at the point in time where they will least affect business. But the good news about our portfolio and our business right now is we\u2019re 77% occupancy on a full year basis. The bad news is when you\u2019re that full unfortunately any kind of renovation work that you\u2019re going to do is going to hurt you because you\u2019re business is that strong. We were aggressive back in \u201910 and \u201911 about accelerating renovations at a point in time when we thought they would be less impactful from a business interruption standpoint and so you\u2019ll remember we talked about increasing our spending then. We\u2019re trying to be as thoughtful as we can about what\u2019s happening right now. It is the right time to do these things, but unfortunately we are paying a price in terms of business interruption. Gregory J. Larson: The only thing I would add is we\u2019re also fortunate enough, we have a tremendous amount of work going on both in Houston and Calgary and both of those markets were going to be fairly weak in 2015 so we\u2019re fortunate on that front. Smedes Rose : Then just as you look at the potential sale candidates, are you able to negotiate these franchise conversion rights or is that kind of played out now? It seems that that makes the properties easier to sell? W. Edward Walter : It certainly does and we\u2019ve referenced the fact that we have probably about 40% of our portfolio by number has some sort of contract flexibility. The bulk of that flexibility exists in assets that we have would generally be on, not necessarily specifically on sale lists today, but certainly covers most of the assets that we are targeting for sale. We have a lot more opportunity on that front. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs. Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs : A couple of questions from the results, first just the strategic nature of New York City, and even DC for that matter, I get it from a long term perspective but the supply issues aren\u2019t going to go away and they\u2019re actually going to accelerate so is this a onetime event, or should we look at this as this could be pulling you down for a couple of years? Then, staying with that theme, have you started to see any impact of fx on visitation into DC or New York City, especially amongst the international leisure traveler? W. Edward Walter : Let me answer the second question first. We are certainly concerned about the impact of the stronger dollar on international travel. Clearly, international travel has been a driver in what we view as stronger than anticipated demand growth over the course of this cycle so that I think that is something to be watching. So far, we have not seen an impact from that in New York. Some of that I would say we consciously sought out international business because we were trying to replace the hole that existed at those hotels from having had had the Super Bowl there the prior year, knowing that that was not going to repeat and there was also, I\u2019m not remembering which one it was, but there was a fairly large group event too that was in town in January or early February of last year that also was not repeating. So, we had sought out additional international business and we were able to get that extra international business primarily through foreign travel. What we\u2019re hearing so far from the properties is that their international business has continued to be maintained strong. I think we\u2019ll have to watch that as the year progresses because a lot of these sorts of international trips are planned way in advance so we\u2019ll have to see if that situation remains the same as we work our way into the spring. DC is frankly, less affected by international travel. We\u2019re actually part of a group in DC that\u2019s working to try to encourage incremental travel to DC from international locations and so I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve noticed anything in Washington that would suggest that had softened at all.  With respect to the two markets, you\u2019re right the supply especially, in New York, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re worried in the next two years about supply in DC, but supply in New York continues to be strong. It has continued to generate good demand growth. Obviously, we talked a little bit about it already on the international side and the market has generally absorbed the new supply, but where the problems have come about is we haven\u2019t been able to drive rate. Looking at the numbers, I\u2019d have to say that looking at the next couple of years I do think that\u2019s going to continue to be a challenge in New York. I think New York from a capital perspective though continues to rank very highly as a place for both domestic and international investors to invest and so that has allowed cap rates in New York to remain low and we frankly don\u2019t see that that situation is likely to change in the near term. So the value of the assets feel good to us but we would certainly like to see additional growth there. DC on the other hand, I think DC\u2019s strength this year will be more dictated probably in the short term, by how active the calendar is on the Hill and whether or not there\u2019s a fair amount of legislative and lobbying activity. As we get into next year the conventions business in DC finally starts to improve in a material way. We would be expecting better results in 2016 from DC. Gregory J. Larson: I think the only thing I would add and you probably know this as well, DC was actually a really strong market in the fourth quarter with RevPAR for the industry up over 8%. Unfortunately for us, because we have two very large hotels in renovation, our RevPAR growth was only 2.5%. But, I agree with Ed, when you look at the future of group bookings pace in \u201916, \u201917, and beyond it looks pretty exciting and as Ed said, supply growth in DC remains at 2% or below for the next couple of years so we do feel pretty good about DC especially once our hotels are fully renovated. Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Just one separate note and aside, I\u2019m intrigued by the move, the changing of the Four Seasons in Philadelphia, and I know you announced it a couple of months ago, but could you see yourself doing more and more of that or was this just a one off? I\u2019m just intrigued by how you\u2019re thinking about the portfolio and brand affiliation versus non-brand affiliation. W. Edward Walter : I think you should assume that we\u2019re going to try to do more of these types of projects. The one that we referenced that is premature to announce would be somewhat similar in approach and I think as we look at how we would like to invest we would look at both opportunities in the portfolio where we have flexibility to convert to this type of approach, or certainly to acquire new assets that are either independent or soft branded already, or have the potential to be that. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Hightower \u2013 Evercore ISI. Richard Hightower : A couple of questions here. The first one is a follow up on New York, I think a lot of the REITs this quarter and previous quarters have kind of made the same point, the fundamentals are opportunely going to underperform but cap rates continue to fall in the market yet no one seems to be interested in selling anything and I\u2019m wondering if you guys have an opinion on that? Then my second question is in the release I think you mentioned some incentive fee changes in a handful of contracts and also some ground lease renegotiations that helped EBITDA. I\u2019m wondering if you can quantify maybe what the potential opportunities in the rest of the portfolio are on that front? W. Edward Walter : As it relates to New York I\u2019d say we certainly each year go through the portfolio and think about what the best strategy is for each individual asset and we certainly doing that on an ongoing basis, looking at our assets in New York to determine if now would be a good time to sell them. The number of cases in our New York assets, we have different elements of them that we\u2019re working on where we think we can enhance value. There also are some things happening within the city with respect to rezoning opportunities which can potentially be beneficially value to the hotels too.  I think we like the exposure that we have in New York although we obviously wish that the performance was a little bit stronger. As I said, we are comfortable on the valuation side. I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re necessarily looking at those values saying, \u201cNow, is the right time to sell those assets,\u201d but that\u2019s an ongoing conversation within the company and we\u2019ll continue to look at that opportunity.  As it relates to the management fee side, I would say that we were able to, on several assets, negotiate as part of broader considerations whether it was extension of an agreement, whether it was part of a capital plan, and a desire on the part of the operator to have us invest and on our part to invest more in the asset or other circumstances to meaningful reduce our incentive management fees in 2014. Now, as we go through 2015 we still retain the benefit of those negotiations. We\u2019ve effectively reset our incentive management fees at a lower level as a result of those negotiations.  We\u2019ll get the benefit of that in \u201915 but in \u201915 we are returning to a more normal growth rate and incentive management fees based on the growth rate in EBITDA in the hotels. I would say that there are probably going to be opportunities to do this. I don\u2019t know that I can see on any the horizon immediately but part of the benefit of having a broad portfolio and broad relationships with operators is that overtime these sorts of opportunities present themselves and when we\u2019re there we try to take advantage of them. Gregory J. Larson: We did mention a couple of ground leases that we\u2019ve been working on and we\u2019re working on several others as well, but what we really did is one ground lease we extended by 30 years so that\u2019ll just make it much easier to sell that asset one day, when we elect to do that. Then on another ground lease we actually fired the lease and so again, that will make it much easier for us to sell that asset going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Anthony Powell \u2013 Barclays Capital Management. Anthony Powell : Just watching on the timing of the renovations given some of the positive views that we\u2019ve heard from you and others on the [indiscernible] cycle for this year and \u201916, why not maybe wait on some of these renovations and take advantage of the overall positive environment that we\u2019re seeing right now? W. Edward Walter : I think that\u2019s a fair question and to be honest, we are doing that with some hotels. As we\u2019re thinking through the capital plan for hotels, we\u2019re going to be thoughtful about which of the renovations it makes sense to do now and which of the renovations that we should try to postpone. To some degree, the existing condition of the hotel drives part of that answer. If we feel that we are not benefitting fully from the market in our current condition, given the fact that we remain confident about the outlook for the lodging cycle for the next two years, this isn\u2019t sort of the decision where you\u2019re sitting here saying, \u201cWell, don\u2019t do it in \u201915 because you can do it in \u201916 or do it in \u201917,\u201d because we\u2019re not looking at the outlook thinking that there\u2019s going to be some drop off in that time period. The postponement decision is more than just a year or so. In some cases too, like with what we\u2019re doing in Washington, the reality is that we knew group bookings were not as strong in \u201915 as they were going to be in \u201916 so this was the right time to go ahead and do the room renovations at the JW Marriott and to tear up the lobby and transform the lobby at the Grand Hyatt. It is going to hurt us, it hurt us in the fourth quarter, it will hurt us in the first quarter, but as we get into the second half of this year and as we get into next year in DC, we\u2019re going to have fully renovated hotels that are going to be, I think, doing quite well in what will be a stronger market. Anthony Powell : Kind of along the same lines you seem to be changing a lot of the management contracts into third-party, you\u2019re going more independent, do you mean to do that on a larger scale across your portfolio and if so, what kind of long term cap ex spend do you believe will be associated with that? W. Edward Walter : I would say we are going to continue to look at opportunities to switch from \u2013 what we\u2019re trying to do across the board here is match the right operator and the right brand with the right hotel. So, with large hotels we continue to be comfortable that the major brand operators are the best solutions for those type of hotels. They have the best marketing platform, the best sales platform to drive large groups into our larger hotels.  As we look at some of our smaller hotels we\u2019re not always convinced that they\u2019re the best solution and so that\u2019s why in Denver we made the solution to convert to a Marriott franchise and brought in Sage Hospitality which is a very strong operator based in Denver, knows the market extremely well to run that hotel. We have some flexibility through the portfolio to take similar type steps. I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re talking about dozens of opportunities like that, but we have, I would say, it\u2019s probably somewhere in the five to 10 hotel opportunities to do things like this in the next three to five years. We\u2019ll continue to look at those opportunities as to whether or not that\u2019s the best solution for that individual hotel. Depending upon what we chose to do in connection with that conversion, there may be a renovation that\u2019s timed with that. In some cases the renovation is a good way to sort of announce the arrival of a new operator and new approach to the hotel. But I don\u2019t know that in the grand scheme of things that\u2019s going to radically cause a big change in our overall cap ex program. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Shaun Kelley : I just wanted to ask for the Hawaiian timeshare development which you guys called out as contributing around $7 million, if I caught it correctly, for 2014. Do you have a general estimate of what\u2019s kind of built into your guidance or a range of what\u2019s built into the guidance for 2015 that you could share with us? Gregory J. Larson: Just over $12 million. Shaun Kelley : What\u2019s the general life cycle here? How long would that project last for sellout? Is it a couple of years or is it going to be more front end loaded? Gregory J. Larson: I think it\u2019s going to be right around four years for us. It\u2019s going to depend on obviously, the pace of sales but I think right around four years for us. Shaun Kelley : Then my other questions would be obviously, New York and DC have sort of dominated the discussions but you guys also called out Houston and Calgary given some of the oil exposures. Could you give us just a little bit of a sense of A) how much earnings contribution or revenue contribution you\u2019re getting to be from what you consider oil sensitive markets and B) just what you\u2019re seeing in behavior in some of those hotels, bookings, cancellations, are you seeing outsized moves at this point or would you say that it\u2019s just a little bit lackluster and people are more in wait and see? W. Edward Walter : I don\u2019t know that right off the top of our head we have a Calgary or Houston number although, intriguingly the additional disclosures we provided will give you some insight into that. I think it\u2019s probably about 4% to 5% would probably be roughly what we get from there. We have seen in those markets some general weakness, but I\u2019ve got to be honest, with the level of capital that we\u2019ve been \u2013 the fact that we\u2019ve had room renovations going on at those hotels and both of those room renovations have involved bathroom renovations, which as I described in my comments, are just more impactful and more time consuming, the bulk of what we have seen in terms of weak operating results we are attributing to the renovation disruption. Gregory J. Larson: I agree. In Houston for fourth quarter for the industry RevPAR was up over 8.5% and our Houston properties had a decline over 5% because of the disruption that Ed mentioned. W. Edward Walter : I think the sense that we have from talking to the GMs there is that there is \u2013 it has gotten weaker, there is some reduction in corporate level activity. It doesn\u2019t feel like the bottom is dropping out of the market by any means, but Houston has had an incredible run over the last four or five years. It\u2019s really been one of our strongest markets in terms of performance. It will not be one of those this year. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Crow \u2013 Raymond James & Associates. Bill Crow : If I go back to your analyst investor day I think you talked about the conundrum of getting net debt to EBITDA down to like 1.5 turns by mid \u201916 and $700 million of free cash flow before the dividend if those numbers are in the ballpark and here we are, we\u2019ve gone through another year and the 800 pound gorilla has sat out the dance again from an acquisition perspective and that seems to be a pretty consistent theme throughout this cycle relative to your size and the size of your peers and we haven\u2019t heard anything about repurchasing the stock. You\u2019re down 6%, 7% year-to-date, worse performer in the group today of course, and I\u2019m just wondering what your thought process is from the allocation of capital perspective and returning capital to shareholders? W. Edward Walter : Well, that\u2019s a great question. I think I would say the net debt to EBITDA number that you quoted is where things would happen were we not to do anything because certainly our net debt to EBITDA is nowhere near that level right now, I think it\u2019s more around 2.5 times which is a level that we\u2019re certainly very comfortable at. As you\u2019ve seen us do, we\u2019ve increased the dividend pretty materially over the course of 2014. As we generate cash flow from operations, as we generate cash from sales, I\u2019d say I think our answer to this is going to be consistent to what we said in the past which is the first thing we\u2019d like to do is invest that either in our existing assets, as you can tell from everything we\u2019ve talked about today whether in our comments or our press release, there\u2019s a fair amount of that happening already. We\u2019re putting a lot of capital to work and we\u2019re putting it to work in areas that we think will frankly drive better performance than what we would expect to get out of an acquisition. But in addition to doing those types of investments, we would like to acquire additional assets. You could say we\u2019ve sat out the dance and I would say to some degree we\u2019re trying to be thoughtful about underwriting and recognize that cycles do come to an end and take that into account in our underwriting and I think some of the folks that we\u2019re competing with may have a slightly different perspective about how to approach that.  The bottom line is that we certainly feel good about our overall portfolio and are only looking for opportunities to enhance it as opposed to being worried about just getting bigger. As we generate those extra proceeds from sales and/or from operations I\u2019d say first of all we would look to enhance the dividend in part because the dividend will probably, if it comes from sales will be generating incremental taxable income from those sales which [indiscernible] some incremental distributions and that\u2019s part of the reason why we had to do the special dividend as part of our most recent distribution, is because we did have taxable income that had to be distributed. Buying back stock is something that is clearly something we\u2019re looking at. I think we have a few things that we have in the pipeline right now that we would like to see how they play out, but we are certainly open to buying back stocks. We\u2019ve done it in the past and [indiscernible] a more productive use of the capital then we would intend to return it one way or the other. I think then the issue there just becomes trying to understand what might generate the best long term return to the shareholders, whether it\u2019s through a dividend or whether it\u2019s through buying back the stock. Gregory J. Larson: Or, really a combination of both a strong dividend and buying back the stock. Operator : Your next question comes from Harry Curtis \u2013 Nomura Securities. Harry Curtis : Can you talk about or give a little bit more color on when you believe that your current renovation program will result in stabilized EBITDA going forward? Is it the end of 2015, is it the middle of \u201916, and what are the odds that you do, at that point, begin to layer in other renovation projects? W. Edward Walter : I guess as we look at the major renovations that we were talking about, the ones that really are causing the $25 million worth of disruption, with the exception of the San Diego ballroom, I think most of those projects are going to be completed at some point this year. In general, I would be expecting that the loss in EBITDA that we\u2019re experiencing in \u201915 will be restored in \u201916 by virtue of the fact that those properties will be open and operating. Over the course of \u201916 and into early \u201917, we would expect to see meaningful EBITDA enhancements from all the investments that we\u2019ve made that would then start to kick in and we\u2019d start to get the benefit out of the investment activity that we\u2019ve had. Without putting too fine number on it, if we\u2019re going to suffer $25 million of displacement this year, we would expect to make that up and our outlook for \u201916 and \u201917 is we recruit at least that incremental. Harry Curtis : Then the follow up is, in the fourth quarter with New York City occupancy at roughly 88%, what is it that your managers are nervous about when driving rate more aggressively? It would seem that despite the capacity growth at 88% occupancy one would think there would be a greater opportunity to push rate? W. Edward Walter : I would agree with you, it would seem that the level \u2013 I think some of the \u2013 our world has gotten a little bit more transparent in terms of pricing over the last decade and the reality is that because the New York market \u2013 a sizeable component of it is driven by leisure, people are quick to price compare. So, what we\u2019ve been finding is that when properties try to push rate, they have to be very thoughtful and sort of tactical about how to do that. At times of the week, at times of the month we are able to drive month but you\u2019ll find that people do move as they start to see rates push beyond certain levels and our world\u2019s gotten easier for people to do that to be honest. Operator : Your next question comes from Thomas Allen \u2013 Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Can you help us with color on what your EBITDA exposure was to each of your major markets in 2014? W. Edward Walter : I don\u2019t have that information right in front of me, but that\u2019s exactly what our new disclosure is designed to provide you so if you go to the website you\u2019ll be able to get a pretty good insight into that. Thomas Allen : Then just on your Hawaii business, you highlighted it was strong in the fourth quarter, it seems like that\u2019s getting the benefit of the rooms that were converted into timeshare, but we\u2019re getting mixed messages from companies on the potential strength of Hawaii in 2015 just given everything that\u2019s going on with the weakening yen and that market being driven by Japanese customers. Can you just help us how to think about that market? W. Edward Walter : I think you\u2019re right that that\u2019s one of those markets that is susceptible to challenges based upon the strength in currency. I think in our Waikiki asset we have seen some signs there that Japanese travel has not been perhaps as strong as it has been in the past. Having said that, our outlook for Hawaii this year is right down the middle in the portfolio in terms of RevPAR growth. I think where we\u2019re being helped is Maui is more US focused than internationally focused. Our booking pace at our hotels is up very strongly in \u201915 and also is up quite strong in \u201916. I\u2019d say that Waikiki and Oahu is probably a little bit more exposed to some of the challenges from international travel, but Maui is looking quite strong this year. Gregory J. Larson: You\u2019re correct, fourth quarter was extremely strong for us in Hawaii with RevPAR up almost 15%, but you\u2019re also right about 2015 that when we look at Hawaii I think it will be a good year but it won\u2019t be that strong. I think RevPAR growth in Hawaii next year will be right within our domestic overall portfolio. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question and answer session. Mr. Walter, at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. W. Edward Walter : Thank you for joining us on the call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our year end results and outlook with you. We look forward to talking with you in the spring to discuss our fourth quarter results and to provide more insight into how 2015 is playing out. Thanks everybody. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Gee Lingberg : Thanks, Noah. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts first quarter 2015 earnings call. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publically update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today\u2019s call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in today\u2019s earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our website at www.hosthotels.com. With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our first quarter results and then will describe the current operating environment as well as the company\u2019s outlook for 2015. Greg will then provide greater detail on our first quarter performance by market and discuss our margin results. Following the remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, here\u2019s Ed. Ed Walter : Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report that 2015 is off to a solid start with another quarter of positive results for the company driven by strong rate growth and solid group demand despite the headwinds of business interruption from capital investments. We continue to feel good about industry fundamentals and our outlook for the remainder of the year, which I will discuss in more detail in a few minutes. First, let\u2019s review our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $321 million, which reflects a 4.2% increase over last year. Our first quarter adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.35, which exceeded consensus estimates and reflected 6.1% increase over last year. These results were driven by several factors. First, RevPAR for our comparable hotels on a constant currency basis increased 3.8% for the quarter driven by rate growth of 4.8%, which was partially offset by an occupancy decrease of 0.7 percentage points. As we detail on our call in February, our operating results at our comparable hotels were materially affected by a number of comprehensive room and meeting space projects at several of our larger hotels. At the 15 hotels that were under significant construction during Q1, RevPAR declined by more than 13% and EBITDA fell by nearly $17 million when compared to 2014. When looking at the performance of our hotels that were not under construction in Q1 of either 2014 or 2015m RevPAR was up 5.5% and this portfolio saw meaningful improvement in market share. RevPAR growth in the portfolio was driven by transient rate growth and a combination of rate and demand growth in our group business. Our transient rate was up more than 4.5% as we experienced strong rate growth in all segments of our business and now achieved the average rate achieved in the first quarter of the prior peak. On the group side, demand increased by 1% driven by an 8.5% increase in our association segment. Corporate business was flat to last year, which means we booked over 15,000 rooms to offset the loss of the Super Bowl group we had in 2014 in New York City. Group rate was up 3% leading to group revenue increase of 4%. Perhaps providing better insight into the strength of our group business, demand and revenues increased more than 2% and 5.5% respectively over last year when we look at the hotels unaffected by renovation in either 2014 or 2015. While only about 9% of our EBITDA comes from foreign sources, the dramatic strengthening of the dollar did reduce EBITDA in the quarter by approximately $4 million. The solid rate growth and positive group activity led to comparable EBITDA margin expansion of 50 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA growth of nearly 5%. As you might expect, the margin expansion of the hotels not under renovation was significantly higher than the level we experienced in the comparable portfolio. Now let me spend a few minutes regarding our approach to capital allocation. First, I want to be clear that we continue to have a positive view on the lodging industry and on the cycle. As most of you know, forecast for supply in 2015 and 2016 indicate it will fall short of the historical long-term and short-term demand level. And while it is early to be predicting 2017\u2019s supply, based on the construction sites announced to-date, we do not expect it to accelerate meaningfully. All this adjusted for at least the next two years provided there is no impact to the demand side of the equation, revenue should continue to increase better than inflationary levels, and the operating environment in our space will remain attractive. As you might anticipate, we are not the only capital source with this view. Lending to our industry has continued to improve and equity capital has been drawn to the higher NOI growth our sector can generate. The natural consequence of these trends as pricing has continued to improve and anticipated returns on acquisitions have contracted. Recognizing these facts, over the last two years, we have sought to take advantage of the market by selling assets generally in non-target markets or in suburban locations within our target markets, including some of our big BOSS Group hotels. In fact, in the last 26 months, we have sold over $1.2 billion of asset. We expect to continue to improving our portfolio in 2015 with roughly $100 million to $150 million in sales in active acquisition currently and with a plan to market at least an additional $200 million to $300 million in asset over the remainder of the year. Over the last two years, we have been clear about our desire to have a strong balance sheet view from both the coverage and a leverage perspective. Irrespective of our current view of the industry\u2019s, history and experience has taught us that a strong balance sheet is our company\u2019s and our shareholders\u2019 best defense against an unpredictable world. Today, we are comfortable that we have the balance sheet strength that we believe is appropriate. As a result, going forward, at some unique circumstances, we would expect to fund additional investments through a combination of proceeds from asset sales, cash flow generated by operations, and modest debt issuance. As market conditions have evolved, we have found it more difficult to identify assets that satisfy our return requirements. As a result, we have renewed our efforts to generate value from our existing portfolio. Our initial success was the redevelopment of the Atlanta Perimeter Marriott and the Sheraton Indianapolis have lead to additional activity in this arena with the conversion of the Phoenix Ritz-Carlton to an independent hotel affiliated with the Autograph brand to be operated by Destination Hotels is just the most recent example. While there is near-term disruption from these types of investments, we expect that they will generate mid-teens or better returns, which clearly exceed what we expect to generate from acquisitions. We\u2019re also expanding our focus on acquisitions to include transactions which require this type of approach as we believe there is somewhat less competition and a greater likelihood of achieving our return requirements. While we are aggressively pursuing several investment opportunities and do expect to complete more acquisitions this year than we did in 2014, we would not be surprised if our sales activity exceeded our investments. For that reason, our Board has approved a $500 million stock buyback program which will be effective once we file our 10-Q this week. While our level of activity under that program will depend on our stock price, our sales and operating activities as well as our other investment alternatives, we felt it made sense to have such a program in place to give us the opportunity to effectively enhance our investments in our great portfolio of hotels. Purchases can occur during any of our open periods which generally begin after our earnings call and end slightly before quarter end. In that respect, we do view our stock is very attractively priced. While we recognize the broader markets concern about the disruption we expect to incur from our increased capex spending this year, we believe the market is underestimating the benefit that capex will deliver in 2016 and 2017. While we have projected that we will lose $25 million of EBITDA in 2015 compared to last year and seven non-com hotels that are being closed in full or in part due to significant renovation. We expect to reverse the projected $25 million in disruption this year and add an estimated $25 million or more benefit going forward. With respect to the disruption in our comparable portfolio I highlighted earlier in my comments, given our expectations of lower capex spending in 2016, we expect to see less general disruption next year that we are experiencing in 2015. And while it seems to be fashionable to some to criticize the strength of our balance sheet, we would view our investment grade rating which leads to superior access to the credit markets throughout the cycle and our highly liquid stock is benefit worthy of a premium multiple not at discount. Finally, it is worth noting that we think the replacement cost for our portfolio which includes signature assets in virtually every major gateway market in the country average over 425 key [ph], well above our current trading level of 320. Now let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2015 as there are a number of factors that keep us optimistic about our future results. As I described earlier, fundamentals in the industry continue to be positive as key economic factors driving demand such as GDP growth and business investments will trend positively over the full year.  Overall, we expect group demand to remain solid through the remainder of the year. Continuing our experience in Q4 of last year, bookings in the first quarter for the year increased by more than 10.5% and the average rate was 8% higher than last year. Due to the strong bookings in the first quarter, demand in the second quarter is now up more than 3% with rate up more than 3.5% resulting in revenue growth of more than 7%. Overall for the year, our group rate is up more than 2.5% with group revenue up nearly 3.5% which represents a significant increase from where we started the year. Construction activity will continue to affect operating results with meaningfully higher year-over-year spending in Q2 although the impact in Q2 should not be as severe as what we experienced in Q1. Over the last six months, the dollar is appreciated by more than 15% against the international currencies relating to markets where we own hotels and it is expected to appreciate further going forward. As a result, we now expect the year-over-year impact of this currency depreciation on EBITDA to be $25 million for the full year which is about $8 million worse than what we projected in February. Offsetting the currency decline, we expect to see better than originally expected benefits from some of our cost saving initiatives suggesting that our margin improvement for the year will be higher than what we indicated in February. While we do expect to complete additional sales and acquisitions throughout the year, our guidance does not include any transaction activity beyond the one announced sale of the Delta Meadowvale Hotel, Canada. With all of this in mind, we continue to expect our comparable domestic hotel RevPAR growth for the year to be 4.5% to 5.5%. On the margin side, given expected rate growth and solid demand growth we expect our adjusted margin increase to be 30 basis points to 60 basis points through the full year. Based on these operating assumptions our adjusted EBITDA guidance will remain at $1.420 billion to a $1.450 billion and a $1.52 to a $1.55 per FFO per share. In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and remain confident about our outlook for the remainder of 2015. Thank you and now let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our CFO who would discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail. Greg Larson : Thank you Ed. As expected our market results for the first quarter were mixed, while there were some outstanding performing markets with double digit RevPAR increases and were partially offset by negative results for hotels in New York, DC, Houston, and Canada. However it was encouraging to see that in most of our markets RevPAR growth was predominantly driven by rate increases. Let me now provide some commentary on our individual markets. It was encouraging to see that for a first time in a long while in East Coast market Boston lead performance with an impressive 20.5% increase in RevPAR, resulting from a 6% growth in occupancy, coupled with a 9.5% ADR increase. Despite the negative impact from the record-breaking winter storms four of the five hotels in that market posted impressive double-digit RevPAR growth ranging from 13% to 37%, with two of those hotels benefiting from prior year room renovation. Without the benefit of these renovations remaining hotels grew RevPAR over 13%. F&B revenues increased approximately 19% leading to EBITDA growth of nearly 200 basis points. Our hotels in Boston outperformed the STAR upper upscale hotels in the market by 600 basis points. In addition to positive renovation impact at Sheraton, Boston [00:02:09], our managers in Boston focused on a strategy to improve group occupancy, especially at our two large hotels. As a result, group occupancy in the first quarter improved 670 basis points at our Boston Copley Marriott and Sheraton Boston properties, which helped drive the increase in RevPAR in F&B revenues. Looking west, once again our hotels in San Francisco had an excellent quarter with occupancy growth of 3.6% each point, and an increase in average rate of 10.3%, resulting in RevPAR growth of 15.4% in the quarter. This growth is even more impressive when taken into account that this is a comparison to last year's first quarter RevPAR growth of 25.3%. All five of our comparable hotels in San Francisco posted double digit RevPAR growth, benefiting from strong transient and corporate group demand in the market this quarter. Group revenues increased approximately 15% and transient revenues improved 12.1%. Our properties in San Francisco are expected to have strong RevPAR growth for the remainder of 2015 and the city will continue to be a top performing market for us. Our Phoenix assets also had a very strong quarter with an increase in RevPAR of 14.5%, driven entirely by strong ADR growth of 15.8%. Group revenues increased over 27% for the quarter. Extraordinary demand was created by the Super Bowl, spring break, and baseball spring training allowing hotels to capitalize on the market compression which drove premium rates. We expect our hotels in the Phoenix market to be one of our stronger performers for the year. Our hotels in Asia posted strong results for the quarter with RevPAR growth of 11%, with a significant portion of the growth coming from a rate increase of 9.2%. Our New Zealand and Australian hotels benefited from the demand generated from the Cricket World Cup matches held across several cities of both countries in February and March. The strong events calendar allowed the hotels to yield both transient and group rates. Our markets had outperformed the portfolio in the quarter at Los Angeles, San Diego, Florida and Atlanta with RevPAR increases ranging from 6.3% to 8.3%. Strong transient business and excellent average rate increases drove our performance at the hotels in these markets. In San Diego, strong citywide events created compression and drove growth group and transient rates for the hotels in this market allowing us to outperform. All these markets are expected to continue their strong performance in the second quarter. Although the market conditions were strong in Chicago and Seattle in the first quarter, our portfolio was hampered by continued renovation, which limited our RevPAR increases in these cities to 2.5% and 2.3%, respectively. The good news is that in both markets, although one renovation was completed in the first quarter and we anticipate the remaining project, the Embassy Suites Chicago rooms\u2019 renovation will be completed in May. As expected, due to increased supply, renovation, and oil issues, RevPAR growth for the first quarter in your New York, DC, Houston, and Canada, was difficult to achieve as all of these markets experienced declines in RevPAR. Our hotels in New York remain challenged because of the tough Super Bowl comparison, ample new supply, winter storms, and a lighter city-wide calendar continue to affect our hotels ability to drive rate this quarter. Our hotels had a rough start with January and February RevPAR down 17.7% and 5.3% respectively. However, the bright spot was that margins results were exceptional with RevPAR growing 7.4%. It should be noted that the first quarter is usually the weakest for New York and we\u2019ve anticipate that the rest of the year will perform better than the first quarter. And in fact, we are expecting positive RevPAR growth in remaining quarters. We have not yet seen any impact from the strong U.S. dollar to the New York and anticipate that some of our traveler tourists from abroad may be impacted by recent currency changes. Moving to DC, continued renovations and the absorption of the new supply in the market hindered results for the quarter. Three of our larger hotels in the city continued to be under major renovation during the quarter, which was the main reason for DC\u2019s 5% decline in RevPAR. We expect the performance of our properties here to improve in the second quarter as the group booking pace is strong and renovations are expected to be completed in the quarter. I should also note that the city-wide are looking strong for 2016 and 2017. DC\u2019s best convention center years were in 2005 and 2008. The city\u2019s booking pace for 2017 is very close to the peak of 2005 and has surpassed the pace achieved in 2008. In Houston, the continued renovation at our JW Houston and the decline in the energy segment negatively impacted RevPAR this quarter resulting in a decline of 9.7%. While the renovation at the JW Houston was completed in April, the travel declines related to the energy industry, an industry that has commenced with nearly 50,000 layoffs recently, will continue to negatively impact the Houston market for the remainder of 2015. Finally, our two hotels in Canada had a RevPAR decline of 21.7% for the quarter mainly due to the continued extensive renovation at the Calgary Marriott. The room renovations are expected to be completed by the end of June and the meeting space renovations of property is expected to be completed by the end of August. This renovation disruption combined with the declining oil prices translates to continued underperformance for our Canadian asset in comparison to our portfolio for the remainder of the year. Shifting to our European joint venture, our hotels in Europe had a great quarter with RevPAR increase of 4.2% on a constant euro basis. Strong transient business more than offset the softer group business and help drive the RevPAR increase this quarter. With a strong increase coming from transient customers, outlet revenues increased 2.8%, but were offset by banquet and AV revenue declining 3.4% resulting in a total food and beverage revenue decline of 80 basis points. Even with the decline in food and beverage revenue, our hotels in Europe were able to generate a 3.6% increase in food and beverage profit with productivity and cost control initiatives. Our outlook for the European asset remains encouraging as sentiment in the eurozone has turned positive. The economic outlook for the eurozone significantly improved in April from 1.1% to 1.5% driven partially by quantitative easing policies, cheap oil, and a cheap euro. Most notable increases in our economic outlook for the rest of the year were in Spain and Germany with both countries GDP forecast increasing 50 basis points from the prior forecast. We continue to expect that domestic and international demand will improve in Europe with these stronger GDP forecast and the benefit of the cheap euro. Moving to our margins. Our comparable hotel EBITDA margin increased 50 basis points in the first quarter on RevPAR growth of 3.8%. This margin increase would have been 20 basis points higher without the USALI adjustment. We are pleased with the increase be achieved in the first quarter as our hotels attained impressive rooms and food and beverage flow-throughs. More than anticipated rooms, wages, and benefits and changes in cancellation policies contributed to strong rooms flow-through. In the past room reservation could be cancelled up at 6 PM on the date of arrival. Beginning in 2015, certain hotels had changed the policy so that reservations must be cancelled within 24 hours or the guest will be charged for the room for tax. This policy will continue to improve room profit going forward as the hotels have been somewhat lenient in the beginning that will begin enforcing this policy in full force going forward. Other factors such as utilities and property insurance expenses help increase margins this quarter. Utility expense was down 7.7% and part due to energy ROIs completed in 2014 such as the steam to gas conversion at the Sheraton, New York. Property insurance was also down 10.3% in the quarter. Looking forward to the remainder of 2015, we believe that RevPAR growth will continue to mainly be driven by average rate growth, which should lead to solid rooms flow-through. On the other hand, our incentive management fees will continue to increase at a more normalized level and we also anticipate real estate taxes to increase well above inflation as our property values have grown. In addition, as Ed mentioned in his prepared remarks the strength in U.S. dollar is expected to continue to impact our EBITDA for the full year. With this in mind, we continue to expect 2015 comparable hotel EBITDA margins to increase 30 basis points to 60 basis points. As previously mentioned, we estimate that without the USALI adjustment, 2015 margins would be higher by 20 basis points. In summary, we feel good about the industry fundamentals and our results. We are focused on executing our renovation and repositioning plan to deliver long term value for our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Anthony Powell : Hi good morning guys. Ed Walter : Good morning. Greg Larson : Good morning. Anthony Powell : Ed, thanks a lot for the comments on the renovation and also you\u2019ve appetite to do more acquisitions that could require some Capex, does your renovation activity imply that you are having more positive view of a lodging cycle then maybe some censuses right now? Ed Walter : I don't know that I\u2019d, I would say, it shouldn\u2019t be compared to what other people think, but I think we certainly do have a very positive view on the lodging cycle as I outlined in my comments and feel this certainly is the time to benefit from the investments we're making in the properties that we already own. Anthony Powell : Thanks. And I guess, also on the change in the investment team, has that changed your target markets for acquisitions or your overall acquisition philosophy for the rest of the cycle? Thank you Ed Walter : No it doesn't. I think actually the changes that we've made will hopefully allow us to focus even more carefully and thoughtfully on the markets that we are interested in acquiring in, but by splitting up to U.S. between Jim Risoleo who was our Chief Investment Officer previously and now is located out in the West, and then bringing in Nate Carroll, who is the senior leader within the company, who has been an active member of the investment committee and a very strong executive. Putting them in charge of the Eastern half and the Western half of the country, I think will allow us to be even more focused in our investment efforts and I\u2019m expecting to see good results out of that change. Anthony Powell : Just one follow-up, final follow-up on the repurchase of $500 million, how did you come up with the $500 million number was there leverage ratio you were targeting or just what were your thoughts on that number versus maybe a larger number like $1 billion? Ed Walter : I think in part, I would say that we typically, when we were issuing stock we tended to look to get authorization to do that up to $500 million and I think in terms of buying back stock we felt that $500 million was sort of a good round number. It obviously, if we execute fully on that program there is the opportunity to initiate another one, but a lot of this was tied to our expectations around sale activity. Anthony Powell : Alright. Good quarter. Thanks a lot. Ed Walter : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Chris Woronka : Hi, good morning guys. Wanted to ask you may reference to potentially doing some more brand or manager changes and that kind of thinking to the history of your company, you guys have successfully renegotiated some management contracts overtime. I think you\u2019ve typically done them kind of in bunches at once. Is there any thought to going back to some of your operators and just revisiting certain things? Ed Walter : Chris, I would say that we are always looking at opportunities to may be make changes in one property and then acquire benefits in another. We\u2019ve done it a couple of times where we done what I would sort of view is very large transaction, both of those with Marriott when we renegotiated our contracts back in 2002 and then again in 2005. I would say what more likely to happen in the near term is something similar to what happened in Calgary, where we agreed to extent the Calgary contract in written for getting flexibility on to other properties one which we subsequently sold. Flexibility that we acquired was the ability to sell that property unencumbered by management. And so, we are always looking at opportunities like that. I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that over the course of the next couple of years or couple of more opportunities like that would develop. Chris Woronka : Okay, very good. And then just a quick follow-up on the share buyback and I think you just mentioned that it could relate to some future asset sales. To the extent you do that, do you envision that being more of a programmatic buyback or would it kind of be more opportunistic and price based and spread out or maybe come together in a short period of time. Ed Walter : I would say that given that our basic plan is to fund it primarily through asset sales, I would suggest that it would more likely be spread out. But having said that, consistent with how we both pursued stock buyback programs in the past and stock issuance in the past and a lot of that relates to where the stock price is. So to the extent that the price where to be more attractive than we might \u2013 we would accelerate our buying in those circumstances and in situations where it would might increase significantly then we may be out of the market for a period of time. So it will be dictated a bit by the pace of sales and then furthermore \u2013 and then offset by to the degree to which sales might be reinvested in other assets, your existing ones or new ones and then ultimately also affected by the stock price. Chris Woronka : Okay, very good. Thanks, Ed. Ed Walter : Thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks, its Smedes. I also just wanted to ask you on the buyback. It seems like in light of your comments about 2016 and even some early comments about 2017, why wouldn\u2019t you want to frontload this now using your line and I am not suggesting you trash the balance sheet or something. But if you feel it fairly confident that you could pay it down pretty quickly with the proceeds from asset sales, why not take advantage of what looks to be really a very compelling discount to NAV particularly in light of what you just threw out as kind of per key value. Could you may be speak to that a little bit? Ed Walter : Steve, I think the point we are trying to make in our comments is we do feel good about the cycle and we do feel the part of that cycle that we can predict is the supply side, which we can reasonably predict that. And we are not seeing at this point any problems on that side. Having said that I think there is always risks on the demand side, so I think we are comfortable with where we are. We will have flexibility to perhaps do a bit of what you were describing as we move forward, but I think some of that again is tied \u2013 I mentioned we are looking at some deals that we want to be thoughtful about how we fund those transactions and would obviously like to see the asset sales occur that [indiscernible] going to use to fund the buyback. So it doesn\u2019t all have to happen sequentially, you don\u2019t have to sold the property in order to fund the buyback but you want to have a reasonable expectation that the sales will occur in order to fund the buyback. And of course some of this gets tied to just the availability of those periods of time when you can actually be in the market to buy. So I get your point and I don\u2019t disagree with it in total, I just think we \u2013 at the same time I don\u2019t believe that the Board was comfortable with the notion that we would aggressively frontload that program in anticipation of things that would happen. I think, that alludes - I've seen people do, maybe move aggressively on expectations in the past and the world can change on you and surprise you as a matter of fact. Smedes Rose : I guess just on that as well, is there any thought to maybe reducing your exposure to international markets, which have proven to be maybe extraordinary relative versus the domestic market? Ed Walter : There certainly are some international assets that are part of for sale program for this year, so that\u2019s something that we are looking at. Smedes Rose : All right, thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi good morning guys. Maybe just a follow-up on the last question, but very specifically Ed, is there a magnitude of discount to NAV that makes it so attractive that you need to look at buybacks instead of doing an acquisition, is there like a, kind of a, I mean is it 20% or 30% type number that just makes it \u2013 that makes that the compelling rational? Ed Walter : Yeah, I haven't thought about it specifically in terms of a percentage reduction to NAV, but certainly as we\u2019re looking at other alternatives we are looking at both what's the opportunity with that acquisition versus what do we think the return would be on the stock and to the extent that the stock is a more compelling investment then that's going to see more capital. Shaun Kelley : Okay, thanks to that. And to switch gears, you know you talked about keeping some fire power for continued M&A and so the question there is, I think in the past you guys have talked about and maybe it was even just last quarter, some potentially larger scale, I think single asset, but probably at larger scale type deal that might be out there, do you still think that larger or bigger assets are available or things we looking at more opportunistic smaller scale and more like some of these independent hotel deals we\u2019ve seen around this sector recently. Greg Larson : We\u2019re looking at a combination of both. Some are larger single asset possibilities and then we are also looking at a number of the smaller deals that might be out there. So, both of those would potentially be on the play. Shaun Kelley : And has anything changed from your comments last quarter in terms of just the availability of some of those big assets? Greg Larson : No I don't know, I wouldn't think that we see a difference in terms of where we were last quarter, maybe one point that you are getting at indirectly is that we - when we talked about the options that we had last quarter, I think we suggested at that stage that we might be in an either or position relative to stock buyback versus investing. And I guess what I would say is as we look forward as we look at what we would be interested in trying to sell this year and have thought about that, the conclusion that we reached is that we probably have the capability to both do new investments and buyback stock, obviously the relative balances of those two will change and will obviously work our way through the year. But we didn't see it as an either/or proposition and so that's why we wanted to go ahead and implement the program at this point in time because our stock price is attractive. We do want to have the ability to be able to purchase it and then we will - the degree to which we execute on one version versus the other will be based upon the relative returns that we\u2019d see from each of those alternatives. Greg Larson : Yes, certainly we can do both of those things, but I would add we could also put out over $600 million in the form of a dividend. Shaun Kelley : Great, thanks guys. I appreciate the color. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Harry Curtis with Nomura. Harry Curtis : Good morning guys. Following up on renovations, I don't know, I jumped on the call late, Ed as you look at the make-up of your portfolio today do you see a more large-scale renovations for 2016 that are likely to get done? Ed Walter : Harry, there are a few projects that we are going to start at the end of this year. That will be sizeable renovations of individual hotels that will happen during the beginning of 2016. Lease based upon our current expectation, but overall when we look at the program that we are envisioning for 2016 and compare it to 2015, we expect that the dollar amount that we invest will go down and the impact of those activities next year will be less than what we are feeling this year. Harry Curtis : By what magnitude, please. Ed Walter : I don\u2019t want to give you a number right now because we are very early in the process on the capital budget. But I think it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m not talking 5% or 10%, I\u2019m talking more than that. Harry Curtis : Yeah. I mean it is important with respect to return of capital to see that CapEx being to come down and to give investors a sense of what percentage of your assets still need innovation. Ed Walter : You know, Harry, the one thing to recognize in our sector is you\u2019re always in some level of renovation. And I know you know that. A big chunk of the larger investments that we are making this year, it relates to the \u2013 really what we call ROI or redevelopment projects and I continue to believe that those are the projects that you also want us to be doing because, as I mentioned in my comments, we think the returns from those investments are in the mid-teens and those are attractive way to both enhance value of the portfolio and enhance the valuable of our cash flow. So that part of what we\u2019re doing to me is very much value accretive. I think the part that \u2013 and I would like to do more of those to the extent that those opportunities such as what we are going to end up doing in Phoenix with the Ritz-Carlton, which present themselves. On the other hand, what we\u2019ve talked about before in the first quarter, I think we talked about in February and are continuing to highlight is, both Greg and I talked about in our comments is, we did have a number of larger renovation projects to comparable hotels, which certainly had a negative effect on those comparable hotel performances during the course of the first quarter. That CapEx, which deals more with maintaining the portfolio, is accelerated a bit in the beginning of this year because of some contractual negotiations we had whether it was with extending a ground lease or extending a management contract in return for other benefits. That level of capital is what I expect will be declining next year and that\u2019s why I believe the level of disruptive will be lower. But we will know more about that as we work our way through the year. Our budget process, we\u2019re coming up with next year\u2019s capital program really happens over the course of the summer. Harry Curtis : Okay. Thanks, Ed. And just a quick question on the importance of scale in the REIT segment. It certainly matters in the C-Corp segment. And do you think for the REITs that the bigger the better? And to that extent, do you expect any consolidation within the lodging REITs this cycle? Ed Walter : I think there are certain benefits of scale that just relate to either your ability to access the unsecured debt market as the foundation of your portfolio and sort of your ability to perhaps develop in-house capabilities in certain areas. In our instance, I think our ability \u2013 our scale forces us to develop a really comprehensive construction team, which I think makes the difference in terms of what we been and when we are pursuing construction project and the like. So I do think there are some benefits to that. On the other hand, I wouldn\u2019t say that scale in and of itself, certainly for us at this stage, enhancing that scale is not necessarily a goal. For us, it is about enhancing profitability and share value. In terms of predicting what\u2019s going to happen within the sector, I think many of you have commented that there \u2013 you could certainly see some logic for some consolidation that hasn\u2019t happened in our sector in the past, I think it will be hard to predict, but it\u2019s necessarily going to happen in the near term. Greg Larson : Harry, I think the other big benefit as you know from size is just \u2013 increase stock liquidity as well. Harry Curtis : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : And we will take our next question from Nikhil Bhalla with FBR. Nikhil Bhalla : Hi, good morning, Ed, Greg, and Gee. Just a couple of questions here. The first question is for Ed. I think you mentioned early on that the market may be underestimating the positive impact from renovations into 2016 that you might expect. I just want to kind of dig in a little bit into that, specifically, what kind of gives you confidence that going to be the case, is it your pace for 2016, that continues \u2013 got stronger than 2015 or just city-wide in your major markets that look a little bit stronger next year than this year, any color? Thank you. Ed Walter : Yeah, Nikhil, what I was referring to there was that, we \u2013 my sense is that the market may be underestimating the benefit that be expected to arrive out of the seven projects that are essentially going on are non-comparable this year because we\u2019re closing parts of those properties. And as a result of closing parts of those properties, all parts of those properties this year, we are losing about $25 million in EBITDA this year compared to last year. As we \u2013 most of those projects with the exception of the San Diego will be coming back online no later than the first quarter \u201916.  And so as we are in \u201916 and \u201917, we would expect to both recapture the $25 million that we are losing in 2014 because they won\u2019t be closed anymore and then based on the rationale under which we undertook those projects, we would expect to see another $25 million or so of incremental EBITDA that would flow to the company in \u201916 and \u201917 as a result of our successful completion of those projects. So that\u2019s what I was talking about as part of my comment. So it\u2019s not \u2013 its inherently the assessment and the underwriting of those individual project takes into account what\u2019s going to be happening in those markets.  And so the strength of the convention cycle is San Diego in \u201916 is one of the benefits that we expect to derive from having our ballroom complete. But I was really referring to those projects as opposed to a blanket statement about how well the portfolio of the industry would perform in 2016. Greg Larson : Ed, I agree with that but I also would say that we are also experiencing a lot of disruption in our comp portfolio as well. And so for instance, as I mentioned, three of our largest hotels in D.C. were all under renovation in the first quarter. So as those hotels, as those renovations are completed by call it May of this year, then those hotels will start outperforming this year and obviously in 2016 as well. Again, the same thing, I think we mentioned the Calgary Marriott, a lot of disruption going on there. The RevPAR is actually down 42%. That hotel is actually in our com set. So again when that hotel \u2013 we will look at that hotel next year, my guess is that RevPAR growth can be substantial. Nikhil Bhalla : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for that. And one other question on asset acquisitions, do you still see some assets in portfolio that you might be interested as the price will rise, both nationally and internationally. Ed Walter : Yeah, I don\u2019t want to necessarily comment on any one company portfolio, but you should assume that we regularly look at whatever the brands are interesting in selling, we have strong relationships with all of the brand. And so we would always be in conversations with them about what options might exist. Nikhil Bhalla : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Rich Hightower : Hi, good morning everyone. Two questions here. The first is a follow-up to the earlier question on capex for this year. Correct me if I am wrong, I think that the ROI portion of the total capex budget is going up slightly from what was announced last quarter. And if I am correct in saying that, is that an increase to the budget versus what was originally expected or is that just pulling forward some of those other 2016 projects that you mentioned just pulling them forward into this year. And then I\u2019ve got one follow-up after that. Ed Walter : Sure. Yeah, I would say as usual in this area, it tends to be a combination of factors. So as part of some of the redevelopments that we are looking at, we have identified some incremental opportunities that we think will add value including a one I would say a meaningful energy ROI project where we\u2019ll end up producing our own power for our particular hotel which we think will significantly reduce our utility cost. So some of it is an increasing scope, some of it is the fact that as we look at the timing for when we\u2019re going to be completing some of the improvements, the reality is we are hopeful of being perhaps completing things a little bit earlier and then that result would further dollars allocated for this year to go up a bit. Rich Hightower : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then my follow-up is just on the guidance largely unchanged from prior. It does sound like FX is getting a little worse than you expected and you said that was offset by cost savings. But in the prepared comments, it did sound like group booking activity and some of the forward numbers that you guys are looking at are getting a little bit better incrementally. So I am just wondering if that\u2019s the case, why guidance didn\u2019t go up slightly on that alone relative to these other factors. Ed Walter : I guess what I would say is, first of all, I think you\u2019ve assessed all that correctly in the sense that we basically are feeling a bit more pain from the current or anticipating that we will feel some more pain on the currency side, which is being offset by the margins. And I\u2019d say you\u2019re right about what's happening on the group side and we were very encouraged by the strong increase in rooms booked in the first quarter and perhaps even more encouraged by the fact that the rate was up 8%, compared to what we booked last year. So our group booking pace for this year is continuing to look better and better as we work our way through the year.  We certainly hope that that trend continue and I think to the extent that we benefit from that trend continuing that might offer an opportunity for an improvement in our top line estimates, but it\u2019s really, it was just one quarter and I think we just simply - we are certainly - in a sense we've improved our guidance because we've offset the decline in the currency impact, but it obviously doesn't show up when you look at the aggregate numbers in nominal dollars, but we're feeling good about where the year is headed and hope we continue to feel good. Rich Hightower : Okay, that's it from me, thank you. Ed Walter : Right. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Meliker with MLV & Company. Ryan Meliker : Hi guys most of my questions have been answered though one thing, I was hoping you could give us some color on was back in the third quarter 2013, you guys issued equity via the ATM at around $18.39 [ph] now with the stock $2 higher and essentially trading at the same forward multiple and consensus estimate, you guys have instituted a buyback and I think that's great, I'm just curious how you reconcile those two things? Is it just based on the opportunities you have for investment then versus now or is there something else are you not even concerned about the fact that you wish you clearly had a price $2 below where the stock is trading now in terms of buybacks, just how do you think about that, that's helpful, thanks. Ed Walter : Ryan I can't necessarily tie that specifically to that particular issuance of stock and I'm not debating your numbers, I'm just simply saying, I don't know that we would necessarily tie specifically to that, but as we approach issuing equity through this last or five years, one is I know that the average multiple that we issued that activity at whereas a couple of terms higher than we always did today, more than a couple of times higher. So, I think we felt very comfortable whenever we were issuing equity previously that we were issuing at a premium to our NAV. I think at this point in time as we look at where our stock sits and having achieved the leverage objective that we have, we tend to view our stock is trading at a discount to that NAV. So, I think the way, the general way we looked at this is that we've tried to issue stock when it\u2019s above our NAV, we used that to buy assets, we did not interesting pay down debt, we used that to buy assets as we grew and then at this point in time given where we are we are perhaps a bit \u2013 while we would like to continue to buy assets as I indicated in my comments just looking at where the markets are [indiscernible] prices if we were to sell more and so in an environment like that when we think we are buying the stock at less NAV, we think that's a fair trade. Ryan Meliker : Okay. Ed Walter : The stock, as the market gets better and as the value of the portfolio improves the stock is going to go up. I\u2019m comfortable with any of the stock issuances that we made because as we worked our way through the cycle, we are working more now than when we issued that stock previously, but at this point in time, I think we are not as being as fairly valued as we should be, which creates the opportunity to buy stock back. Ryan Meliker : Okay, just out of curiosity, I would be curious about your perspective if you talk about trading at a discount to NAV today, but a premium to NAV when you were issuing the equity, do you think that's more driven by the underlying cash flow growth in the assets, or do you think cap rates have compressed in your assets over the past couple of years? Ed Walter : Probably a combination of both and then we clearly had strong cash flow growth in our portfolio and the cap rates have certainly compressed leading out certain individual markets. I think they did compress from earlier in the cycle. We are at a point in the cycle with now, where I think you\u2019d like to see cap rates generally - you are comfortable if they continue to maintain their position, but certainly over the course of the cycle we have seen cap rate compression and we have benefited from that. Ryan Meliker : All right, thanks for the commentary, as it\u2019s all from me. Ed Walter : Thanks. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Thank you, sir. Can you help us think about trajectory of RevPAR growth quarter-by-quarter in 2015. It\u2019s been a pre-coming in a lot of lodging earnings call this quarter. I think companies, if they expect U.S. RevPAR growth to continue accelerating through 2015? And then for you specifically, can you just help us think about kind of the renovation impact and also group trends and seasonality in specific markets like New York and how to think about the overall impact. Thank you. Ed Walter : It sounds what \u2013 I think your first part of your question was just to talk about maybe our RevPAR growth as we progress through the year. As you know, we really do not give quarterly guidance. We give full year guidance. Having said that, I think when we look at our quarters for this year, I think the strongest quarter for us should be the fourth quarter. Greg Larson : And in general, if you look at where our expectations are and our guidance are for the full year, it\u2019s clear that the first quarter is all that. So we are obviously expecting things to improve as we work our way through the year. Thomas Allen : Okay, helpful. Sorry... Ed Walter : And then what was \u2013 I think you had some questions about some of the individual markets. Thomas Allen : No. That was basically what I was trying to get out of it. You obviously have company specific things going on. So it was kind of a two-part question. One, kind of asking what your thoughts on general market U.S. RevPAR growth and if you try \u2013 to accelerating in the second part was just idiosyncratic if something happened for your portfolio specifically. Ed Walter : Yeah. The other thing I would mention Tom is obviously RevPAR is important but margins are important as well if not more important. I would say that clearly when we look at our \u2013 we had a great first quarter with an increase in margins of 50 basis points. I think when I think of the second, third, and fourth quarter, the fourth quarter clearly will be the best quarter from a margin growth perspective. So that way, that helps you in modeling the quarters as well. Thomas Allen : Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up, on the European JV RevPAR was obviously 4%, but you had food and beverage, it was down 1% and we heard some comments about [indiscernible]. Do you think that, that decline in F&B is anything, is it indicative of group trends at all or is it just really one-off things. Thanks. Ed Walter : Yeah. I would say that group tends to be a little bit lighter in the first quarter and allow European hotels anyway. So I think that that was \u2013 I don\u2019t know that I would read a lot into that in terms of full year in Europe. I would say about Europe is the best as we could tell is that, we did get some good look from enhanced international travel coming into Europe. And so I think actually it\u2019s just obviously \u2013 just the first part of the year and the summer travel season will be more significant in that respect. But it looked like our visitation from the U.S. was up 6% to 8% in the first quarter compared to last year, but I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why we lease to price RevPAR growth in Europe. Thomas Allen : Great. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Steven Kent : Hi, just to follow on Tom\u2019s question, on the international travel front, you mentioned earlier that you might see some weakness into some of your gateway cities from Europeans. I think you mentioned that. As we get further in the year, what\u2019s the normal booking curve for your international customers meaning are they booking two months in advance, six months in advance, 10 months in advance, so maybe that\u2019s why we haven\u2019t seen that negative implication yet. And the counter is as you just noted, you maybe saw some benefit of Europe for Europe or U.S. to Europe. Is that a shorter booking cycle? Ed Walter : Yeah. Steve, a lot of that has to do with where the source of the travel. So in other words, the tourists tend to book a bit longer out. I think that individual travel is probably a bit shorter. It hard to put a specific timeframes around that, but I would imagine based on this example as opposed to real data that you and I would both be comfortable with. The individual piece of it is maybe 60 days to 90 days but the tour business tends to be a bit longer. We certainly \u2013 we are obviously aware of the changes in the currency and the dollar relative to \u2013 especially the euro. And so, we\u2019ve been interested to see what that was going to do to our business. In terms of best international travels that we see unfortunately ends in December, but I was surprised to see that at least in the month of December, even during a period of time when the euro had already started to fall appreciably compared to the dollar and same I think with the pound too, are two largest countries that send folks to the U.S. and UK. And Germany was actually up in December compared to the prior year, which I thought was a good sign. What we are hearing so far here is that there has not been any real trend of less international travel into our hotels in the gateway market. I think there is a sense on the West Coast that the Asian travellers are really \u2013 other than Japan, are continuing to grow at a pretty rapid rate in terms of their visitation to the U.S. Now as you circle back to the East, we do think \u2013 we continue to think that there could be some risk in terms of travelling to New York and into Florida. But a gain the feedback that we\u2019re getting from the hotels so far is they are not seeing a reduction in reservation and so we are going to watch that carefully over the course of the summer. Steven Kent : Okay. Thank you for that Operator : And this does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back to Ed Walter for any additional or closing remarks. Ed Walter : Yeah, well, thank you for joining us on the call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our first quarter results and outlook with you. We look forward to providing you with more insight as to how 2015 is playing out on our second quarter call later this summer. Have a great day. Operator : And this does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.  At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Gee Lingberg : Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts second quarter 2015 earnings call. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publically update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today\u2019s call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in today\u2019s earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our Web site at hosthotels.com. With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our second quarter results and then will describe the current operating environment as well as the company\u2019s outlook for 2015. Greg will then provide greater detail on our second quarter performance by market. Following the remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, here\u2019s Ed. Ed Walter : Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of positive results for the company, driven by strong rate growth and solid group demand. We\u2019re also quite pleased with our progress on various transactions and value creation opportunities throughout our portfolio. First, let\u2019s review our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $422 million for the quarter and 743 million year-to-date, reflecting a year-to-date increase of 3.3%. Our adjusted FFO was $0.46 per share for the second quarter and $0.81 per share year-to-date, reflecting a 6.6% increase over last year. Both earning measures are in line with the consensus. These results were driven by several factors.  First RevPAR for our comparable domestic portfolio increased by 5.3%, which matched upper upscale industry performance despite continuing drag from ongoing renovation at a number of our hotels. Well Greg will provide more detailed insight shortly, we were pleased to see that overall with the exception of Houston and New York, our portfolio performed in line or better than we had expected for the quarter. The strong domestic performance was driven by our group segment, which benefited from a 13% increase in association business leading to group demand growth of 2.7% and rate growth of 4.4% which translated to group revenue growth of more than 7%. Our transient segment benefited from mix shift as our top rated segment which represent slightly less than half of our overall transient business improved demand by more than 2%. Planned reductions in our lower priced segments resulted in a modest transient demand decline, but overall rate was up 4.9% and our transient revenues increased by more than 4%.  Within the quarter for our domestic hotels, June was our strongest month as April was affected by renovation impact, and it suffered from difficult prior year comparison. Our group revenue growth outpaced transient growth each month, although because of successful rate mix strategies, our transient rate growth was stronger in all months except May.  Evaluated on a constant currency basis, our international portfolio performed well, selling 9% in the quarter when we exclude the Calgary Marriott, which was undergoing a very disruptive room renovation and the JW in Rio, which benefited significantly from the World Cup last year. Excluding those hotels, group room demand increased nearly 9%, while transient rates rose solidly. When all of our comparable international hotels were included, we had a constant currency RevPAR decline of 5.9% for the quarter.  Overall the comparable portfolio generated constant currency RevPAR growth of 4.8%, driven by rate growth of 4.5% and a slight increase in occupancy. Year-to-date RevPAR increased 4.4% reflecting rate growth of 4.7%, partially offset by a slight decline in occupancy. I would note that the USALI mandated changes in accounting approach artificially reduced each of these figures by about 20 basis points.  Given the strength in the U.S. dollar, we have been watching international travels trends carefully. Overseas arrivals excluding Canada and Mexico are up about 3% year-to-date through the end of May, with Asia travel up nearly 5%. However, Europe and South American travel are both down by roughly a 0.5%. Data from our properties confirms that we have seen weakness in travel from the EU especially on the East Coast, but continuing strength on the West Coast where more travel originates from Asia. Comparable F&B revenues grew almost 5% in the quarter or approximately 2% on USALI adjusted basis, with excellent flow through as F&B profit improved by more than 7%. Overall total comparable revenue growth was 4% for the quarter and 3.6% year-to-date. Comparable hotel EBITDA margins expanded 25 basis points for the quarter and 40 basis points year-to-date. Again USALI negatively impacted both of these figures by 20 basis points. On the acquisition front, as we announced in June, we acquired the 643 rooms Phoenician, a luxury selection resort for 400 million. This hotel is ideally located in one of the premium resort markets in the Southwest, in close proximity to nightlife, galleries, museums and businesses of downtown Scottsdale. It is a terrific hotel that we are excited to acquire and it also has several opportunities for value enhancement and redevelopment that we plan to take advantage of going forward. On the disposition front, we sold three non-core assets during the quarter, including the Sheraton Needham for $54 million which we announced in June and the Park Ridge Marriott and the Chicago Marriott O'Hare for approximately 89 million. Our European JV also sold the Crowne Plaza Amsterdam for EUR106 million. I would also note that we have a small non-core asset currently under contract for sale and expect to close on that transaction within the next few weeks for nearly $10 million. I would note that these activities have combined to improve the overall quality of our portfolio, while RevPAR is not always the best indicator of quality, it is worth noting that the average RevPAR in the domestic assets we sold this year is less than $100, while the Phoenician RevPAR is north of 220. While the scale of our acquisition activity has outpaced our disposition so far this year, because of seasonality, we expect that the net -- of these transactions as a reduction of approximately 5 million in 2015 EBITDA. However on a full year pro forma basis, the favorable impact from these activities would be north of 12 million and we expect these transactions to benefit our 2016 EBITDA by this amount. We continue to actively market properties both domestically and internationally. Given our current level of activity, we anticipate that we could realize proceeds of 100 million to 200 million from international sales by the end of the year. Domestically we expect the market 100 million to 250 million of assets this fall, but any closings resulting from these activities would likely not occur until late in the year or early 2016. Proceeds from these transactions would generally be used to pay dividends, repurchase stocks or invest in new or existing assets. Given the uncertainty with respect to timing of these transactions, the guidance I will discuss in a few minutes does not assume that we complete incremental sales other than a 10 million asset I just referenced. During the second quarter, we completed a number of highly disruptive capital projects, including the rooms' renovation of the Calgary Marriott, the Newark Airport Marriott, the JW Marriott, Houston and the JW Marriott, Washington DC as well as the lobby meeting space project at the Grand Hyatt DC. Year-to-date, the company has invested a 101 million in ROI redevelopment project and $220 million in renewal and replacement CapEx project. Construction activity in the second half of the year will remain robust, with ROI redev is estimated to range from 170 million to 185 million and renewal CapEx ranging from 150 million to 135 million. However, it is worth noting that we expect disruptions from these projects to not be as significant as we experienced in the first half of the year. As we have previously discussed, we continually look to match operator on property types and brand in an effort to maximize our operating results and asset value. Last month, we reached an agreement to franchise the Sheraton Parsippany Hotel and ATI has assumed control of the property as the operator. We currently have 12 third party managed hotels, two of which are independent. We are currently reviewing two other near term opportunities for conversion. Now let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2015 as there are number of factors to keep us optimistic about our future results. Our group bookings this year have been very soft and that trend continued in the second quarter. Group bookings during Q2 for the third and fourth quarter grew by more than 20% in terms of revenue. Because there is a well documented calendar challenges both by the late Labor Day holiday and the timing of the Jewish holiday, our booked revenues are essentially flat to last year for the third quarter, but up by more than 6% for the fourth quarter. We have been pleased with our efforts to shift business into higher rated -- within our year-to-date occupancy running north of 77%, we expect that this trend will continue although it would be more pronounced in Q4. Overall we expect RevPAR in the second half the entire portfolio will exceed our first half result. Despite these positive trends, we are reducing our EBIT outlook for the full year because our operating performance at the Four Seasons Philadelphia and Ritz-Carlton, Phoenix was weaker than we anticipated as those hotels approach their closing date. And the severance expenses of these and other management transitions have increased slightly. We have also seen slight increases in the amount of business disrupted by some of our more significant capital projects, especially at the Calgary and Newark Marriott. In addition as I discussed earlier, the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activity for the full year will reduce 2015 adjusted EBITDA by approximately $5 million. So finally while our overall operating outlook across the country is generally consistent with our slightly above our first quarter outlook, we do anticipate that both Houston and the New York will underperform our previous expectations. With all this in mind, we expect our comparable hotel RevPAR growth for the year to be 4.5% to 5%. On the margin side given expected rate growth and solid group demand, we expect our adjusted margin increase to be 35 basis points to 55 basis points for the full year. Based on these operating assumptions, our adjusted EBITDA will be 1.410 billion to 1.425 billion, which is a reduction of 17.5 million at the mid-point. I would stress that guidance for adjusted FFO remains at $1.52 per share to $1.55 per share as savings on interest expenses due to our ability to access new debt re-financings at low prices and the benefit of our stock repurchases have largely offset the impact of expected reduction in adjusted EBITDA. In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and outside of the challenges posted by New York and Houston, we remain confident about the industry and our outlook for the second half of 2015.  Looking into 2016, we are seeing very strong group bookings as corporations have booking events earlier to ensure that they have access to the best hotels on the desired date. We\u2019ve been ahead on room nights for 2016 since the beginning of the year. Now we are seeing strength in rate too. Next year we will also have considerably less disruption from capital project and we will start to see the benefits of our redevelopment project. We feel very good about the health of the industry and how we are positioned for next year. Thank you and now let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail. Greg Larson : Thank you, Ed. Now let me provide some commentary on our market. The market Southwest continues to be the strongest performing markets with a RevPAR increase of 10.2%. These markets benefited from strong transient and group business in the second quarter. Transient revenues grew 10% over last year and group revenues were up 13.5% with an increase in average rate over 7% for both segments.  San Diego, Seattle, San Francisco and Hawaii all achieved double-digit RevPAR growth in the second quarter. RevPAR for our hotels in San Diego market grew an impressive 16% beating STAR upper upscale RevPAR growth by almost 500 basis points this quarter. The Grand Hyatt Manchester benefited from having full meeting space inventory as its renovations were completed in the fourth quarter last year. This enabled our managers to book in-house group business that created compression, which drove group and transient average rates.  For our hotels in San Diego, group revenues increased 19% and transient revenues grew 12%. Strong group business facilitated the 32% increase in food and beverage revenues with a 40% increase in the more profitable banquet and catering business. Our Seattle hotels grew RevPAR 15.4%, predominantly driven by a 13% increase in average rates. This growth was driven by solid market demand from city wide and the nearby US Open, which created compression and drove ADR. Group revenues increased 16% and transient revenues increased 14%. Stronger business resulted in impressive growth in food and beverage revenues, which increased nearly 17% primarily from a 24% increase in banquet and catering revenues. San Francisco continued to outperform the portfolio with RevPAR increasing 10% this quarter. Strong transient demand and solid association group business helped the hotels and grew transient and group average rates, which were up 6.7% and 5.6% respectively, resulting in transient revenues of over 9% and group revenues of 8%.  Looking at the remainder of the year, our hotels in the San Francisco market are expected to perform only slightly above our portfolio in the second half of the year, with one property that will begin its renovation in the fourth quarter and as construction at the Moscone Convention Center has negatively impacted group booking pattern. Our Hawaiian hotels generated RevPAR growth of 12.6% which exceeded STAR upper upscale RevPAR growth by 500 basis points in the second quarter. Without the USALI resort fee allocation change, the second quarter RevPAR would have been up nearly 18%. This was driven by strong group and transient demand from stable airfare and an airlift increase of 15% for last year as well as the completion of the renovation at the Fairmont Kea Lani. Food and beverage revenues increased 27% this quarter from solid increases in both banquet and catering and outlet sales. Transient and group revenues were equally strong, both increased over 20% for the quarter. As strong as Hawaii was in the first half of the year, we expect our hotels in Hawaii to underperform the portfolio in the second half of the year due to weaker city wide events and a decrease for Japanese travelers. Our Atlanta property increased RevPAR by 12.6%, driven by an occupancy increase of 5 percentage points in addition to average rate growth of 5.5%. Our hotels in Atlanta exceeded the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR growth by 220 basis points. The room renovation at the Westin Buckhead last year contributed to the market's outperformance this quarter. Food and beverage revenues were up 15%, driven by banquet increases from solid group room nights at the Buckhead hotel. In part, due to the renovations to the Westin Buckhead and Grand Hyatt Buckhead that were completed in the third quarter of last year, we expect Atlanta property to outperform the portfolio in the second half of this year. Our hotels in the DC market increased RevPAR 6.8% with excellent average rate growth of 8% as properties shifted from lower rated transient business to higher rated group segment. Group room nights increased 12%, while transient room nights fell 11%. Both group and transient average rates increased by 6.7% and 10.8% respectively, resulting in group revenue growth of 19%, offsetting a transient revenue decline of 2%.  The hotels in DC underperformed the STAR upper upscale market result due to the renovation of three major hotels during the quarter. These renovations were completed in the second quarter. The third quarter for DC will be challenging as certain city wides will not repeat in this quarter as well as the shift of the holiday into September this year. However, fourth quarter looks good as the property start to benefit from the renovations that began in December of last year and there will be no mid-term elections this year.  Unfortunately RevPAR growth in New York, Houston and Calgary continued to be constrained in the second quarter due to a combination of increased supply, renovation and oil issues. All these markets experienced declines in RevPAR for the quarter. Our initial expectation was for RevPAR growth in New York to turn slightly positive in the second quarter and that did not transpire. However, although RevPAR declined 1.5% in the quarter, it is worth noting the positive momentum throughout the quarter as RevPAR sequentially improved each month with June resulting in positive RevPAR growth of 3.3%. This was a positive sign. Having said that, the ability to increase rates has been hindered by supply that continues to negatively impact the New York market as well as a decrease in demand from international travelers due to the strength in the U.S. dollar. Based on these issues, we have decreased our forecast for the remainder of the year, so we are still predicting slightly positive RevPAR in the second half due to easier comps, the completion of the renovations at the Newark Airport Marriott and a better group booking pace in the second half of the year when compared to first half of the year. In Houston, while the renovation at the JW Houston was completed in April, RevPAR at our hotels in this market declined 8.4%. One major reason was the flooding that occurred in Houston in May. In addition, declines related to the energy in this industry continue to negatively impact the Houston market. Further, Middle Eastern medical patient business declined at the St. Regis which affected average rate in the quarter. We should also note that the Medical Center Marriott will undergo a rooms renovation beginning in September which will cause some disruption.  Finally, our Calgary Marriott had a RevPAR decline of 40% for the second quarter, mainly due to the continued extensive renovation at the hotel that was completed at June and also partially impacted by declining energy business as a result of falling oil prices. The decline in energy business will continue to impact our Calgary hotel for the remainder of the year. Third quarter is expected to improve from second quarter levels that will continue to be challenged by oil issues. However, results for the fourth quarter should significantly improve to be positive as comparable results become easier due to the renovations that began in November of last year. Shifting to our European joint venture, our assets in Europe had an outstanding quarter with constant euro RevPAR increase of 5.3%, resulting from a 5.5% increase in average rates. Increase was driven by strong transient business. Transient revenues increased 10%, primarily from a 9.5% increase in average rates. Group revenues decreased 1.8% as occupancy decreased 5%, but it is important to note that average rates increased 3.5%. Eight of the 18 European joint venture hotels achieved RevPAR results in excess of 9% in the second quarter. With major events in Venice and Milan, our properties in these markets had RevPAR growth of 32% and 16% respectively for the quarter. Our outlook for the European assets remains encouraging even with the issues surrounding Greece and a potential exit from the euro zone. EVP performance across the region is improving, most notably in Spain and the Netherlands. Since our last call, Spain's GDP forecast increased 50 basis points to 3% and the Netherlands forecast increased 40 basis points to 2%. Consumer confidence in these countries has been on the rise and tourism has been a large contributor to Spain's economic recovery. International travel demand has been strong into European countries with a weakened euro. Year-to-date U.S. travel into our hotels in Europe has increased approximately 5%, but the third quarter figure is looking stronger. This goes well for the band of our European portfolio for the remaining summer months. Moving to our forecast for the rest of the year, we expect RevPAR to accelerate in the second half of this year with fourth quarter performance significantly exceeding our third quarter performance. As many of you are aware, third quarter last year was our best performing quarter and as a result, it will provide for a difficult comp for the upcoming third quarter; coupled that with the negative calendar impact from the later Labor Day, and the shifting of the Jewish holidays; we expect slower RevPAR growth in the third quarter than the first half of this year. Inversely, because of the calendar shift and easier comp than last year\u2019s fourth quarter, we expect the fourth quarter will be the strongest performing quarter of the year. As a result, we expect third quarter to generate only 45% of the remaining EBITDA for the year.  During the second quarter, we repurchased 6.55 million shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of 131 million. We have 369 million of repurchase capacity under the program. With regards to dividend, we paid a regular second quarter dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of approximately 4% on the current stock price. Given our strong extended operating outlook and significant amount of free cash flow, we are committed to sustaining a meaningful dividend. In summary, we feel good about the industry fundamentals and our results. Our domestic portfolio performance has been solid and the positive pace of the industry upper upscale RevPAR results and we expect our comparable RevPAR to accelerate in the second half of the year. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : I wanted to ask you just on the portfolio sales, I think you said you have a total of 200 million to 350 million of international and domestic properties currently being marketed. What are your thoughts around acquisitions I guess at this point? And kind of what kind of markets would you be primarily focused on? Ed Walter : Smedes, I think we are -- I want to correct what you said about the sales, we have a number of international sales that are on the market now. We\u2019re expecting to put a lot of domestic properties on the market more in the fall, which is why the closings on that are going to be a bit delayed. I think on the acquisition side, we are looking at opportunities that would be in markets where we\u2019re underrepresented some of the West Coast market, especially around say LA or in Seattle are markets we might still be trying to buy and certain markets in South Florida too. I think we\u2019re being provided reasons including where our stock price sits in order to move forward with an acquisition, it needs to make sense in the context of an alternative of buying our stock back and so I wouldn\u2019t put us in the aggressive path in terms of acquisitions, but whether the right opportunity to create value we\u2019d like -- well, we'll look to take advantage of it. Smedes Rose : And I just wanted to ask you maybe just kind of bigger picture sort of I guess strategy. I mean you guys are always trying to sort of I think recycle the bottom kind of tier of your assets. Would you ever think about maybe pulling that forward and possibly spinning out kind of a subset or carving out or potentially selling to another REIT to whom those kinds of asset might be attractive or to kind of just overall improve the quality of your portfolio more quickly rather than over a period of years? Ed Walter : No, I think certainly that is a thought that we\u2019ve looked at repeatedly over the course of the last probably 18 to 24 months. I think probably the more efficient execution in the long run would be a sale as oppose to a spin out. I think there is a spin out, well it looks good on paper, you really got to be thoughtful about the kind of company that you\u2019re creating and making certain that that company has a [indiscernible] on its own or you\u2019re not going to get the valuation that you might think you get. So if there are opportunities to sell whether it was to other REITs or other parties in scale, we would certainly be open to that. Again I think we found so far, every time we have tested some of those theories about doing a larger sale, the reality is we've come back to the fact that the best way to maximize pricing is one-off transactions that are heavily marketed. Operator : And next we\u2019ll here from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Anthony Powell : On the group demand, how is it in the quarter for the quarter group booking pace in the second quarter and how do you expect that to trend over the rest of the year? Ed Walter : We were modestly down in the quarter for the quarter because we had started the quarter in such a strong position. I would say as we look towards the end of the year, I think we'd probably for the third quarter I would imagine that we would -- we might trend just a touch. Fourth quarter, I would expect to see that we\u2019ll see more bookings based on the trending that we\u2019ve been seeing which is that we\u2019re booking more as you look at least a quarter out, we\u2019ve been booking more in those quarters for the last three quarters in a row right now. I think what we are experiencing here which is a good think -- and I think we've had this confirmed by all of our operators is that corporations are starting -- recognizing that hotels especially hotels that can accommodate groups running at high occupancies and are getting increasingly filled up. And so consequently, we are seeing better bookings as we look outwards for the second half of \u201915 or \u201916 even for \u201917 as company start to realize that they need to lock in the spaces that they want for the events that they want to have in order to make it certain that they are getting the right date in the right hotel, so I think that\u2019s a very favorable trend. Greg Larson : I agree with that, the long-term trends are good, but I would also say that even the short term trends the bookings in the quarter for the entire year for 2015 if you look at that way, the volume was up 13.5% and the average rate book it was up approximately 4.5%. Anthony Powell : And switching gears I guess to some of your franchising activity, you completed a number of these transactions this year and you have some more to go. Could you just broadly discuss the economics of these deals? Are you paying lower fees? Have you had more control over the asset or how are you looking broadly at this going more towards a franchise and third-party operator model? Ed Walter : I think what we\u2019re finding, there is a variety of different situations that we've had this year, so in some cases it just moved. We may or may not be changing the brand and may or may not be creating a different type of a hotel by become -- looking to be something like what we\u2019re doing at the Logan or at the Canby, so there is no one great story, but I think broadly speaking what we\u2019re finding as we evaluate these opportunities to convert to a franchise operator and a little bit more of the local market focus on the marketing side. So we are expecting in each instance to varying degrees to see a better revenue blocking. And in most cases, this is because these hotels are less dependent on group business and a little bit more focused on corporate transient. And then we\u2019re definitely seeing a leaner expense model which is lean enough or more lean than our existing model enough to offset the slight increase in fees that we incur in some instances when we convert from a managed to a franchise model. So the bottom-line is in each instance like we\u2019re making the switch, we are ending up with what we expect to be an improved NOI once the new operator have had an opportunity to come into the hotel and for operations to stabilize. Operator : And next we\u2019ll here from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Anto Savarirajan : This is Anto Savarirajan for Steve Kent. You periodically review your exposure to different markets. Understand your view that you would like to have your footprint concentrated in the major markets. But given current trends, would you say you are overweight in a few markets that you would like to move out off and I mean New York City we understand the longer term view there, but is there a view that you are overweight in the market and would like to trim exposure in maybe few of those markets? And the second question, you did mentioned that New York, you have towed down your expectations for the back half of the year, when we look through to 2016 and 2017, how are you thinking about the ability to get back pricing as the supply pipeline accelerates? And are there things that we are missing that perhaps you have a better view off? Ed Walter : Well, I don't know that I necessarily know everything that you know, so it may be hard for me to figure out what you're missing. But I can certainly understand the thrust of your question. As we look certainly New York's been a challenging market and while we expected to be stronger in the second half of the year in terms of 2015, it has been a challenging market for us too. As we look at next year, I would agree with your point that supply look to be increasing next year. I would note that as we all look at those statistics is that at least as we -- based on the numbers that we\u2019ve look at, it tends to be a consistent over prediction a year out of the supply that's going to be delivered in New York and then what it has actually delivered is less. I can\u2019t assure you that that trend will happen in 2016, but we have seen that trend happen in the last two years or three years. Having said that I think that supply will be the concern again next year. The thing that could offset that would be stronger predicted growth in the U.S. in general in terms of economic growth and investment and to the extent that that also would perhaps benefit in terms of additional activity in the financial sector that would clearly be a plus for New York. International travel has been a big benefit to New York. I think this year is probably a bit of a drag on New York. This is one of the reasons why we've seen some weaker performance there. I can\u2019t predict what happens with currencies for 2016, but if the delta and the change in currency with the dollar relative to the oil and some other things would perhaps potentially be different next year than it has been this year where the increase in the dollar's value is not as great. That could vote favorably for New York and these trips that were postponed from 2015 happen in 2016.  I'd say the other thing that I would note is that as we look at the booking pace for next year at least as it relates to our portfolios, we were looking at a considerably down booking pace in 2015, we are looking at essentially a flat booking pace at this point for 2016, which again is certainly trending in a better direction than where it was. As it relates to our exposure in New York, I think we\u2019re probably a little over allocated to New York. Having said that I think we\u2019re looking seriously at marketing one of our assets and there will probably be -- I think any sale that we would do in New York would be certainly contingent on getting a very attractive price. We do view the markets in the long run as an important market to be invested in and it's not easy for us to find assets that we like in the market, so we would want to be thoughtful about exiting one of our hotels, but if we can attract the right size, we would be open to consummating a transaction. Greg Larson : And Anto, keep in mind based on obviously our acquisition this year the small disposition that we have this year in New York and actually the underperformance of New York this year, if you look at New York as a percentage of our EBITDA at the end of this year, it's going to be closer to 12%. Anto Savarirajan : And you spoke of the Phoenician a very large asset. Not a lot of people would have the wherewithal to do such a transaction, Host can. When you look at your opportunity set, do you lean one way or the other where you find that you have an edge with some of these larger transactions compared to some of the other opportunities? And again, would Host at some point think about adding on a select service portfolio, given the popularity it seems to be enjoying now? Ed Walter : I'm sorry, didn\u2019t hear, what type of portfolio? Anto Savarirajan : Select service hotels. Ed Walter : Select service, I would say that to your first point, we certainly recognize that on larger transactions because of our scale and because of our excess capitals that we have an ability to buy those and other and maybe in environment where it's a little less competition than what we might see in other properties, that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re just going to focus on those opportunities, but it is something we certainly recognize as we look at different acquisitions. In terms of adding a select service portfolio, I think I would -- that we would be comfortable on adding select service assets. There is no reason why you could do or purchase a portfolio of those assets, but that would really be driven far more by where those assets were located and what the growth prospects were for those assets located and what the growth prospects were for those assets as opposed to making a strategic movement to adding select service per say. Operator : And next we will hear from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Can you just help us bridge your revised 2015 EBITDA guidance? I think you cut the low end by $10 million, cut the high end by $25 million. You obviously cut the high end of your RevPAR guidance and then you also named a number of other kind of drivers. But can you just like maybe quantify each one of them if you could? That would be very helpful. Thank you. Greg Larson : Yes. I think the simple way to do this really is that if you look in terms at the midpoint where we talked about $17.5 million decline, look just a hair over 5 of that is attributable to that the delta between the EBITDA generated by the Phoenician and the EBITDA that's lost by the asset delta we have consummated already this year. As you look at the other three sources that we identified for the reason why the EBITDA declined, it's pretty much an even allocation across those three items. Thomas Allen : And then just as a follow up. Can you just help us with The Phoenician seasonality? I believe that's a very seasonal property where you actually lose money during the summer, but could you just help us think about it? Greg Larson : Yes. I'd say that you are right in your assessment of the property, it's probably a desperate season during the course of the summer and it probably generates about two-third's, actually it probably generates about three quarters of its profit during the first five months of the year and about one quarter of its profit over the remaining seven months of the year. Operator : And next we will hear from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : You mentioned about the group outlook getting a little tighter, people scrambling to get rooms forward out. Are you seeing any interest in moving to secondary markets and out of these high occupancy gateway markets? Ed Walter : We don\u2019t have a lot of hotels in those secondary markets necessarily. So it'd be probably be a little bit -- we probably don\u2019t have great way to quantify that, but I think one of the reasons why you're seeing the secondary markets at some of the lower price points, begin to perform better is because they have -- they run at lower occupancies and then they have had an office, so they have more room to take on groups and things like that. So I think that's why when you look at what -- as broadly across the industry, the secondary markets have for about last 12 months had bigger occupancy gains and I think it's in part because of what you identified. Greg Larson : It's certainly helping out Atlanta for instance, that's right. Wes Golladay : And then when we look at New York, we always hear about the crisis of confidence in that market. I was just wondering how much of that do you think that was actually potentially mix shift is getting more of the lower rated leisure customers in the market. Just curious about how the business transient customer is in that market? Are you able to have pricing power with that customer? Greg Larson : I would say that off the markets across the country, New York is one of those ones where you have the least pricing power right now. I think that's frankly part of the problem that we have all been grappling with. Now you got to remember when you look at New York is that the first quarter you had a very difficult comp that related back to the Super Bowl. And the first quarter of New York has always tends to be the quarter where New York runs at lower occupancy levels compared to its overall stabilized level of occupancy for the year. So in the environment where you have some increase in new supply slightly demand than what we have experienced in the prior year leaving out the Super Bowl equation, you ended up with a fairly competitive environment, even despite the factors that markets landed at a very high overall occupancy level. We do think that as you work your way into the fourth quarter that scenario starts to look a little bit more effective because the market runs at even higher occupancy levels in fourth quarter than it does the rest of the year. Having said that, I think we are still finding that it's not easy to push rates especially for transient business. Operator : And we will now hear from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Two questions; one is you may have said this in your introductory comments and I missed it, but you mentioned the group bookings were up for 2016. But I don't think you gave the same, didn't give the percentage numbers the way you did for second half. So I wonder if you could just be a little more specific on group bookings for 2016? Ed Walter : Yes. Robin at this point, it looks like our group bookings for \u201916 are trending up close to 6% from a revenue perspective. Robin Farley : Okay. And then the construction disruption, previously you guys had quantified that as being 25 million for the full year. Is that, there wasn\u2019t a reference to that figure in today\u2019s release. I America just wondering if you felt that was still the best way to quantify it. Ed Walter : Okay. Now remember Robin that number refers to the disruption that we were expecting to see in our non-comparable hotels as opposed to the comparable ones. So that number is capturing the delta that we are experiencing year over year in say the Ritz Carlson in Phoenix or the Four Seasons in Philadelphia, the Axiom in San Francisco. Those hotels where they\u2019re being closed for part of the year or in the case of the San Diego Marquis where we eliminated a major chunk of our meeting space in order to build the new ballroom. I would say that number had trended up just and that is really what part of what we were referring to in our comment about the increased loss in effect because of the severance and weaker operations at the Ritz Carlson and the Four Seasons in the spring. But in the bottom-line those Hotels was simply that with as the hotels were focusing -- essentially as the management teams and employees focusing more on closing and what they were going to do next, and we overestimated the profits that we thought we would generate during next period. We have been conservative but it just turned out to be weaker. The good news is with that problem has no impact on what happens with the hotel next year. Greg Larson : Correct. Obviously increased severance cost this year, obviously we\u2019ll not impact next year. Robin Farley : Okay. That is great, thanks. And then just a quick clarification on the group comments for 2016, the revenue up close to 6%. What was specifically the Q2 bookings in Q2 for 2016, the change? Ed Walter : Robin, I don\u2019t have those handy. Robin Farley : Okay, no problem. Thank you. I can get that. Ed Walter : The bottom line though is the same trend that we had otherwise been seeing was that we were our situation in \u201916 and in \u201917 during the course for the second quarter. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to the question from Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity. Ryan Meliker : I just had a couple of follow-ups for you, just to piggyback off what Smedes was asking earlier with the potential to sell incremental assets. You guys are obviously doing a lot of things that are creating value whether it be ticking off assets to sell one by one, or converting to third-party operations, or buying back stock at lower levels, which all make sense but none of it seems to move the needle that much given your scale. You mentioned the willingness potentially to do a larger portfolio transaction. Obviously you guys have historically trimmed the portfolio on the bottom end. But if you were going to do a larger portfolio transaction I guess how do you guys think about your portfolio in terms of the size that you might be willing to dispose of given the right opportunity in the market? Ed Walter : Ryan I think that\u2019s a hard question to answer any abstract. And I wouldn't want to leave people with the sense that we think we need to sell a large number of our assets. We think we have a very strong portfolio at this point and we\u2019re very happy with how the bulk of it is performing. So I think it really comes down to, we\u2019re going to continue to, as you described, we\u2019re going to sell if the weaker assets within the portfolio. And as we continue to do this over the course for the last number of years, the quality of what we\u2019re seeing continue to improve. But I wouldn\u2019t want to start to speculate on what a larger transaction might look like, because I wouldn\u2019t want to raise the expectations that something like that was likely. Ryan Meliker : Okay, that is fair enough. And then just the second question I had was, Greg, you had mentioned that New York started to turn in June but you are still somewhat wary about New York because of slowing international travel. We've heard from others that they haven't seen any slowing in international travel. I know the airline data is lagging, but that is not showing any slowing in terms of the in-planements and de-planements for travel abroad. Is this specific to data that you're getting from your hotels associated with international bookings or is there some other data source; I guess what gives you confidence that you are seeing a slowing in international travel to New York? Ed Walter : I think the airlines added that we are seeing nationwide is suggesting that travel from Europe is off a bit, and specific data that we\u2019ve got in for our individual hotels in the market has suggested that we have seen weaker travels from Europe over the course of the first half of this year. Now as you then look at -- I would point out that on Europe, a lot of the analysis on Europe has been EU currency countries are down in terms of travel. The UK where the currency has been stronger and travel from Switzerland which I think has been much smaller piece of it, has actually been up a bit. But we\u2019ve also seen, I think in some of our assets we have seen that travel from Asia has offset this decline in EU and in other hotels we have not seen that I think that in a lot of cases this has to do with for travel booking that the individual hotels have gone after, it has to do with their group pattern. So it is tricky to draw broad conclusions. We\u2019ve done the best we could to interpret sort of variety of different data points to give you a sense that when we look at it overall we feel as if international travels been off slightly from New York this year. Ryan Meliker : And then just one last follow-up on New York. It sounds like sequentially things got much better in June. We heard from one of the smaller hotel REITs that their New York in July was up 7%. Are you seeing continued sequential improvement? I am not asking for guidance or detail, but just are you seeing that trend that you saw in June persist well into July? Ed Walter : We look at the first few weeks of July; I say we\u2019re roughly in line with what we saw in June. I want to say we\u2019ve seen acceleration. But I think we\u2019re still comfortably positive. So hopefully that will continue for this week and to the rest of the summer. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move to a question from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Jeff Donnelly : Just sticking with New York, I mean the supply/demand outlook there for 2015 and 2016 certainly seems challenging. I think it has been talked about quite a bit. And it could cause some maybe rockiness in cash flows. I am curious, Ed, what is your perspective on the direction of asset prices in New York in light of that environment? Because we certainly had robust prices; it seems to have disconnected a little bit from the operating cash flows. Do you expect that to sort of reconnect one way or another? Ed Walter : Imagine that the cap rates will say low Jeff, just because there is no inherent attraction to the market, but I would say that I would, is that one of the things that I think we\u2019re going to find out over the course of the fall, with our intention to move forward in marketing and asset is to get a sense of exactly how strong the market would be. A lot of the activity that you've seen so far as the more attractive prices has been international buyers. I think they are going to continue to be attracted to the market, because they have perhaps a longer perspective in terms of what\u2019s going about the attractiveness in the New York market and they may have different motivations in terms of the returns that they are trying to achieve with their capital. So overall I would expect that at least when looked at in the context of cap rates then New York will continue to be one of the more attractively priced markets. One of the issue will be what the NOI is that that cap rate is going to be applied to. Jeff Donnelly : And if it will be -- I am thinking, my recollection is that you guys couldn't take action on it until sometime in early second quarter maybe of next year. Are you contemplating bringing it to market in advance of that? Will the closing sort of be well-timed? Or do you feel you need to wait until you are clear to sell that you can begin marketing? Ed Walter : I would say that we are not looking at one of our two largest assets in terms of marketing we are looking at one of our more mid-sized assets, that we think has a more unique story that could be successful -- successfully executed in today's market there. Jeff Donnelly : And just maybe I'll switch gears, and correct me if I am wrong. I thought your original 2015 guidance had no assumption for net investment activity. So is the reason that the year-to-date net investment that we have seen of about $260 million is impacting your 2015 guidance simply just a timing issue? In effect the seasonal contribution of The Phoenician as you mentioned in the second half just isn't enough to offset what is probably a pretty high cap rate on the non-core asset sales? Ed Walter : I would say that it's a high cap rate on a non-core sales just to make that a general point there. We have been selling -- that assets that we have sold when you take into account the asset and then you -- that might be associated which is I think only significant in the phase of one of the sales. We have been getting very attractive cap rate and this fixes for those deals. It is what you survive which is fireline as it's in the desert, you make your money in the first part of the year. And you don\u2019t make that much in the last seven months of the year. The assets that we sold -- you think about Boston and some of those other markets, even Chicago tend to be stronger in the summer and in the fall and tend to be relatively weak in the winter and in the very early spring. So we just ended up in the scenario when you look at it for '15 is we ended up buying an asset that's strongest performance has been in the period of time before we acquired it. And the assets that we were selling not to the same degree, but to some degree have a stronger second half of the year than the first half which is why the net delta is negative this year, but on a pro forma basis would be positive and certainly we would be expecting when we look at it in the context of 2016, we are confident we have added to EBITDA of 2016 virtue of our assets. Operator : And now we will move on to a question from Ian Weissman with Credit Suisse. Ian Weissman : Yes. Good morning. Just shifting gears a little bit on Houston. Clearly it came in weaker than you had anticipated. I guess my question is, is the business drop-off in that market just companies delaying business or you are seeing cancellations? Greg Larson : I think it's a little bit of both Ian. And as I mentioned we also had some other issues in the quarter whether it is disruption or the flooding that I talked about. I think when we look out into the second half of the year, certainly Houston was better than the RevPAR decline that we announced this morning for the second quarter. But having said that, I think when we look at our second half forecast today for Houston, it's slightly lower than what we were predicting a quarter ago for Houston. Ian Weissman : Your expectations for Houston I mean today Shell announced they are laying off 6,500 people and 1,000 of those will be felt in the Houston marketplace. Is your expectations for Houston taking into account a worse economic environment and more job layoffs or are you feeling like your outlook is on sort of steady as you goes, business operations in that market? Greg Larson : Right. We try to take into account all those factors. The negative factors that you just mentioned, the group booking pace actually the third quarter is actually quite weak, the flip side is that the group bookings phase in the fourth quarter in Houston is extremely strong. And so we are trying to take into account all those things including the fact that some of our disruption will be behind at this time. Ian Weissman : Okay. Thank you very much. Greg Larson : Yes, I think trying to keep in mind, Ian, is that Houston is really about 2.5% to 3% of our -- So obviously pretty likely move for us. Operator : And now we will hear from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Shaun Kelley : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So I just wanted to talk a little bit more about some of the international hotels in the portfolio. So thinking about what we are seeing out of Brazil and Canada which have been obviously particularly weak. A question sort of is as you look forward Ed, and you are starting to focus a little bit more on refranchising or franchising away from managing in some of the US markets, do you think that some of these smaller international markets are starting to become bigger distractions and those are areas where you could look to prune the portfolio a little bit or are these still I think part and parcel to the Host strategy at this point? Greg Larson : No I think we are. I would say that we have a disproportionate number of international hotels in the market right now. And some of that is a I say that part of that's strategic and part of that is also tactical from a standpoint that we look across the portfolio, there are five different metrics that we use in purchase deciding what asset to sale. These were assets there moved up on the listing - I would say that in terms of what's happening in real and what's happening in Calgary and the back of the growth international RevPAR down significantly. The Calgary has been a challenging room renovate, but long-term it's been a good market for us. Short-term it's suffering both for the renovation and long-term it\u2019s been a good market for us, short permit suffering both from the renovation and then some of the same issues that exist in Houston, because that\u2019s also, that\u2019s probably and it\u2019s equivalent of the Houston market. But certainly as a general asset, but I wouldn\u2019t see that as a distraction. In the case of the real assets we continued to understand what's happening in that market from capital flows and things like that. We know we got a strong year probably next year with the Olympic, I think if we saw the right opportunity to execute to sale, we would be open to that. But we also want to be thoughtful about capturing good prices there too. Shaun Kelley : Thanks, Ed, I think it is really clear. And just to be, just to go back to the international or the marketing of the hotels that you talked about, because I missed some of the upfront comments. Just to be clear, included in any of the international sales are you a net seller in Europe or are you actually -- is nothing in I guess the JV contemplated there? Ed Walter : I would say, we expect to be a net seller in Europe this year. We are still -- that is the market that we are still interest in acquiring. So that is what we are certainly looking aggressively there. But I would say looking in our overall level of activity and handicapping that, I would say that we have already sold one asset there. We got very good pricing on that. And I think we\u2019re more likely to be, we\u2019ll be in net seller in Europe this year more likely than a net buyer. Operator : And now we\u2019ll move to question from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Chris Woronka : Just one for me. Can you guys maybe talk a little bit about as you look out to next year and I\u2019m really not asking for guidance? But on the renovations, which obviously have had kind of a disproportionate impact for you this year, how much comfort do you have that those, that the impact will kind of naturally reverse in terms of whether it is group bookings at some hotels or your discussions with the corporate room buyers or anything like that? Ed Walter : Chris, as it relates, as we talk about those non-comp hotels which is where the bulk of the problem this year, the one that have been close. We\u2019re certainly based on the initial results we\u2019re seeing, We feel good about how those properties will perform next year. But having said that, but also say that we\u2019re in the midst of construction; our management company has just taken over. All of those hotels tend to be a little bit more transient than group dominated, I am thinking more specifically of the one in San Francisco as well as both Phoenix and the Philly assets. So I don\u2019t know that we have a lot of good indicators right now other than our overall underwriting of how those assets is performing in those market. We should have better insight into that as we get into the third quarter fall, and certainly as we get into the next year\u2019s first fall, only from the standpoint, but that point the operators will be in place, the product will start to be more visible in the market and we\u2019ll have a better sense of the bookings. But we\u2019re expecting across the board in those hotels, but not only recapture the loss EBITDA from this year, but also to be adding meaningfully to EBITDA over the course with 16 and 17. So I think that I\u2019m certainly confident that we\u2019ll recapture most of the, all of a lots EBITDA next year. And then the real question is how much is that expect to growth and we have been 16 versus 17. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Walter for any additional or closing remarks. Ed Walter : Well, thank you all for joining us on the call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our second quarter results and outlook with you. We look forward to providing you with more insight in the remainder of 2015 and third quarter call in the fall. Have a great day. Enjoy the rest of the summer. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We do thank you all for your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to your host, to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Gee Lingberg : Thanks, Coleen. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts third quarter 2015 earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed. And we're not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and on our website at hosthotels.com. With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our second quarter results, and then will describe the current operating environment as well as the company's outlook for 2015. Greg will then provide greater detail on our second quarter performance by markets. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now here is Ed. A - Edward Walter : Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a solid quarter and are pleased to be realizing some of the benefits of our proactive portfolio management strategy. While it's been an interesting last three months in the lodging space, we believe the reaction that's expressed through the equity markets has been over exaggerated, and we are intending to exploit that reaction both now and into 2016. But first, let's review our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $323 million for the quarter and $1.66 billion year-to-date, reflecting a year-to-date increase of 1.5% as compared to the first nine months of 2014. Our adjusted FFO was $0.34 per share for the third quarter and $1.15 year-to-date, reflecting a 4.5% increase over the first nine months of last year. Both earnings measures beat consensus estimates for the quarter. These results were driven by several factors. We had expected weaker results because of the impact of the well-documented calendar changes, the late Labor Day holiday and earlier midweek timing of the Jewish holiday, which drove association business into the fourth quarter and generally limited group business overall in September. This proved correct, as our domestic group revenues looked flat for the quarter, as a roughly 2% increase in rate was offset by a 2% decline in demand. While group business at our international hotels was up significantly in terms of demand, gains were more than offset by a decline in rates, as our Rio Hotel had been able to charge very high rates during the World Cup in 2014. Overall, we saw group revenues decline by slightly more than 1% in the quarter compared to the same period last year. At our domestic hotels, we look to replace the deferred group demand with additional transient guests. We benefited from a 4.5% increase in demand from our top-rated segments, which represented nearly a half of our overall transient business. Overall transient demand was strong in both July and September, up more than 4% in each month. Unfortunately, as we mentioned in our September release, transient demand in August was weak, which dragged our quarterly increase in transient demand down to approximately 2%. Weakness in international travel likely contributed to our challenges in August. While international air arrivals have continued to increase, the rate of growth slowed in the third quarter and spending increases were limited. This may suggest the trips have become shorter, leading to a decline in room night demand. Arrivals from China, South Korea, and the UK continue to grow. We saw declines in travel from France and Japan. Overall, we saw a reduction in international demand in the 5% to 10% range, which represents about 4/10 of a percent occupancy, with slightly more impact on the East Coast versus the West Coast. Our positive mix shift helped drive an overall transient rate increase of 2.5% for the quarter, resulting in transient revenue increase of 4.5%. This, in turn, led to RevPAR for the quarter in constant currency increasing by 2.8% or 3% as adjusted for the USALI change in reporting Resort fees. Comparable food and beverage revenues grew 6.5% in the quarter or approximately 3.7% on a USALI-adjusted basis. Banquet and AV revenue increased by 8.8%. As several groups increased spending above contract minimums, we benefited from newly-created meeting space, and the short-term bookings included heavy F&B spend. Savings in food costs helped drive very favorable flow-through, as the food and beverage profit improved by approximately 20%. Other revenues declined by 11% in the quarter, due to the timing of insurance claim proceeds related to business interruption from Hurricane Sandy, which we received in Q3 of 2014. Adjusted for that one-time benefit, other revenues increased by 1%. Overall, total comparable revenue growth was 2.1% for the quarter and 3.1% year-to-date. Comparable hotel EBITDA margins declined 55 basis points for the quarter and are up 10 basis points year-to-date. The negative margin growth was impacted by a combination of the USALI-mandated changes and by the Sandy business interruption proceeds, which reduced margins by 35 basis points. I will now take a few minutes to provide an update on several of our activities in the context of our near-term strategy for the company. As indicated in our September 28 press release, given that we did not believe we could replicate the success of our initial investments in the Asia-Pacific region, we have made the decision to exit Australia and New Zealand, and ultimately close our office in Singapore. As we announced this morning, we have sold our Four Points Perth Hotel, which we owned in a joint venture with GIC, as well as two hotels which are wholly-owned in Auckland, the Auckland Novatel and ibis. The total price for these sales equals $104 million. Four of our remaining hotels are effectively on the market now, and we expect that the remaining two hotels will be placed on the market at some point next year. With respect to Europe, this morning we announced that our joint venture had sold eight of its 18 hotels, representing 2,300 rooms for \u20ac420 million, or roughly $464 million. While we continue to be interested in investing in Europe, we felt that the current market offered an attractive exit point for a portion of our portfolio, which had an average RevPAR of \u20ac113. After completing this transaction, our remaining EU portfolio generates an average RevPAR of \u20ac164 or more than $180, which is well more than double the average RevPAR for the EU market. Our remaining portfolio includes iconic assets such as the Westin Palace in Madrid and the Hotel Arts in Barcelona. These sales represent $207 million of approximately $300 million of proceeds identified in our last press release. There is one additional international sale we had anticipated closing this year, which has been delayed by regulatory issues. As a result, the timing of that closing is less certain. Despite the fact that low stock prices have forced many REITs to the sidelines in terms of acquisitions, the feedback we have received from the brokerage community, and have experienced from our own marketing efforts, is that international investors and domestic private investors are still seeking new acquisitions, albeit in a targeted manner. We have been the most active seller in the REIT space for the last four years, having now completed north of $2 billion in sales. We continue to see opportunities to complete sales at attractive prices, and are currently marketing approximately $1 billion worth of assets. These assets include the Asia-Pacific hotels I just mentioned, one key asset located in New York, as well as hotels located in several suburban US markets that have an average RevPAR of less than $135. In addition to these planned sales, we have identified approximately $1 billion in incremental hotels that we can bring to market in 2016, assuming that transaction pricing remains attractive. The majority of these assets are located in suburban or secondary markets, and have an average RevPAR below 120. While there can be no assurances that we will complete all of the contemplated sales of pricing we would deem acceptable, our goal continues to be to reduce our exposure to these noncore assets and markets, allowing our domestic portfolio to be targeted primarily towards urban assets located in major markets, plus a collection of iconic resorts. Our long-term goal is to continue to grow the Company and expand our presence in attractive markets. However, as long as the equity markets continue to value our company at a meaningful discount to the private market value of our assets, we are unlikely to invest the proceeds of completed sales into new acquisitions. Instead, because of the inherent gains stemming from these sales, which could average 50% of our expected sale prices, we will likely use proceeds first to pay dividends, and then for other corporate purposes, including repaying debt to maintain appropriate leverage levels and for repurchasing stock. As is evidenced by our purchase of $400 million of Host stock over the last six months, we believe our stock is a very attractive investment. As outlined in our press release this morning, our Board has authorized an incremental $500 million repurchase program, which means we currently have $600 million of total repurchase capacity. The timing for implementation of this program and any subsequent expansions will depend on our operating outlook, the pace of our asset sales, other potential investment options, including ROI CapEx, and our stock price. At this point, we believe that the Company's common stock is the most compelling investment opportunity available to us today, and we look forward to deploying more of our capital for accretive value-enhancing share repurchases. In addition to these capital allocation activities, our other primary effort is to reap the benefits of the investments that we have been making in our existing portfolio over the course of 2015. As we noted earlier in the year, we have closed three hotels to complete major redevelopments : The Axiom in San Francisco, The Logan in Philadelphia, and The Camby in Phoenix. These three projects should complete construction around the end of the year or in early January. In 2015, these three assets are expected to generate EBITDA of negative $4 million. While we are still refining our budgets for 2016, we expect these projects will generate approximately $20 million to $22 million of EBITDA with additional strong growth expected in 2017. We also expect to benefit from the more disruptive than normal room, meeting space, and lobby renovations we have completed in 2015. To summarize, we intend to narrow the markets where we invest and operate, further reduce our exposure to nonprime suburban airport and secondary markets, benefit from the capital investments we have made in our portfolio, and most importantly, close the valuation gap between our public market value versus the inherent value of our assets through a combination of asset sales at private market values, with capital returned to shareholders through dividends and through stock repurchases. As we noted in the press release we have already returned more than $1 billion to shareholders in 2015. We expect to add to this total. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2015, we continue to expect solid results in the fourth quarter. Booking activity in the third quarter was very positive, increasing 2.7% over the same period in the prior year. Our group booking pace for the fourth quarter is ahead of last year by more than 3% and rate is up by more than 2%, indicating that booked revenues are up approximately 5.5%. Although transient activity has moderated to some degree compared to our expectations in July, we still expect RevPAR growth in Q4 to be stronger than our year-to-date performance, leading to full-year RevPAR growth of 4% to 4.5%. While more difficult to predict, we expect to see continued strong growth in food and beverage spending in the fourth quarter, with growth ranging between 5% to 6%, driven primarily by banquet activity generated by the increasing group business. This should lead to full-year food and beverage growth of 4.5% to 5%. We expect our adjusted margin increase to be 20 to 30 basis points for the full-year. Based on these operating assumptions, our estimated adjusted EBITDA will be $1.385 billion to $1.4 billion, and our adjusted FFO will range between $1.50 and $1.52 per share. Our window into 2016 performance is limited, as we have not yet received our operating budget. That said, there are several factors we note that should favorably affect 2016 performance. Our group revenue pace for 2016 remains quite strong, well north of 6% compared to less than 1% ahead at this time in 2014. Activity in Q2 and Q3 is very strong. Only Q1 is currently demonstrating a shortfall to 2015 in rooms booked. We believe that is caused by some carryover renovation activity and the earlier Easter holiday, which will limit late March corporate and association events. Our CapEx spending next year will be lower. While we are still finalizing our capital plan for next year, we expect our maintenance CapEx to fall by approximately 10% and our overall spending to decline approximately 20%. As a result, there will still be some disruption from individual projects, but we expect our disruption overall to fall short of 2015 levels. We expect the three redevelopments I referenced earlier to provide $24 million to $26 million of lift over 2015 performance, in addition to the regular internal growth we would generate from our comparable portfolio. And despite the fact that we have been a very active seller this year, including the additional international sales we discussed today, the expected incremental EBITDA contributed from The Phoenician in 2016 will more than offset the EBITDA we earned in 2015 from the sale assets, which we will not be receiving in 2016. The net impact of those investment recycling activities in 2016 compared to 2015 is projected to be a $3 million to $5 million increase. In summary, we are pleased with our results for the third-quarter and 2015 year-to-date, especially against the backdrop of a difficult calendar shift. We look forward to a solid fourth quarter, as we continue executing our strategy to drive value and return capital to our stockholders. Now, let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail. Gregory Larson : Thank you, Ed. I'll start by providing some additional details on our comparable hotel results by market. In the third quarter, our Seattle hotels increased RevPAR by approximately 10%, exceeding the Star upper upscale market results by 750 basis points. The outperformance was driven by an 11.6% average rate gain, as our managers were able to replace low-rated group business with higher-rated transient business during the summer season. In addition, our Westin Hotel experienced strong banquet and catering business from an international delegation from China, which resulted in food and beverage growth of 18%. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we note The W Seattle will be impacted by a rooms renovation starting in December, and will likely moderate the RevPAR growth for our hotels in Seattle. Our hotels in Los Angeles also had an impressive third quarter, with a RevPAR increase of 9%, driven by average rate growth of 7.6%. Both transient and group business were solid, with revenues for both up more than 7.5%. Food and beverage revenues were also strong and increased 11.5%. The strength in the Los Angeles market is expected to continue into the fourth quarter. RevPAR for our hotels in San Francisco grew more than 6% in the third quarter, beating the Star upper upscale RevPAR growth by 230 basis points. Strong transient business contributed to this outperformance, as demand increased 7% and average rate increased 5%, resulting in total revenue growth of 13%. Looking to the fourth quarter, consistent with our previous statements, our hotels in San Francisco are expected to perform only slightly above our portfolio, with one property beginning its renovation and construction at the Moscone Convention Center, which is expected to weigh on group business. RevPAR for hotels in San Diego market grew 5.6% this quarter, driven by strong transient demand, which was offset -- some weaker group business. Transient revenues increased 9.4% and group revenues grew 1.7% in the quarter. Both transient and group average rate increased approximately 5%. Food and beverage revenues grew almost 17%, with the more profitable banquet and catering business growing 24%. This increase was driven by high catering contributions related to strong corporate group room nights at our Hyatt Manchester and Coronado Hotels. The group revenue pays for the fourth-quarter look strong, and we expect our hotels to outperform the portfolio next quarter. Moving to the East Coast, our hotels in Boston outperformed the portfolio this quarter with a RevPAR increase of 5.3%, driven entirely by an average rate growth of 5.3%. Strong group business at the Calgary Marriott and the Westin Waltham contributed to group revenue growth of over 16% in the quarter, with a 23.5% increase in the more profitable banquet and catering revenues. Total food and beverage revenues were up 18%. We expect the strength in Boston to continue into the fourth quarter. In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 4.4% for the quarter, which outperformed our portfolio but significantly underperformed our internal forecasts. Certain cancellations and citywide events that did not create the anticipated compression led to the underperformance to our expectations. Based on the strong group revenue pace for the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR performance to improve. Our hotels in the New York market had positive RevPAR growth of 1.3%, outperforming the Star upper upscale results by 90 basis points. The well-understood supply in the market, and a decrease in demand from international travelers due to the strength of the US dollar, are impacting the industry's ability to raise rates. We expect RevPAR to significantly lag the portfolio, and acknowledge that the dynamics impacting New York in 2015 will likely persist in 2016. RevPAR at our hotels in the DC market decreased 3.4% this quarter. As you may recall, last third-quarter, our DC hotels grew RevPAR by 9%, benefiting from several major citywide events. The city was unable to replace these events this quarter, and the lack of compression resulted in declines in average rates across the market. We expect RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter to strengthen, as two of our larger hotels were under renovation during the fourth quarter of last year. In addition, the group revenue pace for the fourth quarter improved and looks strong for 2016. Unfortunately, RevPAR growth in Houston and Calgary continued to be constrained in the third quarter, primarily as a result of commodity price volatility and, specifically, weakness in oil. Both of these markets experienced significant declines in RevPAR for the quarter. In Houston, RevPAR at our hotels declined nearly 10%. These declines are related to the overall slowdown in the Houston economy, mainly stemming from negative impact of a struggling energy industry. Our hotels are focused on growing group room nights to offset the transient decline caused by these poor market fundamentals. On a positive note, the group revenue pace for the fourth quarter is up almost 28%. However, even with the strong revenue pace, we continue to expect negative RevPAR for our Houston hotels in the fourth quarter. Likewise, our Canadian hotels experienced a RevPAR decline of 5% in the third quarter, primarily due to the significant decline in RevPAR at our Calgary Marriott. Our Toronto Eaton Center Marriott had strong positive RevPAR growth in the quarter. Major declines in transient occupancy related to the global oil decline in Calgary were somewhat offset by an increase in group business of 18.4%. This increase in group revenues drove the food and beverage revenue growth of 28%, with banquet and catering business increasing 38%. We anticipate energy issues to continue to negatively impact our Calgary property in the fourth quarter. Shifting to our European joint venture, our assets in Europe had an outstanding quarter, with a constant euro RevPAR increase of 9%, resulting from an increase in both rate and occupancy of 4.3% and 3.8 percentage points, respectively. The increase was driven by strong transient business as well as an increase in international travel demand with the weakened euro over the summer months. Transient revenues increased 13%, primarily as a result of 9% increase in average rates. International travel demand into the European countries increased 5% in the third quarter. As we announced in today's press release, we disposed of eight hotels in the European joint venture. We expect our 10 remaining high-quality assets to continue their strong performance into the fourth quarter amidst improving EU economic conditions. Let's move to our forecast. At the end of September, based on market weakness for August, we provided an update to our outlook for 2015. We identified weaker leisure business in the United States and lower-than-expected growth at our international properties, mainly at our Calgary and Latin America hotels. We expect these trends to continue into the fourth quarter. In addition, while renovations will continue to impact specific hotels going forward, it is worth noting that the fourth-quarter this year will have fewer comp hotel renovations than the fourth-quarter of last year. As announced in our press release, our Board of Directors has authorized a second share repurchase program of up to an additional $500 million of common stock. During the third quarter and through early October, we repurchased 15.2 million shares at an average price of $17.76. This brings our total repurchase to date to approximately $400 million. Along with $100 million remaining under our initial repurchase program, we currently have $600 million of repurchase capacity. With respect to dividend, we paid a regular third quarter dividend of $0.20, which represents a yield of approximately 5% on the current stock price. Given our strong operating outlook and the generation of significant free cash flow, we are committed to sustaining a meaningful dividend. Also, based on the asset sale plan Ed outlined in his comments today, keep in mind that the successful execution of these asset sales in 2016 will likely result in taxable gains that could lead to large special dividends. These will be one-time, but could be a meaningful return of capital to our stockholders. Moving to our balance sheet. During the quarter and subsequent to quarter-end, we completed several transactions that reduced our average interest rate by 80 basis points to 3.7%, and extended our maturities to an average of 6.2 years. We have no significant maturities until 2019, and are operating from a position of financial strength and flexibility. After adjusting for the debt transactions that occurred after quarter-end, as well as taking into consideration the 391 million exchangeable debentures that we expect to convert to common shares, we have approximately $214 million of cash, $621 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility, $200 million of capacity under the term loan, and $3.9 billion of debt. And our leverage will be at the midpoint of our stated 2.5 times to 3 times range. When taking into account the additional stock repurchase authorization we announced today, we are comfortable with pushing our leverage closer to the high-end of our range. In summary, we feel good about our results and our outlook for the rest of this year in 2016. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Anthony Powell : Hi. Good morning. Ed, on the asset sales that you've identified, do you believe you'll be able to sell some of these noncore assets at prices or valuational tools that are above your current stock price -- stock trading multiple, rather? Edward Walter : It will obviously depend upon the asset. But yes, I think that when you look at where we are trading right now, I think a number of these sales could happen at or slightly below that cap rate or that EBITDA multiple. Anthony Powell : Right. Thanks. And even beyond the $2 billion that you've identified as potential candidates for sale, what percentage of your portfolio do you believe is noncore? And could there be more sales even beyond 2016? Edward Walter : Certainly, the $2 billion captures the bulk of what we would look at as noncore. I'm sure that there are -- I'm sure there's some incremental assets that, as time evolves, we could add into a sales program from the standpoint of looking at noncore sales. I think, ultimately, this is going to come down to exactly how long does the sale markets remain attractive, and what are some of the options that -- other options that we may see for that capital? Over time, what we've always wanted to be doing, and we have been doing, is looking to sell those assets in our portfolio where we see somewhat weaker growth prospects, and then redeploy that capital into higher-yielding opportunities, which today, is buying our stock. Anthony Powell : All right, that's it for me. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Smedes Rose from Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi. Thanks. I wanted to come back to -- you mentioned that you expect some disruption from CapEx projects in 2016. Is this related to projects that are currently underway that are finishing up next year? Or are they new projects? Maybe you could just sort of talk about what's sort of the major -- besides the three hotels that were closed and are reopening, what are some of the major projects that are underway or that you contemplate starting in 2016? Edward Walter : Smedes, what I was referring to there was that there are -- first of all, we are still spending capital. We are still investing money in CapEx programs in 2016. The overall level, as we tried to make it clear, is going to be less than what we did in 2015 by a pretty material amount -- about 10% in maintenance CapEx and 20% overall. So the spending is clearly going down. What I was trying to highlight is that you'll still have some disruption from those individual projects just because we're obviously still doing them. The larger projects that we would be starting at the end of this year that might carry into next year would be our renovation of the Denver Tech Marriott and the Hyatt, the San Francisco Hyatt near the airport in Burlingame. Those are probably our two single biggest projects that start in the fourth quarter and carry into the beginning of next year. And then we have a series of other rooms' renovations. But again, I think the point I would make there is that, overall, we would expect that there will be less disruption in the comp portfolio next year than what we experienced this year. Smedes Rose : Okay. And then just you mentioned maybe about $1 billion of proceeds for the first tranche of sales and maybe 50% of that would go out as kind of a specials. Could you also break out what you would think the debt associated with those asset sales is? Edward Walter : I think what we are referring to more there is the fact that as you sell those assets, you are also losing EBITDA. And so, in the context of thinking about our overall balance sheet management, as you, if you sell $1 billion worth of assets, you dip into $0.5 billion, assuming that's how the math worked out; then some chunk of those remaining proceeds would be deployed to repay debt to ensure that we weren't exceeding leverage levels that we would be targeting. And then the other portion of those proceeds would be available for other uses, which would, in today's world, be used to buy back stock. I think as we indicated in our comments and we've talked about for a long period of time, we're generally looking at maintaining our leverage in the long run between 2.5 and 3 times. Right now we are in the middle of that range. In the near-term, we would be comfortable, given our operating outlook, to allowing that to -- that leverage level to fly towards the high end of that range. But as you are selling assets, you are ultimately going to have to make some adjustments to your debt balances to ensure that you don't go well above that range. Smedes Rose : Okay, thanks for the color. Operator : We will now hear from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hey, good morning, guys. Two questions for me. The first one would be -- we've heard some of the operators, including some of the big brand companies, talk a little bit about softness in the month of October on the transient side. Clearly, you guys have a little bit more group exposure and more sort of unique exposure to individual markets, but I'm curious -- are you seeing anything that's similar to that across the portfolio or any callouts on that front? Edward Walter : I would say that we are seeing a little bit of that, too. You make the right point, that we have a portfolio that's oriented towards group. And as I indicated, our group pace for the fourth-quarter was very solid. It improved over the course of the third-quarter because of good strong bookings in the third-quarter. But I think we are seeing some transient weakness in the fourth-quarter too. Shaun Kelley : Got it. Thanks, Ed. And then my follow-up would be -- the other thing that I think some of the other REITs that have reported earlier have talked a little bit about is, supply growth in some of the urban and CBD markets. I'm curious, when you guys look market by market, particularly for next year, any markets that stand out to you on the supply front? And how is that sort of impacting either your asset sale program or just your general outlook for the fundamentals in those markets? Edward Walter : There's no doubt that supply is picking up. I think one of the themes, though, that as we've looked at that, is there's also no doubt that the bulk of the supply that you are seeing nationwide is really being driven by the upscale and midscale segments. Supply and upper upscale and luxury is still well below long-term historical averages. And that applies both on a nationwide basis as well as on what we would look at as sort of the top 17 markets where our portfolio is deployed. So there is a little bit of a bifurcation there in terms of where that supply hits. I think some of the markets that are -- that I think that are widely known to have a high level of supply, that would include Houston, New York, and Miami. Those are certainly -- as we look out, and our analysis tends to do a bit of a weighting in terms of when that supply is going to hit and assumes that it feathers in over a 12-month timeframe. But it's clear that those three markets are going to see strong levels of supply in 2016. Gregory Larson : I mean, the flipside to that would be there are certain markets like Hawaii where there is virtually no supply. Shaun Kelley : Great. Thank you both. Operator : We will move on to Harry Curtis with Nomura. Harry Curtis : Good morning. So following up on Shaun's question about the softness in October, as you speak to your customers and your peers, what do you think it's related to? And do you think that it's the beginning of a longer-term downtrend? Edward Walter : Harry, I think it's really hard to say. We -- first off, we're sort of all getting the October softness light. We are seeing it kind of a real-time. You know, our group element of our business has held up fairly well through October, at least based on all indications we have. I would imagine that we are still seeing the same international travel weakness that we saw in the summer. I suspect that that is still carrying into October. My guess is that will become less impactful as we get later in the year, because I suspect international travel tends to ebb a bit as you get into the late part of the fourth-quarter. But I'm sure that is contributing to it to some degree. Harry Curtis : Second question is, Ed, you have seen a number of cycles. You've seen a number of REIT positive and negative cycles as it pertains to attracting funds on the investor side. What I'm -- where I'm going with this is, typically when the Fed raise rates, REIT mutual funds lose assets. Yet it's interesting that lodging REITs tend to do well. What do you think, if the Fed does begin to move rates a bit, what is your expectation as far as Host's ability to price up and keep lifting its dividend? Edward Walter : Well, I think you are right in your assessment, first off, that when -- historically, what we've seen is that when the Fed starts to raise rates, it reflects the fact that there is an expectation that the economy -- or a realization that the economy is doing better. And so while oftentimes I think you've seen a bit of a falloff in terms of REIT valuations, or a lodging REIT valuations when that first starts to happen, folks start to also recognize that a good economy is good for lodging. To the extent that the Fed raises rates at the end of this year, the beginning of next year, and it's also because of the fact that the Fed is really beginning to believe that business investment and GDP growth in 2016 are going to be stronger than what we've seen in 2015 -- and I think that's the consensus outlook at this point, but I would also tell you that's been the consensus outlook the last couple of years at this point, is that the next year will be better. If that all happens, I think that bodes well for us and for the other -- the lodging industry in general. One of the things that will be important for 2016 performance is to see some recovery in -- or some strengthening in demand. We obviously know that supply levels will be somewhat elevated compared to this year, so we are going to need more demand in order to accommodate that. You know, we are certainly seeing, as I mentioned in my comments, really strong bookings for next year, well better -- far better than where we stood at this time last year. And we are seeing -- a lot of our markets are really showing good, solid, advanced group bookings. So I think if we get -- if the Fed is raising rates because the economy is better, that's clearly a good sign. What I would hope with that too is that we would not only, this may be wishing for too much, it would be good if the currency didn't appreciate considerably compared to at least the euro and potentially the yen. Because I think the area where we've been hurt a bit in international travel this year has been a fall-off in travel from Japan and from Continental Europe. And the fact -- if the currencies would remain generally flat year-over-year, I think that would be helpful for international demand, which is something that's been important in this cycle. And it would be good to see that come back at a stronger level in 2016. Gregory Larson : Yes, I think the only thing I would add, Ed, I agree with you, right, because of our strong group booking pace and because of some of the assets that you talked about that are closed this year that will reopen next year, it would be great to have very, as Ed mentioned, strong EBITDA growth next year, which obviously means our taxable income would be higher, which means our dividend would be higher. But in addition to all of that, as Ed mentioned in his comments, as we sell assets, obviously approximately 50% of the proceeds from those asset sales will also go towards the dividend. So for all those reasons, I think 2016 looks good from a dividend front. Harry Curtis : Thank you. Gregory Larson : Thank you. Operator : Next question will come from Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity. Ryan Meliker : Hey, good morning, guys. I guess just the first question I was hoping you guys could kind of give some more color on, and you gave some on the call already, is -- as we're looking out to 2016, it might be helpful to get a good understanding of what the renovation disruption you've put into guidance for 2015 was, so we know that that's going to be added back. And then also what you think the EBITDA impact from your net acquisitions and dispositions that you guys have already closed on. I'm not asking for any forward guidance, just what the impact is in your 2015 guidance from those things, so we can make sure that we adjust accordingly. Edward Walter : Well, I think we tried to explain that in our comments, that if you look -- the assets that we owned for a portion of this year, which we sold in 2015, generated about $20 million worth of EBITDA in 2015. And then we had a -- and then when you -- we also obviously owned The Phoenician for a part of this year, which generated, call it, $6 million or so of EBITDA for this year so far. So, when we look at what -- when you take that $20 million out and you add in the full benefit of The Phoenician in 2016, we are sort of expecting The Phoenician will be in that $30 million to $31 million level next year. So that's where we get basically a lift of $3 million to $5 million on a year-over-year basis for comparing the benefit of The Phoenician versus the sales of the assets that have gone out the door this year. Ryan Meliker : That's helpful. Edward Walter : Okay. And then on the redevelopment side, again, we had $4 million -- we took a $4 million hit from those three assets and we expect to see a $20 million to $22 million lift from that, those are probably the most significant year-over-year drivers. We obviously know that we are spending less on CapEx next year. We know that the number of the investments we made, especially in the first half of this year, were disruptive. Without going through the whole budget process, it's hard to understand what that incremental lift will be. So, unfortunately, we'll have more detail on that as we get into our call in February. Ryan Meliker : No, that's really helpful. Thanks for giving a little bit more detail on that. And then just the second question I was hoping you guys could answer for me was -- year-to-date, your suburban assets have been kind of your strongest performers. I know that's not always the case, and obviously, as we happen to go through the cycle, things change. But I guess the question I would ask is, is now the right time to be selling those assets, given they are kind of driving your RevPAR growth more than any other segment? And with occupancy levels where they are across the industry, you would tend to think that we'll see more compression demand into a lot of those suburban markets. Edward Walter : I think that's a very good question, part of our assessment there. And so we think about that in the context of the assets that we are selling. I think the flipside of that is there's no better time to sell an asset than when its performance is extremely strong. And so I think partly what you are seeing here is our assessment that, while the assets are performing well now, probably will -- should perform well again next year. As we think about where we want to be invested in the long run, at least for those assets that we would end up selling, those would be the ones that we would be comfortable in letting go, even though, in the near-term, their performance has been stronger. Ryan Meliker : Okay, that's it for me. Thanks a lot, guys. Edward Walter : Thanks. Operator : Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI has our next question. Rich Hightower : Good morning, guys. So I actually want to follow up on Shaun's earlier question about supply growth. So, while it is true that midscale and upscale represent most of the growth that's going on in a lot of these markets, I guess my question is, would you say that some of those hotels are actually competitive with urban upper upscale properties such as those that Host owns? Because I think LaSalle and Pebblebrook sort of made that point on their calls, where they said some of the demand that might be -- might have previously gone into those types of hotels is actually gravitating towards either the limited service category or even some of the suburban markets. So, I'm wondering if you are noticing the same shift, or if you have a different perspective? Edward Walter : Shaun, I mean... Gregory Larson : It's Rich. Edward Walter : Rich, I think you are right in that assessment that, first of all, supply is supply. And whether it comes in the midscale or upscale segment or in other segments, it's going to have an impact on the market. So at the end of the day, there still is an impact from that supply. But I think part of our point, though, is that there still is a distinction between the different segments. The supply at the upper price points is not as high. Another differentiation is, from a standpoint of the type of customer, those upscale hotels are really not in a position -- or midscale hotels are not really in a position to be able to handle the group business that our -- the bulk of our portfolio is able to accommodate. So, I would agree that I am concerned about supply, whether it's in the higher price points or in the mid-price points. But I do think that mid-price points supply will be a bit less impactful in our portfolio, in part because of our orientation towards group. Rich Hightower : Okay. That's helpful, Ed. Thanks. And then my second question has to do with the group pace number that you mentioned for 2016. I think it's held steady at plus 6% for maybe the past quarter or so. It's a solid number. Is there any reason, though, that it maybe isn't accelerating at this point? Or is it just too early to know or to have the data? Edward Walter : I'm actually fairly encouraged that it's stayed as constant as it has. Because I see -- the reality is, if you think about that, is that right now if you can tell me that we can do better than 6% group revenues in 2015, I would be pleased, or 2016, I would be pleased. Typically, what we have found is some other phases of this particular cycle is that when we are -- when we sort of had very strong advanced bookings, as you get closer to the actual period of time when the numbers are real, you tend to see that because so much space has been sold, you start to have less available to sell, and consequently that sort of the improvement over the prior year in group tends to decline a bit. So the fact that we've been consistently strong for 2016 throughout this year, really I view as a fairly favorable -- as a good thing. It's a good thing. You know, I would offer up too is that it's not just 2016 that looks good; we've got pretty good advanced bookings for 2017 too. So that trend is going to continue past this year. Rich Hightower : All right, great. Thank you. Operator : Moving on to Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Steven Kent : Hi. Good morning. Just a couple questions. You noted your third-quarter trends coming in better than Street expectations. But then it didn't really look like you flowed it through for the full-year. I just wanted to understand that a little bit more what I'm missing there. And then you mentioned your stock is attractive, but why not use full-service asset sale proceeds and increase presence maybe in the select service market? Is that something you'd think about maybe longer-term, as select service has evolved and seems to be doing -- seems to be showing good returns, taking share, et cetera? Edward Walter : You know, Steve, it's a good -- let me deal with the second one -- question first. It's a good question about whether we should be orienting more as a select service. And if you look at what we've acquired over the course of the last couple of years, we have acquired some assets in that segment as a business. Given what I just said about supply, I probably -- and the fact that the bulk of the supply that we are seeing is directly targeted at the select service segment, I'd probably be reluctant right now, if we were in an investment mode, I would probably be reluctant to deploy a lot of capital into that space, because I think I would be concerned about the -- just the high degree of supply that's coming into that sector. And what we've traditionally seen over time is that new select service competes incredibly effectively with older select service. And so is the fact that you are seeing the increase in supply being so squarely centered in those segments would concern me in terms of accelerating our investments in select service assets at this point. Now thinking longer-term, as we think about where the Company would be in four to six to seven years, I would certainly expect that select service would be a bigger part of our portfolio looking out. But this is probably not quite the right time to be a buyer of those assets if we were in a buying mode. As it relates to the Q3/Q4 comparison, I think some of what you are seeing on the EBITDA side is really related to some improvements, as Greg highlighted in his comments, some improvements in Europe. And then you are also seeing on compensation, the low stock price at the end of the quarter, when run through the appropriate models for calculating stock compensation expense. Really, what we hope, at least, is move some compensation expense out of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. We'll obviously see how that plays out at the end of the year, but I'm sure you could all guess how we are rooting. But that I think there was some deltas that happened as a result of that. Greg, what do you want to add to that? Gregory Larson : Obviously, in the fourth quarter, October certainly will be one of the better quarters or better months of the year on one hand. On the other hand, certainly, I think our hotel forecast for October today is lower than what it was a quarter ago. And I'd say the same thing about our fourth quarter in general. Our fourth quarter in general rates to be pretty decent. But as we sit here today, I think our forecast as a hotel forecast for the fourth quarter is lower today than what it was a quarter ago. Steven Kent : Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Joseph Greff with JPMorgan. Joseph, please check your mute function. Joseph Greff : Good morning, guys. Did you actually talk about what October RevPAR growth was? Edward Walter : No, we did not, Joe. I don't -- we just don't have a number quite yet. But it's certainly been running better than what we've seen for the rest of the year, but I don't have an updated number yet for the month. Joseph Greff : You gave us a bunch of things to think about in terms of asset sales and capital return. How do you feel about other types of corporate actions either separating the portfolios, making them smaller and then affording you potentially longer-term down the road, larger percentage growth opportunities? How do you view those types of opportunities? Edward Walter : You know, I think we are constantly evaluating a variety of different options for the portfolio. Certainly, one of the questions we've gotten before is about whether we could sell some of these assets in a portfolio sale context, for instance. And that's something we've looked at throughout the year, and the last couple of years, frankly. And we'll continue to look at. So far, the response we've gotten from the market has suggested that the tact we're taking, which is individual asset sales, is probably the most productive one in the long-term. But to the extent that the opportunity presents itself to sell assets in bulk, similar to what we did in Europe, albeit that transaction took almost a year to complete. Then we would try to take advantage of that. You know, as you look at other types of transactions, I know that there's been a lot of discussion about spins and things like that in the market over the course of the last couple of years. I think in the current environment, when the entire -- all of the lodging REIT stocks are trading at a significant discount to NAV, it's hard to imagine that a spin is necessarily going to close that gap as effectively as asset sales, because you are still going to -- after the spin, you are still going to have two entities that would, are going to trade, while you may see an improvement in multiple in general from having taken the step, I don't know that you are necessarily going to radically have those companies trade at a different multiple and a different relationship to NAV than the rest of the industry. So, all this is evolving. We frankly have only been in this sort of situation where the stocks are trading at this big of a discount to NAV for sort of half of this year. We are trying to take advantage of that as best as we can. We're trying to take advantage of the balance sheet strength that we have to deploy that right now to benefit from that. And we'll continue to evaluate all sorts of options as we work our way through 2016 and 2017. Joseph Greff : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Chris Woronka : Good morning, guys. I wanted to -- Ed, I wanted to ask you kind of a theoretical question. If there ends up being some kind of M&A in this space, maybe involving some of your brand companies that you do business with, what do you think the broader implications might be? And not really getting specific, but historically, what do you think that could mean for -- do they go for more leverage with you guys? Can you guys renegotiate some things? Just high-level thoughts. Thanks. Edward Walter : It's hard to deal with that question in the abstract, just because you need to know -- you ultimately need to know who is combining or who is buying who. So it's sort of tricky to say. I mean, our contract rights flow out of individual contracts or corporate level agreements with Starwood and Marriott. And so I don't know that those particular corporate level agreements are necessarily -- in fact, I'm fairly confident that they are not specifically affected by any transactions that might happen at the corporate level by any of those companies. So ultimately, I think our valuation of whatever might occur, whatever combinations would occur or whatever change in ownership would occur, are going to be based upon who's in charge and what their plans are for the brands and the properties that we own. Chris Woronka : Okay. That's good color. And then just, you know, you guys have, I think you've sold some assets pretty well, actually, in this cycle. But I guess there is also -- some people ask if there's an implication if smart guys are selling assets. Does it imply that the cycle is coming to an end and at the same time you buy back stocks? How do you kind of jive all that from a very high level perspective? Edward Walter : Well, first of all, we don't think the cycle is coming to an end. We see solid growth in 2016. And as we look out past that point in time, assuming that economic growth continues to be at least at the levels that we've seen lately, we don't see why the cycle wouldn't be continuing past that. You know, I think there's a lot of different reasons to sell assets. In our case, it's not necessarily because we think we are timing it at the top. It's really driven more by an approach to how we manage our portfolio and a long-term perspective to reduce exposure to certain markets, and then, over time, increase it to others, is the way of managing the portfolio. I would envision that other than in those periods of time that are shortly after a decline, where we probably would be -- wouldn't be comfortable that we were getting fair value for our hotels, we tend to be a seller throughout a significant chunk of the cycle. So I don't know that I would read a lot into that other than this is just a continuation of a program that we've been working on for awhile. Gregory Larson : You know, and I think this is, obviously, Chris, as you know, this is sort of a unique situation right now where we can sell assets that are sort of in the bottom sort of, call it, bottom quartile of our portfolio, assets that maybe have slower growth rates, higher CapEx issues. But we can sell those assets at sort of lower cap rates than where we trade today. Right? And then take those proceeds and either put it out in the form of a dividend or buy back our stock at, which today, is close to an 8% cap rate. Edward Walter : And then I think lastly in terms of the notion of buying stock back at this point in time, I mean, that's something that we obviously give a lot of thought to. But I think we are comfortable, especially at these levels, that buying the stock is a good investment. And I think we are being thoughtful about how we pursue that, because nobody knows exactly what the future holds. But at this point in time, as we are sort of -- in effect, we are shrinking the Company with some of these sales. And shrinking and buying back stock is a way to help sort of get the benefit of that shrinkage. Chris Woronka : Okay, very good. Thanks, guys. Operator : Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo has our next question. Jeff Donnelly : Good morning, guys. Maybe just to comment that a little differently on share repurchases, I mean, how do you think about balancing the timing of your share repurchases, given your outlook on the direction of real estate values rather than, say, RevPAR at this point in the cycle? And is there a specific maybe discount to NAV that you want to see at a minimum when you make purchases? I'm just curious how you're thinking about that. Edward Walter : I don't know that we've gotten quite that formulaic about it, Jeff. It's sort of -- we've been in a good position, I guess, in terms of how we thought about it since we've initiated the programs. It's been relatively easy to be comfortable that buying our stock was the best alternative for the capital that we had or that we would be generating. Now, if you go back to what we would've talked about in April, when our stock price was higher and we spoke about this, our assessment at that point in time was as we generated capital from asset sales or from other sources, we would look at buying -- the returns from buying the stock relative to the returns from investing in other things, whether it was new assets or whether it would be ROI investments. And so as we look to a point in time that I hope happens sooner or later, which is that the gap closes between NAV and our stock -- and by the way, I'm hoping that happens because our stock is going up, of course, as that gap starts to close, then we will continue to evaluate what are those best options for the capital that we are generating if, at that future time, you could see an acceleration in ROI investments if those proved to be more attractive. But if, on the other hand, we are at a point in the cycle where we don't think it makes sense to make new investments or new acquisitions, then you would still be buying the stock back at that environment, even though the returns might not be as attractive as they are today. Jeff Donnelly : And maybe to circle back in your comment about portfolio sales versus individual asset sales, I think in the case of another one of your peers who recently structured a transaction to sell itself, I think people were initially a little disappointed that pricing wasn't as robust as they had hoped. Is that maybe an indicator maybe of what you are referring to is that the market is a little bit stronger for single asset sales than there are portfolio sales? And that's why you feel you have more success going that route? I think that's a good insight. It's just -- there's a lot of activity on the individual basis. But as you start to move up in bulk, the number of players is thinner. And I don't -- I haven't had an opportunity to read everything that Strategic published. But while I think they had a high level of interest, it seems like I heard that at the end of the day, there was really -- there were only a few serious bidders. And so that is somewhat of an indication of what you are describing. Jeff Donnelly : And what's your thinking on refocusing maybe more exclusively on the US market? I know you are pulling back in Asia and you've shrunk in some other markets. But there's been some success in doing that, I think, for other companies who have sort of retrenched into the US and maybe cut their overhead a little bit. How do you weigh that? Edward Walter : Well, I think in the near-term, that's exactly what we're doing. I mean, we're obviously going to cut all the overhead that was in Asia-Pacific region. We only have the international offices in Europe -- are the only ones that would be left sort of as we get into early next year. In Europe, I think we've got a number of opportunities to enhance the value of the remaining 10 hotels that we have. And I think the decision has been made at this stage, is to continue to work that portfolio and then watch for what opportunities might develop in the long run. But certainly at this point in time, as we deal with worldwide capital flows, which we are making investing in Asia very difficult to do, at least on our parameters, the best markets to focus on right now are in the US. Jeff Donnelly : And then just last question, I don't want to leave Greg out. Greg, you referenced the potential for special dividends. I might have missed it. But are you able to give us just some more specifics on the potential timing of distributions, or perhaps an order of magnitude relative to, say, your current share price or current distribution, just to give folks a better sense of how you're thinking about that? Gregory Larson : Sure. So, as Ed mentioned, right, we are currently marketing $1 billion worth of assets. Certainly, I'm not sure if all of those assets will actually complete. But as we sell those assets and complete those sales in 2016, certainly that will increase our taxable income. And so, look it, I think the way we look at it is, at a minimum, as Ed mentioned, approximately half of the proceeds will go out in the form of a dividend. And so at a minimum, we could just put it out in a special dividend next year, which would be in the fourth quarter; or to minimize that special dividend, what you could see us do at some point next year is raise our standard dividend. And so, effectively, we've have the same dividend for the year out in 2016. But you could see us stair-step, increase our standard dividend, which would effectively reduce that special dividend at the end of 2016. Jeff Donnelly : Thank you. Gregory Larson : Look, it's too early to know that, but I think at the end of the day, you could do the math, Jeff, right? If we sell X number of assets and if 50% of the proceeds go into the form of a dividend, divide that by our share count, you can see what we are talking about in the form of an extra dividend. Jeff Donnelly : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Ed Walter, at this time, I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Edward Walter : Thank you all for joining us on the call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our third-quarter results and outlook. We look forward to talking with you in February to discuss both our year-end 2015 results and provide much more detailed insights into 2016. Have a great day, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Good day and welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Gee Lingberg : Thanks, Anna. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we're not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in today's earnings press release, and our 8-K filed with the SEC, and on our website at hosthotels.com. With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Greg will provide a brief -- Ed will provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year results, and then we'll discuss our disposition and redevelopment activity, as well as our company's outlook for 2016. Greg will then provide greater detail on our fourth quarter performance by markets. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. To ensure we speak to as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ed. Edward Walter : Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. Looking back on our performance in 2015, we had an active year and undertook a number of initiatives to capitalize on value enhancing opportunities to better position our company for continued growth and success. We sold more than $1 billion worth of hotels including five of our nine hotels in Asia as we make good progress on our plan to exit the Asia Pacific markets. We returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We invested more than $1 billion in new assets and capital improvement including the acquisition of the iconic Phoenician resort as a completion of the major redevelopment of four hotel and finally we refinanced more than $1.4 billion of debt reducing our average interest rate by 110 basis points to 3.7%, extending our maturity schedule and further solidifying our industry leading balance sheet. Looking ahead to 2016, we will continue to support a disciplined approach to actively managing our portfolio and additionally allocating capital. We've remained focused on continuing to improving operational and financial performance to better drive results for our shareholders. Now let's review our results for the quarter and the year. Comparable hotel RevPAR for the quarter increased 3.6% with rate growth of 1.7% and an increase in occupancy of 1.4 percentage points. For the full year, our portfolio achieved an average occupancy of more than 77% allowing the hotels to drive average rate increase of 3.3% resulting in an improvement in Comparable hotel RevPAR of 3.8% which equals 4% when adjusted for the impact of the USALI accounting changes. Adjusted EBITDA was $344 million for the quarter and $1.409 billion for the full year exceeding consensus estimates and our prior forecast. Our adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.39 for the fourth quarter and $1.54 for the full year, also exceeding consensus estimates and reflecting a 2.7% increase over 2014. Even though we were below our RevPAR forecast for the year, adjusted EBITDA was positively affected by the higher than expected profits from food and beverage and from our Maui time share project, as well as $5 million associated with the write-off of deferred IMF relating to a hotel that converted to a franchise and a reduction in our restricted stock expense. The quarterly results were driven by an increasing group room nights of more than 2.5%. As association business grew by more than 6%, group rate improved by nearly 1.5% as corporate rate growth was up by 4% which was significantly higher than our year-to-date results. In total, group revenues grew 4%. Transient demand increased by 1.5%, although it was primarily in the discount segments as corporate demand was weaker than anticipated which may reflect the weaker GDP growth the U.S. economy experienced in Q4. While rate growth in the discount segments was fairly solid, the negative mixed shift resulted in average rate increasing just 1% and transient revenue grew just 2.5%. Some of the transient weakness was likely due to reduced international travel while labels into the U.S. continued to grow at a healthy pace in the fourth quarter, spending decline slightly which suggests that our customers still made the trip but stayed for fewer days and likely shop less. Our sense is that international business declined by 5% to 10% at our hotels in the quarter. The strong group performance translated into strong banquet and catering activity as banquet and catering revenues grew by 6.8% or 5.4% after adjusting for USALI. We experienced above expected catering activity in our Florida hotel and in our larger San Diego and San Francisco assets. Our outlets were also busy as revenues at our restaurants and lounge improved by more than 4.5%. Overall, F&B revenues increased 6.1% or 4.7% after adjusting for USALI which was one of our best quarters of the year. The higher revenues drove improved margins and our profits exceeded our expectations. Total revenues for the quarter increased 3.6% and EBITDA margins improved by 55 basis points as a 9% reduction in utility expense and a 15% reduction in insurance cost, partially offset by a 7% increase in property taxes and an increase in ground run in one of our LA assets. Transient demand represented 58% of our total room nights for the full year, and increased just slightly from last year. Transient rate increased 2.8% for the full year as most segments experienced strong rate growth other than our OTA business. For the full year, transient revenues grew 2.9%. Despite starting the year with no additional room nights on the books compared to 2014, bookings during the year were solid and group demand improved 1.1% for the year led by a 3% increase in association business. Overall, group demand represented 37% of our sold rooms and group revenues grew 3.1%. F&B revenues grew 5.2% for the full year or 2.5% after adjusting for USALI, the increase resulted from banquet revenue growth of 5.9% for the year and outlook revenue improvement of 3.8%. Reduced construction in our meeting space helped spark a 4.2% USALI adjusted F&B growth in the second half of the year. Total revenue growth for the year improved by 3.3% and full year EBITDA margins improved 35 basis points after adjusting for USALI. In 2016 we continue to execute on our strategic plan of reallocating capital out of markets where we expect lower growth or higher capital expenditure requirements. This approach has also enabled us to benefit from the arbitrage between private and public market valuations in the current environment. We had a very active fourth quarter disposition [ph] with approximately $630 million in sales completed. These included the Sheraton Four Points in Perth, the eight property European portfolio, the Novotel and ibis in Auckland and the Novotel Queenstown. In addition, as we announced this morning, we closed the sales of San Diego Mission Valley Marriott, a suburban hotel with 350 rooms, and the Novotel Wellington, a 139 room hotel located in New Zealand for a combined sales price of almost a $100 million. The average RevPAR for these two hotels was approximately $116 which is consistent with our primary focus of selling lower RevPAR hotels. The disposition of non-core assets continues to be a priority, we have an additional $117 million in assets under binding contracts with closing slated over the next three months. We are currently marketing an additional $800 million of assets with more than one-third of those fairly follow-on in the process. We have been pleased with the response to our marketing efforts and remain optimistic that we will continue to complete sales, although there can be no assurance as if that will occur. As we mentioned last call, the sales we are targeting to complete will generate a significant amount of taxable income which will likely result in a special dividend paid at the end of the year. Last year we suffered significant disruption from a number of comprehensive renovations that closed parts of several hotel for significant portions of the year. Each of the most impactful renovations; the Logan in Philadelphia, the Camby in Phoenix, the Axiom in San Francisco, and the Houston Airport Marriott has been or is about to be completed. All the hotels are now open for business and the initial customer reaction has been quite positive. The new rooms products has been well received and the F&B outlook, especially the Urban Farmer to Logan and the Artisan [ph] at the Camby have generated significant favorably publicity. Last year these four hotels generated a loss of approximately $4 million, this year we expect them to contribute between $28 million to $30 million in EBITDA with additional above average growth expected in 2017. This year we're also completing major redevelopments of the Denver Tech Marriott, the Hyatt San Francisco Airport, and the exhibit hall of the San Diego Marriott Marquis. While we expect there will be disruptive impact of the first two assets by referenced, we currently anticipate that the San Diego exhibit hall project will be completed in mid-year and the additional income it will generate will offset the negative impact from the other two assets on a full year basis when compared to 2015. All three hotels should generate above trend improvement in 2017. This morning, based on our closing price from last night, we are trading at a value of $260,000 a key, compared to an estimated replacement cost that exceeds $500,000. Based on the midpoint of our guidance range which I will discuss shortly, we are trading at 10.5 EBITDA multiple and 8.5% cap rate. Both measures reflect valuations that are significantly lower than our historical averages and we believe our stock represents an excellent value opportunity. As we generate cash flow from operations in asset sales, we believe the best way to deliver the most value per shareholders is to repurchase our undervalued stock. In line with this approach, we purchased a total of $325 million of stock in the fourth quarter bringing our total for the year to $675 million. When combined with almost $650 million in dividends we paid over the last 12 months, we have returned approximately $1.3 billion in capital to our shareholders. Assuming 2016 plays out consistently with our expectations, we would continue to execute on our existing share repurchase program and revisit the sites of the program later in the year. The guidance we announced this morning reflects the following; nation-wide supply growth when netted for likely closures is now approaching the long term average of 2% for the next couple of years. However, supply growth in the top 20 major markets has accelerated more quickly, and is now likely to exceed 3%. While upper-upscale supply in these markets which is most directly competitive with our portfolio should not exceed 1.5%, strong supply growth in the upscale and mid-scale segments is driving the overall supply levels higher. Our portfolio will not be immune to impact from this new supply. Over the last three years, demand growth has averaged more than 3% in the Top 20 market but consensus forecast suggest that may moderate slightly in 2016 given the weak economic growth in the fourth quarter and the general low-end GDP forecast for 2016. We are also watching international travel carefully as it impacts the gateway markets. The combined effect of these two factors which likely influence the weaker than expected fourth quarter room revenue growth in the industry suggests that demand may not match supply growth of 2016 progressive. On the positive side, we had very strong group bookings in the fourth quarter, with the bookings up more than 4.5%. We are starting 2016 with group revenues up more than 6% compared to 2015 which positions us to maintain strong occupancies and drive higher rated transient business. In addition, our negotiated rates in most markets have increased more in 2016 than they did in 2015, providing support for transient rate growth. Finally, we have had a solid start in January, reversing the trend we experienced in the fourth quarter as our preliminary RevPAR growth estimate for the month is approximately 3.8%, and that is after the negative impact of about 1% of lost RevPAR driven by cancellations in Washington and New York due to the severe snowstorm. As we indicated last year, we also expect to benefit from less construction disruption in 2016 as our maintenance capital spending should decline by more than 18%. And the hotels we invested in last year, not only facing new year-over-year cost but also have an improved product to sell. Given all these factors, we projected in 2016 solo Comparable hotel RevPAR will increase by 3% to 4% in constant currency, and EBITDA margins will increase zero to 40 basis points. This will translate to adjusted EBITDA of $1.450 billion to $1.480 billion, and adjusted FFO per share of $1.65 to $1.69. It is worth noting that our EBITDA and FFO estimates have been reduced by $14 million to reflect the impact of the $215 million of 2016 assets sales we have identified. However, our balance sheet does not reflect the receipt of the proceeds that these sales will generate. Overall, I'm pleased to say that we are still seeing positive indicators within our portfolio with continued strong demand, especially in the group segments. The capital we have invested in our hotels ensures that our portfolio is in excellent condition, and our industry-leading balance sheet remains strong. We also remain focused on generating cash from asset sales and operations that can be deployed into stock repurchases and returning value to our shareholders. We are confident the future of our business and our entire team is still focused on delivering another positive year of growth. Thank you. And now let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail. Gregory Larson : Thank you, Ed. Despite the fourth quarter headwinds as described, several of our important markets, including Florida, Los Angeles, Atlanta, San Diego and Boston experienced excellent RevPAR growth and continue to give us confidence as we look at into 2016. Let me provide some specific commentary on our major markets. Florida performed very well and produced the best domestic market performance with 11.7% RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter, 310 basis points above the star upper-upscale market RevPAR. Strong group business at our Orlando World Center, Ritz-Carlton, Naples, Harbor Beach Marriott, and Camby Airport Marriott, contributed to high average rate growth at these properties. With a group revenue increase of almost 22%, our managers at our Florida hotels were able to institute more aggressive pricing strategies which increased transient rate by approximately 7%. In addition, the strong group business resulted in more than 23% growth in food and beverage revenues. RevPAR of hotel from Los Angeles grew 9.8% in the fourth quarter as several of our properties benefited from renovations that occurred during the same time last year. Once again, strong RevPAR growth in Los Angeles was the result of robust average rate growth of more than 5% in both transient and group business. On the back of group business strength at our hotels, our managers were able to drive food and beverage revenue growth of more than 17%. Looking forward, group booking pace in Los Angeles looks very strong as the market is expected to host eight addition city-wise in 2016. As a result, we expect continued solid performance from our Los Angeles properties. In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 8.2% for the quarter, primarily as a result of average rate growth of 6.3%. Transient average rate increased 6.6% and 5.2% respectively. Food and beverage revenues at our properties in the market grew by 8.7%, mainly due to healthy banquet and catering business at the JW Marriott and Grand Hyatt [ph] hotels. We expect our outputs in Atlanta will continue to have a solid year in 2016 based on an excellent group booking pace for the year. Atlanta is expected to add more than 8,500 room night related to two additional mega city-wide. Our hotels in San Diego produced results that outperformed the average of our portfolio with RevPAR increasing by 7.5% in the fourth quarter. The Manchester Grand Hyatt benefited for having all of its meeting phase available for bookings after renovations last year. In addition, our managers in San Diego strategically focused on group business at the expense of transient room nights to drive the hotels overall average rate. In the quarter, group demand increased 7.3% and transient room nights fell 9.8%. As Hotels filled with group business, it enabled our managers to become more aggressive with average rates which resulted in group and transient average rate growth of 9.2% and 7.5% respectively. Overall, group revenues increased by more than 17%, contributing to food and beverage revenue increase of nearly 18% while transient revenues declined 3%. I should point out that nearly all of the increase in food and beverage came from the more profitable banquet and catering business. We expect the trend of our San Diego hotels outperforming the portfolio to continue in 2016. Even though the city is expected to have fewer city-wide this year, total room night from the city-wide is expected to increase by more than 20%. In Boston, our assets outperformed the portfolio average with a RevPAR increase of 6.9% driven by an occupancy gain of 3.5% coupled with an average rate increase of 1.9%. In October group room nights with properties in the market grew at 24.4% with a 3.5% increase in average rate. Again, this helps contribute to an 18% increase in food and beverage revenues this quarter. As we look forward to 2016, I would note that although the Boston market is expected to have an average number of city-wide, the high-end convention center is expected to host five additional events. This bodes well for both, our Boston Marriott and Sheraton Boston Hotels as we expect these hotels to benefit from these additional events and lead our Boston Hotels to post solid results in 2016. Moving to some of our markets that witnessed some weakness in the quarter. RevPAR at our hotels in DC increased 0.6% with average rate growth of 1.6% and an occupancy decline of 70 basis points. The main reason for our properties in the markets underperform in the star upper-upscale market by 250 basis points was due to a combination of a lack of in-house groups and softer transient business. In 2016, the number of city-wide events is flat to 2015. However, the number of city-wide room nights is up approximately 85,000 over last year. For 2016, the group booking phase for our DC hotels looks very strong, and many of these hotels are expected to benefit from substantial renovations that were completed in 2015. Unfortunately, RevPAR at our assets in Houston declined 1.1%. However, the good news is our properties outperformed the star upper-upscale markets by 690 basis points. The decline in the market continues to be attributable to an overall slowdown in the Houston economy as a result of severely depressed oil prices, increasing market supply, and specifically for Host, the renovation of the Houston Marriott Medical Center Hotel. Our managers continue to focus on growing group room nights to offset the transient decline caused by weaker market fundamentals. We do not expect Houston's market conditions to improve in 2016, therefore we expect these hotels to continue underperforming the portfolio. Bear in mind, that the hotels in the Houston market represent only 2% of our total EBITDA. Likewise, our New York hotels experienced a 2.4% RevPAR decline in the fourth quarter, slightly outperforming in the star upper-upscale market RevPAR decline of 2.5%. Much of the weakness was due to average rate which decreased 2% although occupancy declined 40 basis points. These results continue to indicate that the well understood supply in the market, and a decrease in demand from international travelers due to the strength of the U.S. dollar are impacting the overall market's ability to raise rates. We expect RevPAR in New York to significantly like the portfolio in 2016 and acknowledge that the dynamics that impacted the market in 2015 will likely persist this year. Moving to our international assets, these hotels had an impressed -- and are impressed with constant dollar RevPAR growth of 15.5% in the quarter. Latin America drove much of the international growth with a constant dollar RevPAR increase of 39%. This growth was spurred by the benefit of the renovated hotels of the JW Marriott Mexico City. Despite economic turmoil related to weakness in the global oil markets and tourism as is related to Zika virus in Brazil, the JW Marriott Rio added an outstanding quarter. As we continue to simplify the portfolio through non-core asset sales above Latin America and Asia Pacific, we expect that EBITDA impact from our international hotels to decline. Shifting to our European joint venture. Despite the negative impact of the terrorist attacks in Paris, and the subsequent lockdown in Brussels, our assets in the region performed relatively well with a constant Euro RevPAR increase of 1.7% for the quarter as the significant decline in RevPAR at the hotels in these two markets were more than offset by the robust growth of more than 10% at the hotels in our other European markets. The RevPAR increase was due to an increase in average rate of over 6% which was offset by a decline in occupancy of about three percentage points. As occupancies for both transient and group business decline, it is encouraging to see that our managers were able to increase transient and group rates in the quarter by 6% and 10% respectively. There are some certainties surrounding 2016 in light of the 2015 Paris attacks and the economic and political recovery that is ongoing in the European Union. However, many positive market fundamentals exist, including the fact that supply remains low in Europe at approximately 1%. The weak Euro to the U.S. dollar will likely drive demand from the U.S. to Europe, and the economic environment in Europe is cautiously optimistic. Now let's move to our forecast for 2016. With respect to the RevPAR guidance we gave today, a 3% to 4% for the portfolio, it is worth noting that we expect 13 of our top 17 domestic market to experience RevPAR growth that will exceed the high-end of our portfolio RevPAR forecast. These markets are expected to perform well based on advance group bookings, less capital disruptions, and lower supply. In fact, we expect some of our best performing markets will be Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Atlanta and New Orleans. However, the challenges in New York and Houston will continue in 2016. Other factors to keep in mind for 2016 are the calendar shift as these will affect the overall quarterly results. Houston moves for the first quarter and the Jewish holidays move to the fourth quarter this year. This has reflected in our group bookings as they are strongest in the second and third quarters, but still positive in all four quarters. We expect approximately 22% to 22.5% of our total EBITDA for the year to be generated in the first quarter. As disclosed in our press release, during the fourth quarter we repurchased 19.6 million shares for a total purchase price of $325 million bringing the total for 2015 to 38.3 million shares of common stock with a total purchase price of approximately $675 million. We currently have $325 million of capacity under the repurchase program. With respect to dividends, we paid a regular fourth quarter dividend at $0.20 per share which represents a yield of 5.4% on the current stock price. Further, as stated in today's press release, the Board of Directors authorized the regular first quarter dividend at $0.20 per share on its counted stock. Given our strong operating outlook and significant free cash flow generation, we are committed to sustaining a meaningful dividend. In addition, based on the robust asset sale plan we've outlined and continue to execute on, we anticipate that asset sales will likely result in taxable gain which could lead to special dividends. While these special dividends will vary at a onetime distribution, they should resolve at a meaningfully return to our stockholders. Moving to one of our key pillars of strength and competitive advantage, our balance sheet. In 2015, we repaid or refinanced more than $1.4 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5% with proceeds from the issuance of $1.5 billion of debt with a weighted average rate of 3.1%. As a result of these transactions, we decreased our weighted average interest rate by 110 basis points or 3.7% and lowered our annualized interest expense by $24 million to $165 million, and extended our weighted average debt maturity from 5.8 years to 6 years. We have no significant maturities until 2019, and our operating position of financial strength and flexibility. At year-end we had approximately $239 million of cash, $702 million in available capacity under our revolving credit facility and $4 billion of debt while maintaining a leverage within our stated goals of 2.5X to 3X. In summary, we feel good about the results -- about our results and accomplishments in 2015 and look forward to a solid year of growth in 2016 as we believe the softness we witness in transient business in the fourth quarter will be offset by our aggressive asset management strategies and the tailwinds we received from our comprehensive capital program in 2015. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll move first to Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask you on the asset sales as you bring your assets to market, have you seen any surprises around the level of interest or the pricing that you're getting relative to expectations? Edward Walter : Not really Smedes but that's probably reflecting the fact that realistically since the summer it's been clear that the pool of buyers for assets, second half of '15 and into '16 is a bit smaller than where it was in 2014, primarily because the REITs [ph] are not aggressive buyers at this point in time. So I think we launched those particular sales was an understanding that we were appealing primarily to two groups; private buyers, often working with operators, and then international buyers who are probably also either using a good existing operators at hotel aligned with the new operator. And so with that I'd say that we have -- I think I've talked a little bit at the last call, interest has been solid, it's probably not as deep as it had been in the past but its still, and it's more than one person bidding on individual deals. I think we're getting very comfortable with the quality of the bids that we're getting. And we continue to feel comfortable that we'll continue to close sales than we're at the phase that we've been on. Smedes Rose : Okay. And then the other thing I just wanted to ask you is, it's a follow-up. You talked about group trends pacing up around 6% for 2016 on revenues. Have you seen anything over the last several months since your last call in terms of the tender of corporations willing to book group or kind of, just the pace relative to the -- kind of backdrop or the issues we've seen around economic growth. Edward Walter : All we have seen on the group side, really throughout '15 and then looking at '16 and at this time frankly, even looking further down the road into '17, it's good strong group booking. And it's carried all the way through last year, and we expect to see that continue this year. Smedes Rose : All right, thank you. Edward Walter : Thanks. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Harry Curtis with Nomura. Harry Curtis : Hi, good morning. A couple of quick questions. So it's a follow-up to Smedes question, year-to-date, to the extent that you've had any major conventions, can you talk about cancellations in attendance? Edward Walter : Harry, I don't think -- there is always adds and flows at individuals, I think Greg might have described a little bit of that but reality is that so far in terms of what we've been seeing over last couple of months is that we haven't seen any signs of weakness in attendance. Harry Curtis : Okay. And then my second question is, could you give us an assessment of the condition of your current portfolio, and specifically you did give us guidance as to how -- how much less you are going to be spending in 2016. As you look even further ahead, there is no budgeting done yet but do you think that your CapEx into 2017 can keep declining? Edward Walter : Our expectation at this point would be that 2017 would be at or it should be above where we in 2016. Our goal for the last two years has been that '16 and '17 would be lower CapEx years, I think it's still little hard to anticipate beyond that but we are expecting levels at similar to where we are on the maintenance CapEx side. And then as it relates to the -- where we would describe as our redevelopment CapEx, that will depend upon what projects we might identify for '17. At this stage I don't know that there is anything specifically on the book so if I had to predict today what would happen in '17, I would expect to see that spending decline. Harry Curtis : Yes, I guess what I was specifically asking also is that, it is just your qualitative assessment of your portfolio and are there any glaring CapEx requirements that you need to address? Edward Walter : I would think that the quality of our portfolio is quite good at this point in time. We have spent heavily on the portfolio over the course of the last several years. So when we measure the portfolio in terms of its effective age, it's that number is as attractive as it has ever been, looking at how recently have the rooms been done, how recently has the meeting space been done, how many lobbies of food and beverage outlets have been done. So I don't see that if I -- there is always going to be an App center too where we made a conscious decision not to do capital for a variety of reasons and some of those were the ones that we're intending on selling because we think that allowing the buyer to do that capital will ultimately enhance the total price that they'd be able to pay for the asset taking into account the CapEx that might be required. But outside of some, a handful of unique situations like that, our portfolio is in good shape and the fact that we're spending less this year and a little -- topmost likely next year, is not an indication of shorting the portfolio of capital that it needs, it's more of an indication of the fact that we're in good condition. Harry Curtis : Very good, thanks. Operator : And we'll now take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Great, thanks. I wonder if you could quantify in your RevPAR guidance we have 3% to 4%. How much of that is held by the renovations, you mentioned, those four properties that had significant renovations, and I think you'd initially expected Q4 RevPAR in '15 to be your best RevPAR quarter for the year because of those renovations. So I assume some of the 3% to 4% or I don't know if you have that sort of fully adjusted not including benefit of the renovations. Edward Walter : Yeah, let me try to provide some clarity on that, because in a couple of the write ups that I saw this morning, I could tell that folks weren't exactly following the differences between some of these assets. So most specifically the four assets that I referenced when I was talking about the ones that are going to have a significant improvement on a year-over-year basis, so the Logan in Philly, the Camby in Phoenix, the Houston Airport Marriott and the Axiom in San Francisco. All of those hotels are for our RevPAR purposes and are forecast non-comparable. So the incredible increase in revenues that we will see at those hotels is not included in our RevPAR forecast. And so that's one of the reasons why I think people -- we are getting the list from that and we are trying to describe the list that we're getting from an EBITDA perspective, but the benefits of that are not showing up in our comparable RevPAR numbers. Those numbers will not likely show up until most likely '17 when those projects have been in our portfolio, operating on \u2013 stabilized fashion, but operating as a completed hotel for a full year. So we'll see the list in '17 from those assets but we're not going to see any list in our '16 reported RevPAR from those assets. Robin Farley : But I guess you had other renovations as well during the year last year, and your guidance for Q4 you had originally said that the RevPAR would benefit in Q4 would be the best of the four quarters because of renovation. So even if it's not those four specific sort of major, were you close the property at the time, can you talk about the benefits of renovations that other property might be included? Edward Walter : Robin, I think we did see some -- we did expect to see some benefit in the fourth quarter from the less construction disruptions. So you're right about that. And I would say that in the end I don't know \u2013 our RevPAR came in but while we had anticipated it. And I think that was not unique to us, that was really an industry wide phenomenon. We did see pick up at a number of the properties that were under renovation. I don't know that we would necessarily view it as overly significant in the fourth quarter. A lot of those renovations had started at the very end of the quarter and frankly with December being a low occupancy month, I don't know that we necessarily saw as much as benefit in '15 as we might have anticipated. We will see some \u2013 and some positive benefits from that in the first half of the year, and I suspect that one of the reasons why our portfolio performed so much better than the industry in January, despite the fact that we had even with the winter storm that hit the northeast, it's impart due to the fact that we had -- we did not have as much renovation activity at some of those hotels. Robin Farley : Okay. That's great. Thank you for clarifying. And then just lastly real quick, you mentioned your maintenance CapEx, renewal replacement CapEx is going to be down $60 million in '16. It looks like in Q4 it came in like close to $35 million or $40 million higher than what you had guided to for renewal replacement in Q4. So is some of that -- is that just may be a timing issue that some of the renewal replacement CapEx came in to Q4 that was originally planned for '16? Edward Walter : Yeah, I would say that it was probably -- the short answer is yes. So I think some of that probably had more to do with the timing of when payments were made as opposed to necessarily when the work was completed. But the short answer is yes. Robin Farley : Okay. Thank you. Edward Walter : Thanks. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Shaun Kelly from Bank of America Shaun Kelly : Hey, good morning guys. Ed, in your prepared remarks you mentioned a little bit more detail on supply growth and how that sort of overlays with the demand environment that you're seeing out there, particularly in some of the urban areas. I was curious if you could just dig in on that a little bit more for us. I mean how generally do you guys seek to react or do you try and manage the portfolio in an environment where the demand may -- on the one side demand is at peak levels, but on the other side, demand may actually not keep up with the supply growth that you are seeing, at least in a handful of markets. Edward Walter : Yeah, I'd say some of them -- there are two ways to look at this, one element of this is we look down the road and as we anticipate markets might see increased supply that does play into some of the decisions we make relative to whether that we retain the asset or we try to market it. So there is a sort of a long strategic perspective that addresses that. As we look at it from a more near term operating perspective, if we see markets that are likely to get additional supply and we think that could may have an impact on our property, so that may guide some of our strategies in those markets relative to the level of group that we would want and the level of say special corporate business that we might try to attract for that individual hotel. So in the markets where we've seen, such as in New York, there is no secret that New York's had a lot of supply. And we have consciously tried to improve the level of group activity that we do in that market as a way to offset some of the increased supply that we expect to see. Shaun Kelly : That's really helpful. Thank you very much. Edward Walter : Thanks. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Anthony Powell : Hi. Good morning. One more question on group. How did it in the quarter/for the quarter, group bookings track in 4Q and how do you expect that part of the business trend going forward? Edward Walter : I don't know that I have that number right here in front of me. I would say that in the quarter, for the quarter was probably -- I'd rather not guess. I know the bookings in the quarter for '16 were solid and we're running north of 4.5%, so the activity that we have looking for the future was quite good. The way the fourth quarter played out, my guess is that the end of quarter/for the quarter bookings were not particularly strong, but the reason for that was the bulk of the group strength which really in the first five to six weeks in the quarter. It was -- October was filled, because you'd have the movement in the holiday, the Jewish holiday comes from October to prior year in the September. So October was a very busy month, but there wasn't really any capacity at the hotels to take a lot of additional group. And once we got beyond that period of time, you're really at a stage during the year where there is not a lot of group pick up in general. So I think that the activity in the fourth quarter was not particularly remarkable in the quarter/for the quarter, but it continued to be strong for the future. Greg Larson : '16 as Ed mentioned, but also for '17 as well. Anthony Powell : All right. Got it. And I think earlier you mentioned that OTA rate was down in the fourth quarter. How are you approaching your OTA kind of allocations in '16 an what are the operators doing I guess to reduce industry reliance on OTAs going forward? Edward Walter : I'd say that in general, because the hotels are running at high occupancies and because the operators especially the major operators are refining their strategies in terms of their relationships with the OTAs, we're generally seeing that business the rate of growth there is smaller than some of the other segments. I think what we ran into the fourth quarter was because we did see what it is generally assumed to be some weakness in corporate travel, there was a little bit more use of OTA options than we had necessarily predicted and what you saw with that was slightly lower pricing in an effort to attract more of that business. So the good news is we were able to get occupancy by opening up those channels through a greater degree, but unfortunately when you watched all that broke across the country, some of that was at a lower rate than what we had done the prior year. Anthony Powell : All right. And a small follow up to that question, as you're striding[ph] towards corporate negotiated rates, you mentioned that they're higher, how do you kind of avoid to replay them back in coming quarters? Thank you. Edward Walter : Well, it's hard to -- it's obviously hard to stimulate demand the corporate travel and history has shown us in prior times that you don't stimulate that demand by dropping price. So I think the way our approach was to generally across the portfolio, focus on look at the different assets and take into account the market factors in individual markets. And then look to try to generate, take advantage of the high occupancies to generate better rate growth in those corporate negotiations, but also firm up in markets where you thought you wanted it some additional accounts. To put some math around that, what we're looking at on kind of a comparable basis in the beginning of the year is it our special corporate rates at least looking at things that apply in the first quarter up north of 5%, and last year we were more in the 3% range. So there's a nice opportunity there to see some better results because of improved special corporate rates. Anthony Powell : All right. Thanks a lot for all that color. Edward Walter : Thanks. Operator : And we'll move next to Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity. Ryan Meliker : Hey, good morning guys. Most of my questions have been answered but first of all thanks for a lot of the color on the guidance and how the renovations are playing out. Just one quick question I had regarding Group Pace. Obviously, I think 3Q your Group Pace was up 6.5%, it held steady around that level for 2016. But what we saw in January from the STR data was Group was off dramatically only up about 1.5%. Is that indicative across your portfolio too? And is that just have to do with the timing that you talked about with some of the calendar shifts, but I know they haven't materialized yet, but you are seeing those sluggish Group out of the gate for the first quarter for your portfolio and for the broader industry? Edward Walter : So not entirely, we actually saw \u2013 I don't have the segment results yet for January, but based on the bookings that we were anticipating and I don't have any indication to think that it turned out radically different from it. We were expecting better than what you described in terms of Group Pace in January and frankly in February, the month that is weaker for us in Group on a year-over-year is March and that's I think solely because of the change in the Easter holiday timing. So I think we commented in our prepared remarks, the first quarter and the fourth quarter are slightly weak, if you spread our group activity across the year, Q1 and Q2 are still both up, but they're not up as much as Q2 and Q2 and Q3 which are up significantly in terms of revenue pace. Greg Larson : You said Q1 and Q4 was the two weak and Q2 and Q3 are the two strong. Ryan Meliker : Right. So I guess the question that I would have is do you think that some of your group's outperformance in the first quarter is more driven by some of the renovations and the types of assets that you have and revenue management strategies or do you think that it's not so anomalistic in favor of your portfolio. I'm just trying to get a gage of where group business is throughout the remainder of the year, not just for you guys but for the broader industry in case we're seeing any type of pull back. Edward Walter : I think across the industry I'm continuing from everyone that group is fairly solid, but I'm sure that we are benefiting a bit from the fact that we have less renovation activity and we have hotels that were under construction last year and now are providing either new rooms or new meeting space and it's attractive to our customers. So I'm sure again going back to our January performance, I'd say some of that is reflective of t fact that we had space available and not under construction. Ryan Meliker : All right. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. Edward Walter : Thanks. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Steven Kent : Hi, good morning. Just a quick question, it sounds like bookings, just mentioned good shape occupancy expectations and banquet. Why is the margin outlook only up a modest 0 to 40 basis points? Are we missing something on the expense side, because it sounds like you should get some better flow through? And then just as an aside, just because I think it's an interesting issue that we're starting to hear from some of the other companies, are you seeing any last minute or late bookers cancelling and rebooking other places? Are you starting to see some of that activity or more term than you've seen before? Edward Walter : Steve, as -- going to your second question first, we have generally seen that problem in a variety of markets, but we have not identified that in discussions with our operators as the situations that had accelerated in the fourth quarter. We have also been actively encouraging our operators and of course this is one place where working with a lot of the major operators is probably helpful for us to push towards pricing strategies that in effect, creates some frictional cost around changing reservations at the last minute. And we will continue to encourage that they look at either non-refundable rooms or extending the time period for when you have to cancel in order to make it more difficult for people to reserve a room with us for a long period of time and then change their mind at the last minute and rebook elsewhere. But Steve to your fundamental point, we did not see an acceleration of that activity in the fourth quarter. On the margin piece of it, I'd say that some of the fact that the margins \u2013 there's no real expense that we necessarily have highlighted that would drive weaker margin performance. We still expect if values continue to increase the hotels and there's a little bit of a \u2013 that real-estate taxes will be jumping by more than inflation on a year-over-year basis. But beyond that \u2013 Greg Larson : Steve, I guess the one other point I would look at is if you look at our results for 2015, we had 3.8% RevPAR growth and 20 basis points improvement in margins. If you adjust those two things, items or you sally we really had 4% of RevPAR with margins up 35 basis points. And so that's pretty similar to our guidance, right? If you look at the high end of our guidance, we're projecting 4% RevPAR and margins up 40 basis points. Steven Kent : Okay, thank you. Edward Walter : Thanks. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Rich Hightower : Hey, good morning guys. Edward Walter : Good morning. Rich Hightower : Just wanted to head back on the guidance for a second here, so I'm curious for what the 3% to 4% range implies for the transient side of the business if Group Pace is up around 6%, I know that includes some of the renovation, so it's not a true same store number. But just sort of what the bridge is between that and the transient implied figure would be very helpful. Edward Walter : I guess what I would say was that is that it wouldn't surprise us if we're up north of 6% right now in terms of group. As we -- because we've sold so many rooms already to potential group customers, it wouldn't surprise us that as we work our way through the year, that the actual increase in group revenue that we experienced by the end of the year would be a smaller number than that. In other words, not have normal, see some follow up in that area especially with an extended booking cycle. So my guess is that as we report group revenues through the course of the year, the actual detail will be a little bit less than that. So that probably addresses the sum of what you're looking at. I would say more probably as may be as a more broad commentary on our guidance in general, our properties are more often -- than our guidance would necessarily reflect. And we do see some benefits whether it's the special corporate rates that I talked about before, the fact that our government rates are up, meaning year-over-year, while that's not a huge chunk of our business, it's one more place where you see some rate increases. I have a number of factors like that that will help with transient pricing. We're not expecting a lot of transient occupancy increase, we think it will be primarily a rate game this year. If we -- I think you're right in your sort of fundamental assumption that as if we hit our numbers, here is the projections that we've identified. We'd probably see a bit slightly more weighted towards group and slightly less weighted towards transient in terms of revenue growth. Rich Hightower : Okay, so the group number should still outpace the transient revenue number in any case? Edward Walter : That would be our expectation for now, yes. Rich Hightower : Okay. I mean I guess just as a follow up to that, the range of 3% to 4% in this stage in the year is pretty tight, only a 100 basis, you just have enough business on the book. You think at this point too to peg such a tight range at this point in the calendar? Edward Walter : There are as many people in the room with that many theories on how to approach guidance. I guess what I'd say is the way we look at it, we're trying to give you our best insight into how we think the year is going to play out, based on the information that we have available to us. And in the context of this year, we thought that we'd probably moved us to be on a hair on the conservative side. So that's why you see the range that we have. Rich Hightower : All right. Thank you, Ed. Operator : We'll now move next to Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group. Jim Sullivan : Thank you. Ed, just to kind of follow on from that last question as well as some of the comments you made in the prepared commentary part of the call. Your \u2013 supply and demand suggest that the negative impact of supply growth will increase over the course of the year. Now we've heard what you've said about the group outlook in Q2 and Q3, but does that mean overall given the supply growth will increase over the course of the year that you expect RevPAR growth overall to be weaker in the second half than the first half? Edward Walter : Not necessarily, Jim because at least as we look at group, the strongest quarter for group booking is in actually Q3. And so I don't necessarily expect that that's what's going to happen. I don't know that in a lot of these markets, the supply necessarily accelerates through the second half of the year, but that's one of the things that we'll need to see how that actually plays out. What we've been noticing in a number of markets is that the outlook for supply, in each of t last few years what's expected to be delivered at the beginning of the year and what's actually delivered by the end of the year turns out to be a lower number because the deliveries don't happen at the same pace as originally forecasted. So that might help mitigate that. But I'd say, at this stage as we look at the year, the only reason why I might anticipate that the first half could be a little stronger than the second half that it relate to construction disruption because we had more in the first half than we had in the second half. But based on the discussions we've been having so far, it feels like it's a fairly balanced year. Jim Sullivan : Okay. And then in your prepared comments on the markets and I may have missed this -- I don't recall your commenting on the outlook for San Francisco and Denver? Edward Walter : I think San Francisco, we're generally expecting to be roughly in line with the rest of the portfolio, so maybe not the outperformer that it has been for the last few years but sort of certainly not in a level where it's going to be a significant underperformer either, there is no doubt that there is some challenges in that market due to the fact of the convention centers been closed. The booking pace at our hotels is still up compared to last year, it's not up as much as the overall portfolio but we're fortunate that the big hotel there, the San Francisco Marquis is essentially just doing a lot of in-house grew business to deal with the fact that the convention center will have more closings. Gregory Larson : And Jim, as I said, 13 of our 17 markets based on the group booking and the supply, and some of the other metrics that we mentioned, I said in my prepared remarks it would actually exceed the high-end of our guidance. So San Francisco certainly would be one of those hotels that are included in those 13 markets. Denver as you know in the fourth quarter for us has actually experienced a decline in RevPAR. We think it will turn positive in '16 but I would think Denver would be sort of close -- closer to call the midpoint to the high-end of our guidance. Edward Walter : And Denver is one of those markets where we do have some construction going on, it's not a big market for us but we built one hotel, it's a redevelopment hotel and the other has some meeting space being worked on. Jim Sullivan : Okay then finally for me, in terms of the dispositions that you've have under letter of intent. It would be helpful to know if those that are out of the wholly-owned segment of the portfolio or if they are the joint ventures? Edward Walter : All of the assets that were described there were consolidated assets. In one instance there is a partner with a minority ownership piece but they are all consolidated assets. Jim Sullivan : Okay, very good. Thank you. Edward Walter : Great. Thanks Jim. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Hi, quick question on Houston. I know it's a small part, I think you said EBITDA but if you look at the rate of growth, it improved meaningfully in the fourth quarter, it was off of a bit, much tougher comp in the fourth quarter of '15 and what you saw in the first three quarters? But can you just help us think about 2016 as we sit to lap, at least initial drop in our oil prices? Thanks. Edward Walter : Yes, I'd say we still expect where Houston is one of the markets that we think is going to be challenged in 2016 and I think it's the toss up, it's the weather RevPAR there is slightly negative or flat. Gregory Larson : I agree with that. I mean, look, the one interesting thing about Houston, not compared to group markets but the group bookings page in Houston '16 is actually quite strong. Thomas Allen : Helpful, thank you. And then just, in terms of your current dividend, you've been paying $0.20 for seven quarters now. You talked a little bit about potential onetime dividends but how are you thinking about the recurring dividend as we sit here today? Edward Walter : Yes, I would say in the long run that our goal is to distribute our taxable income and so when we -- from operations, of course, also from sales. And as we work our way through this year and see both how operating results materialize, as well as what's the level of sales that we complete, we will continue to assess whether we should be doing increasing the raise over dividend or handling things through special dividend. Some of that decision will be tied into our outlook for '17 too as we try to confront that question. We ultimately are certainly interested in being able to increase the dividend when operations -- when the operating results for the company is supported because we'd love to return capital to shareholders in any way that we can. Thomas Allen : Thank you. Edward Walter : Thanks. Operator : And we'll now take our next question from David Lowe [ph] with Baird. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. Ed, you've talked a lot about group and how strong it looks. Can you just give a little background on what you think is driving that? Is it tight employment for white collar workers? And do you have any concerns about weakness in certain industries like energy or emerging weakness in financials or technology? Edward Walter : We're happy to do that David, let me just look at one back here. The wildcard in group over the years has tended to be what I think you're directing your question at, which is what's happening on the corporate side. And what we saw this past year was fairly good, we saw some improvement on the -- in terms of association but as I mentioned in my prepared comments, it's also really good corporate rate improvement as well as some improvement in corporate demand in the fourth quarter. And I think what we're looking at in terms of why we've seen an improvement in group page this year is the combination of slight -- probably a slightly better convention calendar which is -- will reflect itself and is slight increase in association business across all of our hotels. But more importantly, more activity coming out of the corporate side and companies recognizing that they are going to have events and they are now of the mind that they are convinced enough that they are going to have them, that they are making the decisions to book those events in advance and not wait till the last minute because what they've realized is if they wait till the last minute, they are not going to end up with the time or the hotel that they want. So I just -- we work our way through this year while it's fair to assume that there will be some pick up in association business, I'm hopeful that we're going to see good strong corporate growth. That also tends to tying with the fact that we're -- it could reflect itself in terms of better F&B growth too. So I think ultimately, because the corporate group is that adds inflows the most based upon the overall economy, the fact that we're seeing that strong growth is likely, primarily due to strong corporate growth. I'm sure that the oil industry picking a point about different businesses, I'm sure the oil industry with all the challenges that they have is not necessarily booking as many group events as they might have in the past. So it is sort of interesting to see, as Greg just referenced, how strong our group booking pace is in Houston, I suspect that has more to do with a smaller overall group profile for this hotel. But I don't know that we've heard of any other industry besides the energy industry that's cutting back at this point. If anything our numbers would again as we suggest that, they are not only strong for '16, they are strong for '17. That suggest that there is a bit of meaningful level of confidence in companies that are making commitments. Unidentified Analyst : Very helpful, thank you. One more, can you give an update on the W Union Square, you acquired your partner's interest for the beginning of the year. Are you now looking to sell that asset? Edward Walter : That would certainly be one of the assets in New York that we would be open for selling, yes. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And another one of those is the WNLX [ph]? Edward Walter : If that would be an asset that we would be interested in selling, I would say that that's not on the market at the moment but that is another asset in New York that we would certainly be open to selling. The opportunity in New York in order to get this sort of pricing that tends to make the headlines is to take advantage of assets where there is either an opportunity for a brand change, where there is an opportunity for redevelopment, that's where it seems you could -- that's where you can best take advantage of the property that you own. And so those are the sorts of opportunities that we're trying to explore. We -- it is certainly in that $800 million of assets that we're currently marketing that does include the New York asset, and completing a sale in New York continues to be a very high priority for the company provided we can attract pricing that we think is appropriate. Unidentified Analyst : So on the W-Union Square, is that -- are you able to rebrand that on-sale? Edward Walter : There is flexibility on that asset with respect to management and branding. Unidentified Analyst : Great, helpful. Thank you. Edward Walter : Thanks. Operator : And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Walter for any additional or closing remarks. Edward Walter : Great. Well, thank you for joining us on the call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our year-end results and outlook with you. And we look forward to talking with you in the spring to discuss our first quarter results and provide you more insights into how 2016 is playing out. Thank you. Operator : And once again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation.",

Baird & Co. Kris Trafton - Credit Suisse Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets Operator : Good day and welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts Incorporated First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Gee Lingberg : Thanks, Eric. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts first quarter 2016 earnings call. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we're not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in today's earnings press release, and our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our first quarter results, and then we'll discuss our disposition and redevelopment activity, as well as our Company's outlook for 2016. Greg will then provide greater detail on our first quarter performance by markets. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now I would like to turn the call over to Ed. Edward Walter : Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report that 2016 is off to a solid start on multiple fronts. Less disruption from renovation allowed our hotels to outperform the industry on the topline in the quarter and contributed to better-than-expected improvements in margins and profitability. We also continue to make progress on the initiatives we commenced in 2015 to position Host Hotels for continued growth and value creation, including the disposition of non-core assets and returning capital to shareholders. Let's start with a review of our results. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $345 million, which reflects an increase of 7.5% over last year, and which exceeded both our expectations and consensus estimates. Our first quarter adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.41, exceeding consensus estimates and reflecting a 17% increase over last year. These results were driven by several factors. First, demand growth in our portfolio was quite strong, as comparable hotel occupancy grew by 2.1 percentage points, allowing the portfolio to achieve 75.5% occupancy, which represents our highest Q1 occupancy rate since 2000. While we attribute roughly half of this occupancy growth to the reduced levels of construction disruption, overall it still reflects solid demand growth for our hotels. When combined with average rate growth of 0.7%, the comparable hotel portfolio achieved RevPAR growth 3.6% in constant currency, which exceeded the industry luxury upper-upscale average by 170 basis points. The strong demand growth we experienced was driven primarily by our transient segments. Our transient demand, reduced for the effect of the extra day related to leap year, was up 5%, with solid improvements across all segments other than special corporate. Transient demand growth was the highest in February and March, with the latter aided by the early Easter holiday, which accelerated spring break travel. Conversely, our Group business experienced a demand decrease of slightly more than 2% for the quarter, which was generally caused by a very weak March, driven by the shift in the Easter holiday. In what we viewed as a favorable sign, corporate group actually increased 2.7% during the quarter. However, that increase was offset by a slight decline in association business and a larger decline in other group, which related in part to the change in the venue of the NBA All-Star game from New York in 2015 to Toronto in 2016. Strong increases in corporate group rates helped drive an overall group ADR increase of 1.8%, which translated into a slight increase in total group revenues. The expected lower level of group activity contributed to a moderate comparable hotel F&B revenue growth of just 1%, as banquet growth increased slightly less than 1% and outlets grew by 1.4%. We expect these growth levels to improve going forward as group activity picks up again in subsequent quarters. With other revenue growth improving by 3.7%, overall revenue grew by 3.2%. As Greg will describe in more detail, lower utility costs and the implementation of new operating methods allowed us to increase comparable hotel EBITDA margins by 90 basis points, which exceeded our expectations and contributed to solid hotel EBITDA growth of 6.8%. As we've discussed on prior calls, we are very focused on actively managing our portfolio and efficiently allocating capital. We continue to make good progress on our asset sales program, with three asset sales completed during the first quarter, generating proceeds of over $120 million. We have five additional assets under contract, representing gross proceeds of $340 million, with closings anticipated during the second quarter. Given our general goal of upgrading the portfolio as we complete these sales, it is worth noting that the average RevPAR of these sold or under contract hotels is $112, which falls far short of our first quarter portfolio average of $166. In addition to these expected dispositions, we are currently marketing roughly another $0.5 billion worth of assets. While the market is not as robust as last year, we are seeing some signs of improvement in the debt markets and believe that we will be successful in selling additional hotels through the remainder of the year, assuming current market conditions continue. As we have previously discussed, these asset sales will generate tax gains which will likely require a special dividend at year-end. Given that our current stock price is trading at a meaningful discount to NAV, we believe that the primary use of sale proceeds in excess of dividend and debt repayment requirements is to buy back our stock. We repurchased an additional $81 million in stock this quarter, bringing our total to $758 million since the institution of our initial program in April of last year. In combination with our recent dividend payment, we have returned more than $230 million to shareholders in the last 60 days. Now let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2016. As I mentioned, our results in Q1 exceeded our expectations and we continue to anticipate even stronger results in Q2 and Q3. Given that our group revenue pace in these two quarters is up more than 6.5%, and the generally high occupancies we typically run during those months, usually in excess of 80%, should help drive better improvement in ADR. At this point, we anticipate that we will experience a more muted but still positive fourth quarter, as the Jewish holiday shift and nationwide election night will reduce group demand, and the traditionally lower occupancy occupancies in the fourth quarter could restrain rate growth. Looking at comparable hotel RevPAR on a full-year perspective, we remain very comfortable with our full-year range of 3% to 4%. Given our strong first quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin growth, we are increasing our range of full-year improvement to 25 to 65 basis points. This would translate to a full-year adjusted EBITDA of $1.440 billion to $1.475 billion FFO per share of $1.65 to $1.69. It is important to note that our EBITDA estimate for the year was previously reduced by $14 million for the sales that we had closed or under contract in February, and it has been reduced by an incremental $16 million today for the additional sales we have identified. Had we not placed these latter assets under contract, our EBITDA range would have increased by approximately $9 million at the midpoint from our prior guidance? That being said, we are confident that we are taking a disciplined approach to portfolio management and continuing to dispose of non-core assets will better position us in the long run for future growth and success. In summary, we are very pleased with our strong first quarter results and remain confident about our outlook for the remainder of 2016. With that, I will turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in much greater detail. Gregory Larson : Thank you, Ed. Overall, we are pleased with our solid results this quarter. The domestic markets that outperformed the portfolio were San Francisco, Los Angeles, DC, and Atlanta, while Latin America was the outperformer in our international markets. Several of our hotels in markets such as Denver, Boston, San Diego, Phoenix ,and Chicago had a slower start, but are expected to improve throughout the rest of the year. First, I will provide some specific commentary on our major markets. Our hotels in San Francisco had an impressive quarter, with RevPAR growing 12.5% on a difficult comp of 15.4% growth last year. San Francisco hosted the Super Bowl this quarter, and all of the RevPAR growth came from double-digit ADR gains, for a total increase in ADR of 12.7%. In addition, occupancy remained stable at a very high 80%. However, we expect the expansion of the Moscone Convention Center will negatively impact the San Francisco hotels for the remainder of 2016. As a result, our San Francisco hotels may underperform our portfolio in the remaining quarters. RevPAR at our properties in Los Angeles grew at 12.2% in the first quarter, driven by an 8.7% increase in ADR and a 2.6 percentage point increase in occupancy to 83.2%. A solid group base at our Marina Del Rey Ritz-Carlton and Marriott hotels, strong transient demand at several of our other hotels, and tailwinds from the Newport Beach, Bayview and Westin South Coast Plaza renovations last year drove a RevPAR increase this quarter. Looking forward, group booking pace in Los Angeles looks very strong, as the market is expected to host additional citywides this year. As a result, we expect good performance from our Los Angeles properties. Despite the negative impact of the major East Coast snowstorm in January, RevPAR at our DC hotels increased 7.3%, significantly outperforming the STAR upper-upscale RevPAR increase of only 0.4%. This increase was primarily driven by a 4.3 percentage point increase in occupancy, as well as average rate growth of 0.7%. Several of our DC hotels benefited from renovations completed last year. Based on strong group booking pace for these hotels, combined with our expectations that we will continue to see benefits from our completed renovation, we expect our properties in DC to achieve solid results in the second quarter. In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 5.2% for the quarter as a result of average rate growth of 3.5% and occupancy increase of 1.2 percentage point. Our hotel operator successfully executed on their strategy to grow weekend and [show their] room night. With supply in the market well below the historical average and strong group revenues on the books for the second quarter, we expect our assets in Atlanta to continue to outperform the portfolio in the second quarter. Shifting to markets that underperformed the portfolio this quarter, Denver was the worst performing market in the portfolio with a RevPAR decline of 2.8%. We primarily attribute this to the renovations at the Westin Denver Hotel and a supply increase in the downtown corridor, which is impacting the hotel's ability to drive rate and occupancy. Despite these factors, our Denver hotels outpaced the STAR upper-upscale result by 90 basis points. We expect results to improve at our hotels in Denver in the second quarter.  Our Boston hotels experienced a RevPAR decline of 1.9% in the first quarter, driven entirely by a rate decrease of 3%, while occupancy improved 80 basis points. A decrease in citywides this quarter caused our hotel operators shift from higher rated group business to lower rated transient business. The entire Boston market was challenged, as evidenced by the STAR upper-upscale RevPAR decline of 30 basis points. We anticipate that with additional citywide events scheduled at the Hynes Convention Center for the remainder of the year, results at our Boston hotels will strengthen going forward. RevPAR at our assets in San Diego declined 80 basis points this quarter due to the renovation of the Coronado Marriott and a higher mix of lower rated group business to offset a shortage of citywide room nights. Despite the slow start in San Diego, we expect the hotels in this market will strengthen through the rest of 2016, as the city is expected to benefit from an increase in citywide room nights for the remainder of the year, especially in the third quarter. Moving to Phoenix, hotel RevPAR increased 10 basis points in the quarter due to the difficult comparison of the Super Bowl benefit last year. Despite that, we outperformed the STAR upper-upscale RevPAR by 70 basis points. Phoenix is another market with supply still projected to be below the historical average. That, combined with a strong booking pace for the second and fourth quarters, should translate to our properties outperforming our portfolio for the rest of the year. Our hotels in Florida underperformed the portfolio with a RevPAR increase of only 40 basis points. Milder weather in the Midwest and Northeast, plus cold weather in January and February in Florida, the media coverage of the Zika virus, decrease in international travel, and continued new supply hampered growth in the first quarter. Based on the weakness experienced in the first quarter, we anticipate our hotels in Florida to underperform the portfolio in the second quarter. While RevPAR at our Chicago assets improved just 30 basis points, our properties outperformed the STAR upper-upscale market by 860 basis points due to the benefits from room renovations at several of our hotels in 2015. The Chicago market was negatively impacted by a 53% decline in citywide room nights this quarter. Citywide room nights continue to decline in the market. However, we expect to benefit from strong in-house groups, which will result in improved performance at our Chicago hotels going forward. Despite the negative impact of the January snowstorm, the abundant new supply, our New York hotels experienced a positive 0.6% increase in RevPAR in the first quarter, outperforming the STAR upper-upscale market RevPAR decline of 2.1%. Our hotel managers in New York changed their strategy and began to add wholesale transient business three months out, which helped boost occupancy by 4.3% in a challenging rate environment. In addition, the New York Airport Marriott benefited from last year's renovation. Going forward, the New York market is expected to remain challenged as it continues to absorb new supply and, as a result, our hotels will likely underperform the portfolio in the second quarter. Moving to our international assets, these hotels had an impressive constant dollar RevPAR growth of 9.6% in the quarter. Latin America drove much of the international growth, with a constant dollar RevPAR increase of 22%, primarily from pre-Olympic test business in Rio. The Group booking pace our hotels in Rio due to the upcoming Olympics this summer, although demand in Brazil could be impacted by the potential presidential impeachment, continued weakness in oil, and concerns over Zika. Shifting to our European joint venture, terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels negatively impacted our results, with a RevPAR decline of 3.1% in constant euros this quarter. Negative results in Paris, Brussels, and London were somewhat mitigated by positive results in Amsterdam, Berlin, Barcelona, and Madrid. We expect continued weakness in Paris, Brussels, and London as travel alerts and warnings continue to be issued. However, positive market fundamentals still exist in Europe, including the fact that supply remains low at approximately 1% and the weak euro to the U.S. dollar could drive demand from the US to Europe. Moving to our margins, our comparable EBITDA margin expansion of 90 basis points is very impressive; especially considering the majority of the RevPAR increase this quarter was attributable to occupancy growth. Part of this notable EBITDA margin growth is the result of our cost savings initiatives, such as time and motion studies to improve productivity at many of our hotels, as well as energy ROI projects. The third-party time and motion studies, combined with our internal initiatives, resulted in sustainable productivity improvements of 17 basis points this quarter. The utility cost decline was the result of the mild winter and favorable gas and electric prices, in addition to our properties beginning to realize the benefits of our cost-saving energy ROI initiatives. We have invested in numerous projects over the past year, from small projects such as the conversion to LED lighting and replacement of showerheads, to major projects such as solar panels in Maui, and steam-to-gas conversions in New York. In the first quarter, hotels that had completed energy ROI projects decreased their utility costs by approximately 16.5%, which is seven percentage points better than those hotels that did not have energy ROI projects. Given the positive margin results in the first quarter, we now expect 2016 comparable EBITDA margin to increase 25 to 65 basis points. We also expect approximately 29% to 30% of our total EBITDA to be generated in the second quarter. As discussed in our press release, during the first quarter, we repurchased 5.1 million shares for a total purchase price of $81 million. Since the inception of this share repurchase program in April 2015, we have now bought back 43.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $758 million. We currently have $242 million of capacity remaining under the repurchase program. In addition, we paid a regular first quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of 5.1% on the current stock price. Given our strong operating outlook and significant free cash flow generation, we are committed to sustaining a meaningful dividend. In addition, based on the disposition plan for non-core assets we have outlined and continue to execute on, we anticipate that asset sales will likely result in taxable gains, which could lead to a special dividend. While special dividends will vary and be one-time distributions, it should result in a meaningful return of capital to our stockholders. Moving to one of the key pillars of strength and competitive advantage, our balance sheet. We had approximately $234 million of cash and $4 billion of debt. We continue to maintain a leverage ratio as calculated under our credit facility of 2.8 times, which is approximately half that of our lodging peers, and one-third that of our REIT peers. Subsequent to quarter end, we drew on the credit facility to repay the $100 billion mortgage loan secured by the Hyatt Regency Reston hotel, bringing our encumbered properties to just three consolidated assets in Asia. Upon exiting the Asia market, we will no longer have any consolidated assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt. Finally, as we mentioned in today's press release, due to the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement regarding consolidation, we deconsolidated the partnership that owns the Harbor Beach Marriott and recasted the prior period to reflect the new treatment. As a result of the adoption, the operations of the property are no longer presented in other revenues on our income statement, and instead reported as a net amount in equity and earnings of affiliates. Therefore, revenues for the first quarter 2016 and 2015 exclude rental income of $15 million earned by the partnership. However, the adoption does not affect net income, adjusted EBITDA, or adjusted FFO. In summary, we are pleased with our results this quarter as our assets are benefiting from aggressive asset management strategies and the tailwinds from our comprehensive capital program in 2015.  This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, good morning, thanks. I wanted to ask you just to clarify something. You had mentioned that there was $16 million of incremental EBITDA associated with assets being sold. Is that associated with the five hotels that you put in your press release as under contract for $340 million? Edward Walter : Yes, that\u2019s correct. Smedes Rose : Okay, so those are being sold at over 20 times EBITDA? Edward Walter : That's probably a little bit of an overstatement, because we are giving you the EBITDA that we will lose over the course of the remainder of the year compared to our original expectations. Gregory Larson : That's right. The other thing I would add is in our prior press release, in our prior quarter, we had five assets, two under contract, two sold, three under contract for I think a total of $215 million. So to look at the proceeds, you have to take the proceeds of $340 million from this press release, subtract that from the $215 million, and then do the math that you were suggesting with the EBITDA. Smedes Rose : Okay, thanks. And then Ed, I just wanted to ask you, are group revenues for the year still tracking at around 6% in total? And have you - are you hearing any sort of change in tenor on corporation\u2019s willingness to send people either out on the transient front or on the group front, given GDP was pretty disappointing yesterday? Just kind of any color around that. Edward Walter : Sure. Overall group revenues are trending lower than 6%. I think we identified back in February that, while we were running at roughly 6% up in bookings back in February, that we had assumed, because we had booked so many rooms in advance, that that number would likely decline over the course of the year. In fact, we continue to believe that and we continue to expect that our group revenues would fall within the range of overall RevPAR growth that we suggested, but likely towards the higher-end of that range. As it relates to corporate demand, we have seen special corporate drop, not every month, but in general, so there has been some weakness on that side. But as you look at corporate activity and translate that into group activity, our corporate business was actually up in the first quarter, which we viewed as a good sign. So, I am assuming that, given that we had a 0.5% GDP growth in the first quarter, we will likely see some choppiness over the course of the year from the corporate sector. That will depend a lot on particular industries, with finance being the one that seems to be a bit weaker. But we are not necessarily \u2013 we are certainly not seeing a wholesale trend across all corporations that they are cutting back. Smedes Rose : Okay, thank you. Appreciate it. Gregory Larson : Smedes, I also would just like to clarify my first answer. So, on page 3 of the press release, if you add the hotels under contract for $340 million, plus the total sales, that obviously \u2013 adding those two together would get you to $461 million. If you do the same thing from our prior quarter's press release, you had $215 million. So the additional proceeds from those three additional assets are really $246 million. Smedes Rose : Okay, thank you. Operator : Next will be Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Rich Hightower : Hey, good morning guys. Edward Walter : Good morning, Rich. Rich Hightower : So I just want to go back to a quick comment that Ed made in the prepared remarks about debt markets improving in the context of future asset sales. So my question here is, if you could sort of characterize for us the composition of the buyer pool and which of those buyers are more debt dependent, more leveraged buyers, than maybe more equitized buyers that have a different cost of capital, different time horizon, and some of those considerations. Edward Walter : Yes. I would say right now, given that the REITs are generally, with maybe an exception or two, out of the acquisition market, that the two broadly defined groups of buyers would be international capital, which seems to generally be less leverage sensitive, and then domestic capital, which I think tends to be real estate opportunity funds or operators aligned with financial partners. And that group, it does seem to be fairly sensitive to changes in debt availability. So, I would say by \u2013 just to provide a little clarification around my comment, we are not saying that the debt markets are anywhere near as strong as they were last year. But we were seeing a very severe trend in the end of last year, beginning of this year, and sort of weakening in terms of turns. And we are starting to hear some signs that availability has improved a little bit. In some cases, spreads have come in a little bit. But again, not back to where it was in the past, but at least a better trend than what we were feeling at the end of the last year or the first month or two of this year. Rich Hightower : All right, that is helpful, Ed. And then one quick follow-up. Is there any specific reason that share repurchase volume in the first quarter decelerated somewhat meaningfully from the fourth quarter, for instance? Or is it just a question of timing with the asset sales, or something else? Edward Walter : I think it was primarily related to the fact that the asset sales had not yet closed. As I think we said last quarter, we are comfortable right now with the environment that we are in, sort of stage of the cycle we are in with where our leverage is. So, in general, while it's not specifically tied to asset sales, the pace of our stock buyback activity will generally relate or correlate with our ability to get asset sales done. So we are very encouraged by the overall pace of our activity. But I guess I would say we have all been around long enough to know that just because you are under contract with money at risk doesn't necessarily mean things are going to close. So, we are waiting to get those closings completed before we necessarily accelerate activity. Rich Hightower : All right. That makes sense, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Hi, I thought it was interesting that your occupancy was a strong as it was in the first quarter in the context that industry occupancy was down. I mean you obviously had renovation tailwinds this year, as occupancy was down 70 basis points last year. But can you just given any more color on what is driving the occupancy and how to think about it for the rest of the year? Thank you. Edward Walter : Yes, I would agree with you that we certainly \u2013 as we looked at our results and compared them to what we saw in the industry, we were very pleased to see the occupancy growth that we had. Now, some chunk of that was due to the fact that there were rooms out of service, but I think largely we attribute it to the fact that we had very good leisure demand. Perhaps not in Florida, but in pretty much all of our other markets. And on a relative basis to the industry, I suspect our group demand was fairly strong, too. So, as we look through the rest of the year, given the fact that we've got a very strong group base, we are expecting to see \u2013 I don't know that we would necessarily expect to see occupancy growth at the same rate going forward as we have right now. We probably would expect to see our RevPAR growth lean a little bit more towards rate growth going forward, just because these next couple quarters are months where we start off with a really strong occupancy base. But we would still expect to see some gains in occupancy throughout the rest of the year. Thomas Allen : And then just my follow-up. Were you tempted at all to bring up the high-end of your RevPAR guidance after this quarter? I mean you have Hilton and Marriott guiding at three to five. You had stronger first quarter results than them, so were you tempted at all to bring it up? Edward Walter : We are always tempted. But I guess what I would say is that we were pleased with the way the first quarter played out. I think that we took what we thought was an appropriately conservative perspective on RevPAR at the beginning of the year. Our properties are more optimistic right now than we are. But on the other hand is what was demonstrated in first quarter GDP is the economies maybe not quite as robust as we all would like to see. So, I think for right now, sitting where we are and feeling very comfortable with where we are, it was the right answer for us. Thomas Allen : Thank you. Operator : Next will be Robin Farley with UBS. Arpine Kocharian : Hi, thank you. This is actually Arpine for Robin. And to follow-up on that question, actually, you had mentioned the tougher comps in Q1 and Q4. And it seems like Q1 came in slightly better than what you expected. Does that mean the shift impact on Q2 is a little bit less now, unless there is a shift within your guidance range? And then do you still expect Q3 to be strongest in group business? Edward Walter : Yes, so I don't know that we necessarily were commenting on tough comps in Q1. I think what I was saying in my prepared remarks, and I will elaborate a bit, is that we have exceptionally strong group bookings in Q2 and Q3. And those are months where we run at higher occupancy levels. And it is what we have been seeing of late, is in general, when we are running at higher occupancy levels that seems to be when we have the best opportunity to push rate. So that\u2019s why we feel very good about Q2 and Q3. And I would confirm what you said, which is that today our group bookings for Q3 are the strongest that we have throughout the entire year. Q4 is impacted by a number of things. I think what probably matters most is the shift in the Jewish holiday, which will now impact October. And secondly, the fact that this year's election will probably Q1 that most people want to pay attention to. The net of those two things is we would expect less group business in the fourth quarter. And then finally, the other reason why we expect the fourth quarter to be a hair weaker is the fact that November and December tend \u2013 the second half of November and December tend to be lower occupancy months. So what we experienced last year was that it was more difficult to push rate in those months. We are expecting that same sort of a scenario will apply again this year. Arpine Kocharian : Right, thank you. And if I may, a quick follow-up. Now that we know that two of your large hotel managers are combining, as an owner of those assets could you talk a bit about the general sentiment among owners, what this could mean, whether in terms of loyalty programs, occupancy sharing, and just balancing of issues and opportunities? Edward Walter : Well, I am not going to try and speak for what other owners might think, but I guess I would say from our perspective, we see both positives and benefits from this. I think what probably matters in some ways in the near-term, assuming that they navigate and we expect that they will - the challenges that exist around the integration. When we compare our cost structures leaving out management fees, between Starwood and Marriott. Right now Marriott - if our Starwood hotels sat within the Marriott system, we would be able to save costs and improve margins. So we are hoping that they execute as we expect they will, and that we ultimately get the benefit from that. I think that the challenge that the industry in general has identified with the combination is that there will be a number of brands that will all sit beneath one family, under one company, and it will be important to be thoughtful about how to continue to distinguish those brands. We look forward to working with Marriott in order to make certain that happens in a cost-effective manner. Arpine Kocharian : Thank you. Edward Walter : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Steven Kent : Hi, can you hear me. Edward Walter : Now we can. Steven Kent : Sorry about that. Can you just \u2013 I just have a question broadly on some of the hotel loyalty programs on booking direct. Has that impact did you positively or negatively? And then the other thing is, just on the pacing of asset sales over the next 12 months, what does the transaction environment look like? How are you thinking about that over the next year or two? Edward Walter : Steve, it's a little hard right now for us to get a clear indication on how some of the booking direct programs were impacting us. We do know that, in an effort to drive more bookings directly to the website, there were some \u2013 there are some rate reductions. I would say I think that's probably contributed to less growth in our transient rate than what we might have normally seen in the past. Maybe and from that standpoint, a slight negative. The flipside is, of course, is that when you look at what gets through the bottom line, the cost of booking a reservation directly with an operator is significantly cheaper than if it were to happen through one of the OTAs. So we are certainly supportive of the overall strategy and we look forward to working with them to fine tune that as they move forward. As it relates to the asset sales, I think that market is clearly not as robust as it was last year. We do - as I indicated in my prepared remarks, in addition to the assets that are under contract at this point that we identified in the press release, we have another $0.5 billion of activity that we are working hard on and I would feel we are making good progress on. At this point, we would expect to attempt to sell additional assets in the second half of the year, but a lot of that will depend upon how we see the market evolve over the course of the summer and what the outlook seems to be for the second half of the year for transaction activity. So I\u2019m feeling relatively good about where we stand right now. I think we certainly were one of the first in the industry to begin to look to sell assets. We did not just come up with this idea in the last six to eight months. And I think we're made great progress overall on the sale program. I am hopeful that we will be able to keep going. But at this stage, I think we will have to take a little bit of a wait-and- see attitude for the second half of the year. Steven Kent : Okay, thanks for the color. Operator : And the next question is from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Shaun Kelley : Hey, good morning, guys. I just was wondering, I think in the prepared remarks you mentioned a little bit about some of the cost savings initiatives, and I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about where we are in the roll - in the timing of the rollout of those. Like, is there a lot more to come on this? Are we relatively early on? Edward Walter : I would guess it's a little hard to judge that in a vacuum. But I think we are probably about halfway through. My guess is we have implemented more than half of those measures already. And I would also tell you that we are not - just because we are - when I say we are halfway through, we are halfway through the first, call it, 20 to 25 hotels that we ran the program on. We are operating on a scaled down basis; been executing the program on some of our mid-sized hotels. The benefits there will not be as significant in a total dollar context as they were on the larger hotels, simply because the hotels are smaller. But as we work our way through getting the benefits from this, part of the structure of this program is that there is a bit of a cost-sharing relationship with the company that is helping us with that. And so, part of what we are - the second of the benefit we don't really pay for anything. Consequently, there is an opportunity for further pickup there.  So, I would say we have certainly gotten meaningful benefits. We would expect to continue to get more going forward. Shaun Kelley : Great, thanks. And then my second or follow-up question would be to go back to the implications of Marriott and Starwood on the merger front. We had seen in the past around some of these prior integrations and with Marriott's rollout of Sales Force One some churn and some challenges that worked themselves out over time, but in the sales organization specifically. And you guys are obviously a very big group house for both of these brands. So, could you talk a little bit about what you think the sales impact might be as they start to integrate some of the direct property level sales managers and all of that? Is that something you think they are well prepared for and they have reached out to you on yet? Or how do you think that is going to play out? Edward Walter : Shaun, it's probably a little early for us to try to have any informed comment on that. We have talked with them about some of their preliminary thoughts. And it certainly \u2013 the issues that you are identifying and the concerns that you are identifying are concerns that we have. But specifically how they are going to approach that, they have not given us any details on that yet. So, I think I am sure we will learn more as they move forward with consummating the merger and then working towards the integration. But they are not at the point now where they have given us significant detail on that. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : Next will be Anthony Powell with Barclays. Anthony Powell : Hi, good morning everyone. Could you comment on how group production for future periods trended so far this year? Have you seen corporations pull back at all on their future group plans? Edward Walter : Generally, the answer is that we have not seen corporations pulling back on the businesses that they already had on their books. There were some markets where we saw some slight \u2013 we saw some reduction in production compared to prior levels on smaller groups. But the larger \u2013 we are not seeing any \u2013 certainly not seeing any trend of significant cancellations. We are not seeing a trend of significant attrition compared to the levels that might have been under contract. It was interesting on the food and beverage side, just because that is something that we are clearly watching in this area, we actually saw in the first quarter that our spend for our food and beverage spend per group room night actually was up somewhere between 2.5% and 3%, which we viewed as fairly favorable, especially given some of the overall economic headwinds. Anthony Powell : Right, got it, thanks. And we have heard some other REITs talk about better international inbound demand trends across the balance of the year. Are you seeing that and where could that be most impactful for your portfolio? Edward Walter : That is always a little tricky to get information that we fully trust on that area. Our sense was that we were still down in the first quarter on international travel. Now, I would say we were fairly encouraged by some of the arrival data that we have been tracking, which goes through February, which showed that Europe was up mid-single digits, that China was up nearly 20%. Japan, actually \u2013 arrivals from Japan actually trended up, which was a nice change compared to what we saw last year. The two major inbound markets that we saw were down from the standpoint of air arrivals were Canada and Brazil, which were both down about 1%. So those were two markets where \u2013 I think in Brazil it is probably an economic situation; in Canada I think that's really being hit by the dollar. There was some discussion that \u2013 actually at our recent GM's meeting, that there was a feeling that we may start to see international improve in the summer, both because of some better circumstances in some of those countries, and also the fact that \u2013 if the U.S. dollar does not continue to strengthen, then the year-over-year change in the dollar is not as dramatic as what we saw in 2015. But that is on the come. We don't know whether or not that is actually going to happen. Anthony Powell : All right, thank you. Operator : Next question will be from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Chris Woronka : To ask you on the RevPAR guidance, which has been at three to four since last time you reported. And it is a tighter range, obviously, than many of the others. Can we read into that, that maybe you have already grouped up a bit for the rest of the year, and that a lot of this is baked? And the question really is do you have I guess adequate if transient does reaccelerate, do you think you have a lot of upside to the number? Or is it the tighter range more a reflection of having more group and maybe a little bit less variability? Edward Walter : I think to answer the last part of your question first, I think that the group activity that we have is very strong. And of course, as you know, it represents 37%, 38% of our overall business. We have always been more significantly weighted to group than the industry. I am comfortable that with that base, that to the extent that we saw a reacceleration in corporate transient, that we would \u2013 that would not present a problem for us, because that would just be directly reflected in the form of higher rates that we would be able to charge transient customers. And in fact, that is one of the reasons why we like to have a very solid group base. I think if you look more broadly at why we are where we are and others may be where they are in terms of outlook, I think some of this is the fact that we do have a very diversified portfolio. So, no market represents more than 11% of our EBITDA. We have got some exposure to some lower supply markets, whether it's Phoenix, Atlanta, or maybe New Orleans, where we are looking at very strong growth this year out of those markets. The fact that we have a significant chunk of our portfolio in some key resort assets I think also helps, because so far the trend we have been seeing this year is very strong leisure demand, and we hope that that continues. Then lastly, back to the group point, the large number of big group hotels that we have, which contribute meaningfully to our profitability, they are all in good physical condition. We've invested significantly in them, and this is the part of the cycle where they have an opportunity to truly perform, both at the top and the bottom. So, as I stated in response to a question before, we continue to be conservative in our approach to guidance. But we are \u2013 we feel very comfortable with where we are right now based on the information that we can evaluate. Chris Woronka : Great, thanks. And just a quick follow-up. On the Marriott-Starwood merger, I think on paper the consensus this is going to have a lot of long-term benefits. Do you guys as you look out, whether it is second half or maybe even next year, is there any concern that there is any near-term slippage that maybe some of the larger competing brands try to take some of that business away temporarily as Marriott and Starwood sort some things out at the property levels? Edward Walter : I guess what I would say is that we are certainly concerned, as anyone should be, that when two large companies that represent a significant chunk of your portfolio are merging, you hope that that merger happens and that integration happen as effectively and as quickly as it can. We have no doubt, based on our conversations with the folks at Marriott, that they understand the importance of getting that right. Not just for our own sake but obviously for their own success. They are a talented group of people and the one thing that Marriott has always been very good at execution. So, I don't want to underestimate the challenges that they face, but I certainly think that they are aware of what they are heading into and doing the best they can to manage that process. At the property \u2013 some of that - there obviously is activity that happens above the property on the marketing side. But I don't want to leave everybody with a sense that \u2013 when you look at who is running the hotel on a day-to-day basis, those folks are on-site at the property. As we just - again, we had a meeting with all of our GMs a week ago, and it was clear that in talking to both the Starwood and the Marriott GMs, they are all very enthusiastic about this combination. It dramatically improves their opportunity. It will facilitate cooperation in an appropriate manner in various markets where we may have assets branded under both companies. And I think in a lot of ways, at the property level, they are very fired up about what the future might bring. So, we are very focused on making certain that they stay focused on what they are doing, but we are very much aligned with those property GMs in terms of their activities. Again, we are certainly paying attention to this and we will be staying as close as we can to making certain that every effort is being made to complete the integration as quickly and completely as they can get it done. But I suspect we will be okay. Chris Woronka : Okay, very good. Thanks, Ed. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity. Ryan Meliker : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Not to beat a dead horse, but I just want to talk a little bit about RevPAR growth. You guys came in the upper half of your range in the first quarter, with RevPAR coming in flat. And it sounds like your pace is up 6.5% in 2Q and 3Q. So, is there any reason for us to believe that RevPAR growth is not really going to accelerate over the next couple of quarters unless we see a fall-off on the transit side, which obviously the brands aren't forecasting and people seem to be getting more comfortable surrounding the macro, not less? Are there any particular portfolio-specific challenges that you see that might limit that RevPAR growth, is another way of asking that question. Edward Walter : No, I think in general, what you described is generally what we expect, which is to see some improvement in Q2 and Q3, especially in Q3. And then I think Q4 is the part that is a little harder to judge at this point. Ryan Meliker : Sure, and that's helpful. And then on the margin front, you guys were able to institute a lot of cost controls, grow margins pretty materially on a modest RevPAR growth environment. So do you think that you'll see similar type margin growth on increased RevPAR growth in 2Q and 3Q or are you lapping some challenges? Gregory Larson : Ryan, I am not sure 90 basis points of margin growth with 3.6% RevPAR growth was stronger than what we would have predicted, so maybe we will be pleasantly surprised as we move forward as well. But sitting here today, as Ed said, we are expecting stronger RevPAR growth in both Q2 and especially in Q3. So that certainly should be helpful in margins. Obviously Ed, also mentioned that we expect to continue to have occupancy increases, but it will be more - the RevPAR increase will be more balanced between rate and occupancy, which also will be helpful for us. But having said that I don\u2019t know that that we can sit here and count on utility costs always being down 11% or more. So we will see. Obviously, we tried to take into account the success that we had in the first quarter and then we tried to - frankly, my view for the rest of the year is slightly stronger than what it was just a quarter ago. So we tried to take into account both of those things to come up with our new guidance of 25 basis points to 65 basis points. Ryan Meliker : No, that is really helpful. Thanks, Greg. And then just one quick follow-up with regards to asset sales. If I think about this correctly, it sounds like you have got about $30 million of lost EBITDA this year from the $461 million in asset sales. A couple of those assets were sold in the middle of the first quarter, a few being sold later in this quarter, if we just assume roughly four months of ownership across the group. And that would mean that you have got eight months left, so we would true up the $30 million to roughly $45 million in annual EBITDA at $461 million. That is about 10 times EBITDA. Is that the right way to think about it? And then from the buyer perspective, how material are these PIPs? Are these guys paying significant CapEx that brings what they are paying even lower on an EBITDA multiple basis? Gregory Larson : Ryan, I always appreciate fuzzy math to come up with multiples. But I think if you look at the eight assets that we talked about in our press release, the three that we have sold and the five under contract, and look at an aggregate EBITDA multiple, it is around 11 times. And so it is pretty - obviously pretty close to the multiple where our stock trades today. Ryan Meliker : Sure. Any color on what type of PIPs that buyers might be looking at? Are these material PIPs, or has everything pretty much already been done on the assets that have been sold and the ones that you are looking to sell? Edward Walter : It varies by asset. So in some cases, there is a sizable PIP, and in other cases there is virtually no capital required. Ryan Meliker : Okay, thanks. Appreciate it. Edward Walter : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from David Loeb with Baird. David Loeb : Just to continue on the asset sales, I just want to clarify, are there three new transactions since the fourth quarter call? So did the two carry over or did some fall out? Edward Walter : There are three new ones and two that we had \u2013 two assets that were identified on the fourth quarter call have just not yet closed. David Loeb : Okay. And is one of those a New York City hotel? Edward Walter : New York City Hotel is not in the group of assets we've identified so far. That continues to be a priority. And I would hope that we would be able to announce further progress down the road on that, but we are not there yet. David Loeb : Okay, great, thank you. Gregory Larson : Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Kris Trafton with Credit Suisse. Kris Trafton : On the Marriott-Starwood merger. How we think about the potential risk of a nonunion hotel force in the collective bargaining, similar to what would happen with the IHG-Kimpton merger? Edward Walter : Yes, I think that is certainly one of the issues that needs to be studied as part of this. And it's a unique thing to each individual market, so we don\u2019t have anything there that we are necessarily prepared to disclose, but that is certainly something that we are looking at as part of the valuating the overall impact of the merger. Kris Trafton : Okay, great. And then just one more. With social issues oftentimes the main impediment to consolidation, what are your thoughts on taking a closer look at RLJ, with Tom moving over to Hilton? Edward Walter : As tempting as it would be to discuss M&A activity, I just \u2013 I've generally found that the best answer to those sorts of things is to just not try to comment on potential M&A transactions until they are announced. Kris Trafton : Okay, fair enough. Thanks guys. Operator : And we will take our final question from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : Yes, good morning everyone. You mentioned that group pace was trending a little bit lower than a 6% due to the elevated booking pace. What is your year-end expectation? Was that around the 4%? If I was hearing your comment correctly, is that a good goal for the year? And how much of that would be occupancy versus rate? Edward Walter : Yes, I would say \u2013 I would probably would say we are somewhat \u2013 we are in the 3% to 4% range, and then we're expecting to be at the upper end of that range right now. I don\u2019t know that we got a clear delineation on what it is between occupancy and rate, but I would imagine it is about a 50-50 break. Wes Golladay : Okay. And then going to the New York transaction market, what are you seeing on the ground there? It looks like \u2013 what is the depth of the buyer pool? And then also, on the selling side, it looks like a lot of people want to exit the market. How does that compare versus maybe six months ago? Edward Walter : I think there has been a high volume of transactions on the market from New York, for more than just the last six months. I would say that there is a high degree of buyer interest in the transactions that are there. As I mentioned on the last call, our sense is that the properties that have attracted the most interest are ones where there is potentially brand flexibility, or use of the building flexibility. Because that broadens the pool of folks that would be interested in a particular asset. So, I don't think there's any doubt that a lot of people are interested in looking at New York right now, but I would also agree with what you are implying, which is there's a lot of assets on the market. Wes Golladay : Okay, thank you. End of Q& A Operator : This concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Walter, at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional remarks. Edward Walter : Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call today. We appreciated the opportunity to discuss our first quarter results and our outlook for the rest of the year. We look forward to providing you with more insight into how 2016 is playing out in our second quarter call in July. Have a great weekend everyone. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation.",

In addition, on today's call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC and the supplemental financial information on our website at HostHotels.com. With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Greg Larson our Chief Financial Officer. This morning Ed will provide a brief overview of our operations and then we will discuss our disposition and investment activity as well as the Company's outlook for 2016. Greg will then provide greater detail on our second-quarter performance by market and discuss our margins and our balance sheet. Following their remarks, we will be unavailable to respond to your questions. And now I would like to turn the call over to Ed. Ed Walter : Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. As you may surmise from our results, it was an interesting quarter. While the operating environment across our industry was a bit choppy, we executed as planned on the dispositions we have previously referenced and added two more planned sales. On the investment side, we acquired an irreplaceable ground lease, completed several major ROI investments and continued to repurchase our stock, all with a focus on creating value for our shareholders. Let's start with a review of our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was 436 million for the quarter which represents an increase of 3.3% over 2015 and with 782 million for the first half of the year up 5.2%. Our adjusted FFO was $0.49 per share, an increase of 6.5% for the quarter and $0.90 per share year-to-date, an increase of 11%. Overall we are pleased with our bottom line EBITDA and FFO growth which generally met or exceeded both our expectations and consensus. But we were disappointed that our room revenue growth was not stronger. Our portfolio occupancy rate was 82.4%, an increase of 120 basis points compared to 2015. Constant currency RevPAR increased 2% for the quarter as rate growth was difficult to generate. This RevPAR result was well below what we had anticipated in April. We expected that we would benefit from strong group bookings and that generally proved to be correct as group room nights increased 3% due to more than a 6.5% growth in our association segment and a very solid increase in corporate group. Our average group rate was up more than 2% leading to a revenue improvement in group of more than 5%. While it certainly qualifies as a strong group quarter, it is worth noting that short term group bookings declined to the three year average level falling short of last year's accelerated pace and we did experience a slight increase in cancellations. However, our transient segment fell meaningfully short of our expectations. Overall transient room nights declined by 1% as corporate demand proved soft. This resulted in the hotels being forced to target price sensitive leisure business and government business with the latter segment up nearly 7%. The net result of this mix shift was our average transient rate fell slightly and transient revenues declined by slightly more than 1%. To help offset this transient softness, we increased our contract room nights by more than 20%. Declining international demand was also a drag on our transient demand. While difficult to precisely calculate, our international business which represents slightly more than 10% of our total room nights decreased approximately 7% in the quarter further undermining our manager's efforts to drive transient rate. Fortunately a combination of strong group business and catering activity led to a 6.6% increase in banquet and AV revenue which enabled the portfolio to achieve food and beverage revenue growth of 4.5%. Sales per group room night jumped more than 4% which is one of our stronger quarters during this cycle and a good indication that groups are still prepared to spend freely on events. Since nearly all of the F&B revenue growth came from the profitable catering business, the flow-through was quite strong at north of 70%. Other revenues at our comparable hotels grew 4.6% as spa revenues improved and we experienced an increase in attrition and cancellation fees which are now running slightly ahead of what we experienced in the last two years. The flow through in this area was also quite strong. The solid flow through in all segments of our business combined with the benefits of various asset management initiatives and property investments, which Greg will discuss in more detail, led to comparable hotel EBITDA margin improvement of 65 basis points and EBITDA flow through of more than 50%. As a result, comparable hotel EBITDA improved by roughly 5%. Year to date, our transient contract revenues have increased 3.3% and our group revenues have improved by 3.1%. Comparable F&B revenues have increased 2.8% driven by banquet and AV increase of 3.7%. Total comparable revenues have increased 2.9% and comparable EBITDA margins have increased 75 basis points leading to EBITDA improvement year to date of 5.7%. Turning to asset sales, as I referenced at the outset, we continue to make solid progress in our non core asset disposition program. Closing the sales of the Atlanta Perimeter, Seattle SeaTac and Manhattan Beach Marriott as well as our two hotels located in Chile. The three US assets represented older hotels located in airport or suburban locations that we felt would likely not grow cash flows over the long term at the rate of our overall portfolio. These sales, plus the two Christchurch New Zealand hotels that we noted are under binding contract bring our total sales for the year to roughly $500 million. It is worth noting that the EBITDA we are receiving in 2016 from these assets totaled $13 million which should not be included in any of your 2017 estimates. While we continue to market several hotels, the buyer pool has declined in size and pricing is not as attractive as when we commenced our sale program a few years ago. While we do expect to complete additional sales, we are only a seller if we can achieve acceptable pricing. During the last 3.5 years, we have sold more than $2.6 billion worth of hotels or nearly 15% of our consolidated and joint venture portfolio, which has enabled us to further refine our asset base and improve shareholder value. We are very comfortable with our overall progress on this front. Looking at investments, we are very pleased to have acquired the ground leases that sit beneath the Key Bridge Marriott. The second Marriott Hotel to be constructed, this property is situated in Arlington, Virginia at the end of the Key Bridge which provides direct access to Georgetown and has spectacular views of Washington and all of the national monuments. We are in the midst of evaluating the various options for this site and hotel which will clearly include alternate uses, and we look forward to providing updates on this exciting project in the future. We have also completed the redevelopment of the Hyatt San Francisco Airport and the new 152,000 square foot ballroom and exhibit hall complex at the San Diego Marquis. Both of these projects were completed on time and under budget. In addition to renovating all of the rooms and meeting spaces at the Hyatt, we also completed 9,000 square feet of new meeting space and totally transformed the atrium and F&B platform. Our group bookings for this hotel for the next two years are 35% ahead of the pre-construction levels. We also expect to have a very strong fall operating season. At the San Diego Marquis, we have created the best combination of ballroom and exhibit space in the market and customers are responding favorably as bookings through the next two years have increased 40% compared to pre-construction levels. As the second quarter proved, it is challenging to develop guidance during interesting times for the industry. The following factors provide some insight into our thinking about the second half of 2016. Based on consensus economic forecasts and general uncertainty around the U.S. election and international events, we expect that business profit growth and investment levels will not improve, which suggests that business transient demand will remain soft. Alternatively, continued strong employment and consumer confidence numbers suggests that leisure demand will remain solid. We expect international travel patterns will remain challenged as demand from two of our largest international markets, Canada and Latin America, are impacted by both the strong U.S. dollar and weaker domestic economic growth. Our group revenue pace for the remainder of the year is up more than 4% with the majority of the increase occurring in the third quarter. While we would expect some moderation in the overall increase in our group segment, this compares favorably to the actual improvement we experienced in the first half of the year. Q3 will benefit from the calendar shift of the Jewish holidays into October, while the fourth quarter will be hurt by both that shift and less travel expected during the week that includes Election Day. The combination of all of these factors suggests that RevPAR growth and the second half of the year will generally match what we experienced in Q2 with the third quarter considerably stronger and the fourth quarter somewhat weaker. As a result, we anticipate full year RevPAR will range from 2% to 3%. We expect F&B and other revenue growth will moderate slightly from the first-half growth of 2.8% and still generate increased profits over 2015. The combination of solid flow through from all revenue generating activities, continued benefit from our asset management efforts and the strong start to the year is expected to lead to comparable hotel EBITDA margin improvement of 40 to 70 basis points. The net result of these factors is an estimated range for an adjusted EBITDA of $1.435 billion to $1.465 billion which reflects a reduction at the midpoint of $7.5 million from our prior range. $1.5 million of this adjustment is tied to the sale of the two Christchurch hotels I referenced earlier and the remainder is due to the reduction in our estimated topline growth partially offset by improving margins. Our forecasted adjusted FFO range is $1.63 to $1.67. With that, let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail. Greg Larson : Thank you, Ed. I will start with specific commentary on performance within some of our major markets. RevPAR at our properties in Los Angeles continued to outperform the portfolio with an impressive 9.1% increase in the second quarter. The results were driven by a 5% increase in ADR and a 3 percentage point increase in occupancy to 84.2%. A strong group base combined with solid transient demand at several of our hotels drove the RevPAR increase which exceeded the STAR upper upscale results by 140 basis points. Looking forward, our booking pace in Los Angeles remains very strong as the market is expected to host additional citywides during the remainder of this year. As a result, we expect continued outperformance from our Los Angeles properties. Our two comparable hotels in Denver grew RevPAR 7.3% this quarter and outpaced the STAR upper upscale result by 260 basis points. Strong group and transient demand at the Westin primarily drove this outperformance. However, based on the softening of citywide pace and decreasing size of events, we expect our hotels in Denver to underperform the portfolio in the third quarter. In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 6.6% for the quarter as a result of average rate growth of 3.2% and occupancy increase of 2.6 percentage points. Once again a number of citywide events in the second quarter contributed to the outperformance. Based on group revenues on the books for the remainder of the year, we expect third quarter results to be better than the fourth quarter. RevPAR growth of 5.5% at our DC hotels significantly outperformed the STAR upper upscale RevPAR increase by 230 basis points. This was driven by both occupancy and rate this quarter as occupancy increased 2.2 percentage points and average rate grew 2.9%. Several of our DC hotels benefited from planned renovations that we completed last year. Based on group booking pace for these hotels, we expect our properties in DC to achieve solid results in the third quarter. Our Boston hotels RevPAR growth of 5% in the second quarter was driven by a rate increase of 2.2% and an occupancy improvement of 2.3 percentage points. Our manager's aggressive strategies to offer promotions and add high-end airline crews bolstered the RevPAR increase this quarter. These hotels also had an impressive increase in food and beverage revenues of 15.8% entirely from the increase in the more profitable banquet and catering sales. Overall, our Boston properties are experiencing softer special corporate demand from the financial and consulting segments. As a result, we expect RevPAR to underperform the rest of our portfolio in the third quarter. RevPAR at San Francisco hotels grew 2.8% primarily driven by a rate increase of 2.9%. Overall transient demand softness and group room night declined due to the Moscone Center Convention construction led to demand weakness this quarter. However, strong catering business at several San Francisco hotels drove the outstanding banquet and catering revenue growth of over 33% this quarter. The expansion of the Moscone Convention Center will continue to negatively impact the San Francisco market for the remainder of 2016 and through 2017. Our San Francisco hotels will likely underperform our portfolio in the remaining quarters. Moving to some challenged markets. New York RevPAR decreased 4.9% but outperformed the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR decline of 6%. Occupancy dropped slightly to 89.8% and rate declined 4.8% in the second quarter. Supply continues to outpace demand which is impacting our ability to drive rate. We have also witnessed European travel and tour business declining due to the strong U.S. dollar. Based on our outlook for the market, we expect our hotels in New York to continue to have negative RevPAR for the remainder of the year. As anticipated, our hotels in Florida underperformed the portfolio with a RevPAR decrease of 2.2% in the second quarter. Occupancy declined 2 percentage points and rate increased 0.4%. The decline in RevPAR was due to softer leisure transient demand as well as increased group attrition and cancellations. On a positive note, group customers increased their food and beverage spent in the more profitable banquet and catering business by 15.8%. In addition, based on a strong group revenue pace for the third quarter, we expect RevPAR in Florida to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter. RevPAR at our assets in San Diego grew slightly this quarter. Occupancy declined 2.9 percentage points and rate increased 3.6%. Our hotels were negatively impacted by and an 8.6% decline in transient revenues resulting from fewer citywide compression nights from downtown. Despite the slow start in San Diego, we expect the hotels in this market to improve in the second half of 2016 as the city should benefit from an increase in citywide room nights for the remainder of the year especially in the third quarter. In addition, the new 152,000 square foot Marriott Hall opened in June 2016 at the San Diego Marquis. Moving to our international assets, these hotels had a constant dollar RevPAR growth of 2.3% in the quarter. Latin America drove much of the international growth with a constant dollar RevPAR increase of 5% primarily from continued pre-Olympic business in Rio. Due to the upcoming Olympics this summer, we expect Latin America to have a spectacular third quarter. Shifting to our European joint venture, the portfolio was negatively impacted by a number of macro factors including the lingering effects of the Paris attacks in Paris and Brussels and the political and economic uncertainty pre and post-Brexit. All this led to a RevPAR decline of 1.3% in constant euros this quarter. As expected, our hotels in Paris, London and Brussels significantly underperformed the portfolio while our hotels in Spain, Stockholm and Amsterdam outperformed. We expect the challenges that I described for our hotels in Paris, London and Brussels will continue into the third quarter. Moving to our profitability, our comparable EBITDA margin expansion of 65 basis points in an environment with 2% RevPAR growth is very impressive. This notable EBITDA margin growth is the result of decreases in our utility and insurance expenses as well as our continued cost savings initiatives. Utility costs decreased almost 6% and insurance expense decreased 5.5% in the quarter. Utility costs continued to decline in the second quarter due to favorable gas and electric prices as well as the benefits from our cost saving energy ROI initiatives. As we have said previously, we have invested in numerous energy projects over the last year ranging from small to major projects which are favorably impacting our utility costs. Further in June, we completed our annual negotiation of our insurance contracts and lowered rates for another year. Therefore, we expect our insurance expense to continue to decrease for the remainder of the year and through the first half of 2017. Over the last two years, we have focused on improving productivity at our hotels by initiating time and motion studies at our largest hotel. These studies resulted in hotel managers establishing tighter labor model standards and the use of improved and expanded forecasting tools allowing managers to effectively schedule to demand and minimize excess staffing. For example, many of our housekeeping departments are now using an automated system integrated with a property management system to prioritize housekeeping room assignments using a Wi-Fi enabled device. These systems save on time and labor expense while getting guests into rooms faster. Total hourly productivity at our hotels that have implemented the recommendations improved over 400 basis points more than those hotels that have not yet conducted a time and motion study. For all the discussion of technology as a disruptor in the lodging space, we are seeing real cost saving benefits of technology in our industry and at our properties. In addition, sustainability initiatives that provide guests with the option to forgo housekeeping services in exchange for reward points, like Marriott's Your Room Your Choice, and Starwood's Make a Green Choice program are also positively impacting expenses. Given the positive margin results in the first half of 2016, we now expect full-year comparable EBITDA margins to increase 40 to 70 basis points. We also expect approximately 22.5% to 23% of our total and adjusted EBITDA to be generated in the third quarter. As disclosed in our press release, during the second quarter we repurchased 5.2 million shares at an average price of $15.39 for a total purchase price of $81 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in April of 2015, we have bought back 48.6 million main shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $838 million. We currently have $162 million of capacity remaining under the repurchase program. In addition, we paid a regular second-quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share which represents a yield over 4.5% on the current stock price. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility and believe we have one of the best balance sheets in the lodging REIT and overall REIT space. Importantly, we view this as a key competitive and strategic advantage and expect to continue benefiting from it going forward. We ended the second quarter with approximately $266 million of cash, $739 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility and $3.7 billion of debt. We improved our leverage ratio as calculated under our credit facility to 2.6 times. During the quarter, we repaid the $100 million mortgage loan secured by the Hyatt Regency Reston Hotel. We also think it is important to note that 95 of our hotels, which represent 99% of our revenues, are unencumbered by mortgage debt. In summary, we are pleased with our results this quarter as the profitability of our assets continues to improve, as a result of our aggressive asset management strategies in what continues to be a competitive market environment. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many as you as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Hey Good morning, Ed, I wanted to ask you maybe a little bit more if you could share a little more color on the cancellations that you saw in the quarter and maybe through the balance of the year. It sounds like it was a little bit elevated in Florida. Do you see this as economic concerns, is it Zika concerns, if it Florida related? Maybe just a little more color around that would be good. Thanks. Ed Walter : Yes, Smedes, that is a great question because we spent a fair amount of time talking to the operators to get a feeling for that. As best as we can tell, it seems like most of the cancellations were what I would describe as situational. So they were -- some cases there might have been a change around a product and so there was -- around the timing of her product launch. But in other cases it sounded as if certain companies were just trying to be thoughtful about the level of expense that they were incurring in 2016. And I attribute that in part to the weaker corporate profit numbers that we have seen. So it didn't feel as if it was thematic. It seemed like it was specific to the individual companies that had cancellations. What I took some comfort from was the fact that the cancellations that we are seeing were generally focused on 2016. We are not necessarily seeing any increase in cancellations related to 2017. So that tells me that it is a little bit more of a short term orientation and people are not necessarily backing away from their plans to have events down the road. Greg Larson : And, Smedes, as I mentioned in my comments, we actually expect Q3 to be pretty strong for our Florida hotels. Smedes Rose : Okay, thanks. And I mean can you share the group pace revenue pace for 2017 at this point? Ed Walter : I would say it is up low single digits. Smedes Rose : Great, okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now move to our next question from Rich Hightower, Evercore ISI. Rich Hightower : A couple of questions. The first one I went to touch on the ground lease purchase. So was that something that was just opportunistic when the lease was expiring or what was -- just give us a little more color about the origin of that opportunity? And I know you said you would give details later on as to what you actually do with the property. But could you give us a hint -- any hints ahead of time there? Ed Walter : Yes, I guess obviously this is a hotel that has been in our Company for a long period of time. And for those of you that know Washington DC, you probably know the hotel because you have driven by it a number of times on the GW Parkway. It really is a great location on the edge of Georgetown. And the views from the rooms are spectacular because you are looking right down the mall at all of the monuments. This was a land lease situation from the time the hotel was built. We have spent off and on the last 10 years negotiating with the owners of the foundation that owned the property in an effort to try to get complete control of the property. So I guess I would say it was opportunistic in the sense that we finally had -- they were finally motivated to sell and we finally had the opportunity to buy. We had a right of first refusal, which is essentially what we exercised on. So it was sort of if we were going to buy it, we needed to do it now. And I think as it relates to the opportunities for the property, there is, we believe, we haven't had extensive conversations with local officials yet. But we are fairly comfortable in believing that there is excess density associated with the site. So we are in the process now that we know we have control of the property, we are looking at a range of options that would include a complete scraping of the asset and a complete redevelopment of the entire parcel, which would involve for us probably selling off a number of those parcels to other parties. We are also potentially redeveloping a part of the hotel and then selling off portions of the hotel to third parties to develop either residential or office. So we are really in the midst of the effort right now to understand how to maximize the value. There is a lot of local interest in the site, local and national interest for that matter because of just the superb positioning of the property. So we will provide more of an update going forward as we have a clearer idea about how to maximize value for this property. Rich Hightower : Okay. I mean generally what sort of a return would you expect on some, on a big project like this with multiple options? Ed Walter : Yes, I guess what I would say is it should, some of that depends upon how we pursue it. I think it is early to try to quote what the value of the underlying land might be. A lot of that is going to relate to what approach do we ultimately take. Rich Hightower : Okay. All right, I will move to the next question. So my last question here is just in terms of the non-same-store pool of assets, one of the big selling points I guess for Host in 2016 was that it is a renovation tailwind story, which is in opposition to what happened last year. So I am curious, are the renovated projects that have opened, are they performing in line with underwriting? Are you generating the ADR lift and the overall returns you were expecting? Just as we sort of compare it to the same store 2% RevPAR number for the quarter for instance? Ed Walter : Yes, here is what I would say with this. I think overall we are still expecting that the four assets that we talked about earlier in the year are going to generate the improvement in EBITDA that we had forecasted. I would also tell you that in terms of looking at how we are going to get to that number, the ramp up in the first quarter, call it the first four or five months of the year was probably a bit slower than what we expected. But at this point we are generally in line with our expectation for where we expected to be with the properties. And I think we feel fairly confident about how that is going to play out for this year. And then we also expect that there will be an opportunity for incremental lift in 2017 simply because we are, in each instance for three of the four properties, the one in San Francisco, Camby in Phoenix and the Logan in Philadelphia, all of those because they were closed were essentially new hotels opening up in the beginning of this year and so they did not immediately jump to stabilized operating levels in the beginning of the year. Greg Larson : And, Rich, the only thing I would add is if you are looking at our press release you can see our non-comp hotels actually had a decline in RevPAR for the quarter and that was primarily due to two big hotels. As you know, Denver Tech is under renovation right now and that is a fairly large hotel with over 600 rooms. And the RevPAR for that hotel is down over 30%. And then the Hyatt San Francisco, again another big hotel, 789 rooms, that hotel also had a RevPAR decline of 18%. So those two hotels are really driving the negative RevPAR in the non comp hotel set right now. Rich Hightower : Okay, I appreciate that, guys. Thanks. Operator : We will now take our next question from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Anthony Powell : I had a question on pricing in the leisure transient side. Have you seen any impact, the downside from some of the member discounts we are seeing from the brand companies on your ability to drive rate? Ed Walter : I think that the discounts that the brands are offering to reward members is having a slight negative impact on RevPAR. My guess is that I think Arne was quoted yesterday in saying it was about 30 basis points to 40 basis points. And based on our conversations with them and others that seems to be about right. This certainly initially right now we are bearing some hit for the implementation of those programs. And I think the expectation in the long run though is that they will accomplish share shift. And obviously the cost of a reservation through the brand website is considerably less than what we might book through other third-party alternatives. Anthony Powell : All right, thanks. And moving onto asset sales, I think at the beginning of the year you were targeting $1 billion in sales. You are at $500 million now. Is it the case that you are essentially done with the asset sales or just being opportunistic? And how does that outlook impact your share repurchase activity for the rest of the year? Ed Walter : Yes, I would say that one, we are not done with asset sales. We are still working on a number of transactions and would hope to complete some more. My also would probably say right now that at this stage I wouldn't necessarily be expecting to complete a $1 billion number within calendar year 2016 because I think some of the one of the sales that I think ultimately may prove to be more likely would be the sale of the Melbourne Hilton. But I have a feeling at this point that that sale is likely to be drag into 2017 as opposed to be completed this year. I think as I said in our prepared remarks, we are very happy with the overall sale program that we have implemented over the last 3.5 years. We would like to continue to sell assets in part because we would love to use the proceeds in the context of our stock buyback program. But we do want to make certain that we are getting pricing that we think makes sense. If you look at the sales that we have announced so far this year without even taking into account the capital spending that might have been required as part of the transition of that property, I would say to a franchise status, we were in the mid 7s in terms of a cap rate on those sales which frankly compares very favorably to where we are trading as a Company. And if I looked at the relative quality of what we were selling compared to what we are retaining, that relationship looks even more attractive. Anthony Powell : Got it. And just following up on that, so if there aren't materially more asset sales, do stock buybacks stop this year or would you just use cash proceeds or cash flow to fund share buybacks? Ed Walter : I think we have with the sales that we have completed, we do have I would say some extra cash that could be invested in the stock buyback. Some of that will obviously get tied into what our ultimate dividend requirement is going to be. And I think we are still interested in buying back stock. Obviously as you look at the price that we have paid in this most recent quarter, part of what governs our activity in the stock is where the stock price is. But I think we are still open to additional stock repurchase. Anthony Powell : All right, that is it for me. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And will take our next question from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Jeff Donnelly : If I maybe could just stick with the question on dispositions for a moment, Ed, I am just curious. I mean if assuming markets are cooperative, is there a particular goal that you have in mind? I mean where you would like to be with the portfolio looking beyond just the sales you are contemplating for 2016? I wasn't sure if you had a number of assets, a number of markets or other sort of metrics that shapes how you are thinking about where you would like to bring the portfolio? Ed Walter : Jeff, it is a good question. I would tell you that with maybe just a few exceptions, I would say that we have sold the bulk of the hotels that we would have started, when we looked at the, started to look at commencing a sale program three or four years ago, we sold the bulk of the hotels that we felt we were either quality reasons, capital reasons or likely underperformance of the market reasons. We sold the bulk of the hotels that we would like to do. There are a couple more that I think we would like to sell where we would view them as perhaps detractors in the long run from our likely performance. But not that many. I mean I am really talking about a small handful of hotels. So I would say that it ultimately moving past perhaps selling that handful of hotels, it really just comes down to a function of pricing and in a market that seems to be a little less robust than where it had been, I would probably say at this moment I am not as optimistic that we are necessarily going to be selling a lot of additional hotels unless we see pricing start to improve. Jeff Donnelly : So in other words it is not $500 million down and $3 billion to go or something like that? Ed Walter : No, I think that, no, definitely, definitely not. At least not on our current perspective. Jeff Donnelly : And just sticking on the sales question, can you maybe just give us a little more color about what you have learned from the marketplace with dispositions in terms of how buyers are underwriting? Are they kind of looking at on a per key basis, is it sort of cash flow yields or is it an IRR driven buyer? And I guess if I could I just had one other question on just group trends. Ed Walter : Yes, I think it is a little bit dependent on the type of buyer that you are dealing with. So the international buyers tend to be looking more at long-term storage of value and tend to, what we have found in our conversations with them trends toward the higher quality assets. The financial buyers that are probably, are using more leverage than what we might necessarily use seems to me that they are primarily focused on a cash flow stream that will generate a fairly attractive rate of return and provide some cushioning against what might happen later in the cycle and trying to rely less on a growth in the value of the asset in terms of either certainly cap rate compression or just a significant increase in value down the road. So it seems to be it is much more around current cash flow in terms of a driver for them. Jeff Donnelly : Thinks. And the question I just had on group and I will yield the floor is that just earlier in the year I think you guys had shared measures on group attrition and cancellations and just in the year bookings that maybe they weren't necessarily moving in the right direction. Can you just talk about how those trends have moved from Q1 and into Q2 and maybe how that shapes your thinking for next year as we roll forward? And I think you gave a metric earlier on the call about your group pace being up single digits in 2017. Do you recall what that same metric was last year looking at 2016? Ed Walter : Yes, let me try to address the first part of your question then come back to that. So I think what we indicated earlier in the year was that we certainly had very strong group bookings. And I think at the end of the first quarter as we look through the rest of the year, we thought we were up I think it was around 5% to 6%. And what we said at the time was because we were running so far ahead in terms of the prior year in terms of group bookings that to some degree there was just not as many nights in rooms that were still capable of being sold in a lot of those hotels for group. And so we were expecting that what would happen over the course of the year is that group would still be very strong but that it would generally fall to a level of production or from a revenue perspective that was consistent with the overall range of RevPAR guidance that we were providing at that point in time. So we were suggesting that yes, we might be up 5% to 6% right now but given at that point in time, we were talking 3% to 4% in terms of RevPAR. We expected the group revenues would ultimately moderate and be more in line with that level. If I were to look out today looking out for the rest of the year, I would say that what we generally were expecting was going to happen with group which was that the lead that we had over the prior year would probably condense a bit and that has happened. I think we still feel pretty confident about group for the second half of the year. I might on the margin say because we have seen a little bit of incremental weakness in short term group bookings that we are a hair less confident in terms of how group compares to what we thought in April. But by and large when we look at our booking pace through the remainder of the year and calibrate that with expectations of what we actually expect to generate, we still feel pretty good about our group business. When we look into next year, I would say that we are probably running a little bit behind. Our growth for '17 is not as strong as our growth for 2'16. Our growth for '16 thinking back to calendar '15 was sort of mid single digits for most of 2015. So we are behind in terms of a rate of growth but of course remember, we have been saying for a while, including a lot of last year, that the group bookings for 2016 were quite strong. We are still saying that our group bookings for 2017 are better than our group bookings for 2016. So we are slated to have a better year for group in terms of absolute amount of group nights and absolute group revenues in 2017. But that rate of improvement right now would be slightly lower than what we were forecasting a year ago for 2016. Jeff Donnelly : Thanks, that was very helpful. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity. Ryan Meliker : I just wanted to talk a little bit about the guidance reduction for the back half of the year. You gave some good color on group pace and the idea that you are expecting transient trends to slow, or not slow but remain soft I guess. Can you give us some color on what type of macro outlook -- I am assuming you have some type of macro model that you use to help drive kind of transient RevPAR demand trends for the back half of the year? Ed Walter : Sure. I would say that what we have found over the years was the best indicator for what was going to happen to corporate transient is generally tied to what is happening in terms of business investment. If investment activity is higher, travel seems to be -- business transient seems to be stronger. And while I didn't have much time to absorb the GDP report that came out early this morning, I did note that business investment was off in the second quarter and I think it might have even been off more than 2%. So, I wouldn't say that our approach to this is so scientific that we calibrated with our expectations for business investment would be for the second half of the year. I think that would presume too much. But we did assume, based on the data that we have been seeing and the outlook that we will see from people that spend their time forecasting that, is it generally was expected to be weaker. So, until that changes, we assume that corporate travel will probably, it will still be there but the growth and the demand from that side will not be as strong as it might have been in the past. And that is one of the reasons why, as we look at the transient side of our business, and I think it is clear from my comments that that is the part of our business that disappointed us in Q2, that is the part of our business that we think is weaker in the second half of the year. We are assuming that we will see weakness in corporate demand consequently push us more toward some of the more price sensitive segments of leisure discount business. And that is what underlies the fact that we are adjusting our RevPAR guidance down for the second half of the year and obviously for the full year. Ryan Meliker : I think that make sense. So, just to make sure I understand it correctly, it sounds like you are assuming that the soft business investment spend dynamic that we have seen in the first half of the year really persists through the back half of the year. Is that correct? Ed Walter : That is correct, that is correct. Ryan Meliker : Okay, so no acceleration or deceleration necessarily? Ed Walter : Correct. I would say that if you were trying to look at what might change this dynamic a little bit and lead to stronger growth, it would be improvement in corporate investment which could then turn around, and you know corporate travel reacts very quickly both down and up. So, to the extent that the investment side of their business starts to their perspective changes, they get more optimistic, that is the one place for upside too. Ryan Meliker : Okay, that is helpful. And then just one quick follow up. Greg, you had mentioned that you are expecting San Francisco to be a little softer in the back half of the year. I am wondering if you guys have tried to quantify the impact of the Moscone Center renovation, what you think that is going to do in 4Q and then next year? Greg Larson : I mean look, it is certainly going to impact the second half of this year and certainly next year. But I don't have an exact number for you. But we are within our guidance that we gave today for our portfolio, 2% to 3% RevPAR growth, we are actually modeling San Francisco to have a slight to be slightly negative in the second half of the year. Ryan Meliker : Okay. And is it reasonable for us to assume that it will be slightly negative again next year? Ed Walter : Expect it to be negative? I think it is awfully early right now to try to provide an outlook relative to 2017. But what I can tell you that at least as a concern is that when we were looking at our bookings for next year, one of the markets that was has been weakest in terms of bookings for 2017 was San Francisco. So, there is clearly going to be some impact from the closing of the the construction activity around the convention center. Operator : Thank you. Will now take our next question from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Chris Woronka : I was hoping that maybe we could drill down a little bit on the rates. And I know that in 2Q and I think even in 1Q your mix shifting had a lot to do with it. And so I am trying to get a sense for how much of the rate under performance may be relative to your expectations is just mix and how much of it is real time softening on the transient side? Ed Walter : I would say it is a combination of both. So if I look across our different segments, I would say that in the lower price segments, government or in some of our discount segments, we actually had fairly strong rate growth. So for instance, our government business from a rate perspective was up 4.4%. And our discount business was up about 3%. So we saw a good jump in those segments. Where we saw ,if we did see, as our highest price business in retail and some of the, that segment, we did see some rate decline. So I would tell you at the end of the day it is a combination of both. The good news is the segments we did more we had growth in also had higher rate. So that is positive. The downside is that the actual rates of business, the rate that we charge those customers tends to be lower than the rate that we would charge our most expensive retail customer. So it was a combination of at the top level some weakness, some negative rate growth combined with a lot of rate shift, mix shift. Chris Woronka : Okay, great. And then also wanted to ask you, it seems to be with all of the uncertainty out there the trend is kind of lower shorter booking windows. Are you guys working with the brands? Do you think there, could this be more of a longer term trend and do you think the brands are kind of on top of it and are you working with them to maybe look at changes in policies or things like that? Ed Walter : I don't know that we are necessarily seeing right now that the booking window is shorter. I mean I, we are, as we have reached higher occupancy levels, we have generally seen the booking window extended. And we are still seeing even looking out to 2018, we are still seeing good growth in our group business. So I don't know that we would necessarily sit here and say that we think the window has shortened so far this year. Chris Woronka : Okay, very good. Thanks, Ed. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Harry Curtis, Nomura. Harry Curtis : Ed, you have seen a couple of lodging cycles and certainly Greg is no spring chicken, right, Greg? Greg Larson : That is the pot calling the kettle black. Harry Curtis : All right, let's get on with it. I did stir the pot. So the question is, if you have seen the deceleration in corporate investment, through these cycles have you ever seen it reaccelerate once you see these trends in group bookings begin to soften? Ed Walter : Harry, that is a good question. And I am trying to think back. Certainly the last two downturns, my guess is is that your general assumption is that once it rolled over, it continued to head down. Now what is different though is that in both of those last two cycles in 2001, it had started to go negative in the beginning of the year and then obviously we had the attack on 9/11 followed by SARS followed by the war. So we sort of had, once things went a little south, I don't know that we necessarily got a chance to see how the economic environment was going to play out in kind of in this context. There was a lot of other events that intervened to create a problem. And of course the financial recession had somewhat of a similar tempo to it. So coming back to what we might expect this time, I do think that if you look at what the Fed just said in what they came out with earlier this week, I don't know that they are necessarily acting or speaking in the context of thinking that the economy is about to roll over. I have a feeling just sort of if looking at this through my own lens is that part of what Corporate America is trying to figure out is what does Brexit mean, what does this unsettled -- these attacks that have happened across the world, who in the world is going to be the next President of the United States and what exactly -- what policies are they going to pursue? So I can't -- the last thing I am going to try to do is predict the future in terms of economics. But I could look at this and say that if the Fed is right that the underlying economy is actually fairly healthy, then if companies had a different perspective about some of these issues that I think do affect people's willingness to invest, I think there is an opportunity to see corporate investment improve. I believe that the consensus forecast for next year does call for some slight improvement in business investment, not robust but some slight improvement. So not that they have necessarily been right at all through this cycle, but if they were right, then that might offer an opportunity to see some improvement. Harry Curtis : Okay, and then. Ed Walter : Checking my data on that. The most recent blue-chip consensus talks about corporate investment next year at 3.1%. So that was down a little bit from where it had been the prior quarter but still pretty positive. So I think that will be -- in our mind based on given that we see that being a fairly influential indicator for us, we will have to see how that plays out. Harry Curtis : Thank you for that. And then my second question is, what do you need to see to take the base dividend up? Ed Walter : Generally what we have done is tie our dividend to our taxable income. So one of the biggest drivers there would be we would need to see our taxable income continue to increase. We have generated incremental taxable income as a result of our asset sales. And so one of the things we will provide more clarity on I would expect at our next conference call is the degree to which we would have a special dividend. I would say that certainly in terms of thinking about the dividend long term, we are certainly focused on having a dividend set at a level that we are comfortable in maintaining even to the extent we might go through a period of weakness. And we are certainly comfortable at the level we are at today that we could do that. Harry Curtis : Okay, that is it for me. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joe Greff : Ed, earlier in the call you talked about that the third quarter would be considerably better than the fourth quarter in terms of RevPAR growth. Are you anticipating that your third-quarter RevPAR growth will accelerate from Q2 levels? Ed Walter : Yes. Joe Greff : Okay. And your explanation for that would be September group, presumably and the timing of the Jewish holidays? Ed Walter : Yes, I think we were not necessarily expecting that July would be any stronger than what we had seen in Q2 but we do have very strong group bookings in August. And we have strong group bookings in September. I think as you were I think alluding to there a part of that is due to the fact that the Jewish holidays have shifted into October. So we are not necessarily expecting acceleration in July but we do expect a strong August and September. Joe Greff : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Will take our next question from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : When you look at prior election cycles, how do I guess transient and group react going into an election? Is it normal to see this type of pause? Ed Walter : I don't know that we have necessarily identified a trend. I mean the two trends that we have seen is that sometimes a market like Washington will end up with a little bit softer business in the fourth quarter because when you are having a nationwide election, most of the elected officials tend to be out of the city. And since that they draw for business in Washington, we've sometimes seen some softening of business in DC related to that. We have generally seen that the election week ends up being relatively slow on the group side because at least larger groups are reluctant to schedule an event that would overlap Election Day. And so that is one of the reasons why we have indicated really for the last couple of quarters now we have highlighted the fact that we were not overly confident about the fourth quarter. One reason is the holiday shift but the other was the fact that we felt that this Election Day would be one that groups would be reluctant to book in. So, I think what we are going to find when we get to the fourth quarter, not to get too far ahead of ourselves here, is that you are going to see some incredibly strong weeks because group is going to be very compacted into the sort of the open weeks of that quarter and then those weeks that are affected either by the election or by the holiday will probably be fairly weak. Wes Golladay : Okay and then going back to the San Francisco Convention Center next year, Marriott Marquis is obviously a headquarter hotel. It appears they are trying to put in as much in house group for you at the hotel. How much of the overall group in house and from the convention center do you think you can recapture just by their push the San Francisco travels push to help you fill up the hotel? Ed Walter : Well, I don't know that that we don't have a precise forecast right now. But you've correctly identified exactly what we are trying to do. We do have a very good meeting platform there. We are trying to take full advantage of it to offset the loss of business that we might otherwise have gotten if the convention center had been not under construction and fully available. Wes Golladay : Okay, so qualitatively maybe are you more encouraged maybe than at the beginning of the year? Ed Walter : I am not certain that, I think we are still going to end up finding that we have a weaker year in San Francisco and that group bookings are going to probably at the Marquis will probably be down for the full year. I just think that we do enough business that is associated with the convention center that we have we do have a great meeting platform but I don't know that it is big enough to completely replace all of the citywide business. The one thing I would say though is that while the convention business will be off in San Francisco, we do think we have a very attractive hotel or hotels that are in great locations in that market. So, we are going to have a it is going to be a struggle to overcome some of the weakness on the group side but we are in good locations from a transient perspective too. Greg Larson : Wes, you really picked the most two extreme markets; DC has a very, very strong group booking pace for next year but then as Ed just mentioned, San Francisco is fairly weak for next year. Wes Golladay : And to follow up with that comment, I guess San Diego is probably going to do quite well with the complete renovation of the ballroom? Is that going to start being a big lift next year? Ed Walter : Yes, we are seeing San Francisco as being -- or San Diego, rather, being quite strong the second half of the year and I think we believe that carries into next year too. I mean San Diego should be one of our best markets in the second half of the year. Wes Golladay : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : We have a final question from Shaun Kelley, Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I was just wondering if we could get a quick update on your outlook for supply. We talked a lot about 2016 maybe last quarter and before but as you are looking out to 2017, any shift in some of your largest markets as we think about New York, San Francisco, LA, Boston and DC? Ed Walter : Yes, I think in general what we are -- the pattern that we have seen the last few years is that there is of course estimates from the experts in terms of what is going to happen with supply growth for the beginning of the year. And then normally what seems to happen is by the time we get to this point in the year or a little bit later, we begin to realize that the supply growth that is actually going to materialize is slightly less just because projects have a tendency to be delayed. And so this year I think we started off the year thinking that nationwide supply was probably going to be just under 2 and now it feels like it might be more in that 1.6, 1.7 range, which is not a huge difference. But still on the margin, a little bit better. So that is sort of 2016. We are expecting that supply next year will increase somewhat. I think we see that both across the industry and we also see that in the upper price points in the top 20 markets. So again I would say we are probably expecting the industry supply to be a little bit over 2 and probably expect that the supply in the top 20 markets is a little bit higher than that. I would also guess though that at some point we are going to see the same sort of lengthening of the delivery time for that supply which will hopefully maybe pull back down a little bit. New York continues, New York and Houston and Miami tend to be the markets that continue to see the strongest supply. Seattle might be one more that falls into that category. We are seeing while supply for New York will continue to be robust and a lot of it is under construction, my sense in looking at the data was we were seeing fewer projects that were projected to start in the next 12 months and fewer projects in planning. So we are hoping that that may signal a return to some level of rationality around New York supply. But we are not going to see the benefits of that in 2017. Shaun Kelley : Great, that is helpful. And just one follow up or [nit] was I think you mentioned early on in the prepared remarks that international demand was down about 7% for the quarter. Could you just give us a sense of where that came in for, where that was trending in Q1? Ed Walter : I think it was right around that same level, maybe a percent or so higher. Again as I have said in the past, this is a little bit of an imprecise science. But I think in looking back at our comments for the prior quarter, we were probably, we might have been just a hair higher in terms of Q1. And some of that would be reflective of the fact that the relationship between the US dollar in some of those other currencies is you are starting to lap over when we had an impact last year. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Walter for any additional or closing remarks. Ed Walter : Great, well thank you for joining us on the call today. We appreciated the opportunity to review our second-quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. We look forward to providing a further update during our third-quarter call in November. Have a great weekend. And travel often for the remainder of the summer. If you haven't looked at our website lately, it has got some great suggestions on places to stay. Bye. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg. Please go ahead, ma'am. Gee Lingberg - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts' third quarter 2016 earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA, and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our operations and the company's outlook for 2016. Greg will then provide greater detail on our third quarter performance by markets and our balance sheet. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed. W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a solid quarter. Our operating results, given the trends the industry is experiencing, were quite good and in line with our expectations. We completed the sales of our last two New Zealand assets, continued to make progress on our redevelopment investments, and repurchased 44 million of our stock in September, breaking the year-to-date total return to shareholders to over $800 million. Looking at our operating results, adjusted EBITDA was $342 million for the quarter reflecting an increase of 5.9%. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $1.123 billion, an increase of 5.3%. Our adjusted FFO was $0.37 per share for the third quarter and a $1.28 year-to-date, reflecting an 11.3% increase over last year. A strong EBITDA and FFO performance was driven by the top-line growth and margin expansion. For the quarter, our average rate grew 2.2% complemented by solid demand growth in our portfolio, as comparable hotel occupancy grew by 1.2 percentage points, allowing our comparable hotels to achieve an occupancy rate of 81.3%. As a result, comparable RevPAR growth on a constant dollar basis increased 3.8%. The primary driver of our RevPAR growth this quarter was our group segment. Our domestic hotels benefited from a 3.4% increase in group demand, all generated by a significant increase in association demand. Corporate demand was uneven in the quarter but the shift in the timing of the Jewish holidays from September of last year to October of this year led to a significant increase in corporate group during September. The net result was a 2.5% increase in average rate which was generally achieved across all of our group segments leading our domestic group revenues to increase by 6% for the quarter. Our international assets also buoyed portfolio results this quarter as our Canadian hotels benefited from strong transient demand leading to RevPAR growth of almost 15% and the Olympic Games generated a 105% RevPAR growth in our Brazil asset. Since much of our Olympic business was booked as group, our overall group business actually increased by more than 9% to the quarter. As would be expected, the strength in group demand was partially offset by a decline in transient demand which has been a theme for most of this calendar year. However, unlike the first two quarters, our hotels were able to increase rates and also push business into more highly-rated segments leading to transient rate growth of 2% for the quarter. Taking into account the decline in transient demand, our transient revenue growth was slightly less than 1%. Recognizing the trends we have been experiencing this year, we have been focused on layering in more highly-priced contract business at several of our hotels. Our contract business which is still only 5% of our total demand increased nearly 15% for the quarter and is up 17% year-to-date. The one aspect of our operations that was disappointing in Q3 was our food & beverage department as food & beverage revenues increased by just 0.3% which was roughly 2% less than we had anticipated. While F&B has been notoriously difficult to forecast, the bulk of the shortfall occurred in catering and resulted from groups being more conservative with their entertaining budgets. Our revenue actually grew by nearly 2% which was an impressive result given that transient occupancy had decreased. Offsetting some of the weakness in F&B, our other department revenues grew by a strong 10.5%. We saw a strong increase in spa revenues and an increase in attrition and cancellation fees which was largely concentrated at three of our convention hotels. Comparable hotel revenues increased 3.3% for the quarter. The increased level of higher rated group activity combined with the rate increase in our transient business as well as our continued focus on productivity improvements, resulted in strong rooms flow-through. This flow-through, plus reductions in utility and insurance expenses, contributed to our comparable EBITDA margin growth of a 110 basis points in the third quarter. Year-to-date, comparable hotel RevPAR has increased 3% in constant currency terms. Food and beverage has improved by 2.1%, and hotel revenues have increased by 3.1%. Comparable EBITDA margin growth is 90 basis points, which has generated 56% flow-through for the year which is a very solid result. An important focus of our company is actively managing our portfolio and efficiently allocating capital. Towards that goal, as I mentioned earlier, in the third quarter, we completed the sales of final two New Zealand properties for $31 million bringing out year-to-date, non-core asset sale total to approximately $500 million. We purchased this New Zealand portfolio for $190 million in New Zealand terms and received total sales proceeds in New Zealand dollars of NZD 266 million, which allowed us to achieve better than a 14.5% unlevered IRR on this investment. We are currently marketing our remaining consolidated Asia-Pacific asset, the Melbourne Hilton, and we'd hope to complete a sale during the first half of 2017. In addition, we are marketing a select few other non-core asset while we are making reasonable progress on these sales, the transactions have not yet gone hard and we do not expect any additional asset sales will be completed in 2016. On the investment front, the company invested approximately $46 million in the third quarter on redevelopment, return on investment and acquisition capital expenditures. We completed the initial phase of the Denver Marriott Tech Center redevelopment, which included newly-designed guest rooms in one of the towers, a new lobby and lounge, new fitness center and some additional meeting space. While we are pleased with the progress we have made on this project, we are slightly behind schedule due to some permitting challenges, but still expect to be completed by year-end. In addition, we have also made great progress on the first phase of the renovations at The Phoenician during the slower summer months. This phase included a complete redesign of the guestrooms, casitas and canyon suites. We are excited to have an opportunity to show you our progress at The Phoenician before NAREIT in less than two weeks. For the full year, we expect to spend $200 million to $215 million on redevelopment, ROI and acquisition projects and $300 million to $310 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures. Now, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Uncertainties surrounding the US Election and other international events lead us to believe that corporate profit growth and business investment levels will not improve meaningfully in the near term, suggesting that business transient demand will remain soft in the fourth quarter. While year-to-date, our domestic group revenues went up nearly 4%, we expect to experience a softer fourth quarter as the Jewish holiday shift and nationwide election will reduce group demand and the traditionally lower occupancies in the fourth quarter will likely restrain rate growth. Our group booking and revenue take for Q4 is only slightly positive and assuming continued short-term booking weakness could easily be slightly negative for the fourth quarter. A combination of these factors suggest that we will experience minimal RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter, leading us to conclude that our full year comparable RevPAR will increase between 2% and 2.5%. Weaker group demand and negligible revenue growth will put pressure on operating margins in the fourth quarter, reversing to some degree the strong results we have seen year-to-date. As a consequence, we expect our full-year comparable hotel EBITDA margin growth improvement to be in the range of 40 basis points to 55 basis points. This should translate to full-year adjusted EBITDA of $1.440 billion to $1.455 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.64 to $1.66. Looking ahead to 2017, as we have indicated in prior years, our visibility at this time into next year is limited as we have just started on our detailed operating budget process. There are a number of factors that will influence operating results in 2017, starting first and foremost with the economy. This year, we are experiencing weaker GDP growth and declines in corporate profits and investments, plus the strength in the US dollar. These factors have led to weak corporate transient demand and reduced international travel, resulting in industry demand growth of just 1.5%, which is well short of the average of nearly 3% for the last three years. The outlook for GDP corporate profits and corporate investment is more favorable in 2017, but the concept that it will be better next year has been offered frequently during this recovery and generally hasn't come to fruition. The current fee outlook is slightly more favorable, especially in countries such as Japan and Brazil, which could lead to better international travel trends. As opposed to the uncertainty surrounding demand factors, it is clear that supply is increasing. In our top 19 markets, upscale and above supply has increased by roughly 2.5% in 2016, while a number of reports have correctly noted that our portfolio is less exposed to new supply than many others in the industry, primarily because we benefit from a more diversified distribution. Supply in our markets is still expected to increase by more than 3% in 2017. While we are experiencing record occupancies this year, this anticipated supply increase suggests that we will need to have stronger demand growth in 2017 to have pricing power. Our group revenues for 2017 are up over 2.5%, but short-term bookings have been growing at a slower rate and so we would not accomplish expect to benefit (12:15) from the significant increase in group activities that we have seen in 2016. Combining all of these insights along with the trend of weakening top-line growth that we have seen over the last two years, we would not expect to see RevPAR accelerate in 2017 unless the economy improves meaningfully. We will provide much greater insights into our outlook for 2017 in our fourth quarter call in February. With that, let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you, Ed. I'll start with commentary on performance in several of our major markets. Our consolidated international hotels had a spectacular third quarter with double-digit RevPAR increases in Latin America and Canada of more than 61% and almost 15%, respectively. As anticipated, the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Brazil drove significant increases in our three Brazilian hotels. Our hotels in Calgary and Toronto also experienced double-digit RevPAR growth. Toronto's outperformance was mainly the result of a Microsoft city-wide in July which caused compression in that market. Calgary experienced strong growth due to an increase in events at the convention center. Keep in mind that overall demand in Brazil, excluding the demand surrounding the Olympics, has been weak due to concerns over Zika, economic and political issues, as well as increased supply. As a result, we expect lodging fundamentals in Brazil to weaken in the fourth quarter. As discussed last quarter, despite the slow start in San Diego in the first half of the year, RevPAR for our assets in the market grew at an impressive 11.8% this quarter, with occupancy growth of 5.6 percentage points and a 5% increase in average rate. Importantly, our RevPAR results exceeded the STAR upper upscale market results by 430 basis points. The increase in city-wide room nights from MLB All-Star Game and Comic-Con created healthy compression in the market and resulted in strong group business, which was up almost 26%. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our hotels in San Diego to continue to outperform our portfolio. Our hotels in Hawaii grew RevPAR 7.7% this quarter, beating the STAR upper upscale market results by 220 basis points. Occupancy increased 4.8 percentage points and average rate improved 2.1%. Strong transient demand at our Mali hotel coupled with solid group business at the Fairmont Kea Lani and Hyatt Place Waikiki offset ballroom renovation displacement at Hyatt Maui. Short-term transient demand increased more than anticipated in August and September, as vacationers chose Maui over the Zika-feared Caribbean locations and airfare costs remained stable. We expect our Hawaiian hotels to continue to outperform our portfolio in the fourth quarter. In addition, we should note that Hawaii is the market with the lowest expected supply growth out of the top-20 U.S. markets for the next couple of years, which bodes well for future performance. As expected, our properties in D.C. outperformed our portfolio again this quarter, with RevPAR growth of 6.8% outpacing the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR increase by 120 basis points. This was driven predominantly by an average rate increase of 5.6% as well as a 90-basis point increase in occupancy. The Westin Georgetown, JW D.C. and Grand Hyatt all had double-digit RevPAR growth this quarter benefiting from renovations in the comp set and a strong group base that created mid-week compression and enabled the hotels to drive strong average rate growth. With elections next Tuesday and the resulting slowdown in legislative activity, we expect RevPAR growth to slow in the fourth quarter, but still expect outperformance relative to the portfolio. Even though we have not provided any guidance for 2017, it is worth mentioning that city-wides in 2017 look strong for D.C. Combined with Congress operating on a full calendar and Inauguration in January, we expect there will be additional demand in 2017. Los Angeles continues to outperform the portfolio, with a 6.6% increase in the third quarter. The results were driven by a 3.5% growth in average rate and a 2.5 percentage point increase in occupancy. Strong group and contracts business at several of our hotels drove the RevPAR increase which exceeded the STAR upper upscale market results by 120 basis points. Year-to-date, our hotels in Los Angeles have grown RevPAR by 8.9%. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, group booking pace in Los Angeles remains strong and as a result, we expect continued outperformance from our Los Angeles properties. In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 5.6% for the quarter as a result of average rate growth of 0.8% and occupancy increase of 3.6 percentage points. Continued strong city-wide room nights in the third quarter contributed to the outperformance. As anticipated, the city-wide calendar on a year-over-year basis for the fourth quarter will be weak. Therefore, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR to be flat for last year. Moving to some challenged markets. New York RevPAR decreased 4% basically in line with the STAR upper upscale decline of 3.6%. Supply continued to outpace demand, which when combined with lower European travel and tour business due to the strong US dollar continued to negatively impact our ability to drive rates. Based on our outlook for the market, we expect the hotels in New York to continue to have a RevPAR decline in the fourth quarter. RevPAR of the San Francisco hotels declined 3.4% with a decrease in both occupancy and rate this quarter. Group room nights were down due to the Moscone Convention Center expansion which will continue to negatively impact San Francisco in 2017. Due to the lack of group compression, almost all hotels booked more lower-rated transient business resulting in overall transient ADR decline of 5.4%. Our San Francisco hotels will likely underperform our portfolio in the fourth quarter. The Houston market continues to be impacted by the struggling oil industry and increased supply as evidenced by the superior decline in the STAR upper upscale of nearly 14%. Our Houston hotels' RevPAR declined 2.9% in the quarter, as a 3.7% decrease in ADR was partially offset by a small increase in occupancy. Two major city-wide events did not repeat in the third quarter this year compelling our managers to book group business at our hotels to maintain occupancy. This proved to be the right strategy as we beat the STAR upper upscale market by 11 percentage points. We expect the difficulties in Houston to continue in the fourth quarter and therefore anticipate that these hotels will underperform the portfolio. RevPAR of the hotels in Seattle declined 1.5% in the third quarter. Occupancy declined about one percentage point to almost 91% and ADR decreased 0.3%. Last year, our hotels in Seattle had a record group business in the quarter and grew at RevPAR 9.8%, making for a difficult comparison this year. Many of the groups during third quarter last year did not repeat this year and the market has seen a decrease in Canadian leisure weekend business contributing to the weaker results this quarter. We expect performance to improve in the fourth quarter as transient demand increases and the W Seattle will benefit from being under renovation last December. RevPAR of the Phoenix hotels grew 0.6% in the quarter with an occupancy decline of 4.3 percentage points and an increase in ADR of 7.9%. Our hotels were negatively impacted by group cancellations, slippage and soft transient demand. We expect RevPAR of the hotels in Phoenix to improve in the fourth quarter. Chipping to our European joint venture, the portfolio continues to be negatively impacted by a number of macro factors, including the lingering effect of the terrorist attack in Paris and Brussels and the political and economic uncertainty pre and post Brexit. All this led to a RevPAR decline of 2.6% in constant euro this quarter. As expected, our hotels in Paris and Brussels significantly underperformed the portfolio while our hotels in London, Spain and Stockholm outperformed. We expect our hotels in Paris and Brussels will continue to be challenged in the fourth quarter. As noted in our press release, during the third quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares at an average purchase price of $16.04 for a total purchase price of $44 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in April of 2015, we have bought back 51.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $883 million. We currently have $117 million of capacity remaining under the repurchase program. In addition, in October, we paid a regular third quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents an annualized yield of over 5% on the current stock price. Based on our current operating forecast, combined with taxable gains generated from our completed asset sales to-date and our regular fourth quarter dividend, we expect to pay a special dividend of approximately $0.05, bringing total dividends for the fourth quarter to $0.25 per share. We continued to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility and believe we have one of the best balance sheets in the lodging REITs and overall REITs space. Importantly, we view this as a key competitive and strategic advantage which enhances our ability to pay our dividends throughout the cycle and allows us to invest as opportunities arise to buy asset, buy back our stock or reinvest in high-yielding redevelopment or ROI projects. We ended the third quarter with approximately $340 million of cash and currently have $628 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. We improved our leverage ratio, as calculated under our credit facility, to 2.5 times. It is important to note that when updating models for 2017, our 2016 adjusted EBITDA includes $12 million for the reimbursement of operating losses at the New Orleans Marriott due to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In addition, the 2016 full-year guidance includes adjusted EBITDA of $13 million that was earned by the hotels that have been sold during the year. Therefore, a total of $25 million in EBITDA will not repeat in 2017. However, keep in mind that comparable EBITDA margin growth in 2016 was not impacted by these items as the business interruption insurance proceeds and sold assets are excluded from our comparable hotel results. In summary, we are pleased with our results this quarter as the profitability of our assets continues to improve due to our aggressive asset management strategies in what continues to be a competitive environment. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator : Thank you. We'll go first to Anthony Powell with Barclays. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning, everyone. I believe you mentioned the group cancellations a few times in your script. So if you could give us more details on what exactly was going on there and what markets were impacted and if you expect that to continue next year? W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yes. Overall, we've seen that cancellation and attrition fees, which is what we were talking about, have been higher this year than they have been in the last few years. Now, I would tell you that the level of attrition and cancellations we saw in the first half of this decade was below what I would describe as our long-term average, but the bottom line is they're up about 30% for the year. They were up closer to about 60% this particular quarter. We saw the cancellations in Orlando and at two of our larger convention hotels, one in San Francisco, which I suspect might have been a little bit related to some of the activity out there at the convention center that you're all fully aware of, and also at the Marquis. I would imagine that you'll \u2013 that we think that will moderate a bit in the fourth quarter, but it's not abnormal at this part of the cycle to start to see a little bit more in terms of cancellation and attrition activity. So we would expect to see that continue at a slightly elevated level compared to the 2010 to 2015 timeframe. Part of that, I would note, though, is I'd be careful to draw the conclusion that means that people are canceling it or not showing up to a greater degree in the past. I'm sure that's part of what's happening. Some of that, this is also reflective of the fact that we have better contracts from our perspective, which is enabling us to recover more when folks don't show up. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. And Greg, I think you mentioned your ability to pay your dividend through the cycle. What did you mean by that? And are you committed to maintaining your current dividend even as taxable income goes down a bit next year? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yes. I mean, obviously, as I noted today, our taxable income actually exceeds the $0.80. And so, yes, I think we \u2013 what we've said in the past is that we would like to pay our dividend throughout this next cycle, and if our taxable income were to have a modest drop next year, yes, I think because we have one of the best balance sheets in the entire REIT universe, I think we're in a good position to be able to continue to pay the dividend. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Joseph Greff with JPMorgan. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, everybody. Greg, can you help us understand how much the Olympics contributed to your Brazil results in terms of revenues and EBITDA in the third quarter? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I mean, when we look at our hotels in Latin America, I mean, they had a RevPAR increase in north of 60%, so obviously, a little bit. W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yes. One way to look at that, Joe, would be that our \u2013 I think for the full year, we're probably expecting that our Brazil hotels will generate between, call it, $10 billion to $12 billion worth of EBITDA. So, they're not overly significant to our overall results, but there was \u2013 we had an incredibly strong quarter especially at the top line, and that obviously did influence our overall results for the quarter. Having said that, if you look at our domestic results, we would still \u2013 we've still had a very solid quarter from a domestic perspective with RevPAR being up 2.8%. So, no doubt that that headline number is better because of Brazil, but we were strong in Mexico and we were strong in Toronto, too. So, all of our international hotels had a good quarter and domestic portfolio did, too. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And then, you talked about this in your earlier prepared remarks about the transaction market, but can you talk about the asset sale transaction market? I guess how frozen is it now, especially when you look at markets with high supply growth, say, a city like New York? Thank you. W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. I would say that it certainly not \u2013 and I think you've heard this from others. The market is not as robust as it was in 2014 and the first half of 2015. Having said that, I would say that there's still activity happening. I just think deals take longer. The number of folks that are chasing a particular transaction is probably a little bit thinner. We're hearing as we talk with the brokerage community, as we look at the experience we're having, we're finding that the international buyers are probably a bit higher percentage of the activity than in past. You're seeing some smaller operators associated with family offices chase after some of the smaller deals that are out there. I've heard that some of the public but non-traded REITs or non-listed REITs have been a bit more active, too. So there's still a market out there. I feel reasonably optimistic that we're \u2013 I certainly feel optimistic we'll sell Melbourne. I think that there is a decent chance that we'll complete a few more asset sales. But as I started off in saying the market is not as strong as it had been, and that's why you're not seeing as many sales announced by folks. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning, guys. Ed, maybe just to follow-up on that last point. You had laid out a program of I think $500 million to $1 billion. You're at the lower bound of that now, of what you wanted to target. Is there a chance that getting further, reaching too much further closer to the $1 billion, is increasingly off the table just given what you're seeing out there? How are you thinking about that target now? W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Short answer is that I think we can still over the next three quarters get to the $1 billion number. But I would also say that that is totally dependent on us feeling comfortable with the pricing that we get. Greg talked about the strength of our balance sheet, and I think you all recognize that. We're not doing this for liquidity reasons. We're doing this because we're trying to be smart about how to continue to position our portfolio for the future. And the assets that we're selling now are just ones that we generally think will not perform as well as the remainder of our portfolio or may have higher capital needs. The one exception to that would be Melbourne, where we've made the conscious decision to exit the Asia-Pacific market and so we want to sell that property. We won't sell that for a bad price, by any means, but that is one that we are more motivated to sell perhaps than some others. So bottom line is that I think we still have a reasonable shot at getting to the high end of that range, but we'll be thoughtful in terms of evaluating the sale opportunities that we have and making the decisions going forward on those sales. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. I appreciate that. And then my follow-up is related to some of your comments on supply. So appreciate that color as we look forward to next year. If I recap, I think you guys said that in Host markets, you're looking for greater than 3% supply in 2017. Can you just give us a sense of where is that number this year in Host markets so we can compare and see how big of an acceleration you're anticipating? W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, you mean what is that number this year? Is that what you were asking? Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, correct. W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah, so I think the number that we're quoting, what we're finding today as relevant is to look at upscale and above. So I think you know that the upper upscale segment generally has very light supply. And I think that's still coming in generally across the board in our markets at less than 2%. But it's clear to us that, depending upon the property, we may compete with upscale supply, too. And so if we look at that particular number, this year we would say that across our top 19 or 20 markets, we're looking at supply that's roughly 2.5% in 2016. We think that's going to escalate to slightly more than 3% in 2017. Markets that we are a bit concerned about would be ones that you are, too, Seattle, Denver, Houston, and New York. I think the thing to note for us, though, is that while those markets represent about, call it, 15% of our EBITDA, we also have great representation in some markets like Atlanta, Hawaii, San Diego or San Francisco, that are expected to have much lower supply. And in fact, those last four markets that I just referred to, we have more than 25% of our EBITDA coming from those markets. So hence my point in our prepared remarks that when we see our portfolio compared to others, we think we have a little bit less exposure to supply than some others because of the diversity in the portfolio. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Very clear. Thanks a lot. Operator : We'll go next to Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning. Two questions. First, you added a disclosure on hotel management opportunities in the press release. Can you provide some additional color on how the new economics impacted results and also address how many properties are potentially still governed by above-market management fee agreements? W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah, we had agreed at least for the short-term not to provide specifics about that particular transaction. So, unfortunately, I'm going to have to abide by that agreement. But I would say that we had an opportunity there where a contract was expiring and there was a chance to both lower our management fees. We extended the term a bit, but we retained a fair amount of flexibility in terms of how the hotel would be operated going forward. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I think if you look across our portfolio, we do continue to have a number of opportunities. It probably falls in the realm of a couple of years you space things out over the next five to seven years where there's an opportunity to consider either replacing the existing branded operator with a franchise operator or we may have contracts that terminate that offer us even more flexibility. So I think it's an area that we've been able to have a fair amount of \u2013 we view that where we've may done conversions or where we've changed contracts, we're consistently seeing anywhere from a 10% to 20% improvement in EBITDA as a result of the changes that we're making. And it's something that we could build into our business plan for each year is to look at the opportunities that may exist for that year and then try to exploit them. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Then just as a follow-up, with the closing of the Marriott Starwood transaction, can you just give any kind of initial color on the potential impact there, and any difference in hotel level fundamentals between the two companies and comparable chains? Thanks. W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Of course, at this point, they've only been closed for probably less than 45 days. And certainly, maybe the biggest issue that surrounds that whole transaction from our perspective as an owner will be how smoothly and how successfully the integration goes. I'm sure that Marriott and Arne will give you more insights into those issues on their call which I'm assuming is later this week. I guess what I'd say is, as we've looked at this and we've consistently said this since the transaction was announced, our Starwood Hotels were operated under the Marriott expense and cost structure, not fee structure, but the operating costs of running those hotels. We think that there will be an opportunity to reduce expenses at our Starwood Hotels. There's a number of elements of the Marriott system, be it reservations or purchasing or some other areas, including their agreements with the online company where the Marriott contracts and the Marriott cost structure is cheaper. I can't \u2013 it's \u2013 we know that as they work their way through the integration process, we will start to see the benefits of those cost savings. But it's a little hard right now for us to predict how quickly that will happen. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Fair enough. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. It seems like one of the bright spots during this earnings season has been leisure trends outperforming. I mean, how long do you think that leisure trends can continue to outperform given the corporate environment? And any other thoughts on leisure trends would be helpful. Thank you. W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yes. I think as long as employment remains fairly strong then I would say looking back in past history, leisure should probably hold up fairly well. If you go back to the 2001 to 2003 downturn, we generally found throughout that downturn, because it was not from an economic perspective, it was not that severe. Hence, unemployment, if my recollection serves me right, did not increase significantly during that time period. We found that our resort hotels outperformed during that time period, and we generally found that leisure travel was fairly strong. I think, going forward, the other thing that will affect leisure travel will be international leisure. We've had \u2013 the last 18 months have been a bit weak, primarily because of currency. But assuming that the currency stabilizes, I think there's an opportunity for some pickup there. We're generally fairly bullish as you look out over the next five years about our resorts profile. We think it benefits from both a combination of the leisure trends that we just discussed, and secondarily, it benefits from the fact that supply in the resorts segment is much lower than the industry as a whole. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful. Thanks. And then, can you just give us an update on how you think the hotel brand's direct booking push is affecting your business? Thanks. W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: We're generally in favor of what they are trying to do there. We know that there is some short-term pain associated with that. The best estimate that I have heard of that is it might have cost us a couple of tenths of RevPAR growth in the last couple of quarters. So we're watching it and well, obviously, to the extent that it doesn't seem to be accomplishing their goals, may urge them to reconsider it. But at this point in time, we're still comfortable with heading down that path. I mean, the bottom line is that the reservation made through an operator website is a heck of a lot cheaper for us than one that might come through an OTA in terms of the costs associated with that booking. And so to the extent that we can drive more traffic to that operator website, we generally think that makes a difference for us from the bottom line and that's what matters most to us. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about, and I'm sure you'll give more detail on your fourth-quarter call, but just your CapEx priorities as you think about 2017 and where you are? You have about $100 million left on your share repurchase program, would you look to continue to buy back shares at these levels or just sort of some general thoughts around that? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure. Let me answer the second question, first. We will be buying more of our shares back, especially if the price remains at the current level. And we do \u2013 we have the balance sheet capability to do that. We have the authorization from the board to do that. So, you should assume that we'll continue to pursue a share buyback. CapEx for next year, I'd say that we've been \u2013 had been targeting for a few years now to be spending a bit less, especially on maintenance CapEx in 2016 and I think that will carry over in 2017. So, I would generally expect to see a little bit less capital in 2017. Our thought had generally been that we would prefer to \u2013 we would look to increase capital spending a bit later in the cycle under the theory that it costs us a little bit less maybe in terms of lost occupancy. And it costs us a little bit less because oftentimes as you get near the end of the cycle, pricing for construction projects drops, too. So, we're not at the point we're making any decisions about 2018. We are looking hard at our 2017 plan, and I'd say general \u2013 the general initial sense, without putting a hard number on it, is it will be lower than what we've spent in 2016. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. You know, you mentioned earlier, too, that all things being equal that Marriott Hotels run, I guess, at a higher relative operating margin versus Starwood. And I was just wondering, I mean just two similar hotels side-by-side, like what is kind of the difference, all things being equal? Is it like 50 basis points or is it a point of margin or just kind of very broadly? W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: You know Smedes, I know that it is less, but I'm not confident enough, sitting here right now, to give you a direct answer on that question. So, let's \u2013 I don't think it's more than a point. Let's put it that way. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's fair enough. I just \u2013 that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to David Loeb with Baird. David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, good morning. I wonder if I could just take you back to capital allocation. I noted the increased ROE spending in the fourth quarter, and I wonder if you could just comment about how you look at ROE spending versus buybacks? And how tightly tied are future asset sales and continued stock buybacks? Thanks. W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I would say that the increase that you saw in the ROI CapEx \u2013 or the redevelopment CapEx is a lot more to just do with the timing of when we expect to complete projects, and probably even more so when we expect to close them out, rather than being an indication of any change in philosophy or change in quantity in terms of our projects. There may be a little bit of a couple of projects being a hair more expensive than what we had originally anticipated. But the reality is that overall in talking with our construction group. Our overall budgets \u2013 our overall performance compared to budget is coming in pretty consistently with what we expected. And so that mild increase that you see in the numbers compared to the prior quarter really just reflects the fact that we expected to pay for more of the costs this year, and that's likely because we're finishing a little bit sooner for some of those projects. I think as the \u2013 looking beyond that or thinking more broadly, we look at all of these different options, whether it's investing in the portfolio, buying stock or other investments on kind of a comparative basis. Opportunities to enhance the portfolio have generally driven higher rate or higher levels of return and will continue to be attractive. Having said that, I don't think we have as many of those opportunities in 2017 as we've had in 2015 and 2016. And so I expect, the volume of activity in there will be lower. David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Hi. Good morning, guys. W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Good morning. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : So just another twist on the Marriott-Starwood question. So I appreciate the color that you guys were able to give on in terms of how you're looking at 2017 at this point. But to the extent that Marriott is able to give an initial look on 2017 RevPAR when it reports next week and also given that I believe that the overlap in terms of concentration within Host portfolio is even higher today now that the deal has closed than it was before, do you think that there would be any material differences in how they view North American RevPAR growth next year versus what you guys might think about your portfolio? W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Rich, that's a great question and I think to some degree we're all sort of chuckling here as we hear that. Here's what I will tell you. Clearly, our hotels, in the position they're in, both physically and locationally. Should generally perform in line with what Marriott would generally be suggesting their broad-based brands would deliver. Now, their optimism about what the numbers might be for next year versus our trying to be realistic could \u2013 in other words, it's hard to predict exactly how they're going to look at next year and what message they want to try to convey. So I guess at the end of the day, we've tried to provide you with as clear a view as we can have at this particular time in terms of what's going to happen for 2017. Ultimately, as you're suggesting, I would expect our hotels to generally perform in line with what they would be predicting for domestic performance because our hotels represent a big part of their portfolio. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah, I agree with all that. I mean, obviously, there are some geographic differences as well and plus, as you know, Rich, a lot of the supply growth recently has been on the select service side. And they have, obviously, quite a bit of select service. We do not. So that could be another difference as well. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Yeah, that's very helpful color, guys. And then my second question is just on G&A. As you think about the fact that you're exiting certain markets around the country and around the world as well, and I'm assuming that transaction expenses are included in the corporate G&A line item at this point. I didn't see a different number anywhere else in the release. Do you see G&A savings opportunities in some of those categories or other categories as we think about next year and beyond? W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I don't know that I would \u2013 the short answer is yes in the standpoint that, as we have phased out of the Asia market, we are certainly cutting expenses in that market and so that there is some benefit that flows from that. I don't know that I would necessarily expect, though, in modeling our G&A expense that you should be thinking that there'd be radical differences from one year to the next, at least in the context of 2016 looking at 2017. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Robin Farley at UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. I think in the past you've talked about needing RevPAR to grow in the 2% to 3% range to offset increases in expense. Your comments about next year suggest that maybe you wouldn't expect more than a 2% increase, maybe even lower or just something similar to this year's levels around 2%. How should we think about expense growth without \u2013 or I guess impact on profitability if RevPAR is not up above the level to offset those higher expenses? And your comment about maybe savings from the Starwood-Marriott transaction, if I'm understanding that right, it sounded like maybe that's only 100 basis points of expense to be offset. And I guess that would only be in the sort of \u2013 I don't know, is that like 20% or 25% of your room base that are Starwood, coming from Starwood. Maybe you could put some color around that. Thanks. W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure. So first off, I would say that in terms of thinking about the level of RevPAR and revenue growth that we likely would need from one year to the next in order to maintain the margins that we have, I'd say today our thinking is that needs to be right around or just slightly above 2%. And that's based on nothing more complicated than expecting inflation to generally run at about that level. And so if our costs go up by inflation then we certainly need to match that at the revenue line in order to maintain our margins. Now I will point out that that does mean that EBITDA grows at that same rate of inflation or slightly better. And so that's not suggesting that we'd be at flat EBITDA, but I think that's still a reasonable reference point. We do think that there are some things that we're working on now, including the continuation of the time-motion study work that we've done, which we talked about before and has saved us a fair amount of money this year. We do think there are some things on those lines that might benefit us next year. And of course, to the extent that we end up with a lower level of RevPAR growth that we've been suggesting, then we'll be working hard at trying to find other ways to take costs out. Some of that will, of course, be dependent upon whether that lower level of RevPAR is generated more by lack of rate growth or perhaps a reduction in occupancy. The latter, obviously, gives us a better opportunity to try to take costs out of the system. In terms of the benefits that would flow from the Marriott-Starwood merger, I honestly would not be expecting to see a significant amount of that benefit in 2017. There are a few things that could happen more quickly, but I think there's still some work to be done in this area. I believe that the opportunity benefit from the new Marriott-negotiated OTA agreements could probably take hold next year. But I think a lot of the other integration activity that would be required for us to get the expense savings are likely to take a bit longer to happen. And so I would not be counting on a benefit of that in 2017. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. And for my follow-up question, do you think the current environment with at least not accelerating RevPAR growth, I don't know if you see it decelerating next year, but this current environment, do you see opportunity in maybe consolidation among just the REITs? In other words, you haven't been a buyer of assets, but would it make sense, could it make sense for you to be involved with consolidation among small or medium-sized REITs? W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: That concept of consolidation on the ownership side has certainly gotten more attention since we've seen a bit more consolidation on the operating side. To-date, despite the fact that I think a number of you have offered good reasons why that should occur. We have not seen that occur. So I wouldn't rule out that it could possibly happen, but I would say that it's not a particular objective of ours. We're not concerned about getting larger, we're just concerned about essentially becoming more valuable. That could happen in the context of a larger transaction. But typically that has not proven to be the case. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Harry Curtis with Nomura. Mr. Curtis, your line is open. You may have us muted at the time. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. We can hear you now. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: What's that? I don't have a \u2013 I'm not on the line. W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, you are, Harry. We can hear you. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: It's not on. W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, I guess we'll have to move to the next caller. Operator : Mr. Curtis \u2013 are you able to hear us right now, Mr. Curtis? Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Can you hear me? Gee Lingberg - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah.

Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Mr. Curtis, do you have a question for the conference today? [Technical Difficulty] (53:12-53:21) Operator : Okay, thank you. We'll move on to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Mr. Golladay, your line is open. Please go ahead with your question. W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: You know what, I'm guessing that we must \u2013 there must be a technical issue here because of the fact that we had two calls in a row. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Why don't we try one final question and then we'll end it? W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: One more, why don't we move to the next participant? Operator : Thank you. We'll move next to Bill Crow with Raymond James. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I'm sorry, everyone. Operator : Mr. Crow, your line is open. Please go ahead with your question. W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I think we should end it. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yes. W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: All right. Folks, we apologize for what seems to be a technical difficulty here, but the team will be available to answer any of your questions throughout the rest of the day and tomorrow. Thank you for joining us on this call today. We appreciate the opportunity to talk about our third quarter. We look forward to seeing many of you at the event in Phoenix in a couple of weeks and of course talking to you in February to discuss both our year end 2016 results and provide a lot more insight into 2017.

Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts, Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Gee Lingberg - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts' fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA, and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer will begin by providing some thoughts on his transition, then will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full-year results, discuss our recent transaction, and conclude with his outlook for 2017. Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our fourth quarter performance by markets, margins, balance sheet, and our guidance for 2017. Following their remarks, will be available to respond to your questions. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Host's fourth quarter and full-year results. I'll begin by saying how honored and humble I am to lead this great company. Not only do we have an incredible portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels, but we have some of the brightest, innovative and hardworking professionals in the industry. I am excited to help take Host to the next level alongside them. I would also like to thank Ed Walter for everything he has done for Host over the past decade. Personally, I would like to thank him for his friendship over the past 20 years and wish him all the best. In my first two months at the helm, I have had the privilege to meet with many of our employees, investors, analysts, and operating partners. Many, if not all of them, have asked the same question. How will Host be different going forward? It's an important question, but before I can answer that, I think it's worth reaffirming what remains the same and why I am so confident in our future. First, we will continue to own the most geographically diverse portfolio of irreplaceable hotel real estate in the industry. Second, we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, providing us a flexibility to navigate the inherent volatility of our business over the course of the cycle. Finally, we will continue to take advantage of our scale, both on the acquisition front where we have a competitive advantage to pursue large complex transactions and in analytics where we can utilize our wealth of property information to mine and create value for our stockholders. We are in the early stages of assessing the organization and its strategic direction. I'm actively reaching out to all stakeholders to gain an understanding of their perspective on Host and what it is they would like to see from the company going forward. I look forward to speaking with many of you over the next several months to receive your input and help shape my perspective as we work to refine and advance our strategy. Having said that, the first item we're looking to strengthen is our culture, which I believe is the cornerstone of any successful organization. For Host to continue creating long-term value for our stockholders, we believe we need to empower employees by fostering an entrepreneurial environment that is dynamic, nimble and efficient. I have been encouraged by our early efforts and believe these changes are resonating with employees. We have established an enterprise analytics group, which allows us to streamline several critical functions and enhances our ability to leverage information to create benefits for current and future investments throughout the cycle. When I refer to Host as being more nimble, I think of us as being much more opportunistic in acquiring great real estate that will enhance the quality of the portfolio and ultimately, drive the value of the company. To do so, we will be more open to investing outside our historical top 10 to 12 markets and using our strong balance sheet to pursue accretive acquisitions where we can add real value. Of course, we will remain disciplined in our approach to external growth opportunities. A great example of our acquisition strategy is the transaction we just announced this morning, the Don CeSar in St. Pete Beach. The resort is an iconic Grand Dame Floridian resort on one of the top beaches in the U.S. and was available free and clear of brand and management. While the property immediately fits into the top 20 and 10 from a RevPAR and EBITDA per key perspective, we believe there is a substantial upside to our underwriting with the installation of Davidson Hotels & Resorts as the new operator along with a targeted capital plan. And while I anticipate we will be more active on the investment front, should the economy and markets falter and our stock trade down to some of the levels we witnessed last year, you can also expect us to be prepared to repurchase shares, which is why we have also announced an additional $500 million share repurchase program this morning. I also note that whether we are evaluating new acquisitions or share buybacks, we fully intend to maintain a strong balance sheet, which we believe to be one of our core strategic tenets. Hopefully that provides you with some color on my near-term focus. With that, let's discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results. We are pleased to report a better-than-expected fourth quarter and full-year results for our company. Our results were driven by strong group and leisure demand growth, which led to the highest full RevPAR in our history. We saw outstanding margin improvement in both the fourth quarter and full year, driven by a combination of productivity improvements and lower utility costs. The lower utility costs are partially a result of the energy saving ROI projects we have implemented over the last several years. Adjusted EBITDA was $348 million for the quarter and $1.471 billion for the full year, an increase of 4.4%. Comparable hotel EBITDA growth was even better, up 5.8%. Our adjusted FFO was $0.41 per share for the fourth quarter and $1.69 year to date, reflecting a 9.7% increase over last year. Both our EBITDA and FFO results for the quarter exceeded consensus estimates. Despite the expected deceleration due to the shift of the Jewish holidays from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, results were better than anticipated. For the quarter, hotel occupancy grew 80 basis points to 75%, and our average rate grew 60 basis points. As a result, comparable RevPAR growth on a constant dollar basis increased 1.7%. For the full year, comparable hotel occupancy increased 130 basis points, and average room rate increased 1%. On a constant currency basis, full year RevPAR growth increased 2.7% to approximately $177, which as mentioned, was the highest full year RevPAR in our history. The primary driver of our results this quarter was our group business. On our third quarter call, we had anticipated a weakness in this segment due to the holiday shift, the November election, and Hurricane Matthew. Fortunately, the hurricane did not materially impact our Florida properties, and despite the election, November was our strongest month in the quarter with a 9.7% increase in group demand, and a 2.9% increase in rate. Throughout the fourth quarter, our higher rated corporate group business was our strongest segment with a 9% increase in demand. Overall, group demand increased 1.8% with a 1.3% increase in average rate, leading to fourth quarter group revenues increasing by 3.1%. For the full year, group revenues were up 4.5% as a result of demand increasing 2.1% and an average increase in rate of 2.4%. As we anticipated, the strength in group demand was partially offset by a decline in transient demand, which was a theme for most of 2016. The solid group performance in November and early December displaced mid-week transient volume. As a result, transient demand declined 1% in the fourth quarter, while rate increased 80 basis points. We continue to see positive demand growth from leisure business, but that was offset by declines in special corporate demand. For the full year, our transient business was up 1.2% as a result of a 50 basis point increase in demand and a 70 basis point increase in average rate. The solid fourth quarter group business led to favorable results in food and beverage. While fourth quarter F&B revenues increased less than 1%, profit margins increased 140 basis points. For the full year, F&B revenues increased 1.7% and margins increased 90 basis points. The margin increase is mostly related to productivity improvements and somewhat to food and beverage cost reductions. Total comparable hotel revenues increased 1.9% for the quarter. The increased group activity, combined with our continued focus on operational improvements, resulted in strong rooms flow-through. As a result, comparable EBITDA margin grew 65 basis points in the quarter. For the full year, total comparable hotel revenues increased by 2.8% with comparable EBITDA margin growth up 80 basis points. As I mentioned earlier, we acquired the 277-room Don CeSar resort and its sister property, the 70-unit Beach House Suites in St. Pete Beach for $214 million. The main resort features over 38,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor event space. The Beach House is an all suites property with rooms averaging over 600 square feet. The resort is distinct in historical architecture combined with its unprecedented location on one of the best beaches in the U.S., making it an ideal hotel for leisure, corporate and social groups. We are acquiring the resort unencumbered by brand and management. We have selected Davidson Hotels & Resorts to operate the property as an independent hotel under the Pivot Hotels collection. After the completion of a strategic renovation, working with Davidson and utilizing proprietary internal benchmarking and cost saving initiatives, we believe we can materially increase existing performance at the resort. Further, there are several ROI opportunities we did not underwrite that we believe could drive incremental value. As part of a like kind exchange with the Don, we sold the JW Marriott Desert Springs and Palm Desert, California on January 11 for $172 million which deferred a taxable gain of approximately $65 million. The property was encumbered by a long-term management agreement with Marriott and due for an extensive renovation. With a RevPAR of less than $140, materially lower than the average of our portfolio, the hotel is projected to require CapEx spending of nearly 9% of total revenues over the next 10 years, and resides in a historically volatile market where airlift is a challenge. As far as our outlook on the investments front, I think you can expect that we will be a bit more active in 2017 than we were in 2016. If fact, we are working on several other transactions and while we are not ready to announce any deal at this time, we have included an acquisition in our 2017 guidance. Again, we will be prudent in managing our portfolio and disciplined in allocating capital. You can expect us to only move forward on deals that are accretive to the value of the company. Our focus is on value enhancing growth, not growth for growth sake. We're also continuing to take an opportunistic approach to dispositions. We're very pleased with the quality and diversification of our portfolio, which we think is the best in the industry. As such, we're comfortable holding our assets unless we can achieve attractive pricing and we will be less likely to engage in a systematic asset sale program. Having said that, we are open to selling any asset, whether it be iconic or one of our prime suburban properties, if we believe it materially increases shareholder value. On the CapEx front, the company invested approximately $39 million in the fourth quarter on redevelopment, return on investment and acquisition capital expenditures. Notably, we completed the final phase of the Denver Marriott Tech Center redevelopment and the first phase of a comprehensive renovation project at The Phoenician. As I mentioned at our November Investor Day, the second phase, which includes the public and retail areas, will be renovated in the second half of 2017, during the property's low occupancy off season. Now let me briefly touch on our outlook for this year. In many ways, we entered 2017 with (16:09) the same uncertainty that we felt at this time last year. Lodging fundamentals continue to decline in 2017, as supply continue to increase, particularly in the major markets, where we have exposure and group booking pace and RevPAR continue to decelerate. However, the difference this year is that a wave of economic optimism has taken hold in both, the overall stock market and the lodging industry, with promises on material economic policy initiatives from the new administration. Unfortunately, the turnaround in the stock market and economic sentiment has not yet translated into consistently improved results for our business. Part of this has been the result of continued weakness in corporate business travel, resulting in a negative mix shift with operators, replacing high rated corporate business with lower rated corporate business, such as contract, discount or government. Given historically high occupancy, in order for RevPAR to reaccelerate, corporate business will have to return and reverse this trend. We are very pleased with our November and December results, which led to performance that was stronger than forecasted. However, we believe it is too early to determine if that was simply pent-up demand or the start of a more positive long-term trend. Our hope is for the latter, if the new administration can follow through on its proposals for lower taxes, reduced regulation and infrastructure spending. In addition, January was a very strong month driven primarily by the inauguration in D.C., but we are still in a wait and see mindset. One potential negative offset of the new administration's pursuit of growth policies is an appreciation of the dollar, which could potentially impact international demand to gateway U.S. destinations. We also could face potential demand shortfalls from the negative sentiment surrounding the administration's proposed travel ban. Another difference between now and 2016 is in our group booking pace. At this time last year, group revenues on the books were stronger than our current levels of up 2%. This is tempering our 2017 outlook. But I would point out that January bookings for 2017 were extremely strong, which we expect to push 2017 group revenue pace to nearly 3%. We have approximately 75% of 2017 group business on our books which is near record levels. And although it is still early, 2018 group revenue pace is looking very strong. We also should benefit from the tailwinds from less disruption from capital expenditure projects as spending is expected to be lower by 25% this year. Further, we have noted stronger forecast from economists on GDP, consumption, business investment and corporate profits, all of which bode well for our business. All in all, we are looking forward to getting to work in 2017 and producing another solid year of results. With that, let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our performance and 2017 guidance in more detail. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you, Jim. We had a very solid quarter and are especially pleased with RevPAR and EBITDA margin, which exceeded our expectations. Six of our 14 identified markets had impressive RevPAR increases ranging from 6.4% to 12%. A common theme for these markets, which included San Diego, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Hawaii, and Chicago was that strong group performance created compression and enabled our managers to increase transient average rate. San Diego continued to outperform the portfolio and was the top-performing market with RevPAR increasing 12% in the fourth quarter. Occupancy increased 6.5 percentage point and average rate increased 2.8% as a result of strength in both transient and group business. Importantly, our RevPAR results more than doubled the STAR upper upscale market growth of 5.4%. Our hotels in San Diego benefited from city-wides, good in-house group business and market share gains at the Coronado Island Marriott post renovation. In 2017, we expect our hotels in San Diego to outperform the portfolio. RevPAR at our Phoenix hotels grew 8.3% in the quarter, driven by a 3.1% increase in average rate and a 3.4 percentage point growth in occupancy. Our hotels' RevPAR increase exceeded the STAR upper upscale results by 420 basis points. Strong group room nights, which increased 12.4% in the quarter enabled our operators to improve transient rate by 4.2%. We expect that our hotels will continue to outperform the portfolio, partially driven by The Camby continuing to ramp up as it becomes comparable in 2017 for reporting purposes. Our hotels in Los Angeles continue to outperform the portfolio with an 8.1% RevPAR increase in the fourth quarter which has nearly tripled the STAR upper upscale market result of 2.9%. The impressive results were driven by a 5.8% growth in average rates and a 1.7 percentage point increase in occupancy. Group room nights were up 26%, creating compression that allowed our managers to drive transient rate. We expect RevPAR growth at our Los Angeles properties to moderate in 2017, as certain hotels in this market will be negatively impacted by renovation, as well as a weaker group booking pace. Our properties in D.C. also exceeded our expectations and outperformed our portfolio this quarter with RevPAR growth of 7.8%. This was driven by an average rate increase of 3.6% and a 290 basis point increase in occupancy. Strong citywide events contributed to a 13.2% increase in group revenues, which provided compression to drive improvement in transient ADR of 4.4%. As we mentioned in the last quarter, city-wides in 2017 continue to look strong for D.C., which should allow the positive dynamics we witnessed in the fourth quarter to carry over into this year. In fact, January was a fantastic month for D.C., with our hotels' RevPAR increasing approximately 75% from demand generated by the inauguration and the women's march. In addition to the city-wides I mentioned, we see additional demand from ongoing legislative activity and expect our hotels in this market to outperform our portfolio in 2017. Moving to Hawaii, our assets achieved a RevPAR increase of 7.3% this quarter, significantly beating the STAR upper upscale market growth of 0.4%. These exceptional RevPAR results were driven by robust group business at both our Maui hotels, resulting in a 15.2% increase in group revenue. This created internal compression and drove significant rate increases in both transient and group average rates of 6.7% and 7.9%, respectively. Over the next several years, the Hawaiian market has the lowest expected supply growth out of the top 20 U.S. markets, which bodes well for future performance. Based on these expectations, as well as strong group revenues on the books for 2017, we expect our Hawaiian hotels to continue to outperform our portfolio. In Chicago, our hotels increased RevPAR by 6.4% in the fourth quarter, with an ADR increase of 3.5% and occupancy gaining 2.1 percentage points. Strong in-house group and citywide room blocks helped the hotels outperform the STAR upper upscale market result by 320 basis points. Based on the lift we expect from the Chicago Marriott Suites renovation and strong city-wides in the first quarter, we expect our hotels in Chicago to outperform the portfolio in 2017. While those markets have been outperformers in the portfolio, we also have some challenged markets, which partially offset RevPAR increases. Our hotels in Houston continued to struggle in the fourth quarter, due to persisting weakness in the energy sector, increased new supply, and the fact that there were only four city-wides in the fourth quarter as compared to 13 in the same quarter last year. Collectively, these factors contributed to a decline of more than 14% in the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR for Houston. While our hotels' RevPAR outperformed the STAR market by more than 9 percentage point, the challenging conditions resulted in a 4.9% decline in our properties' debt. (25:34) Although the city hosted the Super Bowl in February, the same negative fundamentals are anticipated for 2017. So we expect our hotels in Houston to continue to underperform the portfolio. However, keep in mind that our hotels in Houston only account for 2% of our total EBITDA. In fact, a wide geographic diversification means that no single market makes up more than 11% of our EBITDA. Our hotels in Florida had a RevPAR decline of 4.7% in the fourth quarter. This market has been negatively impacted by weaker group and leisure activity. Occupancy declined 2.7 percentage points and average rate declined almost 1%. We expect our hotels in Florida to continue to be challenged in 2017. In New York, RevPAR decreased 2.4% in the fourth quarter with an occupancy increase of 60 basis points and an average rate decline of 3.1%. Supply continues to outpace demand, which when combined with lower European travel and tour business due to the strong U.S. dollar continued to negatively impact our operators' ability to drive rate. Based on our outlook for the market, we expect RevPAR at our hotels in New York to continue to decline in 2017. RevPAR at our hotels in Boston declined 1.3% in the quarter primarily due to a 1.4 percentage point decline in occupancy, offset slightly by a 0.5% increase in average rate. The business transient market in Boston is softening as demand from financial services and pharmaceutical sectors have weakened. With the possibility of decreased regulations on both sectors from the new administration, we are hoping this trend may reverse moving forward. That, combined with solid group booking and stronger in-house group business, leads us to expect Boston to outperform the portfolio in 2017. Our consolidated international hotels had a challenging fourth quarter with RevPAR down 9.5%. The decrease was primarily due to the underperformance of our hotels in Brazil. Following the strong third quarter results driven by increased demand around the Olympics, overall demand in Brazil has been weak due to the economic and political issues, as well as increased supply. In constant currency, we anticipate our international property to underperform the overall portfolio in 2017. Shifting to our European joint venture, the portfolio continued to be negatively impacted by two major macro factors, including the effect of the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels and the political and economic uncertainty around Brexit. This led to a RevPAR decline of 1.1% this quarter in constant euro. Understandably, our hotels in Paris significantly underperformed the portfolio, while those in London, Stockholm, and Berlin outperformed. We expect our hotels to improve in 2017 driven by continued growth in Barcelona and Madrid, and an expected recovery and favorable comparisons in Paris and Brussels. An important highlight for the quarter and for the year was our impressive EBITDA margin growth. With a RevPAR increase of 1.7% in the fourth quarter, we had EBITDA margin growth of 65 basis points. On a full-year basis, our RevPAR increased 2.7%, resulting in margin expansion of 80 basis points. In addition to decreases in insurance and utility costs attributable to a combination of reduced rate and consumption as a result of our energy ROI, our focus on improving productivity at our hotels over the past few years has resulted in our operators establishing tighter labor model standards and improved and expanded forecasting tools. This has allowed our managers to more effectively schedule labor based on demand and to minimize excess staffing, thereby reducing costs. We have completed the time and motion studies at most of our largest assets and reaped the benefits in 2016, as evidenced by our outsized margin growth. The good news is that opportunities to derive benefits from additional studies at our medium and small hotels still exist, albeit at savings rates that will be lower than those achieved at our large hotels. With these productivity savings in mind, we expect RevPAR growth at 2% will result in breakeven margins. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 0.7 million shares at an average price of $15.82 for a total purchase price of $11.8 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in April of 2015, we have bought back 52.1 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $894 million. The share repurchase program ended on December 31, 2016, and the board of directors authorized the new program to repurchase up to $500 million of common stock depending on market conditions. In addition to our share buyback efforts in January, we paid a regular fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share and a special cash dividend of $0.05 per share bringing our total dividend for 2016 to $0.85, which represents a yield of approximately 4.5% on our current stock price. Over the past 12 months, we have distributed approximately $848 million of capital to our stockholders through cash dividend and stock repurchases. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility and believe we have one of the best balance sheets in the lodging REIT and the overall REIT space. Importantly, we view this as a key competitive and strategic advantage, which enhances our ability to pay our dividend throughout the lodging cycle and allows us to invest as opportunities arise either by buying assets, buying back stock and reinvesting in high yielding redevelopment and ROI projects. We continued to maintain a strong investment grade balance sheet and ended the fourth quarter with approximately $372 million of cash. We improved our leverage ratio to 2.4 times as calculated under our credit facility and as of year end, had $788 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Moving to our 2017 guidance, we're cautiously optimistic about 2017 and are prepared for a number of economic scenarios, which leads us to project our 2017 comparable hotel RevPAR range will be flat to up 2%. With the high end of our range at near inflation, we anticipate EBITDA margins to be flat at 2% RevPAR and down 80 basis points if RevPAR growth is flat. This translates to full year adjusted EBITDA range of $1.42 billion to $1.49 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.60 to $1.70. Keep in mind that the quarterly results will once again be impacted by the Easter and Jewish holiday shift. Easter shifts from the first quarter last year to second quarter this year and the Jewish holidays shift from the fourth quarter in 2016 to the third quarter in 2017. We expect approximately 23.5% of our total EBITDA will be generated in the first quarter. To help bridge the gap between 2016 adjusted FFO per share of a $1.69 and the 2017 midpoint of $1.65 per share, I think it is worth noting several items. First, assuming a 1% increase in RevPAR and a decline in EBITDA margins of 40 basis points, 2017 adjusted EBITDA will decline by approximately $10 million. Next, our disposition and acquisition activity will lead to a net decline of approximately $10 million. This includes the loss from operations of the 10 assets we sold in 2016, as well as the JW Desert Springs sale and the acquisitions of the Don CeSar and the unidentified hotel Jim mentioned in his remarks. Also, as we referenced on our third quarter call, the BP oil spill proceeds from last year that will not be fully repeated in 2017 reduces FFO by a net amount of $10 million. Finally, we are anticipating an increase in interest expense from our floating rate debt, as well as increased taxes due to higher leakage which results in a reduction of approximately $25 million. Offsetting these reductions is a $22 million benefit in outsized EBITDA growth from our non-comp hotels that were under major renovation or repositioning. In addition, due to our 2016 share buyback activity, our weighted average share count in 2017 is lower. The combination of these factors decreases our 2016 adjusted FFO per share from 2016 to the midpoint of our 2017 guidance by $0.04 to $1.65. Overall, we are pleased with our results this quarter, particularly with the improving profitability of our assets in what continues to be a competitive market. This includes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : And we'll go first to Anthony Powell from Barclays. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: First, a clarification on the EBITDA impact of the acquisitions you announced today and the disposition. If you isolate the Don CeSar, JW Marriott and the unidentified deal, what is the EBITDA total change from those three transactions? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Hey, Anthony, this is Greg. So I think if you remember from prior conversations last year, obviously, we sold 10 hotels last year for approximately $500 million. And as we talked about, those hotels generated $13 million in 2016 and that will not be replicated in 2017. So that's a minus $13 million. The acquisitions that Jim talked about today, the Don, the unidentified asset and the disposition of Desert Springs, those three things combined results in plus $3 million of EBITDA. So if you take the minus $13 million from the 2016 disposition, combine with the plus $3 million, that gives you the minus $10 million that I talked about in the bridge. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right, that's very helpful. And just going to the overall acquisition and transaction philosophy, Jim, you sold an asset and you're buying two. Are you a net buyer, or seller and how do you approach the leverage at this point in the cycle? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Anthony, I think that's a great question. We are going to be opportunistic and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we will look for transactions that create shareholder value. We are not interested in buying assets just for the sake of growth. We underwrite every transaction in a disciplined manner. We underwrite each deal to a 800 basis point increase, plus over our cost of capital and if the right opportunities present themselves, we will pursue them. That goes on the sales side as well. As I mentioned, we are not implementing a systematic sales program in 2017, but every asset in the portfolio is for sale. If we get an offer that is truly accretive to shareholder value, we're not going to be shy or bashful about pulling the trigger and selling a hotel. So to say today that we're going to be a net buyer or a net seller, I really can't \u2013 I can't give you a definitive answer on that, because I just don't know how the year is going to unfold. I will tell you that we are working on a number of opportunities and if they pencil, we would intend to pursue them, but at this point in time, the only thing I can refer to is the guidance we've given. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. That's it for me. Thank you. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : And our next question goes to Smedes Rose of Citi. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Jim, you mentioned in your opening remarks the potential fall-off in international visitation, can you remind us what does international visitation comprise out of Host's overall demand at this point? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure, Smedes. It's roughly 10%. And... Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Portfolio-wide demand? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Pardon. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I'm sorry. So portfolio-wide demand, 10% is driven by international visitation? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Correct James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: That is correct. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: As you realize, Smedes, I mean, certain market \u2013 it varies by market, right. New York certainly would be a market with more demand than 10% and there would be other markets with a lot less than that. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then can I just slip in one more, your acquisition of the Don CeSar, could you talk about, obviously, we can look at the per key, but what sort of EBITDA multiple or cap rate was that and where do you think its stabilizes when you've managed to exploit some of the opportunities you mentioned? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, we think that Don is a terrific acquisition. It's just the kind of asset that works for Host for a lot of reasons. First of all, it is truly iconic, it's on one of the best beaches in America. We were able to buy that asset at a price that puts it in the top 10 on an EBITDA per key basis today within our portfolio as it is. Bringing in Davidson Hotels and implementing a strategic capital plan, as well as using our proprietary internal benchmarking that we have, given our broad resort exposure, we believe is going to allow us to meaningfully increase the net cash-on-cash return and the EBITDA, as if that we're open and operating today. So roughly the going in cap rate is 6.5% to 7%. We think we can meaningfully increase that return over the next several years. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning. Jim, also in the prepared remarks, you mentioned sort of the willingness to kind of move outside of the top, I think you said, 10 to 20 markets. Could you just elaborate a little bit on that? That's not really been where many of the public, full service retail have focused, and does this mean we'd expect to see generally smaller transaction sizes versus some of the big flagship Phoenician style group properties that Host has often specialized in the past? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure, Shaun. I think it's \u2013 we're currently operating in the top 10 to 12 markets. We are prepared to look beyond those 10 to 12 markets and to opportunistically acquire assets where the opportunities are. I would point out that The Phoenician was not in one of the top 10 to 12 markets when we made a decision to acquire that asset in mid-2015. Similarly, the Don really wasn't in one of our top 10 to 12 markets, but we saw opportunity in both of those deals. Our ideal preference would be to acquire bigger, chunkier assets where we can use our scale and our information to add value. That is the focus that we're going to have going forward. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question goes to Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning. Just on the guidance, could you just provide a little bit more color on some of the cost savings that you've implemented, I guess, that will occur this year in the back half that they impact next year and some of the offsets that you anticipate? Thanks. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure. So I think when I think of business over long periods of time, I think, in the past, I probably would have said that, that breakeven on the margin front would have probably been at 2.5% to 3% RevPAR growth. Obviously, last year was sort of a unique and powerful year with 2.7% RevPAR growth, we are able to achieve 80 basis points in margin growth and some of that is because of the things we talked about, the time, motion studies with some of the bigger hotels, better productivity, some of the benefits we've seen on technology, we've also reduced insurance costs by over 10% and utility costs, because of our energy ROI projects reduced utilities as well. So, all those things came together to produce, really, I think record level margin growth for us with that level of RevPAR. I think, when I think about 2017, some of those things will still benefit us. We renew our insurance once a year in June and so that double-digit decline in insurance will certainly benefit us for the first six months of 2017. We continue to implement additional energy ROI projects. So even though it's sort of hard today to predict utility cost, I do think we will continue to have benefit from the energy ROI projects that will help us. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we're still implementing, or we will implement this year some of our best practices from the time, motion studies and we'll start looking at some of our medium size and smaller hotels. So again, there'll be benefits on that front, but just maybe not as much as what we achieved last year. And so again, I guess, when I think about it, when I think about all those statements in general, I think to have flat RevPAR with 2% RevPAR growth is actually a pretty good outcome. The other thing I'd just mention, it's a technicality, but I think it matters, is that this year, we're comparing to last year, which was a leap year. And so, when we say 2% RevPAR growth, it's really (45:24) 1.7% revenue growth. And so, to end up with flat margins that means that the high-end of our guidance, we're only expecting 1.7% total expense growth. I think if you look at the midpoint of our guidance with RevPAR growth of 1%, we're only predicting total expense growth to be 1.25%. So again, I think it's going to be a great year with keeping costs growth low, but maybe not quite as great as last year. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. And then if I could sneak one other follow-up in, maybe I missed this. But maybe if you could provide bit more color on the ROI initiatives that you anticipate at the Don? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. We have a number of identified ROIs that we haven't underwritten, Stephen. And we don't have hard numbers around them right now. I can generally give you a sense of what we're looking at. As an example, we think that there's an ROI if we were to reposition the food and beverage operations. Likewise in the retail space, we think there's an ROI there. We have a parking lot at the Don that may very well have a higher and better use than as a block surface parking lot. We've been able to do that in other instances on the acquisition front that we've done over the years. So those are some of the broad things that we're looking at right now. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. I think I would add, and Jim mentioned that earlier today, obviously, we have some of these ROI projects that Jim just mentioned. But also, I think, because we're bringing in Davidson and because our analytics team has looked at this hotel, I think, even without those ROI projects, I think we've identified $3 million, $4 million, up to $5 million of cost savings. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's great. Thanks so much. Best of luck. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Yeah. Just to get a little more color around \u2013 it sounds like you are shifting more to being acquirer of assets rather than a seller. Are you leading towards more of single assets you mentioned, some example of single asset acquisitions outside the top 10 to 12 markets or more portfolio, or actually even potentially a smaller cap REIT overall, I guess, just to think about how you think about those different options? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I think we think about all the options in the same way, Robin. If the transactions are accretive to shareholder value, if they're going to drive growth, profit and value for our shareholders, we will opportunistically pursue them. So it's difficult to really go beyond that at this point in time. I think we're very open-minded, and we are going to evaluate the opportunities as we see them and as they are presented to us. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : So yesterday, there was a little bit of activity from others in the market, and if we think about a REIT that might interest you, maybe before your comments today about looking outside of the top 10 to 12 markets that you're already in, we might have thought there are certain REITs that you wouldn't be interested in. But could it be of interest to you now a REIT that is in maybe some more of those secondary markets than what you've typically looked at? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I think it's premature for me to speculate on anything along those lines at this point in time. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, all righty. Thank you very much. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Hightower from Evercore. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. And... Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Morning. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Morning, Rich. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC : ...sort of along similar line of questioning here. Just with respect to maybe the change in investment strategy and focus, so let's assume that hurdle rates and the spread versus your cost of capital haven't changed over time, can you give us a sense, maybe an example, a post-mortem of sorts of yields that you had looked at in the past, but maybe weren't as attractive under the old regime or the old paradigm that you think maybe would be a good fit under the new paradigm, for instance? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah, Rich, that's a good question. And I just want to reiterate that we have a fantastic company here. We have a truly iconic portfolio of hotels, well diversified across the United States. We have scale and flexibility, which gives us the ability to buy larger complex deals. We have unparalleled information and insight based on the portfolio that we have in the proprietary systems we put in place. And we have a strong balance sheet, which we intend to exploit going forward within reason. We're not talking about going beyond our investment grade category. I'm looking to the future and that's where I'm focused right now. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's right. And obviously, as we mentioned today, and as Jim has already mentioned, right, that Don is a great example of an asset that's outside of the top 10, 12 markets, the Phoenician was too. In fact, both of those hotels are resorts and as you know, Rich, the nice thing about resorts when you look at supply growth over the next three years, supply growth in the resort segment is half a percent or less. So obviously, sort of very compelling to us. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Yeah. Just two questions on RevPAR. First, just a clarification, you said that January RevPAR growth was very strong. Can you actually quantify it? And then second, just on the fourth quarter transient result, you said there have been some transient weakness, was that just a result of group replacing it, or \u2013 so higher-quality business replacing it or was that some corporate demand weakness as well? Thanks. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Hey, Thomas. This is Greg. So obviously, we had a fantastic January for a number of reasons, but primarily because one of our largest markets for us is D.C., and D.C. had really a spectacular January. And so for us, our January RevPAR was north of 7%. So a great way to start off the year. I mean, that certainly beat our internal expectations and it certainly beat our managers' expectations for our portfolio. So that is a great way to start out the year. I think, when we were talking about some of that weakness in transient, I think what we were talking about, you've seen it \u2013 we witnessed this all of last year is, all of the companies including Host, we're really in a sort of record occupancy levels, we know leisure business has been very strong on the transient side, group business has been very strong, but the one customer that has been a little bit weaker is the corporate, the corporate transient customer. And so, we saw some of that weakness in October, certainly, in fact, in October of last year, we actually missed our forecast because of that. I think the good news from our perspective is after the election, both November and December were very strong for us, primarily, because the group business and some of that group business, as you mentioned, probably did display some of the transient customer, but both of those months were strong. And as Jim mentioned in his comments and as I just mentioned, January was much better than our original forecast as well. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: The other thing that's been interesting for us is just the bookings and we've talked about that a little bit. But again, when we looked at the bookings in November for 2017, they were very strong. Unfortunately, in December, when we looked at group bookings for 2017, they were weaker. So that was sort of the inconsistency that we were talking about in the comment. But again, if you fast forward to January, the bookings, the group bookings in January for 2017 were extremely strong. And that's one of the reasons why our group revenues started the year up just over 2%. As we sit here today, our group revenues on our books are up closer to 3%. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very helpful. Thank you. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah, good morning, everyone. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Good morning. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Sticking with that corporate travel, what level of demand do you need to see from that customer in order to get that up-mix at the hotel? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: What's interesting about it, as I mentioned, right, our group business has been good, the leisure segment of transient has been strong. Obviously, in 2016, the weak segment is this corporate business traveler that we're talking about. But what's happened is, if you look at the average rate for that traveler, our highest rated customer and compare that to special corporate discount, there is a big rate delta there, right, between our highest rated customer and special corporate, it's about a $60 delta between our highest rated customer and our discounted segment, it's about \u2013 it's approximately a $100 discount. And so, what happened in 2016 is, even though it was very easy for Host and other lodging companies to replace that customer with other forms of business, whether it was government business, contract business, or group business, there was sort of a negative mix shift that was occurring while we were replacing our highest rated customer with the lower rated customer, and so that put pressure on rates. I think what \u2013 not to get too optimistic about 2017, but what's interesting is, if we can get that customer back in 2017 and if we can have this, a positive mix shift, I think that could be a pretty, powerful thing for 2017. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So maybe if that customer grows faster than the supply growth around 3%, should be able to get that mix? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. No. I think, look at, we already have strong occupancy. So I think if we can get customer back, I think even with the supply growth in 2017, that would look really good. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: And one other thing. Look, we're speculating on that today. It's hard to know if that customer is coming back. I do think there are a couple of metrics that we always look at that that again if they come true for 2017 will be useful for us, right. One thing we always look at is business investment and if you look at the business investment stat for 2017 compared to 2016, they are up about 350 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Same thing for corporate profits, right, corporate profits declined in 2016 and they are expected to be up over 5% in 2017. So again, on a relative basis, that could be meaningful for 2017. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I think the way I would describe it is cautious optimism at this point. The forecasts are looking great, but we haven't seen it borne (57:04) on the numbers just yet. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And that's something you wait to bake in the guidance at a later point if it does occur. Did you kind of bake in in the status quo right now? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. Correct. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Correct. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Good morning, Chris. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Greg, I guess a question for you. I want to dig in a little bit on the non-comparable hotels, is that, I think you did a $150 million of EBTIDA in 2016 which is ahead of your initial guidance. I think you're saying, $148 million to $154 million this year. But is there \u2013 is that \u2013 I guess, how much surprise does there tend to be in the year on those non-comparable hotel results? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: So the non-comp \u2013 you are referring to, when I mentioned that our non-comp hotels, we're expecting the EBITDA to increase by $22 million in 2017, is that what you are referring to? Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right, right. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. So, I think that \u2013 I think those just like any forecast, sometimes, you can beat it, sometimes, you miss it by a touch, but I think those are good forecasts. I think what's interesting about it, if you look at some of the hotels in the non-comps that, for instance, Denver Tech, and the Hyatt in San Francisco, is both of those hotels are in, what I would consider, sort of weaker markets for us this year. But because there was so much disruption last year, I think both of those hotels, Denver Tech looks fantastic, and sort of the San Francisco Hyatt, I think both of those hotels should have very strong EBITDA growth in 2017. And then, the other hotel that we're benefiting from in the non-comp set is our San Diego Marriott. The meeting space there looks outstanding, groups love the meeting space. They are booking that hotel in a very aggressive manner right now. And so, when I think about those \u2013 the hotels in the non-comp set, I think I feel very confident with that $22 million. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, that's great. And just follow up on the prior, I guess, question about group and tie \u2013 tie and group \u2013 try to tie the group and transient conversation up. Do you think \u2013 do you have enough capacity kind of left in 2017 in terms of \u2013 I know there was talk last year of grouping up a little bit. I mean, do you think you have enough space left during peak periods of 2017 or is some of that already consumed by group? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I mean, look, some of it is consumed, right. I mean, as Jim mentioned, if we look at our group business today for 2017, I mean, we have over 75% of that booked today, but I still think it can be important going forward that the bookings in the year, for the year are strong. I mean, if you look back to our comments about January, right, in one month, we improved our group revenue pace for the full year from up 2%, up 3%. So those group bookings in the quarter sort of in the year, for the year are still important. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: The other thing I would add, Chris, is, while group is strong, we're hopeful that as the special corporate customer comes back, that we can see positive rate shift as opposed to negative, like we saw last year. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Sure. Understood, very good. Thanks, guys. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning, guys. Just one quick housekeeping question. The $22 million in uplift from the non-comp hotels, is that apples and oranges with what was in the non-comp set in 2016 versus what will be in the non-comp set in 2017, because the $150 million going to $148 million to $154 million doesn't add up? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah, our non-comp set that \u2013 two of our hotels that we performed work on in 2015, The Logan and The Camby, are now in our comp set, right. And so, when I think about the non-comp growth of $22 million, it excludes Logan and Camby. However, when I think about those two hotels as we mentioned last year, they're still ramping up, right. So those two hotels combined are going to produce RevPAR growth of close to $8 million and in EBITDA. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Your customer, especially at resorts, have you seen any change in demand or booking patterns from this customer, given the high levels of consumer confidence, then also maybe due to the brands' initiatives to book direct and book more prepaid rates earlier? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I think you broke out. We didn't hear the beginning of that question, sorry. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: On the leisure customer, have you seen any change in demand or booking patterns given the high levels of consumer confidence today? And then any impact from the brands' booking initiatives trying to get customers to book sooner and maybe some prepaid rates earlier? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: We haven't \u2013 as Jim mentioned, we really \u2013 we have some reasons to be cautiously optimistic for 2017. But we really \u2013 leisure was obviously a strong segment in 2016, so far it's been strong in 2017, but we haven't seen a material increase in that at this point. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And then just lastly circling back to scale and your comments about leveraging the platform, but you said G&A to come down as a percentage of assets, as you potentially acquire more or is there an opportunity to scale that number down ahead of any potential growth opportunities? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Michael, I think that we're just a little early in the year to address G&A. I will tell you that we're focused on how we can take what is a terrific organization and make it better and make it more nimble and more efficient. We've already undertaken a few steps early in the year by \u2013 the most prominent one to allow us to become more nimble and more efficient is to form the enterprise analytics group where we moved business intelligence, feasibility, CapEx and our corporate financial model under one individual, who is now reporting to Greg. And as we think about the organization going forward, as I have an opportunity to talk to our various stakeholders, we will just have to wait and see how the year turns out. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I agree with that and I also agree with the concept that as we buy hotels, the G&A as a percentage of our hotels and revenues will go lower. I mean, obviously, if you think about the acquisition of the Don, or this unidentified asset that Jim just mentioned, I mean, obviously, we're not going to have to hire anybody else based on those two acquisitions. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: That's correct, absolutely. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Makes sense. Thanks for the comments. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks. Operation: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Jim Risoleo, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you very much. Thank you for joining us on the call today. We look forward to talking with you in the spring to discuss our first quarter results and provide you with more insight into how 2017 is playing out. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Baird & Co., Inc. Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts, Incorporated First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Gee Lingberg : Thanks, Christina. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts\u2019 first quarter 2017 earnings call. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today\u2019s call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA, and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today\u2019s earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer will provide an overview of our first quarter results, discuss our recent transaction, and conclude with our outlook for 2017. Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our first quarter performance by markets, discuss our margins, and the balance sheet. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim. James Risoleo : Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Host\u2019s first quarter results. As reported this morning, we had a solid first quarter that performed above our expectations from both a top and bottom line perspective. Operating results benefited from the inauguration in Women\u2019s March in Washington D.C. as well as the Easter holiday shift, which positively impacted March performance. We also took a number of steps to bolster our company in the first quarter, underscoring our disciplined approach to capital allocation and portfolio management. We acquired two high-quality hotels, the Don CeSar and W Hollywood, which further improved our iconic portfolio of assets. Both properties immediately fall into the top of our portfolio and RevPAR and EBITDA for key metric, and our stronger examples of the types of value enhancing growth opportunities we are pursuing. Subsequent to quarter-end, we disposed of the Sheraton Memphis for $67 million, and assets that we believe will underperform the rest of the portfolio, as a RevPAR of less than $100 and will require greater CapEx going forward. We also entered into a contract to sell the Hilton Melbourne South Wharf effectively ending our investment activity in Australia and New Zealand. This summer has significant money at risk and we plan to close sometime during the second quarter. We have no plans to reenter the region. As Greg will go into in greater detail, we continue to demonstrate the strength of our investment grade balance sheet. We completed a 3.875% $400 million seven-year senior notes offering, which fills a gap in our maturity schedule and provides us flexibility to deal with multiple opportunities in economic environment. Organizationally, we formed the Enterprise Analytics group, which contributed to the successful execution of P value-add activities during the quarter and helped drive strong margin improvement and profitability growth. Speaking of operations, let me provide some insight into our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $367 million for the quarter, an increase of 6.4% and exceeded both our expectations and consensus estimate. Comparable hotel EBITDA growth was slightly higher, increasing 6.5%. First quarter adjusted FFO per share was strong, increasing 7.3% over last year to $0.44, which was also above consensus estimates. An increased level of group activity, as well as our continued focus on productivity improvement resulted in comparable EBITDA margin growth of 85 basis points in the first quarter. While we expected to see some benefit from the Easter holiday shift, group average rate was strong and transient demand was better than anticipated. As a result, on a constant currency basis, comparable hotel RevPAR improved 3.4% in the quarter, as a result of a $2.4% increase in average rate, occupancy improving 80 basis points to 75.8%. For the quarter, comparable hotel revenues increased 3.1%. As mentioned, our group business benefited from both the inauguration and the Easter holiday shift, with group revenue of 9.1% in the quarter, based on average rooms sold per night and leap year adjusted. This was a result of strong increases in both demand and rate up 4.7% and 4.2%, respectively. Interestingly, January group strength was based more on grade, which March\u2019s group performance was more a result of strong demand improvement. In January, group rate increased 8.6% with demand up 1.3%, driven mainly by the inauguration in our Washington D.C. hotels. In March, we saw group revenue increased over 14%. This time a result of demand increasing nearly 10%, an average rate over 4%. Despite the strong group results, and as we expected, group booking activity weakened as we move throughout the quarter with new group room nights being booked in the quarter for 2017, down 3% versus last year\u2019s bookings. As a result, group revenue on the books for 2017 declined by 30 basis points from the beginning of the year, and it\u2019s now 1.7% versus last year. This excludes our three hotels in Brazil. Not surprisingly, the significant increase in group business in January and March had a limiting impact on transient demand in those months. Overall, we saw a transient revenue decline of 1.7% for the quarter and a \u2013 as a 1.4% increase in average rate was offset by a decrease in transient room nights of 3.1%. Importantly, the Easter holiday is typically a strong transient leisure period. So the shift has a holiday into April had a more pronounced negative impact on transient performance in the quarter. Despite the cautious optimism we voiced on our last call, we have yet to see the special corporate transient customer return. Having said that, the rate of decline in this segment appears to be slowing. In 2016, special corporate rooms declined 3.6%. And for this quarter, volume for this segment declined only 1%. While we remain hopeful, this customer can return in growth, particularly given the optimistic consensus forecast on corporate profit and business investment, we have not yet win its material signs of this at our properties. Moving to food and beverage, the strong group performance this quarter drove banquet, catering in AV revenue, which increased 7.4%. This contributed to comparable hotel F&B revenue increasing 4.8% in the quarter. Combined with excellent cost controls, this generated a 330 basis point increase in comparable hotel food and beverage profit margin. On the investment front, as I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we have completed two acquisitions year-to-date, the Don CeSar hotel and the W Hollywood for approximately $430 million. Since we last spoke, we added the 305 rooms W Hollywood to our portfolio. We are very enthusiastic about the asset for a number of reasons. In addition to the hotel, which we purchased for $625,000 per room at a 6.25% cap rate. We also purchased 10,800 square feet of high-quality retail space and seven prominent supergraphic billboard signs for a total value of $219 million. The hotel immediately ranks in the top five in both RevPAR and EBITDA per key in our portfolio, and is essentially located in a dynamic and rapidly growing stock market of Hollywood. The surrounding area features a strong base of business in transient demand generators and serves as a hub for a thriving creative community and entertainment-related companies, such as Viacom Netflix and Paramount. We think the deal compares quite favorably on a price per key basis relative to other transactions in the market. We also were pleased to increase our exposure to the LA market, which represented only 5% of our total hotel EBITDA prior to the purchase. Having been built in 2010, the asset is nearly brand new with a limited amount of owner funded CapEx required. This was an attractive feature as was the opportunity for potential margin improvement under Marriott management. Last but not least the contract flexibility of the W. Hollywood provide significant value that we did not take into account in our underwriting. The hotel is fully unencumbered by brand and management upon sale beginning in 2021, which allows us to create value in a married of ways, including but not limited to, enhanced sale price, potential franchise conversion, fee negotiations, and/or contract trades on other assets within our current portfolio. While we are actively looking for assets that will enhance the value of the portfolio, the difficulty in predicting availability and timing prevents us from including any additional acquisition assumptions in our forecast. During the quarter, we also acquired the ground lease for the Miami Marriott Biscayne Bay Hotel for $38 million. We are excited about this deal, as it increases our flexibility on the asset either via sale our brand, but also opens up potential for numerous value-add incentives. For forecasting purposes, the Sheraton Memphis and Melbourne asset sales are the only additional dispositions included in our guidance. We continue to look to enhance the portfolio through value-add investment. During the quarter, we invested approximately $16 million on redevelopment, return on investment, and acquisition capital expenditures. As expected, we also began to see the benefits from prior year investments in this category. For the quarter, our non-comp hotels had a RevPAR increase of nearly 16%. We spent approximately $64 million on maintenance CapEx, including room renovations at the Dallas Airport Marriott and San Francisco Marriott Fisherman\u2019s Wharf Hotels. For the full-year, we expect to spend between $270 million and $300 on renewal and replacement capital expenditures and $90 million to $115 million on redevelopment ROI and acquisition project. However, our 2017 capital spend to be used with a bit of an aberration, as we would expect our normal CapEx spend to be somewhat higher. Now, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2017. While we are very pleased with our results in the first quarter, we are aware that overall performance was aided by events that skewed results higher. In fact, we believe that the first quarter will be our best of the year. Like quarter one, which benefited from the Easter shift, the fourth quarter will be favorably impacted by the Jewish holiday shift from October into September and we expect it will be our second strongest quarter in 2017. That being said, the events that benefit the first and fourth quarters will negatively impact the second and third quarters, leaving our full-year outlook relatively unchanged. Despite this quarter is better than expected results, there does not appear to be compelling evidence of acceleration in RevPAR above where we initially guided. On our last call, we expressed cautious optimism this might occur, which was partially due to a positive forecast in business investment and corporate profit. It was also a function of the possibility of pro-growth legislation coming out of Washington in the back-half of 2017. Sitting here now a lot of forecast for both business investment and corporate profits remain strong, we do not anticipate any material policy initiatives providing tailwinds to our business until 2018 at the earliest. Further, and as mentioned, group booking pace appears to be weakening for 2017, with February, and March bookings in the year for the year slightly softer than last year. This trend combined with continued economic uncertainty has tempered our outlook for the remainder of the year. As a result, we are maintaining our full-year comparable hotel RevPAR range of flat to 2%. However, given our strong first quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin growth, we are increasing both the low and high-end of our full-year margin guidance to negative 60 basis points and plus 10 basis points. The impact of this is a 15 basis point improvement to the midpoint of our range and translates to a full-year adjusted EBITDA range of $1.425 billion to $1.49 billion, and an adjusted FFO per share range of $1.60 to $1.68. With that, I will turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in greater detail. Gregory Larson : Thank you, Jim. As Jim mentioned, we had a strong first quarter and are especially pleased with RevPAR and EBITDA margin growth, which exceeded our expectations. Our properties in D.C. significantly outperformed our portfolio this quarter. With RevPAR growth of over 20% exceeding the startup or upscale results by 400 basis points. These results were better than we had anticipated. As we mentioned last quarter, January was a fantastic month for our properties in D.C. with RevPAR increasing approximately 75% from demand generated by the inauguration in the Women\u2019s March. RBC Market RevPAR growth was driven by an average rate improvement of over 16% and a 230 basis point increase in occupancy. On the group side, additional citywide room nights contributed to a 35% rise in group revenues on the strength of significant increases in both room nights and average rate. The strong group business provide a compression that drove transient ADR growth of 15.2% and contributed to excellent food and beverage sales, which were up 19.5%, mainly in the more profitable banquet and catering business. Having said that, citywide room nights in D.C. are expected to decline over the remainder of the year and bookings remained very short-term. As a result, we expect RevPAR to moderate in the second quarter. Our hotels in Seattle also outperformed our expectations and the rest of the portfolio with an 18% RevPAR increase in the first quarter, which was over a 1,000 basis points above the STAR upper upscale market result of 7.8%. The impressive results were driven equally by occupancy and average rate increases of 6.8 percentage points and 7.4%, respectively, and aided by a strong citywide calendar displacement from a competitor\u2019s room renovation and the benefits from our W. Seattle hotel that was renovated last year. Group room night growth of 26% created compression allowing our managers to drive transient rate of almost 12%, while increasing food and beverage sales by over 23%. In addition, the Western Seattle is now part of a unique special corporate rate program with a local business, which benefited the hotel in the first quarter and will continue to positively impact performance going forward. We expect RevPAR growth at our Seattle properties to continue to outperform the portfolio in the second quarter. In Denver, RevPAR at our hotels grew 13% in the quarter, driven by a 1% increase in average rate and a 7.6 percentage point growth in occupancy. The RevPAR increase at our properties exceeded the STAR upper upscale results by 910 basis points, which is partially a product of several competitors undergoing room renovations this quarter. Group revenues growth in this market was strong, up 24.8% and contributed to the food and beverage revenue increase of more than 66% predominantly in the more profitable banquet and catering business. That said, we expect a lack of citywides in the second quarter to temper the RevPAR growth demonstrated in the first quarter. San Diego was again one of the top performing markets, as RevPAR growth in the first quarter increased to 11.3%, driven entirely by an increase in average rate. Four additional citywides in the market resulted in a 15.8% increase in group revenues, which created compression and yielded an increase in transient average rate of almost 12%. The additional citywides were not the only contributors to the outperformance, a strong in-house group business and continued market share gains at the Coronado Island Marriott post renovation proved beneficial as well. It is also worth noting that our RevPAR result exceeded the STAR upper upscale market growth by 320 basis points. Although, we do not expect RevPAR growth to continue at the same pace as the last several quarters, we do anticipate that RevPAR growth at our assets in the mark will outperform our portfolio in 2017. Over the next couple of years, the San Diego market has some of the lowest expected supply growth, which bodes well for future performance. Now, I\u2019ll provide some color on some of our more challenged market. RevPAR at our hotels in San Francisco declined 6.3% in the first quarter, largely due to a difficult comp, given the Super Bowl last year. Renovations at the Moscone Convention Center and our rooms renovations at the Marriott Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Going forward, we anticipate hotels in San Francisco will continue to struggle, as the Moscone Convention Center is scheduled to be completely closed in the second and third quarters, negatively impacting all hotels in the Bay Area. However, keep in mind that once the expansion project at the Convention Center is complete in 2018, we expect citywide to return to San Francisco and business that follows to in a meaningful way in 2019. In New York, RevPAR decreased 3.9% in the first quarter, with an occupancy decline of 1.7 percentage points, at an average rate reduction of 1.8%. Not surprisingly, supply continues to impact our ability to drive rate. We have also noted that European travel to the city continues to be weak due to the strong U.S. dollar and residual effects from the impact from Brexit. As we stated in February, based on our information on the market, we expect RevPAR growth at our hotels in New York to continue to be challenged in 2017. Our hotels in Florida had a RevPAR decline of 0.4% in the first quarter, as the market continues to be negatively impacted by weaker group and leisure activity. Occupancy decreased 2.1 percentage points, but on a positive note that was offset by an average rate increase of 2.2% In the short-term, we expect our hotels, the Board that will benefit from the Easter shift in April. This should help our Florida assets outperform the portfolio in the second quarter. Moving to international operation, our consolidated international hotels first quarter RevPAR declined 7.1% in constant currency. This is primarily due to the underperformance of our hotel \u2013 of our properties in Brazil. The continued weakness in Brazil was a function of economic issues and increased supply. However, our performance there was partially offset by the strong performance of our two Canadian assets. RevPAR in our hotels in that part of itself in Canada grew 3.9% with constant currency. Our Calgary Marriott has a strong corporate group and contract business that helped boost performance this quarter. Looking ahead, in the second quarter, we expect the story of these two countries to continue, outperformance in Canada and underperformance in Brazil, which is a continued weakness in Brazil\u2019s economy in the difficult times related to the business leading up to be a Olympic last summer. Shifting to our European joint venture, the portfolio showed signs of recovery this quarter, especially in markets severely impacted by terrorist attack at the end of 2015 and first quarter 2016. On a broader macro level, we are seeing improving GDP forecast across Europe. RevPAR for the 10 hotels in the portfolio improved 8.2% in constant euros, with occupancy growth of 4.7 percentage points with an average rate increase of 0.7%. This performance was driven by strong corporate group demand at several properties, as well as increases in contract revenues through the addition of airline group. The group volume strength contributed the growth in food and beverage revenue of about 17%, most of the which came in the form of profitable banquet and catering business. Going forward, we are encouraged by the positive signs in Europe and expect that RevPAR growth at these hotels for the full-year will outpace our comparable hotel results. We continue to be impressed by the efforts and results of our managers and asset managers that bring more profit to the bottom line. In the first quarter, we increased EBITDA margins by 85 basis points, driven by outstanding productivity improvements throughout the hotels, notably from excellent cost containment in food and beverage department. Food and beverage margins improved 330 basis points. We continue to focus on productivity improvements through our time and motion studies, which we have rolled out at our medium and small hotels. As we have already seen at our large properties, our managers have made structural changes to processes and procedures enabling them to more effectively schedule labor, on-demand, and minimize excess staffing thereby reducing costs and increasing productivity. With the benefit of one quarter behind us with these products \u2013 productivity savings in mind, we expect RevPAR growth of 2% will translate into a 10 basis point increase in margin expansion as opposed to the previous assumption break-even margins we guided to on our last earnings call. In April, we paid a regular first quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents the yield of 4.2% on our current stock price. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility and believe we have one of the best balance sheets in the lodging REIT and overall REIT space. Importantly, key competitor is strategic advantage enhances our ability to sustain the dividend throughout the lodging cycle, while also allowing us to invest when accretive opportunities arise to either buy assets, buy back stock, or reinvest in a high-yielding value-add projects. In March, we issued $400 million of Series G senior notes due April of 2024 at an interest rate of 3.875%. This transaction filled our gap in our debt maturity schedule and demonstrated the continued strength and flexibility of our investment grade balance sheet. Part of the proceeds were used to repay $250 million that have been drawn under the revolver portion of our credit facility, while the rest remains available for general corporate purposes. We ended the first quarter with approximately $411 million of cash and $784 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Today, our leverage ratio is 2.6 times, is calculated under the terms of our credit facility. As Jim noted in his remarks, we have increased the midpoint of our margin guidance for the year and maintained our RevPAR guidance from our prior earnings call. In addition to the change in our margin assumption, our guidance now includes the loss of EBITDA related to the two asset sales we announced today and an increase in EBITDA from better than previously estimated profit to be generated from reposition, non-comparable hotels. The interest expense from the issuance of the new $400 million Series G notes and the repayment of $250 million of the credit facility equates to the loss of approximately $0.1 of FFFO per share and explains while the midpoint of our our revised adjusted FFO per share guidance is a $1.64 compared to the $1.65 midpoint we articulated in February. Finally, I would urge you to keep the impact of the holiday shift in mind. As second and third quarter RevPAR results are anticipated to be significantly weaker than the first quarter with a rebound expected in the fourth quarter. Looking specifically to the second quarter, we expect nearly 29% of our total EBITDA for 2017 will be generated in that quarter. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our strong results today, particularly with the improving profitability of our assets when continues to be a competitive market and lower growth environment. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Smedes Rose [ph]. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thank you. Jim, it sounds like in your prepared remarks that group demand declined maybe more than you had expected over the course of the quarter. And I\u2019m wondering if the \u2013 and your assumption is to get to zero RevPAR for the year, if you are assuming that same pace of decline, or do you expect that to kind of flatten out? And I guess, really kind of the \u2013 my question is, how confident are you that you can, at least, achieve a zero or flat RevPAR growth and not go into negative territory? James Risoleo : So I think, we are very thoughtful in our reevaluation of our prior forecast. I would tell you that we expected as we move through the quarter that group would weaken. As you may recall, we started the year with group up 2%. We saw a strengthening in February to 3%, and then we saw it weakening down to 1.7%. At this point in time, I think, we\u2019re comfortable with providing our guidance of 02% RevPAR growth. I think if you step back and look at the comments with respect to the first quarter, the fourth quarter and the respective holiday shift. Second and third quarter is really going to be weak; but as we looked at group booking pace, we took that into account and that\u2019s why we have affirmed our guidance for the year. Gregory Larson : Yes, and Smedes, if you look at that, the same thing sort of happened to us last year too, right. We started with group revenues on our books at one level and then as we moved throughout the year, the groups that booked sort of in the year, for the year were a little bit weaker than the prior year. And so, as a result, the group revenues that we had, group still outperformed transient in 2016; but the group level at the end of the year was just lower than where we started. So, as Jim mentioned, right, we started the year at 2% on the group side and when we gave guidance of 0% to 2%, we were certainly expecting that the bookings in the year, for the year would be a little bit weaker and would bring that group revenue numbers down. Unidentified Analyst : All right thank you. Thanks for the color. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Anthony Powell : Hi, good morning guys. Just a bit more on the group piece decline. Are you seeing that concentrating at any hotels or any markets? And do you think meeting planners are just a bit more cautious given some of the policy uncertainty we\u2019re seeing? James Risoleo : I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any market in particular, right. I mean when we looked at it, again we had certain markets that were quite strong this year, this quarter. Yes, I\u2019m looking at it as I\u2019m talking to you now; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in any particular market. Anthony Powell : All right and - James Risoleo : Go ahead. Anthony Powell : Well, I was going to say some of the other reads are saying that they are attempting to replace some \u2013 this lost group or corporate transient with things like LNR business, associations, contracts. Is that available to you and are you pursuing that strategy? James Risoleo : Anthony, it is available to us. And in fact that\u2019s just a strategy we took last year. Where we had holes in occupancy because the high-end business traveler didn\u2019t show up, we were able to fill in with either lower rated group or more Government and other lower rated business and that\u2019s the same strategy we\u2019re pursuing this year. Gregory Larson : Yes, in fact Anthony, if you \u2013 just to build on what Jim just said, I mean if you think about it, our occupancy ended here in this first quarter at 75.8%. For our first quarter occupancy, you\u2019d have to go all the way back to the first quarter of 2000 to see a higher occupancy level. So, again it\u2019s pretty easy in this environment to replace the business with other business; but as we talk about before, right, I mean what we would love to see at some point this year is to see the corporate, special corporate customer come back and the business traveler to come back, because at that point we would be able to have a higher rated customer. There would be a positive mix shift and then we could produce a higher rate growth and therefore higher RevPAR growth. James Risoleo : Just to reaffirm what we said on the first quarter call, we discussed this very topic with respect to the fact that special corporate have not shown up. We indicated we were cautiously optimistic that they in fact would show up. And that\u2019s based on the forecast for business investments and the forecast for corporate profit. But the simple fact of the matter is, is that we haven\u2019t seen that happen today and that\u2019s another reason why we\u2019ve elected to keep our guidance in 02%. Gregory Larson : Yes, I think that\u2019s the good news Jim and others is that, even though there certainly are some forecasts as Jim mentioned, corporate profits looks strong, business investments looks strong, our group revenues are sitting here up at 1.7%, which is sort of near the high-end of our RevPAR guidance. I think we ignored a lot of those positives and just really focused on the fact that supply is increasing at touch this year. And like I said, we ignored those positives in giving guidance of 0% to 2%. Anthony Powell : Got it, and there is one more quick one for me. Do you have a year-to-date RevPAR growth number which is including April? Gregory Larson : For April, you know we\u2019re expecting because of the holiday shift. We\u2019re expecting actually April for us that actually have a decline in RevPAR. Anthony Powell : Right. Gregory Larson : But we haven\u2019t finished the month yet, so \u2013 James Risoleo : We don\u2019t have the final data in, so it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re in a position to provide. Anthony Powell : Got it, all right. Thanks a lot for the color. I appreciate it. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Patrick Scholes : Hi good morning. Just when looking at your performance for San Francisco in 1Q negative six, is it fair to assume that as the \u2013 is it fair to assume for 2Q that things could actually be worse than negative six for you? James Risoleo : Patrick, when we think about San Francisco, obviously our hotel are down 63 [ph] was worse than the SAAR data for the industry. So, because of that I actually think our Q2 could be slightly better than our down 63. You might be right though, for the industry could be a little bit weaker in Q2 than in Q1. I do think that that at least based on our group booking pace, you know our best quarter of the year at least in our forecast when we think about San Francisco is actually Q3. Patrick Scholes : Okay and then just one follow up question if I may. Just for overall, not just San Francisco, but overall for 2018 group, how are you feeling about that, I think last quarter you mentioned that the group revenues pace for 2018 is looking very strong. How do you feel now? James Risoleo : You know, we have seen continued strength in 2018 pace. However, we think it\u2019s too early to really provide any guidance. It\u2019s too early in the year and what we\u2019ve \u2013 if history repeats itself which it likely will, there will be some slippage in terms of what\u2019s on the books today. I would tell you the numbers today looks pretty good. Gregory Larson : Very good. James Risoleo : Very good, very good; but it\u2019s not a number that we\u2019re prepared to discuss. Patrick Scholes : Okay, fair enough, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good morning guys. Maybe just to stick with the whole group conversation sort of in the year, for the year pattern, just curious if you could give us a little bit more color, it seems like some operators out there have actually entered the year with the strategy of trying to group up to gain some visibility just given how \u2013 just how challenging the demand environment has been in the last couple of years. But in most cases it seems like you knew that in the year, for the year would be tough to come by and now it is. I\u2019m just curious if you can kind of help us think about like why can\u2019t you source more group business and maybe even just try and push with this given that you kind of know or that you expected the environment to be a little bit softer. James Risoleo : Yes, that\u2019s a great question Shaun. We had a meeting with our major operator Merlin International over the last couple of weeks to discuss group booking pace. I will tell you that we have today 85% of the group business is on the books for 2017. And I think that there is a general strategy that if we can find group business in an attractive price point that we will take it today. Now that said, if you think back to the trend that we\u2019ve seen over the first quarter where we started it, two went to three, and we\u2019re down at 1.7, these are said and done sometime, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re keenly focused on. Gregory Larson : Yes, Jim, I think that\u2019s 85% of the group business that we ultimately think that we\u2019re \u2013 sorry that was like \u2013 it\u2019s a good number. You know, I also think, Shaun, you mentioned that the group bookings are I think you said very weak. I wouldn\u2019t go that far. Again, I think we\u2019re still booking group business at a descent clip. It just happens to be year-to-date we\u2019re booking and that\u2019s just slightly lower clip than we did last year; but we\u2019re still booking. There is still group business to be booked and frankly the groups that we\u2019re booking now are pretty high quality groups. I mean if you look at our first quarter, our food and beverage growth is quite strong. In my comments I talked about our banquet business has been quite strong. We\u2019re starting to charge groups for room rentals and that profit just drops down to the bottom line. So, I think we\u2019re still booking; we\u2019re just booking a touch, at a rate that\u2019s a touch less than last year. Shaun Kelley : Okay, yes, I\u2019m sorry if I mischaracterized that. Thank you very much. James Risoleo : Yes. Gregory Larson : Yes. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chris Woronka : Hey, good morning guys. Jim I was hoping maybe you can elaborate a little bit more on the food and beverage margin improvements, because it\u2019s a pretty big deal to the bottom line and I think you said you\u2019ve done it in your small and medium sized hotels. And so, how should we think about the opportunities across the rest of the portfolio going forward? James Risoleo : Well, I think that there are a couple of things that drove margin improvements in general this year, Chris. And then I\u2019ll come back to your question regarding food and beverage. We have been time motion studies throughout the portfolio and those studies are not done yet, but we have really gone through the bigger hotels and we\u2019ve rolled out the same process now to our smaller hotels. So what has driven our margin performance by and large is productivity gains and productivity gains both in hotel operations i.e. rooms productivity and undistributed, as well as food and beverage. Food and beverage productivity or food and beverage margin gain this year is up 330 basis points, that\u2019s a combination of just the sheer increase in volume, but also in very strong productivity gains and really a decrease in food and beverage cost. Gregory Larson : Yes, you know Jim mentioned the time motion studies, as you know Chris, we completed those time motions or we were completing them last year with our big hotels and what\u2019s happened here in the first quarter is, some of the time motion studies that we completed throughout 2016, you know in first quarter obviously we\u2019re getting all the benefits from those time motion studies and in first quarter of last year we probably hadn\u2019t fully implemented them. And then combine that with the fact, as Jim said, that this year we\u2019re starting to implement some of those studies on our medium and small hotels. So, in the second half of the year we\u2019ll get the benefit from that as well. Chris Woronka : Okay. Gregory Larson : And Chris, the final thing and you know this, the one thing that always helps out margins and Jim sort of mentioned it, is strong revenue growth, right. So, when you have strong F&B growth that\u2019s helpful, and then especially when it comes from the higher-margin business, the banquet business, that\u2019s also very helpful. Chris Woronka : Okay, very good. Thanks guys. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Thomas Allen : It\u2019s been almost six months now since the Marriot-Starwood deal closed. Can you just give us your updated thinking on potential there? And I think Marriot\u2019s Investor Day in March, they talked about rolling out some better procurement and other cost saving plans in the next few weeks, so is that something you guys start benefiting from? James Risoleo : I think what we\u2019re trying \u2013 we will definitely see benefit from the Marriott-Starwood acquisition. We\u2019re looking forward in a number of different places, Tom. First and foremost, I think that it is immediate as the travel agent costs with respect to the OTA. Marriott had a much stronger deal than Starwood did, with Expedia and Booking.com and we expect that that is going to benefit us over the course of 2017 and 2018. Another area that we feel we will see benefit over time, does relate to procurement cost. The sheer size of the combined company will enable Marriott to drive a better deal for a good to be provided to the hotel. Lastly, we continue to see Marriot make improvements in operations, they are running the properties tighter than Starwood did, so we\u2019re optimistic that that should continue to flow through to us and better margin performance as we move forward. On the other side of it, you didn\u2019t ask the question for sake [ph], but I think that the fact that Marriott has a fantastic sales engine, group sales engine is going to benefit us going forward, as well as the combination of the two rewards programs which when combined will have over 100 million members and they\u2019re adding about 1 million members a month. So all-in-all, we\u2019re very happy about the Marriott-Starwood acquisition. Going back to the rewards program alone, I mean, Marriott \u2013 this will impact the rewards program. Marriott is in the process of negotiating a new credit card deal, which we think will benefit us as well to lower credit card commissions. So those are some of the things that we\u2019re looking at as we move throughout 2017 and into 2018. Gregory Larson : Certainly tailwinds for us both in 2017 and 2018. James Risoleo : Yes, absolutely. Thomas Allen : Is it okay to take from what you said that the margin outperformance during the first quarter wasn\u2019t really \u2013 it was more your own channel for measures and any kind of Marriott-Starwood synergy measures and so the opportunities\u2026 James Risoleo : I think that\u2019s right Tom. I mean it really was the effect of our \u2013 and we work very closely with our operators and we worked hard together to drive productivity improvements and to keep a tight lid on food and beverage costs. You know our time motion studies that we implemented at the hotels have been meaningful and we\u2019ve seen a meaningful uptick in productivity to allow us to outperform on the margin perspective to the tune of 85 basis points in EBITDA margin increase in first quarter. Thomas Allen : Again, just a follow-up, your transaction in the quarter had mixed messages around whether you are trying to diversify away from Marriot, how are you thinking about the need to diversify? James Risoleo : Which transaction are you speaking of? Thomas Allen : It\u2019s more talking cheap bread, you bought the W Hollywood some more Marriott exposure there and then you bought the Don CeSar, so sold that and then you sold Hilton, so I was just \u2013 it didn\u2019t seem like there was any, there was nothing suggesting a strategy to move away from Marriott exposure? James Risoleo : No, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a strategy to move away from Marriott. As I said, we are very comfortable and think that they are \u2013 they are the best is the space. I mean they were great before Starwood and now with their increased scale for a number of the reasons that I mentioned just a moment ago, we\u2019re very comfortable with Marriott and we love the relationship we have with them. I think when we think about acquisitions and dispositions, every deal we do, whether it\u2019s a sale or an acquisition is with an eye toward enhancing shareholder value. And when we think about diversity, we think more about geographic diversity. As we look at balancing the portfolio among various markets and not necessarily looking at brand at the outset. Thomas Allen : Helpful, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Rich Hightower : Hey, good morning guys. James Risoleo : Hey, Rich. Rich Hightower : Two questions here, the first one is on margins, really quickly. I don\u2019t know if I caught this in the prepared remarks, but can you give us a sense of what the better-than-expected mix shift in the first quarter did to our margins in the first quarter relative to initial expectations? And then how margins alongside sort of it\u2019s in RevPAR across the quarters that you mentioned, how margins will progress as well for the rest of the year? Gregory Larson : Hey, Rich, this is Greg. I don\u2019t know if it is a much of a mix shift, it\u2019s just when our RevPAR growth is stronger-than-expected, which obviously occurred in the first quarter with 3.4% RevPAR and if you look at our domestic hotels 3.8% RevPAR and that\u2019s always helpful on margins, right, and so I think that that certainly helps our margins. I think when you think about the quarter is going forward, you can think about that comment, in quarters where we\u2019re predicting very low and maybe no RevPAR growth, like Q2 and Q3 in aggregate, than you should assume margin will actually decline in those quarters. On the other hand, where we mentioned in our comment, we think RevPAR will rebound in fourth quarter and if that occurs and then obviously that will be better margin performance in that quarter than in Q2 and Q3. I think the good news overall, obviously we had a great quarter on the margin front in the first quarter and that\u2019s why were able to comfortable increase the midpoint of our margin guidance by 15 basis points. Rich Hightower : Yes, that is helpful Greg. And then the second question here, kind of hitting back on Tom\u2019s question about acquisitions and capital allocation. When you look at deals like the W Hollywood and Don, I think we all get the point that they, both of the those deals enhance average RevPAR for the portfolio, average EBITDA for each of the portfolio, but there is a risk of course that you can over pay for those sorts of things. And I just want to know kind of how you guys balance out each deal on its own in the sense that NAV accretion? And then also in a portfolio context, raising the average RevPAR for the assets in the portfolio, how you think the markets value for those right now? James Risoleo : Well, I\u2019ll answer the first question last. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s being valued fairly. With respect to the underlying quality of the assets that we have in the portfolio, when you look at the Don and the W, they are truly iconic assets that are exceptionally difficult, if not impossible to duplicate. And when we think about how we can enhance shareholder value, we take a very disciplined approach to any investment opportunity or frankly any sale that might \u2013 sale opportunity that might present itself. By looking carefully at where we are in the cycle, underwriting the asset appropriately, and taking it to account all capital needs of the property as we look out over a ten-year period of time. And solving for a hurdle rate of return to our cost of capital that is at 100 basis points to 150 basis points at a minimum and higher depending on the risk profile in the transaction. So there\u2019s a lot of fact that goes into every deal that we underwrite and every acquisition that we make as we go forward. And I think that when you look at the metrics on both of these deals, they are very unique metrics. The Holly \u2013 the W out of the box is going to be top five in the portfolio. And if you think about our hotels, another \u2013 and newer hotel, I mean the W is a new property, the Don had a significant investment, completed before we bought the hotel. But if you think about something like the W with a RevPAR that the hotel generates, that would lead to the conclusion that your owner\u2019s funding CapEx is going to be relatively de minimis compared to other properties, compared to lower RevPAR hotels, compared to properties that are older, that might need more money, so there\u2019s a lot that goes into our decision on every acquisition opportunity. Gregory Larson : Yes, Rich, I agree, obviously as Jim said, we are always looking for that 100 basis points to 150 basis points return unlevered IRR above our cost of capital. But the other thing we do is we always compare that return to buying back stock and as you know, right, last year we bought back stock with a 15 handle on it. So, even though there were opportunities in the market, last year we felt that buying back our stock with a 15 handle was a better investment, so that\u2019s what we did. And so again, if you fast forward to today, we found these two great acquisitions, the returns were good and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re look at, but when we look at things, we look at returns for assets, but we also look at\u2026 James Risoleo : Alternative uses of the capital. Rich Hightower : Yes, that\u2019s all great color guys, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : Good morning everyone. Looking at the group bookings, can you comment on how in-house group bookings are looking and maybe if we would see F&B revenues close the gap versus RevPAR, and should that hang in there be a more in-house? And in particular San Francisco, how are you doing in 2Q and 3Q for the in-house? Gregory Larson : Hey, Wes, this is Greg. So, as we said in our prepared remarks, right, of group revenues on our books today, up 1.7%, right. But what we also mentioned is, in our guidance, our assumption is as we progress through the year, even though we\u2019ll continue to book those at a pretty decent pace, the pace will be slightly lower than the pace that we booked through the last year, and so that 1.7% growth in group revenues well over throughout the rest of this year should end up trending lower. So that is sort of how we \u2013 I\u2019m sorry. Wes Golladay : So, as I was referring to all the in-house group, I was wondering if you had \u2013 does that include the groups you assigned, that gets assigned to you from the Moscone Center through that might be down and you might be having more in-house group and then you might get more F&GB, so total PAR would be a little bit better? James Risoleo : Hey, Wes, I\u2019m sorry, I thought you were talking about in total and San Francisco, what I just told \u2013 talked about was our entire portfolio. Wes Golladay : Yes. James Risoleo : If you think about just San Francisco, yes, we have, like I mentioned earlier, we have some in-house group activity in Q3. And so because of that, I think, our hotel in the third quarter should \u2013 our hotel in San Francisco should perform much better than what the performance that you witnessed here in the first quarter. Wes Golladay : Okay. And then probably to the point they would maybe better on total total par. So I mean, F&B we price at a model that been down too much for the\u2026? James Risoleo : Well, the interesting thing about San Francisco is even though our hotels in San Francisco had a decline of 6.3%. We actually had at the Marriott Marquis and San Francisco, we actually had a very strong group that generated very strong food and beverage growth for that hotel. Wes Golladay : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Great, thanks. And I don\u2019t know if you commented on this at the beginning of a call because I had to miss part at the beginning. But have you sort of given guidance on whether you expect on a full-year basis to be a net buyer, or seller of assets this year? James Risoleo : Robin, it\u2019s a great question, and we didn\u2019t comment on it. I think that we are very cognizant of some of the tailwinds that the lodging sector is going to face, given some supply considerations that we\u2019re looking at for 2017 and 2018. And also did add spreads on potential acquisition as we look at the landscape out there. So I don\u2019t have a definitive answer for you today, because we are, as Greg mentioned before, in addition to having the ability to acquire hotels, we will also opportunistically sell hotels. And if the stock price drops to a level, where we feel the right decision is to buy back shares, we\u2019ll certainly do that. So, as I mentioned, the \u2013 our guidance for the balance of the year includes the two dispositions, the sale of share to Memphis and the sale of their home in Melbourne, and it includes the acquisitions we completed year-to-date. We have not included any further sales, or dispositions in the guidance. Robin Farley : Okay. All right. Thanks. And then maybe also, I don\u2019t know if you made comments on. When you look at your solid branded property, are you seeing an improvement there in index? And do you think it\u2019s coming from Marriott Board members? Is that where you\u2019re seeing occupancy coming from? And sort of the second part of that question would be, are you seeing impact on your Marriott branded hotels in the same market? In other words, is there to what degree is there maybe some occupancy being shared now with this reward program? James Risoleo : We haven\u2019t seen \u2013 that\u2019s a great question. We haven\u2019t seen any deterioration in yield index on the Marriott Hotels. And the given the group sales engine that Marriott has in-house, which is very powerful, we would expect to see more RevPAR index improvement on some of our bigger shares in hotels going forward. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thank you. James Risoleo : Thanks, Robin. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Bellisario with Robert W. Baird. Michael Bellisario : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick question on the moving parts and guidance. Can you quantify how much Memphis and Melbourne are impacting the full-year EBITDA range? And then what sort of benefit the ground lease buyout might have in those figures doing them? Any run rate figures would be great as well? Gregory Larson : Hey, Michael, it\u2019s Greg. Yes, if you look at the two dispositions, I mean, obviously, because we increased our margin guidance for the year, and we mentioned that our non-comp forecast for the year is stronger today than what it was a quarter ago. That would lead you to believe that our EBITDA guidance should be higher. The reason why the top-end remained the same is, because we\u2019re now baking in \u2013taking into account these two dispositions and those two assets combined probably reduced our EBITDA by about $10 million or $11 million. Michael Bellisario : And then any benefit from the ground lease acquisition? Gregory Larson : Look, as you know, ground leases are usually low cap rate acquisitions. I mean, as Jim mentioned in his comment, lots of good reasons to do it, adds a lot of flexibility to that hotel, and gives us a lot of really nice options going forward. But that\u2019s such a small acquisition at a lower cap rate, there\u2019s not much impact to that. Michael Bellisario : Thank you. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session, Mr. Risoleo. At this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. James Risoleo : Thank you for joining us on the call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our first quarter results and outlook with you. We look forward to provide you with more insight into how 2017 is playing out on our second quarter call this summer. And I\u2019m sure, I\u2019ll see a lot of you and NAREIT in New York. Have a great day. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Farley - UBS Securities LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by, we are about to begin. Good day and welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts, Incorporated Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Gee Lingberg - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts second quarter 2017 earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA, and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliation, to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earning's press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our second quarter results, and provide our outlook for 2017. Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our second quarter performance by markets, discuss margins, and the balance sheet. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you, Gee. And thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We are very pleased to report solid second quarter results, which beat our internal expectations on both the top and bottom line. Once again, we materially out-performed industry upper upscale results by over 100 basis points. As a result of our continued strong performance we are raising the midpoint of our guidance for the year across the board. We now anticipate 2017 comparable hotel RevPAR to range between 1% and 1.75%, which is a 38 basis point increase to the midpoint of our prior guidance. We also had increased the midpoint of our prior margin guidance by 25 basis points, and now forecast corresponding margin change of minus 15 basis points to plus 15 basis points. I continue to be impressed by our ability to drive this type of margin improvement, particularly given this level of RevPAR growth. This is a testament to the scale and information benefits of our portfolio, driven primarily by our new enterprise analytics team. As a result of these adjustments, we now anticipate 2017 adjusted EBITDA to range between $1.46 billion and $1.495 billion. This translates to a $20 million increase to the midpoint of our prior guidance. Similarly, our adjusted FFO per share is now projected to range between $1.64 and $1.68, a $0.02 increase from our prior midpoint. The cadence of the year is playing out as we anticipated, and as we discussed on our first quarter call. As expected, the strength we witnessed in the first quarter was somewhat offset in the second quarter, due to the Easter holiday shift. Looking forward, that same holiday shift dynamic remains, with the Jewish holidays moving back from October to September. This will negatively impact the third quarter, but positively impact the fourth quarter, which we believe will be strong, and second only to our first quarter in terms of RevPAR performance. This is consistent with our prior and current commentary, and is the basis for our forecast. Macro-economic forecasts remain relatively unchanged from the last time we spoke, and appears supportive to overall economic and industry growth. The key statistics we follow closely, corporate profits and business investment, remain significantly above 2016 levels, and have historically been a strong leading indicator of future RevPAR growth. In addition, employment remains strong, consumer sentiment is high, industrial production is rebounding, stock markets are at or near all-time highs, and the recent decline in the U.S. dollar appears to be shifting from a recent headwind to a tailwind, particularly as it relates to increases in international arrivals. We have yet to see the clear impact of these positive factors on our business. However, we continue to be cautiously optimistic that the stage is set for economic expansion. Offsetting that is a general uncertainty with respect to government policy, and economic initiatives, which may be putting a slight damper on corporate outlooks, and business travel. Moving to capital allocation, we continue to selectively prune what we believe to be the most geographically diversified portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels in the sector. As mentioned in our press release, the sale of the Hilton Melbourne South Wharf is imminent. The hotel is expected to be sold for $182 million, and ends our investment activity in Australia and New Zealand. In addition, we remain committed to reducing our exposure to non-core assets requiring higher capital expenditures, and in locations where lower growth is expected, assuming we can pursue asset sales at attractive pricing. As noted in our press release, we have accounted for one additional unidentified disposition in our guidance, which we would categorize as non-core, and which we expect to close late in the third quarter. On the acquisition front, we remain disciplined in allocating capital to new investments. While we have evaluated several investment opportunities, the pricing has not met our rigorous underwriting requirements. Our 2017 guidance does not contemplate any additional acquisitions from what we have already disclosed, this year. However, we will continue to source opportunities and sell assets, where we believe we can add value and enhance NAV per share. Our industry leading balance sheet has never been in better shape, with leverage at 2.4 times, as determined under our credit facility. As of quarter-end, we have nearly $650 million of cash, and over $775 million of capacity under our credit facility. Depending on the economic conditions and opportunities that present themselves, this investment capacity provides us the ability to effectively allocate capital, and drive stockholder value in a number of ways. We can seek to increase earnings through disciplined external growth; judicious capital investment in our portfolio; opportune repurchases of stock under our existing $500 million buyback authorization; and returning capital to stockholders through payment of a special dividend. We believe this flexibility to pursue a variety of outcomes sets Host apart from our peers. One of the places where we have allocated capital, and will continue to do so, is within our existing portfolio. This is evident in the results of our non-comp hotels, where RevPAR for the quarter was up nearly 11%, building on the momentum we witnessed at these assets in the first quarter. While this performance is not reflected in our full year RevPAR guidance, these assets are contributing significantly to our EBITDA, and represent another lever that we can pull in our diversified portfolio to successfully allocate capital. Looking at CapEx for the full year, we expect to spend $275 million to $290 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures, and $100 million to $110 million on redevelopment and ROI projects. Let me now discuss our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $444 million, reflecting an increase of 1.8% and exceeding consensus estimates. Second quarter FFO per diluted share was $0.49, also exceeding consensus estimates. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was at $811 million, and FFO per diluted share was $0.94. These results were driven by several factors. While we expected to see some disruption from the Easter holiday shift, Group average rate exceeded our expectations and Transient demand was better than expected. As a result, on a constant currency basis, our comparable RevPAR improved 1.7% in the second quarter to nearly $194, driven by an 80 basis point increase in average room rate. Better than expected demand resulted in occupancy improvement of 70 basis points, to 83.2%. Our domestic comparable properties had RevPAR growth of 1.8%, with a 10 basis point delta between total and domestic comparable RevPAR growth, a result of the tough comp at our properties in Rio de Janeiro, which benefited from pre-Olympic activity last year. Comparable hotel revenues were luckily flat for the quarter, and up 1.4% so far this year. I am pleased to report that comparable EBITDA margin grew 15 basis points in the second quarter, and 45 basis points year-to-date. Greg will elaborate on where that margin improvement is specifically coming from. Starting with our Transient segment, the Easter and Passover holiday shift into April, coupled with spring break travel, boosted Leisure demand for the month by 3.5%. May and June demand grew a combined 1.3% for an overall quarterly demand increase of 2%. Transient rate for the quarter increased 1%, driven by a nearly 2% rate increase in the month of May. Our strong book of Group business allowed us to drive Transient rates. Overall, the favorable demand and rate results led to a 3.1% increase in Transient revenue for the quarter. We continue to be impressed with our Transient business, particularly Leisure, which remains strong and buoyed by high customer sentiment, lower oil prices, and strong employment. As expected, our Group results for the quarter were also impacted by the holiday shift, as Group revenue decreased 2.7% for the second quarter, notably impacted by demand declining more than 8% in the month of April. Specifically, a result of the holiday shift from March into April. While we expect Group to continue to be impacted in the third quarter as a result of the Jewish holiday shift, these strands have been incorporated into the revised guidance we presented this morning. Let me spend a few minutes discussing our Group outlook. We have over 90% of our Group revenues on the books for 2017, and continue to see the Group booking window extend. With nearly all of our Group business on the books, combined with record occupancies at our properties, and Transient demand strength, there isn't that much additional capacity remaining for groups to book for 2017. This means that groups are looking out to 2018 and beyond, which is a great trend that helps our managers shore up their business, shrink the hotel, and drive future Transient pricing. In fact, we were encouraged by strong booking activity for 2019 and beyond during the quarter. Combined with solid 2018 Group revenue pace, our outlook for Group business remains positive. One additional item I'd like to address is a question which has been raised regarding a decelerating second half for our business. Please keep in mind that two one-time events, both in the first quarter and the third quarter, caused a little noise when looking at our guidance. As you know, in January we benefited from the Inauguration and the Women's March. Business we were thrilled to have, but which skewed first half results higher. As we look to the second half, it is important to remember that we expect to be impacted by the difficult comps in Brazil, due to last year's Olympics in the third quarter. When you smooth out those two events, our forecast does account for a slight deceleration in the second half, but not nearly as much as the forecast would suggest. Looking at the remainder of the year, we remain cautiously optimistic and confident in the raised guidance we put out last evening, and would describe our outlook as, steady as she goes. Before I turn things over to Greg, I would sum up by saying, that our geographically diversified portfolio of iconic assets continues to drive positive results, as illustrated by our performance and our upward revision to 2017 guidance. We continue our strategy of utilizing our portfolio scale and access to information to identify and generate opportunities, both internally and externally, that we expect to produce strong returns for our investors. Finally, we continue to benefit from our disciplined capital allocation decisions, and maintain the flexibility to create value in numerous ways, due to our strong balance sheet. With that, I will turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in much greater detail. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you, Jim. We continue to be pleased with our RevPAR and EBITDA margin growth, as our results exceeded our expectations again this quarter, allowing us to raise both our RevPAR and margin guidance. Now, I will provide an overview of some of the markets. Our hotels in Seattle outperformed our expectation in the rest of the portfolio, with an 18.7% RevPAR increase, which was over a 1,000 basis points above the STR upper-upscale market results of 8.1%. The impressive results were driven by both occupancy and average rate increases of 5.2 percentage point, and 11.8%, respectively. Our Seattle hotels benefited from a strong city-wide calendar, displacement from a competitor's room renovation, and tailwinds resulting from the W Seattle renovations last year. Strong Transient Retail and Special Corporate business, coupled with solid Group business, helped our managers drive Transient ADR, which was up 14.1%. We continue to witness strength in Phoenix, where RevPAR at our hotels grew 11.8% in the quarter, driven by a 6.6 percentage point increase in occupancy, and a 2.1% growth in average rate, more than tripling the STR upper-upscale market results of 3.6%. This was the result of the combination of strong Transient and Group business during this quarter. Specifically, Transient revenues increased 17%, while Group revenues grew 5.2%. In addition, the continual ramp-up of the strategic 2015 redevelopment and franchising of The Camby Hotel benefited our Phoenix results in the first half of this year. Despite the excessive lack of city-wides this quarter, our hotels in Denver grew RevPAR a significant 8.8%, driven primarily by a 7.6 percentage point increase in occupancy, mainly from Transient demand, which increased almost 23%. The RevPAR increase exceeded the STR upper-upscale results by 520 basis points. In addition, our managers strategically targeted short-term Group business, which enabled the hotels to increase Food and Beverage revenues by almost 15% in the quarter. Our Boston properties also amazingly outperformed our portfolio this quarter, with RevPAR growth of 8%, 380 basis points in excess of the STR upper-upscale results for the market, and better than we had we'd have anticipated. Occupancy increased 3.2 percentage points, and average rate grew 4.1%. Two additional city-wides helped to compress the city and drive incremental ADR growth. Once again, Transient revenues were strong, with a 16.7% increase. We expect continued strength in Boston, as several companies are moving into the area or expanding. Although much of this activity is in the Seaport district, we do anticipate the overall market will benefit. Hawaii RevPARs were 5.7%, beating STR upper-upscale market results by 110 basis points. Resorts destinations, such as Hawaii, benefited from stronger Leisure business, related to the Easter holiday shift. Average rate for the overall market at our hotels was up 7.3%, which was offset slightly by an occupancy decline of 1.4 percentage points. However, our resorts in Maui were even stronger, and saw a 15% increase in Transient average rates, as they benefited from pricing strategies that replaced lower rated Group business, with higher rated Leisure customers. The Maui properties are also benefiting from the anemic supply growth on the island, and the low national supply growth at resort properties overall. Shifting gears to some of more challenged markets, RevPAR at our hotels in Houston declined 12.7% mainly driven by challenges in the Group segment. These included two fewer city-wides this year, and lower than expected attendance at one large event in Houston this quarter. Our hotels in Houston will likely continue to under-perform the portfolio, as additional supply continue to negatively impact the market, especially on the weekend. However, it remains worth noting that Houston represents only 2% of our total EBITDA. In Atlanta, the RevPAR decrease of 3% in the second quarter was driven by a reduction in occupancy of 1.7 percentage points, and a drop of almost 1% in average rate. Both Transient and Group business were negatively impacted by the Easter holiday shift, and renovations at the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead hotel. In San Francisco, RevPAR declined 2.8% in the second quarter, largely due to the anticipated, and well-documented, closure of the Moscone Convention Center. However, our hotels outperformed the STR upper-upscale market results by 280 basis points. Going forward, we anticipate hotels in San Francisco will continue to struggle as the Moscone Convention Center is scheduled to be completely closed in the third quarter, negatively impacting all hotels in the Bay area. However, keep in mind, that once the expansion project at the convention center is completed in 2018, we expect city-wides to return to San Francisco, and business to positively follow through in a meaningful way in 2019. For our Domestic hotels in the second half of the year, we expect Phoenix, Los Angeles, Boston, and Hawaii to out-perform the portfolio, and Houston, New York, San Diego, and Denver to under-perform the portfolio. Moving to International operations. Our consolidated International hotels second quarter RevPAR decreased 3.1% in constant currency. As expected, the story of these two countries continues. Out-performance in Canada, and under-performance in Brazil. RevPAR in our hotels in Canada grew 11.5%, but was offset by a RevPAR decline of 14.6% at our Latin America hotels. Specifically, the business leading up to the Olympics in Rio last year provided for difficult comp at our Brazilian hotels. We expect these difficult comps to continue into the summer, and estimate that it will impact our total portfolio RevPAR results by 100 basis points in the third quarter. Another bright international note is the performance of the hotels in our European joint venture, which showed encouraging signs of improvement in the quarter. The portfolio continued to show signs of recovery, and is benefiting from accelerating economic growth across the continent. Many other countries where we own assets, such as Belgium, France, Germany, and Spain have increased GDP forecasts since our last call. RevPAR for the 10 hotels in the portfolio improved 8.2% in constant euros, with occupancy growth of 4.3 percentage points, and average rate increase of 2.7%. This performance was driven by strong Transient and Group business at several properties. For the full year, we expect RevPAR growth at these hotels will continue to out-pace our comparable historic result. We remain impressed by the efforts of our managers, and asset managers, as they continue to do a phenomenal job in bringing more profit to the bottom line. We increased margins by 15 basis points with a RevPAR increase of 1.7%. And on a year-to-date basis, we have increased margins by 45 basis points, on a RevPAR increase of 2.5%. These are impressive results in an environment with rising labor costs. Broadly speaking, our margin out performance can be broken down into three categories. First, we attribute about half of the performance to productivity gains. As we described on previous calls, a large portion of the productivity improvement is related to time and motion studies conducted by third party consultants at our hotels. We still have a portion of the portfolio where we have yet to complete such studies, so we anticipate continued benefits from this until at least next year. We are also pursuing other initiatives to drive productivity improvement. These include continued expansion of Marriott's Green Choice program, which allows customers to forego housekeeping service in exchange for loyalty points. We have also implemented a room technology solution at many of our hotels, which facilitates more efficient deployment of housekeeping labor. Our operational initiatives are also delivering out-performance. One example includes recently outsourcing four Starbucks operations. These were high revenue, but low profit operations, so converting them to rental income stream benefits overall margin. We have also continued efforts to restructure in-room dining operations. We now have 26 hotels in our portfolio with some form of modified, or completely eliminated in-room dining, in favor of packaged food, pick-up, or delivery. Other smaller targeted initiatives consist of reviewing maintenance and service contracts, or food procurement practices. Finally, further out-performance was achieved from plus inflationary growth in operating expenses not allocated to specific departments, such as administrative and general expenses, sales and marketing, and utilities. Higher purchasing card rebates, and savings in training, recruitment, and travel helped reduce A&G expenses. Savings in sales expense, through more targeted media and e-commerce spending, and reduced Group concessions held down sales and marketing expenses. We also continue to benefit from ROI projects, such as high-efficiency central plant equipment replacement, LED lighting retrofit, and solar panel installations, which drove continued savings in utilities. Going forward, we continue to execute on productivity improvements through our time and motion studies at our medium and small hotels. We also expect to garner cost savings from the Marriott-Starwood merger through lower OTA commissions, and better procurement costs, both of which should continue to drive future margin improvement. With the benefits of two quarters behind us, and with these productivity savings in mind, we have increased the midpoint of our margin guidance by 25 basis points this quarter, and 40 basis points since our initial guidance in February. In July, we paid a regular first quarter dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of 4.5% on our current stock price. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility, and believe we have one of the best balance sheets in the lodging REIT and overall, REIT space. Importantly, these key competitive and strategic advantage enhances our ability to sustain the dividend throughout the lodging cycle, while also allowing us to invest when accretive opportunities arise to either buy assets, buyback stock or reinvest in high-yielding value-add projects. During the quarter, we meaningfully extended the maturity of our revolver, and one of our two term loans, and lowered the interest rate margin on the term loan. This transaction demonstrates our ability to take advantage of our strong investment grade balance sheet, and our financial flexibility to opportunistically manage our maturity schedule, while remaining within our target leverage range. As Jim mentioned, we ended the second quarter with approximately $644 million of cash, and $775 million of available capacities remaining under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Today, our leverage ratio is 2.4 times, as calculated under the terms of our credit facility. As Jim noted in his remarks, we are excited to have reached the first half in an even better position than we anticipated. We have therefore increased the midpoint of our RevPAR and margin guidance for the year. Finally, I'm going to urge you to keep the impact of the holiday shift and the tough comps related to the Olympics in Brazil last year in mind, as third quarter results are anticipated to be weaker than the first half of the year, with a rebound expected in the fourth quarter. Looking specifically to the third quarter, we expect 21% of our total EBITDA for 2017 will be generated in the current quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our strong results today, particularly with the improving possibility of our assets in what continues to be a competitive market, and lower growth environment. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : And we'll go first to Barclays with Anthony Powell. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Good morning. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Good morning, Anthony. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Morning. You mentioned the strength of Leisure demand several times in your prepared remarks. Looking back, have you seen prior examples where Leisure out-performed business transient for an extended period of time? And how long do you think this dichotomy could last? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: It's a good question, Anthony. I think that we're very, very pleased with the book of business we're seeing from the leisure traveler. So long as consumer confidence remains strong, and unemployment remains low, and people feel good about their wallet and their balance sheet, we expect to see the leisure traveler continuing to spend money. We see no slowdown. If anything, we're seeing acceleration. So, we like nothing better than to see the business traveler return and put us in a better position to yield rates in an even more aggressive manner at the hotel. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. And as a follow-up, I think in the past you said Leisure made up about 30% of your overall room night mix. Has that mix changed in recent years? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: No. It's about the same. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Great. That's it from me. Thank you. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure. Great. Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Greg, you mentioned some detail around the margins, and I think in the last part of the prepared remarks that you kind of see some benefits on the \u2013 from the Marriott-Starwood merger and integration. Do you think both in the performance that we saw this quarter, and possibly then on the RevPAR side, you're seeing any of that benefit sort of real time? Or do you think more of the opportunity from the merger is slated to come in the months and years ahead? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yes. I think \u2013 look, we're benefiting, obviously, from quite a few of the things I mentioned this year, the time motion study, the energy ROI project, the Green Choice program, et cetera, but I think the benefit that will accrue to us from the Starwood-Marriott merger, really that's going to happen later. Either late this year, or really into 2018 and 2019 as well. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. And I guess, as we think about sort of the broader overall mix, and we look at the portfolio, it feels like this quarter we saw a demonstrable out-performance in some of the kind of non-top five or top ten cities. You know places like Denver, Phoenix, I guess even Seattle, as we head forward, A, do you think that pattern is likely to continue? And B, what's your plans for how you view your portfolio right now in terms of \u2013 I think over time, people probably try to prune and get out of some of those, the kind of \u2013 let's call it, non-top 10 markets, what's Host view towards those top 10 or 15 markets versus your overall diversification? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Shaun, that's a really good question. I think that we are very comfortable with the geographic diversity that we have in the portfolio today. I've mentioned in the past that we're very open-minded to looking beyond the top 10 to 12 markets that we had invested in, and in fact, while the Phoenician in and of itself is non-comp right now because of a renovation plan that we have ongoing, that asset is in Phoenix, that is a good example of the type of property that we'll be looking for, a large asset with scale, and an asset where we can add a lot of value. So I don't think that you will see us exiting those markets for the sake of exiting them. I think I'd go back to the comments that I made earlier. If we have a non-core hotel that is situated in a market that's under \u2013 that is likely to under-perform the rest of the portfolio over time, and is in need of a lot of capital outside of the reserve, those are the types of assets that we'll continue to prune. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks very much. Operator : And we'll go next to Rich Hightower from Evercore. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Hey. Good morning, guys. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Good morning, Rich. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : So let's \u2013 I want to break down the back half guidance a little bit. So it really does sound like Brazil, combined with the holiday shifts, were throwing a wrench into the third quarter, certainly vis-\u00e0-vis the fourth quarter if not the first half, as well. I'm just trying to get a sense of \u2013 and I appreciate the color you guys give on the contribution of EBITDA, relative to the full year, and so we can sort of back into some numbers that way. But what is the breakdown between RevPAR and margins in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, if you don't mind? And if we go negative, how negative could it be in the third quarter? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Hey, Rich. This is Greg. Hey, look, I clearly agree with almost everything you just said there. Clearly we are, as we mentioned in Jim's comments, impacted in a positive way because of the Inauguration and the Women's March in the first half of the year, and my comments \u2013 as I mentioned in my comments, Brazil, even though we only own two small hotels and the JW down in Brazil, those three hotels will impact our RevPAR by 100 basis points just in the third quarter. So there is some noise, as we've all talked about. I think the other thing I would add that sort of impacts first half, second half, is we have two hotels that just became comped this year, the Camby hotel and the Logan hotel, and those two hotels are really ramping up in a meaningful way this year. Clearly had strong RevPAR growth year-to-date. Those hotels are going to perform more in line with our portfolio on the second half of the year. So that's one additional item that sort of skews first half, versus second half. But, Rich, as you know, we don't give third quarter guidance here, I do try to help you out by telling you how much EBITDA, but look, I think, when I look at the shift of the Jewish holiday, and think about, you know, 100 basis point impact from Brazil, we should think that clearly, for us, I think RevPAR is going to be negative in the third quarter. And then as Jim mentioned, it rebounds in a strong manner in the fourth quarter. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Okay. That's very helpful, Greg. Thanks. And then just one quick question on some of the quarterly results from 2Q. As I kind of look at Host's performance versus the STR MSA tracks that most of us get on a weekly basis, you did out-perform in several of those markets. I'm curious though, if you take markets like San Francisco, D.C., maybe Boston as well, how your CBD assets did relative to maybe some of the suburban assets in those markets? Just given some of the particulars last quarter? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Hey, Rich. You know San Francisco might be the best example of what you just described. In total, all right our RevPAR declined 2.8% compared to the STR data, which is down 5%, 6%, obviously great out-performance. But when you look at our big hotels, the Moscone Center, it was down about 2.8%, so similar performance as some of our more, I guess, suburban properties around San Francisco. Yeah, I think, the one thing that really helped us in San Francisco is that our revenue manager, our asset managers, and our manager, we identify this quarter and this year as being, obviously it was going to be a weak year in San Francisco. And so because of that, they really focused on booking in-house Group business, which really, I think, helped us in the quarter. They also booked some, what I would say, high rated contract business, which also helps us out in the quarter. So with the benefit of hindsight, sitting here today, I think that was a great strategy and really helped our results. In fact, frankly, if you look at, sort of the branded hotels in the area around the San Francisco, Moscone property, frankly, most of those hotels were down double-digits in RevPAR. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: And Rich, I'll give you just a little bit of color on Washington, D.C., looking at suburban versus CBD hotels. So we continue to be very focused on driving performance at every property in the portfolio, and a good example of that, I think, is the Westfield's Marriott, which is not in the central core of Washington, D.C., but we had strong in-house Group performance in that property in particular. And our RevPAR for that hotel exceeded our previous forecast, as once we had the Group on the books, we were able to yield a stronger Transient business in the property, as well. <: That's great color, guys. Thank you. Operator : Up next, we turn to Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. So just on the EBITDA revisions, or the 2017 guidance revisions, how much of \u2013 so what would have been the \u2013 what's the impact from the additional property sale that you're assuming? And I'm assuming that's not the Melbourne sale that you had already anticipated last earnings, right? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: That's correct, Thomas. The undisclosed disposition that we referenced in the press release and our remarks, will have an effect \u2013 a negative effect of about $2.5 million, roughly, for the balance of the year. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Which is in our guidance. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yes. Of course it's in our guidance. And so the $20 million would have been closer to $23 million. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Perfect. And then I think there's been some concern in the market, just that if you looked at the STR data, June RevPAR decelerated from May despite it should have gotten the benefit from the July 4 shift. Did you feel like there was any kind of change in demand trends in June versus the prior quarter \u2013 or prior months and quarters? Thanks. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: No, we did not, Thomas. Actually, we had a pretty good June. I'm not going to give you specific RevPAR numbers, but we're really comfortable with how June performed. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I guess July, also? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah, July, and look, obviously we're still in July, but so far July has been pretty decent as well, compared to our internal forecast. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Robert W. Baird. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning, guys. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Hey, Michael. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: First question just on acquisitions. Jim, how far off do you think you are on pricing? And then maybe from your seat with your investment history and acquisitions history, are you seeing others underwriting differently than you are? Or do you think it's just simply a cost of capital difference that you guys have versus your competitors out there today? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, I don't think it's necessarily a cost of capital difference, Michael. I think that as we're looking at investment opportunities today, I think, first and foremost, we don't think it's time to be a buyer of any commodity type of asset, so we are focused at this point in the cycle, on unique hotels that I would categorize as iconic and would fall into that section of the assets that we own today. We are taking into consideration the growth environment that we're operating in as we're underwriting hotels, and as we've talked before, we take into account a full 10 year capital plan, and look to solve for an un-leveraged IRR on a 10 year basis that is at least 100 basis points in excess of our cost of capital, if not higher, depending on the facts and circumstances of the particular deal. So we have not \u2013 I wouldn't say that we're wildly off underwriting expectations, pricing the expectations of buyers today, but I would say that given the attractiveness of the debt markets, and the availability of debt capital, both from a pricing perspective and proceeds perspective, there has to be a real reason for an owner of an asset to want to sell today. So they become indifferent to a refinancing unless they can really achieve a valuation that excites them. And I think that is what's happening in the markets today. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. And then just one other question on Group. Can you maybe provide some metrics on the in-the-quarter bookings for all future periods? Did you see that pace tick up or down in the second quarter? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, it depends on how you define all future periods. When we look from bookings sort of in the quarter, or for this year, but for 2018, 2019, and beyond, the bookings were actually stronger. Bookings in the year, for the year, as we expected, and as we talked about last quarter, were as expected, a little bit weaker. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. I would \u2013 I would \u2013 you know, 2018 specifically, Michael, we are ahead of Group pace in 2018, relative to where we were this time last year for 2017. So we feel pretty good about what's happening with Group in 2018, as we look at the numbers today. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Meliker of Canaccord Genuity. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, Jim, I guess just one for you. You've now been in the big seat for six months, obviously been with the company a lot longer, but I'm just wondering if there's anything that you've learned over the past six months that's surprised you, or has caused you to rethink some ideas you had coming into the seat? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Boy, I'd say, if anything, Ryan, I've come to appreciate better what a great company Host is. When I sit back and look at the attributes of Host Hotels & Resorts, and I look at the geographically diverse portfolio that we have, which I think is unmatched by anyone else in the industry, the scale that we have, the access to information, and the ability to utilize that information to be effective on asset management, and effective on the acquisition side, and then the balance sheet that we have never been in better shape. I'm really excited about where we sit, and I think that the results that we had for this quarter, and the fact that we were able to beat consensus and raise estimates is a testament to everything that I just referred to in many ways. So, no surprises. Excitement, and looking at ways to move the company forward as we think about where we are in the cycle, and what the next leg might be. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. I appreciate it, Jim. And then as we think about going forward, as we move through the cycle, and what the next leg may be, coupled with the balance sheet that you just mentioned that's obviously in great position, where do you see Host, you know, call it five years from now? Is Host going to be a lot bigger? Are you going to continue to prune \u2013 prune the portfolio and one-off transactions, similar to what you've been doing this year? Do you see M&A on the horizon? How are you thinking about the portfolio on a go forward basis? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, you know, it's difficult to answer that question in a vacuum because it's so dependent upon what happens in the economy, and whether or not we see a re-acceleration of economic growth depending on what comes out of Washington, and general economic trends. So the thought that I have is, I want to make certain that Host is the best performing REIT in the space. And the actions we take will be with an eye towards increasing our performance, increasing our margin performance, and out-performing as we look to the future. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : And from Deutsche Bank, we'll go next to Chris Woronka. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Morning, Chris. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Morning. I wanted to ask you about your Hyatt Hotels. I think you have about nine of them, and I know they're going through kind of a contract re-negotiation of sorts with a couple of the OTAs. What are \u2013 do you \u2013 is there any embedded \u2013 do you think there's \u2013 that's going to create any kind of friction for you temporarily in the third quarter? And I think they've sent the owners some communications about their plans, but I mean, do you see that as a potential source of surprise for you? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: You know, Chris, I'm going to be careful with how I answer this question, because we've been in close communication with Hyatt, and as you might imagine, we are among the many owners in the industry that advocate for lower distribution costs. And I feel that over time Hyatt's strategy will achieve this result for us, and really that's about all I want to say on this subject. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. Also, I want to ask you on the \u2013 I know on the non-comparable hotel guidance, I think that is up $9 million or so at the midpoint versus prior. I guess the question is kind of, how much visibility do you have on that? And then, looking out to next year, maybe, Greg, can you explain to us how the comps suddenly change next year? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. So, I mean, Chris, as you mentioned, I mean, obviously we've been very pleased with our non-comp and our comp results so far this year. In fact, if you look at year-to-date, our non-comp is up north of 13% in RevPAR growth. So I would expect when I look at the non-comp assets that are in the group, Denver Tech, the Hyatt in San Francisco, which is actually up over 20% in the quarter in RevPAR, you know the Marriott Marquis in San Diego, Axiom, and our two new acquisitions, The Don and W; I would expect all those hotels to continue to have decent results in the second half of this year. As far as which assets will fall out? I think, the Marriott Marquis, I think becomes comp next year. But \u2013 and I know the Axiom becomes comp next year. Beyond that, really what we always try to do is have a full year sort of what we would consider normalized results, before we put it into comp. So, it's hard for me, sitting her today, knowing fairly exactly what will be non-comp next year. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Very good. Thanks, guys. Operator : Up next, we'll go to Smedes Rose of Citigroup. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to ask you how you're thinking about your position in New York? We've just sort of heard anecdotally that buyers are perhaps more interested in the market now, given that the pace of new supply is likely to start declining. Do you think that's accurate? And maybe, just in terms of the overall portfolio re-positioning, are you interested in selling a property or more here? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Smedes, I think you are starting to see some interest in New York. There's a lot of noise in background here. The city has undertaken an initiative with respect to Midtown East rezoning, which will likely be approved and signed into law in \u2013 later in August through September of this year. I think that that could potentially open up opportunities for re-purposing of certain hotels today to office/residential. So, we \u2013 as you know, we have a number of properties in Midtown, we're looking at a number of the assets. We've had conversations with different prospective purchasers. I would not say today that we're close to a deal, but it is something that's at the top of our list. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. That was it. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes, SunTrust. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. My question is on your expectations for the fourth quarter. Certainly you know October has a very easy Group comp, but what do you think about the strength or weakness of Group business in November and December? Thank you. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Hey, Patrick. As you probably already know, since you're a specialist on forecasting future RevPAR, you know November... Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: That's not bad. (52:28). Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: You know, I think November, surprisingly, even though it's a difficult time, November looks pretty decent right now. And, as Jim said in his prepared remarks, we expect a real rebound in the fourth quarter. Now having said that, we think it's probably, it's a decent quarter, but it's probably our second best quarter of the year. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Now, let me \u2013 let me \u2013 let me quiz you a little bit more here. I completely agree with you on November. This is interesting because a year ago, November, sort of a surprised to the upside. November, I would say, is one of the harder back half comps. Why do you think November looks decent for groups? And, I relate that to, when I go back and look at Smith Travel results around the election, it doesn't look like there is a terrible easy comp. I mean, group was up 15% or 17% the week after the election. I mean, what do you think might me going on for another good November here? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I mean, Pat, it's a great question. If you remember, you know, November of last year was really the first year that we, and I think the industry in total, actually we all feed our internal forecast after experiencing about a year, a year and a half of always sort of coming up short on internal forecast, November was a very strong month. December was a strong month, and obviously for us, the first quarter and strong quarter were both strong months, and first quarter is strong quarter, and second quarter is strong as well. So, it's a good question. Look, all I know, I don't know if I have a specific answer, but what I can tell when I look at our group booking pace in the second quarter, especially in November and December, looks real decent sitting here today. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for the comment. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Crow of Raymond James. William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Good morning. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Good morning, Bill. William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: First question is going back to something you said earlier about the potential savings from Starwood Marriott merger. I'm just curious, you referenced slower OTA commissions. What is the average commission, OTA commission you're paying today, and if we had to take a guess, how many basis points could we see that decline over the next year or two years? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah, Bill, I think, that, you know, when we look at our sort of Starwood legacy hotels and look at the contract that they had versus Marriott. You know, I think, once those contracts are fully negotiated, you know, my guess is, we save a point or two points, which is, you know, obviously material. I mean, the other \u2013 so the \u2013 but the other thing that we're hoping for obviously, Marriott as a larger company going forward, I mean, I'm speculating now, but I'm hoping as a bigger company, they have more leverage in the future on negotiations as well. William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then, the follow-up was on Europe, just with the weaker dollar here in the back half of the year. I'm just curious whether that has had an impact on your forecast for the balance of the year and whether you are contemplating now that you've kind of cleaned up Australia, whether you looked at Europe as a potential area for capital recycling? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Great question, Bill. I would say with respect to inbound international travel, it's probably neutral to up a bit. We are happy from our perspective to see the dollar weaken a bit because we do think we'll see more inbound travelers. With respect to Europe generally, as you know, Europe contributes roughly 2.5% of our EBITDA on an annual basis, and we are invested through a joint venture with two really terrific partners, the Government of Singapore, and APG, and it's been a great relationship. We've been in the Euro JV since 2006. That said, we are evaluating the way forward in Europe, and a couple things can cause one to stop and think, well, cost of capital in Europe is \u2013 appears to be much more aggressive than it is in the U.S. So, frankly, it makes it more difficult for us to compete. And we start with that premise, and we'll take it from there. William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. That's it from me. Thank you. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks, Bill. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Just first I want to ask a follow-up on Moscone. The Group booking contribution from Moscone is just marginally better in 2018 than it was in 2017, so I'm just curious, I know it's early, but is it your sense that San Francisco could commence a recovery in RevPAR as early as next year? Or is your sense that 2018 could be more of another year of, call it, transition, before we really get into that period of 2019 and 2020, where the Moscone bookings are quite strong? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Jeff, I would \u2013 I would agree with the latter comment that you made. I think that as we look at city-wide events in San Francisco for 2018, it is not as strong as 2017 or 2016. We really start to see Group room nights come back on the books in 2019. 2019 is the year when we're likely to see performance levels in total Group room nights of 2016. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's helpful. And then \u2013 and then, just another question on the expense growth. I mean, it's been pretty low this year. Can you maybe talk about how much longevity you feel there is to holding expense growth low? Is that going to be isolated to 2017, and pretty persistent to 2018, if you think RevPAR, you know, kind of remains around this 1% to 2% level? And I guess, maybe a second part to that. We had estimated some of the synergies that you guys might face from the Marriott Starwood combination to ultimately approach call it 50 basis points to 100 basis points cumulative on margins over the next few years. Do you think that's a reasonable estimate of the tailwind you could get from Marriott Starwood? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Jeff, to answer your first question is it sustainable? We're working really hard at making it sustainable. As we mentioned, we have completed time and motion studies at a number of the hotels in the portfolio. We're continuing to roll those studies out throughout the portfolio to improve productivity and improve margin on a regular basis. So Greg also mentioned that when he talked about other avenues that we're taking along with our managers to enhance productivity like how you schedule housekeeping rooms and the Green Choice. I mean, we're looking for continuous and working with our managers to find new initiatives that's going to allow us to be more productive in our hotels and keep costs down. Answering your question regarding the impact of the Marriott Starwood merger going forward, I don't think that your assumption is unreasonable at all. Over the next two years to three years as the companies are fully integrated we will likely see benefits top line as well once the rewards programs are fully integrated, hopefully by the end of 2018. So when I look at margin performance I think it's difficult in many ways to separate margin performance from RevPAR performance. So all in all we feel really good about what's happening with the Marriott Starwood integration and the fact that the Marriott is managing 81% of our rooms. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : From UBS we turn next to Robin Farley. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Two questions. One is just looking at your change in RevPAR guidance for the year it mostly has sort of gone up by the amount of the beat in the second quarter just at the midpoint. So how should we think about \u2013 is your outlook for the second half pretty much the same as what you thought it was a quarter or so ago? Is that the best way to think about that? And then I have another question. Thanks. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Hey, Robin. This is Greg. Yeah, I think that you're generally right that our increase in \u2013 if you look at the midpoint of our RevPAR guidance increasing nearly 38 basis points, it's primarily because of the success that we've had in the both the first and second quarter beating our internal forecast. And I think we pretty much sitting here today have a similar outlook for the second half of the year. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just in the opening comments, Jim, you'd mentioned that you've like looked at some opportunities that didn't meet your IRR standards, and can you give us a sense of just what type \u2013 were they portfolios, or individual property similar to the Don and the W acquisitions you've made, where they just sort of individual properties, and is it that there were other bidders that, you know, had a lower cost of capital or something? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, I'm not certain that \u2013 Robin, I don't think I said that the other bidders had a lower cost of capital. I think, we're very comfortable with our cost of capital, and that puts us in a position to compete, to create accretive value over time, and we underwrite for that perspective. So, they were not portfolios, they were single asset deals, and we spent a lot of time in one in particular, we were very close on it, and frankly, as I mentioned earlier in a response to, I think, a question that Michael raised, when a buyer can go out and borrow at very attractive rates \u2013 I'm sorry, in order to go out and borrow very attractive rates or high proceeds levels, yes, they change their mind. And they decide they want to own the asset, I think for many of the same reasons that we continue to be cautiously optimistic about where we're going. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's question and answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Risoleo for closing remarks. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, thank you for joining us on the call today. As I said earlier, we are pleased with our solid results, earnings fee, and 2017 guidance range across the board. We look forward to providing you with more insight into the remainder of 2017 on our third quarter call this fall. Have a great day, and enjoy the rest of your summer. Operator : And this does conclude today's presentation. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts Incorporated Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Gee Lingberg - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks, Julia. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts third quarter 2017 earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA, and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliation, to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earning's press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our third quarter results, and provide our outlook for 2017. Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our third quarter performance by markets, discuss margins, and the balance sheet. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you, Gee, and thanks, everyone for joining us this morning. Before I begin, I just want to send our thoughts and prayers to those recovering from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and the wild fires in Northern California. While we at Host were fortunate to experience relatively minimal damage from the storms and no damage from the fires, it certainly impacted many in our country and we wish them the best as they continue to rebuild their communities. I also want to recognize the great work of the associates at all of our hotels affected, as well as the work of our corporate team members who were on the ground assisting and getting the properties up and running quickly. In the third quarter, comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.8%, matching our internal expectations despite the unexpected impact of the hurricanes and Brazil underperforming our very low expectations. As we discussed on our second quarter call, the Jewish holiday shift from October into September negatively impacted the quarter, while Brazil and the storms further decreased comparable hotel RevPAR by 110 basis points and an estimated 45 basis points respectively. I would also note that prior to the storms, we were actually ahead of our forecast through July and August. As we discussed performance for the third quarter and the remainder of the year, it is important to realize that we have kept our hotels in Houston and Florida as comp despite the damage and closures we experienced. The good news and the major takeaway from this quarter is that we did an excellent job managing expenses, which allowed us to perform much better on the margin front than we otherwise would have in a challenging revenue environment. For the quarter, comparable expenses were down approximately $13 million, or over 1.5%, which is remarkable, considering many of our markets are near full employment. We continue to reap benefits on the margin front from the scale and information of our enterprise analytics platform, combined with our diligent asset management team. Further, we are beginning to see early signs of margin improvement from the Marriott-Starwood integration, although we don't expect most of those benefits to take hold until late 2018 and into 2019. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $317 million, exceeding our internal forecasts and consensus estimates. Third quarter FFO per diluted share was in line with consensus estimates at $0.33 per share. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA is $1.128 billion and FFO per diluted share is $1.27. As we have maintained all year, we believe the fourth quarter should rebound. As the holiday shift positively impacts October, Brazil and the 2016 Olympics are in the rearview mirror, and the impact of natural disasters abates. This is reflected in our revised guidance of full-year comparable hotel RevPAR growth of 1.15% to 1.35%. Please note that the full year impact of Hurricane Harvey and Irma on RevPAR is 15 basis points, which accounts entirely for the revision of the midpoint of our guidance to 1.25% from 1.375% last quarter. I would also point out that continued strong margin results allowed us to increase our full year comparable hotel EBITDA margin guidance by 5 basis points at the midpoint to flat to up 10 basis points. This implies that we can now achieve breakeven margins for this year at 1.15% RevPAR growth, an improvement versus our prior guidance of breakeven margins at 1.375% RevPAR growth. Part of our confidence on top line performance stems from the fact that the macroeconomic environment and the global economy continue to exhibit strength and appear supportive to industry growth. The key statistics we follow closely, corporate profits and business investment remain significantly above 2016 levels and have historically been strong-leading indicators of future RevPAR growth. In addition, employment remains strong, consumer sentiment is high, industrial production is rebounding, and the stock markets continue to reach all-time highs. An offset to the demand side of the equation is that overall supply and supply in our markets is projected to continue to tick higher, although not much greater than the long-term historical average. Although we have not yet experienced the impact of these positive factors on our corporate business, the third quarter was quite noisy for the reasons I've previously described, and we continue to be cautiously optimistic that the stage is set for economic expansion. To be clear, we have not underwritten the benefit of a tax reform policy passing this year or next, but recognize that could be very positive for the U.S. economy and our business. On the bottom line and as we noted last quarter, we continue to see the benefit of various initiatives focused on productivity and operational efficiency, including time and motion studies conducted by third-party consultants, expansion of brand Green Choice programs, and outsourcing or restructuring of less profitable F&B operations including in-room dining. The success of these initiatives provides a positive backdrop for our margin outlook and bodes well for continued relative outperformance. Given the challenging revenue environment in the quarter, I cannot emphasize enough the incredible job our team did limiting the comparable EBITDA margin decline to 75 basis points. In fact, year-to-date, comparable EBITDA margins remain up 10 basis points. The decline in RevPAR was primarily driven by our group segment, as third quarter group demand was down nearly 7%. As expected, September was impacted by the Jewish holiday shift from October last year to September this year with group demand down over 10% in the month. Looking forward, we have over 98% of our group business on the books for 2017, and as we discussed on our last call, continue to see the booking window extend. We saw evidence of this in the quarter as group revenue booked in the quarter for 2019 and beyond was up. Another positive was that group bookings in the quarter for the quarter were up nearly 5.8% compared to last year. As we look into 2018, group revenues on the books are positive, and in fact, up the same amount as when we were sitting here in 2016 looking into 2017. At this point, we feel our 2018 group business is solid. The decline in group demand in the quarter was offset by increased transient demand, which increased 1.3% and in contract business where demand increased almost 22%. As we have noted before, we have been strategically taking contract business in higher rated markets, such as San Francisco where we anticipated group demand gaps. On the rate side, transient increases are reliant on group demand to allow managers to drive rate. The challenges in our group business this quarter made it more difficult to benefit on the rate side. And as a result, transient average rate declined 2.3%. Overall, transient revenue decreased 1%. However, we continue to be impressed with our transient business demand, particularly leisure which remains strong and continues to be driven by high consumer sentiment, low oil prices and strong employment. Moving to capital allocation, we continue to selectively prune what we believe to be the most geographically diversified portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels in the sector. We sold one non-core asset during the quarter, the Sheraton Indianapolis Hotel at Keystone Crossing, for $66 million. This was the previously unidentified asset we disclosed on our last call. You will recall that we also closed on the sale of the Hilton Melbourne South Wharf for $184 million in the third quarter, which ended our investment activity in Australia and New Zealand. On a smaller scale, we also sold the land at the Chicago O'Hare Marriott (sic) [Chicago Marriott O'Hare] for approximately $10 million. By carving out this excess land when we sold the property in 2015 and going through the rezoning process ourselves, we were actually able to increase the purchase price of the hotel while harvesting value from a previously unutilized space. On the same topic but on a much larger scale, we are very excited about the pending sale of the Key Bridge Marriott in Arlington, Virginia. We worked very long and hard to acquire the fee simple interest in this property, which is ideally located on the Potomac River overlooking Georgetown in Washington, D.C. The buyer has the property under contract for $190 million including the FF&E reserve at a sub-5% cap rate and with $12 million at risk. The hotel is the oldest in the Marriott system and is in need of significant capital investment. However, the (12: 49) that has potential for residential, office and retail redevelopment. This is a great example of how we are mining the portfolio to opportunistically create and drive real estate value for stockholders. We anticipate that the deal will close by either late 2017 or by the end of the first quarter 2018. Another value-creation initiative we want to provide an update on is at The Phoenician. Recently, we received approval on our planned unit development which provides for the rezoning of the entire resort property. Under our master plan, we intend to sell about 60 acres of land as residential housing. There will be a mix of approximately 338 new single-family homes, townhomes and condominiums and 20 additional resort casinos. We now have begun marketing to interested residential developers and estimate incremental net profits from land sales of approximately $50 million to $65 million. We anticipate receiving those proceeds by mid-2019. I would also note that when we underwrote and purchased the property in 2015, we ascribed no value to residential land development. This is all incremental to our original underwriting, increasing our total 10-year unleveraged return by approximately 100 basis points. Further, we believe that there will be long-term revenue benefits at the resort as future new residents take advantage of our fantastic and transformed facilities, another clear example of entrepreneurial real estate value creation at Host. Our 2017 guidance does not contemplate any additional acquisitions from what we have already disclosed this year. We have begun to see several assets that would fit our target profile come to market this fall. However, we remain disciplined in allocating capital to new investments and continue to deploy our rigorous underwriting requirements, particularly focused on the fact that we could be in the later stages of the cycle. Our industry-leading balance sheet has never been in better shape with leverage at 2.3 times, as determined under our credit facility. As of quarter-end, we had nearly $790 million of cash and over $800 million of capacity under our credit facility. Depending on the economic conditions and opportunities that present themselves, this investment capacity provides us the ability to effectively allocate capital and drive stockholder value in a number of ways. We can seek to increase earnings through disciplined external growth, judicious capital investment in our portfolio, opportune repurchases of stock under our existing $500 million buyback authorization or returning capital to stockholders through payment of a special dividend. We believe this flexibility to pursue a variety of outcomes sets Host apart from our peers. Looking at CapEx for the full year, we expect to spend $270 million to $300 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures, which includes an additional expected spend of $55 million related to replacements for hurricane damage and $90 million to $100 million on redevelopment and ROI projects. Before I turn things over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, I would just like to take a moment to thank him for his leadership and contributions to Host over almost three decades with the company. Greg has enjoyed a long and successful career here, serving in a variety of roles and departments. He had served as an Executive Vice President for the past 10 years and as Chief Financial Officer since 2013. He has had a significant impact in setting and executing numerous strategic initiatives, including Host's achievement of an investment-grade balance sheet. On a personal note, I am deeply grateful to the work he has done this year to help me acclimate into my new role as CEO. He has been a trusted adviser, helping me navigate through my first set of earnings calls, in addition to actively assisting in the day-to-day management of the company. We will certainly miss him and his sense of humor, but take comfort that he has offered to remain as an adviser through July of next year. I also wanted to recognize Michael Bluhm, who will be joining me on our call in February as he is appointed CFO later this month. I am confident that Michael is a great fit for Host and that under his financial and strategic leadership, we will build on our success. Michael most recently served as a Managing Director at Morgan Stanley and he has deep knowledge of our industry. I look forward to benefiting from his perspective on how we can continue capitalizing on our financial strength to drive innovation and agility in an increasingly complex business climate. Finally, I am also pleased that Nate Tyrrell has been promoted to the role of Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer. In this role, Nate continues to be responsible for overseeing investments and is also overseeing asset management. Nate's promotion gave us the opportunity to achieve our stated objective, to combine the asset management and investment functions and create value through a more integrated approach to hotel ownership. With the new senior leadership team in place, we are poised to continue executing on our strategy of owning the most geographically diversified portfolio of iconic assets. This strategy continues to drive positive results, as evidenced by our relative operational outperformance to-date. We are better aligned to utilize our portfolio scale and access to information to identify and generate opportunities both internally and externally that we expect to produce strong returns for our investors. Finally, we continue to benefit from our disciplined capital allocation decisions and maintain the financial flexibility to create value in numerous ways due to our strong balance sheet. As we look ahead, our new senior team is working together and in the process of prioritizing and aligning the company under new leadership. This includes constantly evaluating, as we always have, different levers we can pull to drive enhanced value for shareholders. Given our strong balance sheet, the quality of our portfolio, and our scale, we are confident that opportunities exist to further bolster what we believe to be an already great real estate company. While we have no major strategic actions to announce at this time, we continue to actively consider value-creation opportunities consistent with our focus on delivering superior returns for Host's shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Greg, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in much greater detail. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you, Jim. As Jim pointed out, I've spent 24 years at Host, and this will be the 68th earnings call that I have participated in at the company. It is hard to believe how much time has passed and how much Host has changed over that period. I'm very proud to have been associated with Host since its inception, but most of all, I am thankful for having had the opportunity to work with amazing, bright and hard working people during my tenure. We have accomplished a lot together, and I know the team will continue to achieve great things. Host is a terrific company, and I know the future is bright. I wish Jim, Michael and all of our associates the best and we'll be rooting for all of them. With that, let's discuss the quarter. We are pleased with the continued outperformance at our hotels in Phoenix this quarter. RevPAR at our properties grew 9.2% beating the STR upper-upscale market by 830 basis points. A primary driver of the strength was strong corporate group demand at our Westin Kierland, which helped produce group revenue growth at 15% this quarter. Once again, our hotels in Seattle exceeded our expectations and the rest of the portfolio with a 6.6% RevPAR increase, which was 700 basis points above the STR upper-upscale market result of minus 0.4%. These impressive results were driven by both occupancy and average rate increases of 2.7 percentage points and 3.5% respectively. Our Seattle hotels benefited from strong transient, retail and special corporate demand, as well as the renovation of the W Seattle last year. Based on the anticipated and well-documented closure of the Moscone Convention Center, our managers at our hotels in San Francisco strategically targeted in-house group and high-rated contract business. This strategy proved successful, yet again, as our hotels exceeded our internal forecast and outperformed the STR upper upscale market results by 320 basis points with a RevPAR increase of 4.3%. Our strategy increased in-house groups by 26% and boosted banquet and catering revenues by almost 25%. However, we do not expect the short-term strategy to continue through the fourth quarter. Once the expansion project at the convention center is completed 2018, we expect citywide to return to San Francisco and the business to positively follow suit in a meaningful way in 2019. Our hotels in Denver continued to outpace the portfolio with a RevPAR growth of 4.1%, primarily driven by strong in-house group business. The RevPAR increase exceeded the STR upper upscale results by 220 basis points. Hawaii RevPAR grew 2.7% besting the STR upper upscale market results by 160 basis points. Strong group business as well as the Hyatt Maui ballroom renovation last year drove the increase this quarter. In addition, resorts destination, such as Hawaii, benefited from stronger leisure business from weather-impacted markets in the Caribbean. Keep in mind that our hotels in Hawaii are benefiting from the anemic supply growth on the island and the low national supply growth of resort properties overall. Shifting gears to some of our more challenged markets. RevPAR at our hotels in Florida declined 8.7% mainly driven by Hurricane Irma. Six of eight comparable hotels in Florida were closed due to mandatory evacuation and loss of commercial power. As Jim mentioned, our teams did an excellent job of getting our properties back online quickly. Those properties have been restored to substantially full capacity. We currently have about 320 rooms out of service, most of which are at the Biscayne Bay Marriott. Prior to the hurricane, our properties in Florida performed better in July and August than we had anticipated at the end of the second quarter. In Atlanta, RevPAR decreased 5.7% in the third quarter and underperformed the STR upper upscale market results due to the renovations at the Marriott Midtown Suites (sic) [Marriott Suites Midtown], The Ritz-Carlton, Buckhead, and the JW Buckhead properties. In addition, several large citywide events did not repeat in August, which affected overall demand in the Buckhead sub-market. RevPAR at our Chicago properties declined 4.1% this quarter, but outperformed the STR upper upscale market results by 220 basis points. Occupancy increased 1.5 percentage points offset by an average rate decrease of 5.7%. The decline in rate stemmed from softer-than-expected transient demand and a poor citywide calendar, requiring hotels to provide more discounted rates in order to drive occupancy. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect Boston, Atlanta, Denver, and Phoenix to outperform our portfolio. Conversely, we anticipate Houston, San Diego, San Francisco and Latin America to underperform. Moving to international operations. Our consolidated international hotels' third quarter RevPAR decreased 31% in constant currency. As expected, this was a direct result of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil which provided for difficult comps at our Brazilian hotels. RevPAR at our three hotels in Brazil declined 70% in constant currency and negatively impacted third quarter total comparable RevPAR by 110 basis points. The European joint venture portfolio continued to show signs of recovery and is benefiting from accelerating economic growth across the continent. Many of the countries where we own assets such as Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands have increased GDP forecast since our last call. RevPAR for the 10 hotels in the portfolio improved 3.2% with occupancy growth of 3.1 percentage points and a slight decrease in average rate. This performance was driven by strong transient and group business at several properties. For the full year, we expect that RevPAR growth at these hotels will continue to outpace our comparable hotel results. We remain impressed by the exceptional job of our managers and asset managers in bringing more profit to the bottom line. With a RevPAR decline of 1.8%, our margins only declined 75 basis points this quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have increased margins by 10 basis points on a RevPAR increase of 1%. These are remarkable results in an environment with low unemployment and rising labor costs. As we noted last quarter, we continue to see the benefit of various initiatives focused on productivity and operational efficiency including, one, productivity gains related to time and motion studies conducted by third-party consultants at our hotels. We still have a portion of the portfolio where we have yet to complete such studies, so we anticipate continued benefit into at least next year. Two, continued expansion of programs like Marriott's Green Choice, which allows customers to forego housekeeping service in exchange for loyalty points and the implementation of room technology solutions at many of our hotels, which facilitates more efficient deployment of housekeeping labor. And, three, our operational initiatives such as outsourcing low-profit food and beverage operations, including continued efforts to restructure in-room dining operation. We now have 26 hotels in our portfolio with some form of modified or completely eliminated in-room dining in favor of packaged-food pickup or delivery. Other smaller targeted initiatives consist of reviewing maintenance and service contracts or food procurement practices. Going forward, we continue to execute on productivity improvements through our time and motion studies at our medium and small hotels. We also expect to garner cost savings from the Marriott-Starwood merger through lower OTA commissions and better procurement costs, both of which should continue to drive future margin improvement. In October, we paid a regular third-quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share which represents an annual yield of 4.1% on our current stock price. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility and believe we have one of the strongest balance sheets in the lodging REIT and overall REIT space. Importantly, this key competitive and strategic advantage enhances our ability to sustain the dividend throughout lodging cycle, while also allowing us to invest when accretive opportunities arise to either buy asset, buy back stock or reinvest in high yielding value-add projects. We ended the third quarter with approximately $789 million of cash and $807 million of available capacity remaining under a revolver portion of our credit facility. Today, our leverage ratio is 2.3 times as calculated under the terms of our credit facility. Overall, we are pleased with our strong results, particularly with the improving profitability of our assets in what continues to be a competitive market and lower growth environment. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Larson. We'll go first to Anthony Powell with Barclays. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Good morning, Anthony. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Good morning. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. The Key Bridge sale and The Phoenician opportunity involve some residential redevelopment opportunities. Do you have any more of these opportunities throughout your portfolio particularly in cities like New York? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yes. Good question, Anthony. We're looking at options for a number of our New York hotels. I wouldn't say that we're to the point where we're comfortable discussing anything today, and we continue to look at opportunities throughout the portfolio to develop excess land, to convert as we did years ago at the Newport Beach Marriott. We took excess tennis courts out of inventory, and sold that piece of dirt to a local residential developer who put a condo tower there. So, we have a number of initiatives that we're working on today, but the short answer is nothing that I would be comfortable discussing because we're not far enough along. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Got it. And, Greg, thanks a lot for all your help over the years. You've been one of the most helpful executives that I've dealt with. So, good luck in the future. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, thanks a lot. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Operator : We'll go next to Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning, and, yeah, Greg, let me offer my congratulations too. So, Jim, in the prepared remarks, you did mention weighted average supply growth being sort of one of the kind of issues that continues to remain out there for the industry. Could you just talk about how you're thinking about weighted average supply growth in Host's markets for stacking up for 2018? And do you see any signs of kind of a crest or peak out in either 2018 or 2019 especially in maybe a handful of markets like New York? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I think that, in general, Shaun, we see supply peaking in 2019. And our sense today is that supply will pick up in 2018 and probably level out in 2019, and then we should start to see a decline. Generally, what's happened over the last six months or so is that the lending environment has gotten much more difficult for developers to build new hotels. Obviously, that's something we'd like to see, and we're seeing projects being delayed and projects being put on the shelf. So, I think we'll be right around industry averages, maybe a tick more. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And anything in particular driving those delays that you could elaborate on? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, I think, generally, it's the fact that lenders have clamped down on their underwriting standards. The capital markets are flush with cash today which obviously impacts other pieces of our business. But based on conversations we've had with lenders and talking to folks in the brokerage community and developers and operating partners that we work with, it's just not as easy today to go out and get a construction loan. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Operator : We'll go next to Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Hi, good morning, guys. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Morning, Rich. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : If I've got one question, I'm going to try to make it count here. So there's been a lot of chatter surrounding Host recently on the topic of various strategic alternatives, levered share repurchases, programmatic asset sales. There's obviously a lot of levers available, and I certainly appreciate that you guys can't talk about things that haven't been announced. But can you talk about what the current limitations are with respect to an investment-grade rating, with respect to commitment to the dividend throughout the cycle, just how do you guys think about that box that you might be in as we contemplate these other alternatives? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Rich, I think that we have consistently said that we intend to maintain our investment-grade rating. And that means that \u2013 well, in addition to that, we said that at this point in the cycle, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we may be in the late stages of the cycle, we may not, but we're taking a cautious approach today to capital deployment and taking that into consideration in our underwriting criteria. But we have stated that we would be comfortable taking leverage to 2.5x to 3x.And I don't think that's changed by any means. Does that provide a limitation to us? I don't think that it does. Candidly, I think that we are cognizant of the scale, the depth, the breadth of what we have in this company and are looking for ways to create shareholder value over the long term, but we're going to keep the balance sheet in mind, and we're going to keep the dividend in mind as well. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, I agree with Jim. I mean I think Host is in a great position today with leverage at 2.3x and nearly $800 million of cash. I think there's a lot of flexibility to do all the things we mentioned, whether it's buying back stock, reinvesting in our assets, or buying assets. It's still clearly being investment grade. It's still clearly being in a position in a downturn to maintain our dividend. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Okay, guys. Appreciate that color. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I'm going to go ahead and follow up on that one. So you mentioned buying back stock, reinvesting in assets or buying assets. Given your views on the cycle, would you rank any of those as a priority relative to the others? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: It's tough to rank anything in a vacuum, Steve. It really is dependent upon how a particular acquisition opportunity would stack up from an accretion perspective relative to buying back stock, which we will evaluate any potential acquisition opportunity against the stock buyback opportunity concurrently as we're evaluating it. So I can't sit here today and say that one is going to take precedence over another. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Fair enough. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Thank you for the group color around 2018, but any chance you could just give us more thoughts around kind of how you're thinking about 2018 RevPAR guidance? Thanks. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah, Thomas, it's a little early in the year for us to be talking about 2018 RevPAR guidance. We are in the budget process with our operators. We don't have budgets. So there's really not a lot of color I can add. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I can answer that, Jim. Yeah, I mean obviously there are some other wildcards out there as well, right. Are we going to get a tax cut at some point later this year, early next year? And we continue to look at the economic stats. So, as you know, Thomas, what we like to do is give our guidance on our next call, which will be in February. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. I thought it was worth a shot. Can I just ask another question then? I think the market \u2013 I mean, you're not alone in highlighting how the hurricanes are having a negative impact on RevPAR. I think investors and we simply thought that there was going to be a bit of a tailwind from people displaced. Can you just talk about kind of the gives and takes there? I mean, could the hurricanes be a positive surprise in the fourth quarter? Thanks. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, the properties that we own are truly in both markets. They're upper upscale luxury hotels. They're not the type of assets that would generally benefit from teams that are coming in to rebuild the local markets that have been battered as a result of the hurricanes. So generally, I don't see that piece of business benefiting us. However, I will tell you that we're already starting to \u2013 and none of this is baked in our numbers, by the way. We're already starting to hear some tangential news that people want to come to Florida this winter and end of fourth quarter, people who might have been going to the Caribbean or Puerto Rico in particular, St. Thomas, some of the other islands that got devastated. So I'm going to be cautiously optimistic and say that we have our fingers crossed that we should see a pickup in our Florida properties as a result of Irma and Maria. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. The other thing I would add, Tom, here, I'll give you some 2018 guidance for you since you're so persistent. Look, I think the good news for Host is that we have kept all of these hotels that were impacted in our comp set. And so in looking, I think the good news is, obviously, we were impacted this quarter. I think we will have some impact in fourth quarter, but all those hotels we have easy comps in 2018. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Way to look at it positively. Greg, thanks for all your help over the years. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I did. That was just a byproduct of our decision not to take them out of comps. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Bellisario with Baird. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning, gentlemen. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Good morning, Mike. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Just kind of want to circle back to Rich's question a little bit, maybe ask it slightly differently, but not looking for specifics on the \u2013 call it European exit, for example. But what needs to happen or what do you need to see to maybe act on some of these options that you have embedded within your portfolio? Is it something on the macro front or is it a capital markets decision? What's kind of the thing that needs to happen for you to say, 'Okay, it's time to do X, Y or Z?' James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. I think what has to happen first and foremost, Mike, is we have to get the new senior teams aligned and integrated, and come together with a plan of how we want to see Host in the future. And Michael is not even on board to-date, so I think it's going to take some time for us to wrap our arms around the new vision and the way forward. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. I think what I would add is, look and I know you guys are talking about maybe some bigger things. But I would add also to Jim's comments that he had in his prepared remarks is that I think the team is doing a great job already, right. If you look at the Key Bridge potential sale later this year or next year, I think that's a fantastic transaction, even the land sale in Chicago and the other asset sale both in Australia and here. So I would say that they're already moving quickly, but you could see further things in 2018. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. I'd just add onto The Phoenician, Michael, because we, actually, I think, talked a lot about the potential for residential development at The Phoeniciana couple years ago when I was in Phoenix. And it was an opportunity that we identified as a possibility in our underwriting, but we certainly didn't bake any value into it and underwrote the asset on a standalone basis. So these are the types of opportunities that we are going to continue to look for going forward, places where we can really opportunistically create value out of real estate. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That's helpful. And then just kind of digging into The Phoenician there where you have approval, can you kind of maybe walk us through the steps and the timing on what needs to get rezoned and any potential for an accelerated timeline there maybe? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, I think we always run the risk if there's an appeal of our PUD approval. But it's been through the City of Phoenix \u2013 The Phoenician is located in the City of Phoenix. It's been through the Planning Commission. It's been through the City Council. And we've had important communications with all the neighborhood groups that that might have evidenced the concern or had questions about what this was going to mean to them and to their land values. So the resort in it of itself is 319 acres. As I stated in my remarks, we rezoned the entire property. So we put a PUD, a planned unit development on the entire property. It involves relocating the tenants to an activity center, building a new fitness facility, and really shrinking the golf course from 27 holes to 18 holes, and freeing up 60 acres of residential land for development. Our plan \u2013 and we've hired a land broker. We had assembled a team early on shortly after we closed on the deal. We have a land broker on retainer who is representing us with residential developers. And our goal is to sell the land to one or more residential developers and let them develop the real estate going forward. We're hopeful that we could see the closings occur by mid-2019. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks and, Greg, best of luck to you going forward. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I wanted to ask just Jim on the underwriting side. Are you seeing any changes in pricing of hotels just given where we are in the cycle and maybe departure of some buyers that might have been more present, say a year ago or so? Are you seeing anything there? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: A couple observations on the investment side, Smedes. First of all, I would tell you that until very recently, we did not identify product on the market that fit our criteria. I've stated in the past that given where we may be in the cycle, it's not a time to be a buyer of commodity-type hotels. Obviously, we like the resort space. We like big boxes a lot. We're prepared to move beyond the top 10 or 15 markets and look out to the top 25 markets. What we've seen happening over the last 60 days or so is a number of hotels have come to market, some being formally marketed by intermediaries and one or two others that we're working on a direct basis or an off-market basis. Yes. Seller expectations are lofty. That doesn't mean that they're going to transact. We are still seeing a number of situations contrary to the comment I made earlier with respect to the tightness in construction lending, we are starting to see situations and continuing to see situations, I should say, where current owners of hotels, if they can't clear the market at a price that they find attractive, they can refinance a property today at very attractive terms and very attractive proceeds. So there are a handful of deals out there that we're looking at today. I think it's TBD to see where they clear the market. We certainly don't intend to stray from our underwriting. We don't feel that we have a need to stray from our underwriting. We're going to continue to be disciplined. And if we can wrestle a deal down that makes sense for us and creates stockholder value, then we'll pursue it. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. I just wanted to ask you as well. As you look at labor costs moving into 2018, are there any particular markets that just sort of stand out in terms of higher costs, either that are being sort of legislated in or there are perhaps union contracts coming due or anything along those lines that we should just be keeping in mind as we think about 2018? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Hey, Smedes. This is Greg. I think it will depend on the market. I mean, certain markets \u2013 Arizona is probably a good example \u2013 we are experiencing some tight labor markets in Arizona and some other markets. There will be some union contracts coming due in '18. Obviously, we've experienced some of those pressures this year, but because of the benefits of technology and time/motion studies and other things, we've been able to mitigate some of those cost increases. In fact, as Jim said, during the quarter we were able to decrease our overall comp expenses by $13 million. So, yeah, I think we will have some pressure on labor in 2018, but I think we'll continue to benefit from technology and, obviously, the merger between Marriott and Starwood will also be helpful and gives us some tailwinds to offset that as well. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. And yeah, I'll certainly echo the concern or the comments earlier, Greg, that you'll certainly be missed, but we'll look for you trackside next year. But I'm curious just on earlier question came in about just constraints on your options for maximizing value. I'm just curious, how do you guys think about managing around monetizing low-tax-basis assets like the Key Bridge Marriott because of the need to either recycle that capital or pay a special dividend? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. I think, a couple things on Key Bridge in particular, Jeff. It's something that we thought about, obviously, because it is a low-basis asset. It's been in the company from inception, and I think it was the second hotel that Marriott Corp. built many, many years ago. It was built 1959, I believe. So, we do have a very low tax basis in that asset. And as we're thinking about whether or not we have a special dividend as a result of the sale, I think, one of the things we're thinking about today is, is it possible to do a like-kind exchange for that hotel? It's also going to depend on when the deal closes. So, there are a lot of factors here that go into the equation. Obviously, if it closes in 2017, and we don't feel that there is a high probability of executing on a like-kind exchange, then a special dividend is something we'll be thinking about internally and talking about among the management team here. If it closes in 2018, it might have a slightly different color on it. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And maybe just one follow-up, if I could. And I know it's early, but Marriott is considering changing its occupancy threshold around rewards redemption to maybe more of a waterfall. I know nothing has been concluded, but as someone who has a good number of Marriott managed hotels, who I think probably operates near those occupancy thresholds, could you talk a little bit about how those affects pricing in your mind and maybe, conceptually, what the opportunity could be if it was modified? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: We're having some conversations with Marriott around the rewards program. I mean, they're doing a lot of work on rewards today. They have to \u2013 they want to and they have to harmonize the Starwood rewards program along with Marriott rewards. They are hopeful that they'll get this done by the end of 2018. We have an active seat at the table. We're having conversations. And I think to say anything more than that, I wouldn't be comfortable with that. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks, guys. Operator : We'll go next to Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, everybody, and similar sentiment to you, Greg. You'll be missed. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks, Joe. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : When you guys think about the 2018 and I heard your comment, Jim, on the group revenue pace for 2018, would you expect that the group segment to lead or lag relative to business transient leisure? But then when you think about 2018 overall, would you expect your overall portfolio to lead or lag relative to the U.S. industry RevPAR results? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I think a lot of what happens in 2018, Jeff (sic) [Joe], is going to really be dependent upon the psychology of travelers in general, but of businesses in particular. And if we see a tax bill come out of Washington, D.C. that gets close to doing what is being proposed, i.e., take the corporate tax rate down to 20%, if we see a repatriation of profits that are trapped overseas right now and see a big inflow to the U.S. Treasury that maybe leads to an infrastructure build at some point during 2018, then I think that we feel really good about what that's going to mean for our business. But sitting here today, the only thing I can really tell you is that we're sitting today with the same amount of group business on the books in 2018 as we had in 2017 at the same time in 2016. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: With the same increases. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Same increases, yeah. And we have about 67% of our 2018 group business on the books already. So, we feel good about it. Do we want to see the return of the business transient traveler? Absolutely. Do we want to see group bookings pick up? Sure, we do. That can lead us to a billion dollar question. When is this going to happen? If we had that answer, I think we'd all be in a much better place. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: And we could give guidance. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: And we'd give guidance. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Hey, Chris. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I want to ask you. Jim, there's been a lot of talk about the Marriott-Starwood merger and some of the benefits that accrue to owners. And I heard your comments, you expect to see those more later next year, 2019, and I think a lot of that is probably on the expense side. I want to ask you if you think there's any top line benefits that are \u2013 that either have or going to materialize from that merger? I think that was, part of the \u2013 if not spoken, at least part of the implied idea when that happened. And I don't know you guys don't give a specific brand data, but maybe some comments on whether you think there are top line benefits coming out of that as well. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I think I can answer that with an unequivocal, yes. Marriott's group sales engine, in my opinion and I think the opinion of everyone here at Host, is second to none in the industry. Starwood had a good group sales platform. I think, Marriott's is superior. Marriott is in the process right now of integrating the two organizations. We're working closely with them to understand what that means. Again, not unlike the rewards program, we do have a seat at the table and we are having conversations with them. So, we fully expect that as the two sales organizations are integrated that we should see yield index increase for our Starwood legacy hotels. The Sheraton RevPAR index today is not a fair share. It's 90%plus or minus. So, we see a lot of upside going forward. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And I also want to pass along best wishes to Greg. And, Greg, I'm sure you'll miss those trips to Fiji, but we'll see you around. Operator : We'll go next to Robin Farley with UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Two questions or really just clarifications. I know you're not giving guidance for 2018 RevPAR, but it's one we're sort of expecting a similar increase in U.S. RevPAR or something in that sort of 1% to 2% range for next year. You talked about a lot of the programs targeting expenses. Is it reasonable to think that you could keep margins flat next year, if RevPAR is only up in that 1% range? I know it looks like you will be able to have done that this year, but just wondering how you feel about that, just going into 2018. And then just the other clarification, your commentary on group pace for 2018, having the same increases this time last year did for 2017. Can you just remind us where 2017 group is coming in for the year, what the increase is coming in for 2017 group? Thanks. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Hey, Robin. This is Greg. So, yeah, this year, I think it's been as we've mentioned an extraordinary year on the cost front and margin front. I mean, if you look at the low end of our guidance, we're going to have breakeven margins and 1.15% RevPAR, and frankly, revenue growth is going to be under 0.5%. So, I think those are remarkable results. I think we still as I've talked and Jim talked about, we still have some things that will help us next year. Again, we still \u2013 because we have a lot of these things more complicated hotels, I think, technology is going to continue to help us next year. Certainly, as Jim just mentioned, yes, obviously there's a revenue bump because of the Starwood-Marriott merger, but I think there'll clearly be some expense benefits occurring to us both in 2018 and 2019. So, I think, we're going to do better next year than a typical year. But I guess without giving \u2013 getting too specific, I don't think, we'll be \u2013 look, this was a record year, right, to have flat margins with 1.15% RevPAR growth, right. I think the breakeven margins growth will be higher than that, but certainly better than an average year. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. On the group, where group is coming in for 2017? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I'm sorry, Robin, we didn't \u2013 I didn't hear you on that. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Oh, sure. The other question was just you mentioned that your 2018 booking pace for group is similar to what 2017 looked like at the same time last year. Can you just remind us where your 2017 group is now coming in for the year now that 98% of that is on the book? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. It's single. It's up over 2%. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And best wishes with everything. Greg, let me add that to everyone else's. Thanks. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, thanks, Robin, for that. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks, Robin. Operator : Well go next to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Going back to that group outlook for next year, are there any markets that are driving that? I know you invested a lot of money in some of your group hotels, and I wonder if these are just Host specific. And then for D.C., are you seeing any uptick in short-term group as legislative activity looks to pick up? Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I think, it's too \u2013 look, D.C. has been a great market for us. And when we look at sort of the city-wide for 2018 and 2019, D.C. looks quite strong. And my guess is based on what you were just talking about, we could see additional activity in D.C. So, we \u2013 clearly, we feel pretty good about D.C. There are other markets for us that that look good. But as we said earlier, we're not giving guidance for 2018 at this point. And our group revenues looks solid on our books today. So, I'm not sure that we're going to get into it too much further at this point. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Well, congrats, Greg. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Hey, thank you. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Bill Crow with Raymond James. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Greg, let me express my well wishes for your wife who has to deal with you a lot more at home. So, good luck to Piper. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: (01: 02: 00). Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I hope you spend a little more time out in wine country. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: All right. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: My question is twofold, very quick here. Any update on the COO search? Is it still under way? Or have you rethought that position? And number two, The Ritz-Carlton rebranding in Buckhead, is that something that you approached Marriott on? Or Marriott came to you? And how did that play out? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah, Bill. Happy to give you an update on both of those. With respect to the COO search, we have suspended the search. By marrying up asset management with investments, we think we're accomplishing what we wanted to accomplish, which was integrating the two disciplines to really be completely focused on real estate value creation. We have a strong enterprise analytics team that is mining data for us and providing a competitive edge, as well as strong asset managers as we go forward. So, at present, the management changes are done internally. With respect to The Ritz-Carlton in Buckhead, we're having conversations with Marriott regarding the right way forward for that hotel. The hotel was in need of a material renovation. We looked at some options outside of Ritz, but keeping it within the Marriott family, and landed on The Whitley, a luxury collection hotel, as the best alternative to drive stockholder value. We put HEI in to manage that property. And what we haven't discussed is that we also own The Westin in Buckhead, and HEI is managing The Westin as well. So, we see incremental benefit of complexing and sales, and catering by having one manager manage two properties within the same brand family. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Jim, is it fair to assume that there will be a restaurant flag in Buckhead eventually? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: That, I don't know. I've asked that question in the past. And to my knowledge today, there is nothing planned. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. All right. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks, Bill. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure. Operator : And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Risoleo for closing remarks. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you for joining us on the call today. As I said earlier, we are pleased with our solid results and earnings beat, particularly after weathering the impact of two major storms. I am looking forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in a couple of weeks and hope you will join us at our informal meet and greet on Monday prior to the conference start. Otherwise, we look forward to discussing 2017 results and our 2018 outlook on our year-end call in February. Have a great day, everyone. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Michael Bluhm, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide commentary on the expanded disclosures, our fourth quarter performance including markets, margins, balance sheet and our guidance for 2018. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you, Gee, and thanks, everyone for joining us this morning. It's been a busy and exciting start to 2018, but I'd be remiss not to mention all that we achieved in 2017 as an organization. In addition to three spectacular hotels we are under contract to acquire and which I will speak about in a moment, we bought the iconic Don CeSar resort and the irreplaceable W Hollywood, while recycling capital out of low growth markets and high CapEx spend assets. We completed our Australian exit with the sale of the Hilton Melbourne and opportunistically sold the Key Bridge Marriott for a very low cap rate, even before considering the significant capital the asset required. We made great progress on addressing our New York strategy, culminating in the announcement of the W New York sale, which we intend to close sometime in the second quarter. We made tremendous progress on creating value in our portfolio, most notably at The Phoenician, where we filed a new PUD enabling us to sell land zoned for residential unit development, which should net us an incremental $50 million to $60 million in profit in 2019 and beyond. And on the operations side, we drove very strong margin outperformance, despite a low RevPAR environment and an economy running at full employment, partially a result of the new enterprise analytics platform we established early last year. Organizationally, we have a new senior team that is firing on all cylinders and better aligned under the streamlining of asset management and investments that we completed late last year. Last, but not least, we have listened to the investment community's call for greater transparency into our operations. You will note our enhanced supplemental and additional disclosure, which I will let Michael address in greater detail, but which helps illustrate the value of what we believe to be the best hotel portfolio in the public lodging space; all-in-all, a terrific year that we are looking to build upon. With that, let me give you some color on the quarter and full year 2017 results. As anticipated, operations bounced back nicely in the fourth quarter, generating the second strongest results of the year and beating internal and consensus expectations on the bottom line. Comparable RevPAR growth for the quarter on a constant dollar basis was 2.2%, driven by 140 basis points increase in occupancy and an increase in average rate of 30 basis points. The primary drivers of these results were strong transient performance, particularly on the leisure side, and better than expected group business in October. We always anticipated the Jewish holiday shift to positively impact October, but were pleased to see group revenues up nearly 5% in the month. As a result, our managers were able to push transient pricing to yield the second best RevPAR month of the year behind January, which benefited from the inauguration and Women's March. We were also pleased to see some pick up in the business transient customer during the quarter, as that segment grew nearly 5%. Although some of this was simply a result of the holiday shift and one quarter does not make a trend, it was an encouraging sign to see business travel up, and we will continue to monitor this customer closely as we move through 2018. As was the story during all of 2017, we did another fantastic job driving margins in the quarter through increased productivity and strict cost controls. Comparable EBITDA margins grew 10 basis points in the fourth quarter, resulting in adjustable EBITDAre of $375 million, an increase of 6.8% from the prior year. Let me remind you that this is on total revenue growth of only 50 basis points. For the full year, comparable RevPAR growth on a constant dollar basis increased 1.3% to approximately $180, the company's highest full year RevPAR in its history. Adjusted EBITDAre was $1.510 billion and adjusted FFO per share was a $1.69, both significantly exceeding consensus estimates; really a strong finish to a solid year. Moving to capital allocation and our initial outlook for 2018, I would like to spend some time discussing the strategic transactions we announced yesterday. As you have heard me say before, our strategy is to own the most geographically-diverse portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels in the U.S., utilizing our scale and investment grade balance sheet to grow externally through smart acquisitions and organically through operational improvement. With our pending acquisition of three fantastic Hyatt properties, we are executing on the external growth part of our strategy to begin the year. We are under contract to purchase a $1 billion portfolio consisting of : two resort properties, the 301-room Andaz Maui and 454-room Hyatt Regency Coconut Point; and one large City Center hotel, the 668-room Grand Hyatt San Francisco in the heart of the city. We anticipate the deal will close in the first quarter, although it is possible it may fall to early in the second quarter. These hotels are exactly the type of assets we have been targeting. Resort and large city center properties, segments where the supply outlook for the next several years is anemic. They're also in markets where we believe the near-term growth is significantly stronger than our broader portfolio and the country as a whole. We believe Maui and San Francisco will be two of the fastest growing markets in the country over the next few years. Maui is benefiting from improved air lift and continued strong leisure demand, while San Francisco will continue to improve from the combination of continued tech and business demand as well as the completed expansion of the Moscone Center. Additionally, we continue to be bullish on the West Coast of Florida, where Hyatt Regency Coconut Point is located, which should benefit in the near-term from displacement from the Caribbean and strong group and leisure demand. These three properties are nothing short of spectacular. In addition to supportive market fundamentals, we believe there are several initiatives we can implement to enhance value, once these properties are plugged into our enterprise analytics and asset management platform. These will include time and motion studies, food and beverage re-concepting and benchmarking with other Host assets in the respective markets. As many of you know, we currently own major Hyatt properties in both Maui and San Francisco, which will provide for collaboration and centralization opportunities. Further, we own iconic non-Hyatt-branded properties in all three markets, such as the Fairmont Kea Lani in Maui, the Marriott Marquis in San Francisco, and The Don CeSar and Ritz-Carlton Naples in West Florida. Using our data platforms to benchmark these existing properties against this Hyatt portfolio should prove to be beneficial, not unlike the success we have had in San Diego between our Marriott Marquis and Manchester Grand Hyatt. We also like the quality of this portfolio. These are modern hotels that have been invested heavily in by Hyatt, are in exceptional condition and require comparatively little CapEx in the near term. Further, with a combined 2018 RevPAR of nearly $290, we believe these assets will be able to live within the FF&E reserve much more comfortably than the assets we have been disposing of over the past 12 months, limiting our out-of-pocket investment throughout the life of the assets. Speaking of Hyatt, I can't overstate the importance of our relationship with them. We currently own eight Hyatt managed properties and two Hyatt franchised hotels. I am confident that our strong relationship, combined with our ability to move quickly to evaluate the deal, complete our due diligence pre-signing, provide a competitive bid and close quickly with a high degree of certainty, were all factors in their decision to award us this opportunity. We are excited to continue to build upon what is already a very strong relationship with Hyatt and value their expertise as a first-class operator. Looking closer at quality, these assets immediately will rank in our top 40 hotels ranked by RevPAR, with the Andaz Maui ranking in our top three. More importantly, the EBITDA per key generated from the portfolio is over 40% greater than the average of our portfolio. From a pricing standpoint, we are paying approximately $700,000 per room or approximately 17 times 2018 EBITDA and a 5% cap rate. As I stated earlier, we expect significant growth out of this portfolio over the near-term. Given the quality of these assets, the relatively low CapEx in the near-term required and the substantial growth outlook, we believe this is an excellent investment of our capital. On the disposition front, we also announced we are under contract to sell the W New York Lexington for $190 million. The buyer has a $13 million deposit at risk and the transaction is anticipated to close early in the second quarter. This sale is another example of Host executing on a strategic initiative, which was to reduce our exposure to New York. This hotel has been a particularly poor performer and requires substantial CapEx. Our ability to acquire the right to terminate the management agreement at this property was paramount in completing the sale. As anticipated, on January 9, we closed on the sale of the Key Bridge Marriott for $190 million. Again, this was a terrific opportunistic sale at a really attractive cap rate. We intend to like-kind exchange both properties with the Hyatt portfolio acquisition, which also ensures we retain the ability to reinvest the substantial gain that would be generated. The cap rate on the nearly $900 million in assets we have sold since January of 2017, including the W New York, is just north of 5%. Both sales included hotels in lower growth markets with higher CapEx requirements and an average RevPAR of approximately $140. Needless to say, we are pleased with our ability to recycle capital out of lower quality assets and into a high quality portfolio of scale with a strong growth profile. Shifting to our outlook for 2018, we continue to remain cautiously optimistic, with the midpoint of our comparable RevPAR growth guidance improving 20 basis points from 2017 to 1.5% on a range of 50 basis points to 2.5%. This slight acceleration is based on what we are seeing in the macroeconomic environment, as the global economy continues to exhibit strength and appears supportive to industry growth. What we discussed for nearly all of 2017, namely improving corporate profits, business investment, consumer sentiment amidst a low unemployment backdrop, all remain in place for 2018 and bode well for demand. The offset to the demand side of the equation is that overall supply and supply in our markets continues to tick higher, although not much greater than the long-term historical average. Looking out further, we expect to see supply moderating in 2019. We also gained some confidence, as January results came in nearly 300 basis points higher than our property forecasts, which were completed in November. That, combined with some life in the business transient customer in the fourth quarter of 2017, certainly gives us some hope for 2018, although it is too early to call breakout just yet. And while we are also hopeful tax reform will prompt corporations to increase their travel spend this year, we have not included the benefit of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in our outlook. As I said, we are cautiously optimistic, but realize it is only February and we have a long way to go in 2018. Group revenue pace sits about where it was the same time last year, up 2%, with approximately 80% of our group on the books. We feel group is solid and where we anticipated it to be. Our properties are running at record level occupancies and we continue to see the group booking window extend. As far as the cadence of performance in 2018, we anticipate the second half of the year being stronger than the first half. The first quarter will be our weakest, as a result of tough comps due to last year's inauguration and Women's March in D.C. and Easter weekend starting on March 30 this year. On the bottom line, our team continues to do a great job driving margin performance. And this is reflected in our 2018 comparable EBITDA margin guidance of negative 60 basis points at the low end and plus 20 basis points at the high end. Although we did a spectacular job on margins in 2017, that will be difficult to replicate in an operating environment with this level of employment. Having said that, we still have levers to pull internally through our enterprise analytics team, in addition to continued benefits we anticipate from the Marriott, Starwood integration. We would hope for breakeven margin performance around RevPAR growth of approximately 2%. Our 2018 guidance does not assume any acquisitions or dispositions, other than those I have discussed this morning, although we are continuing to work on several transactions that would fit our strategy. I would also point out that per our stated strategy of ultimately focusing solely on the U.S., we are exploring the sale of our international assets, including our interests in our European joint venture. While there is nothing to report at this time, it is an area we will be investigating throughout the course of the year. On the CapEx side, we anticipate spending between $475 million to $550 million this year, which is much closer to our historical average. Part of the increase from our 2017 spend of $277 million is a result of projects being pushed from late 2017 into 2018. In addition, we are undertaking a transformative repositioning at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis in the second half of the year, which is responsible for the majority of the $114 million we announced in our press release. This will be a complete reimagining of the hotel that we decided to bring forward from its previously-scheduled renovation date in 2020 in order to complete work ahead of what we expect will be a very strong market in 2019 and beyond. Any disruption related to the higher level of capital spend has been captured in the guidance we have provided today. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael who will discuss our operating performance and guidance as well as the recent changes we have made to our disclosure in much greater detail. Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you, Jim. Before we begin, I just wanted to say what a privilege it is to have joined Host and this team. We have some of the most talented and dedicated individuals in the space, and I'd particularly like to say thank you to those who helped me prepare for my first earnings call as Chief Financial Officer. With that, and before we review quarterly and full year performance, you'll notice that we have made some material changes to our disclosure, particularly as it relates to our financial supplement. Some of these changes were made simply to make it easier for you to find the information we had previously provided by putting it into one simple document. However, others were a significant step to providing more information and greater transparency into our operations in order to help the investment community better recognize and value the quality of this irreplaceable portfolio of world class hotels. To that end, we've incorporated new and expanded disclosure, including key performance metrics for our top 40 consolidated hotels, ranked by RevPAR, including: RevPAR; total RevPAR; and full year EBITDA for 2017. This top 40 represents over 60% of the company's total EBITDA, has a 2017 RevPAR of approximately $230, total RevPAR of nearly $350 and an EBITDA per key of $35,000, exemplifying a portfolio of hotels that we believe is the highest quality amongst our peers. We've also expanded the comparable hotels by locations, which you've seen previously, from 16 locations to 23 in our press release and financial supplement. This change was made to give you better insight into our submarkets, particularly as it relates to Florida, Manhattan, and CityCenterDC. We've included the same property detail for these markets as is provided for our top 40 assets. Finally, we have provided more detail about our financial obligations, including additional credit metrics and a summary of our ground leases. You can easily download this information from our website, by scrolling down to the black box at the bottom of every page of our website at HostHotels.com. Now, let me begin with a discussion of Host's financial performance by providing a discussion of the factors that led to our adjusted EBITDA outperformance as compared to the midpoint of our third quarter guidance. While comparable operations were approximately $3 million better than anticipated, there were three areas that provided the remaining outperformance. First, effective December 31, 2017, we adopted the new NAREIT guideline on EBITDAre and now have included the full EBITDA related to our consolidated partnerships, which increased our full year adjusted EBITDA by $10 million. And for the quarter, that would be $3 million. Second, certain one-time sources of income related to business interruption proceeds and gain on sale of the Chicago land benefited the full year adjusted EBITDAre by another $10 million. And third, the remaining increase of $11 million resulted mostly from a decrease in corporate expenses and accruals and favorable foreign exchange rates, offset by a slight decline in non-comparable operations. I will now expand on our quarterly and full year performance. As Jim mentioned, we were pleased with our fourth quarter results, driven by our strong leisure transient demand and better than expected group performance in October. Our leisure revenues increased 7% in the quarter and group revenues in October improved 5%, outperforming our expectations. For the full year, the performance was primarily driven by a 5% increase in leisure demand and a 16% increase in contract demand, as our managers strategically took on high-rated contract business in specific markets with new supply or softening demand concerns, such as San Francisco, New York, Orange County and Boston. For reference, the ADR in our contract business was over $200 in 2017. Our best performing domestic markets this quarter were Philadelphia, Jacksonville, San Antonio, Orlando, and New Orleans. RevPAR increases ranged from 7% to almost 16% from these markets. Generally, these markets benefited from strong group business from additional citywides in the quarter. The strength in group business led to double-digit food and beverage revenues growth ranging from 11% to 39% in these markets, except for San Antonio. In addition, the hotels in these markets, with the exception of Orlando, exceeded comparable STR upper-upscale market results by 150 to 550 basis points. Our more challenged markets were Miami, San Diego, Chicago, Washington D.C. and New York. RevPAR ranged from 0.1% to a decline of around 17% in Miami, where our Biscayne Bay Marriott suffered hurricane damage and approximately 230 rooms were out of service for the fourth quarter. All rooms were placed back in service by mid-January. You will recall that we kept this hotel in our comp set, despite the hurricane damage. Hotels in San Diego, Chicago and Washington D.C. were impacted by the large citywides in the quarter, resulting in a lack of compression to drive transient average rates and requiring the hotel to provide more discounts in rates to drive occupancy. It is also worth mentioning that in Washington D.C., the meeting space was under renovation at the Grand Hyatt, and the parking garage restoration at the Hyatt Capitol Hill further impacted group business in the fourth quarter. New York continues to be impacted from new supply and group weakness in the Times Square market as well as weaker international demand, overall contributing to underperformance as compared to our portfolio as a whole. Looking ahead to 2018, we expect Maui/Oahu, Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego to outperform our portfolio. Conversely, we anticipate Houston, Seattle, Atlanta, Washington D.C. and New York to underperform the portfolio. Moving to our profitability, we remain impressed by the exceptional job of our property managers and asset managers in bringing more profit to the bottom line. Comp total revenues increased 2% for the quarter. A 10 basis point increase in comparable hotel EBITDA margin is quite impressive. Our full year comparable hotel EBITDA margin improvement of 10 basis points is even more extraordinary, as full year total comparable revenues increased 0.7%. These are remarkable results in an environment with a 12 year low unemployment and rising labor costs. While these results will be difficult to replicate, we will continue to have a keen focus on various productivity and operational efficiency initiatives in 2018. We will continue to execute on productivity improvements through our time and motion studies at our medium and small hotels. Furthermore, we expect to garner cost savings from the Marriott, Starwood merger through lower OTA commissions, better procurement costs, technology integration synergies, lower workers' compensation expense, reduction in charge-out rates from the consolidation of the rewards program and reduced processing fees from the renegotiation of the credit card program, among others. Furthermore, we are encouraged by the strengthening macroeconomic conditions and the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that could drive additional demand from the higher-rated business transient customers. Combine this with the all-time high occupancy levels, a potential positive mix shift to the business transient customer could lead to a rate-driven increase in RevPAR, which would bode well for profitability. Having said that, the guidance we have provided today does not contemplate this. Let me discuss dividends for a moment. In January, we paid a regular fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share and a special cash dividend of $0.05 per share, bringing our total dividend for 2017 to $0.85, which represents a yield of approximately 4.4% on the current stock price. In addition, this represents the payout ratio of approximately 50% on our 2017 adjusted FFO per share. We have announced a first quarter 2018 dividend of $0.20 per share and continue our policy of paying on our taxable income. Let's talk about the balance sheet for a moment. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility. I believe we have one of the strongest balance sheets among our peers. We ended the year with about $4 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 4%, a weighted average maturity of five years and no debt maturities until 2020. Approximately 30% of our debt is floating and none of our consolidated hotels are encumbered by mortgage debt. We ended the year with approximately $913 million of cash and $822 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Today, our leverage ratio is 2.2 times, as calculated under the terms of our credit facility and after taking into effect the proceeds from the sale the Key Bridge Marriott, which we received in early January. We expect to close the Hyatt transaction in late first quarter, early second quarter, as Jim mentioned, which will be funded with cash and a draw on the credit facility revolver. Upon completion of the sale on the W New York hotel in the second quarter, we expect to use the proceeds to pay down a portion of the draw on the credit facility. After taking these transactions into consideration, we expect our leverage ratio to be at the low end of our stated target range of 2.5 times to 3.0 times. Let me take a few minutes to discuss some assumptions included in our 2018 guidance. In addition to the operating metrics provided in our press release and discussed by Jim, included in our guidance are three transactions : one, the acquisitions of the Hyatt portfolio for $1 billion by the end of the first quarter; number two, the sale of the Key Bridge Marriott for $190 million in January; and three, the sale of the W New York hotel for $190 million in the second quarter. No other acquisitions or dispositions have been included in our guidance. These transactions, along with the 2017 disposition and acquisition activity, led to a forecast net acquisition EBITDA increase of approximately $16 million in 2018. We expect this will be offset by an increase in our G&A and incremental disruption from the increased capital expenditures Jim referenced. The G&A increase, a one-time charge of $7 million relates to technology cost associated with the update and move over enterprise analytics platform and systems to the cloud. Furthermore, certain one-time sources of income related to business interruption proceeds and gain on the sale of Chicago land, which benefited 2017 adjusted EBITDA by $10 million, will not repeat in 2018. The combination of all these factors decreases our forecast 2018 adjusted EBITDA from 2017 by $10 million. Lastly, keep in mind that we generally earn 23% to 24% of our total EBITDA in the first quarter. To conclude, we are pleased with our strong operating results and completion of a large acquisition that is consistent with our strategic initiatives and financial discipline. Furthermore, we are delighted to introduce a more fulsome package of disclosure through our enhanced financial supplement. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To make sure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our first question today from Andy (sic) [Anthony]. Powell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning, everyone. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Morning, Anthony. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you for that correction on the name and congrats on the acquisitions. You mentioned that you're acquiring the assets at a 5% cap rate on 2018 EBITDA, but there's also some good near-term growth prospects in some of those markets. Could you talk about what you think the stabilized cap rate could be on the transactions after a couple years? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. We're looking at somewhere in the mid-6s. We're really bullish on these markets and these assets and, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, our ability to really get into the properties and bring our enterprise analytics platform to the table and our asset management expertise to just take a fresh look at how the hotels are being run. I'll give you a little more color on this, Anthony, but let me back up and just make one thing really crystal clear. These assets are great hotels. And we can talk about the metrics of each individual property in the markets that we're in. But as we sat back and said, okay, we sold $900 million of assets over the course of 2017 at a relatively low cap rate, $140 RevPAR in the aggregate, with high CapEx needs in slow growth markets. And when the opportunity to acquire these three hotels presented itself in the markets that they're in and our familiarity with the markets, we said, wow, this is a really terrific opportunity to effectively recycle capital. And we had the cash on the balance sheet. We have a great relationship with Hyatt. We feel that we could add value to this portfolio on many different levers. One thing that we didn't talk about with respect to the assets that I think is actually quite critical is based on our allocation of value, the cost per key for each hotel. So the Andaz Maui at a cost per key just slightly under $1.3 million, we think is really attractive. I don't know if you know the hotel, Anthony. I would encourage you to take a trip to Maui and go see it. I don't think I have to provide too much encouragement there. But it is a fantastic property and it sits next to the Marriott Wailea, then the Four Seasons, then the Grand Wailea and then our Kea Lani Palace. So one of the things that really gave us an advantage across the entire portfolio is our experience in each of these markets and the fact that we had iconic Hyatt hotels in both markets and have the ability to collaborate and centralize services, in this instance between the Hyatt Ka'anapali, and the Andaz in San Francisco between the Hyatt Burlingame and the Grand Hyatt Union Square. So we are just really excited and delighted to have the opportunity to acquire these assets. They are truly one of a kind, iconic properties in very fast growing markets and markets that we're very familiar with, and they underwrite. That's the other part of the story. I could talk about capital recycling, but as a first step in any acquisition we adhere to our discipline that you've heard me talk about many times over the course of 2017. The first step is to develop a 10-year pro forma taking into account all the CapEx needs that we believe are appropriate in a 10-year plan, and then making realistic assumptions about the near-term performance of these assets, looking at revenue generators and expense savings and building out a pro forma that also is reflective of the cyclicality of the industry that we're in, looking at a reasonable exit cap rate on the back-end and discounting those unlevered cash flows back to target a return over our cost of capital of 100 basis points to 150 basis points. So that's the first screen that we look at on any deal and we looked at it on this deal and it passed muster. I can't say it enough times. We're really delighted. We have a great relationship with Hyatt. They are great to collaborate with and we've always worked with Hyatt in partnership. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now move to our next question today from Smedes Rose from Citi. Please go ahead. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask you, you mentioned in your guidance, you're including some disruption associated with the Marriott Marquis in San Francisco. Could you quantify that a little bit and kind of maybe talk about the timing of the improvements there in relationship to the Moscone Center coming back online next year? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Smedes. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we had contemplated renovating Moscone, not renovating, but reinventing and transforming a great asset in a great market in 2020. And then of course we all know what's happening in San Francisco next year. I think the last I looked, there was about 1.6 million group room nights on the books being generated by Moscone. And we balanced and did the analysis of should we renovate this year or should we wait into 2020. We think 2020 is going to be another terrific year in San Francisco. So we made a decision to pull the renovation forward and to put us in a position so that we can participate in the growth in San Francisco with a really truly reinvented hotel, which we believe will allow us to significantly increase our yield index in the property and drive more cash flow to the bottom line. The incremental disruption this year as a result of doing that, which is already included in our guidance, is about $5 million. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We will now go to our next question from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. One of the key changes to your release was the increased disclosures around the top 40 hotels. Can you just talk about that a little bit more and if any hotels you just want to highlight, that'd be helpful? Thank you. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I just think, Thomas, as we talk again, listening to the sell-side and the buy-side, your thirst for greater transparency, greater disclosure, giving you the opportunity to better understand the company and the assets that we have and how they perform, we listened, we heard, we provided. And really, at this point in time, it's nothing more than that. I think that the top 40 provide a really good picture of the quality of this company, the quality of the EBITDA, the valuation of those assets. Take the Kea Lani Palace, which is on Maui, which is the top asset in our portfolio; we didn't provide EBITDA per key, but you can certainly do the math. And if you do the math, you'll see that the Kea Lani Palace is generating $90,000 per key of EBITDA. So, I just don't know how many folks really had a good handle on the performance of these top 40 hotels and we thought it was important to highlight them. Additionally, as Michael mentioned, we also provided seven additional markets to give you a bit more granular look into Florida, as an example, where we have properties on the West Coast. We have properties in Orlando. We have properties on the East Coast. So the various submarkets in Florida, now you're going to be able to have a better gauge on what's coming out of each of those markets and how they're performing. And I think we truly are being very transparent here. I mean, we put a list in of our ground leases, our capital structure, debt statistics, so it's all in one place. You can go find it. You can download the information. And we're happy to answer questions. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Perfect. I'm sure we'll have a lot. Thank you. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I know you will. Operator : Thank you. We'll go to our next question now from Harry Curtis from Nomura. Please go ahead. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Good morning. A quick question on the $1 billion of investment, is there a much incremental ROIC CapEx that you expect in this portfolio? And related to that, if the answer is no, as you look ahead, do you think that you'll be seeking incremental acquisitions that really don't require the kind of CapEx that, say, The Phoenician has? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. Harry, it's a two part question. So let me answer the first part of your question and then we can talk about the second part. Obviously, as we underwrote this deal and evaluated the transaction, we identified certain ROI opportunities. As an example, at the Andaz Maui, part of the consideration includes an entitled parcel of land at the property to add 19 villa units. Now, we bought the land. It's a dead asset. We're paying real estate taxes on the land. We haven't underwritten the value that we would derive from developing those 19 units. And I think we've got a pretty good track record here, given what we've accomplished at The Phoenician. So we're excited about that one. There are other opportunities at the Andaz. As an example just putting a luau in place, those are real moneymakers. We have that experience up at the Hyatt Ka'anapali. At the Grand San Francisco, we will look at the opportunity to add eight keys to that property. We're looking at the re-concepting of the restaurant and room service. So, yeah, there are opportunities around all these hotels. Those are things that we didn't underwrite in the context of the acquisition. With respect to other assets that are out there that we're evaluating, we're not far enough long at this point on any additional acquisition for me to give you color around capital needs, capital spend, but the one thing I can assure you is that that's all taken into consideration in our underwriting. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Very good. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll now go to our next question from Shaun Kelly from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning, everyone. Jim or Michael, I think one of your peers yesterday discussed a little bit about possible sale disruptions at some of the Marriott hotels. Is that something you could comment on, just given that you guys have a lot of exposure there and you're probably the best to kind of give us your insights? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Shaun, are you talking about the integration of the Starwood Hotels into the Marriott platform. Is that.... Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : ...exactly, that was the context. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we've been working closely with Marriott since the day they announced that they were acquiring Starwood. And there is always a little bit of uncertainty early in the process as the two programs are migrated together. We are very comfortable with the direction that this is taking. And not only are we comfortable with it, we're excited about it. Because when the Starwood legacy hotels that we own are merged into the Marriott sales system, we expect to see increases in revenue, increases in yield index going forward. So we've been on it from day one and it's not a concern to us. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So nothing specific on the sales organizations or anything that's changed in the last couple of months as it relates to trying to combine, whether it group sales efforts or anything else? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: They're putting new leadership in place. I mean, this is actually a question probably better asked to Marriott, but I can tell you that they're putting new leadership in place. They are putting the organization in place. They are putting the final bells and whistles on it and about ready to tie a bow here. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Easy enough. Thank you very much. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. We'll now move to our next question from Rich Hightower from Evercore. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Hey, morning, guys. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Morning, Rich. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : I just want to go back to some of the prepared comments around business transient commentary and I think we've been hearing a pretty consistent message for some time now that even though there's broad-based optimism on the part of corporate entities and CEOs, we're not seeing that show up necessarily in the demand patterns. And I'm curious as to why you think that might be happening. Is it just a function of kind of a choppy calendar for the first part of the year? Is there something else underlying that? I mean, what's Host's broader perspective on why we're not seeing that yet? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Rich, I think that the statistic that we follow with respect to the business traveler and group business is really business investment. And business investment for 2016 was negative 50 basis points. For 2017, it was 4.6%. For 2018, as of February, the forecast is 5.6%, so it's trending in the right direction. And I think that over the course of 2017, in particular, there was a lot of uncertainty out there regarding whether or not we were going to have a tax bill. There was uncertainty just generally given what was happening in Washington, D.C. I think that now that the tax bill's in place, corporations are still digesting what the bill means to them. But I can tell you that the commentary that we have is people are feeling much better about the economy. They're feeling better about spending money and investing. And when they feel better about investing, that means that they're going to travel, and they're going to come back to our hotels. So in past cycles, we have seen business travel, business transient accelerate when the business investment forecast gets up about 8%. So we're moving in the right direction, and that's why we're cautiously optimistic. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : One quick follow-up there, do you think that timing-wise, I mean, maybe after the Easter comp gets out of the way, that we would start to see some of the fruits of what you're talking about really show up in the numbers or we just don't have an idea yet? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I wish I could tell you yes. If I thought that, Rich, I wouldn't be holding back on you. I'd put it in our guidance. It's just too soon to tell. I think we saw a January that was stronger than we anticipated, based on budgets that were completed in November. We had a 300 basis point swing in January, from minus 1% to plus 2%. And that gives you a high degree of comfort, but I think it's too early to bake an acceleration of RevPAR as a result of the return of the business traveler into our numbers this year. One month doesn't make a trend. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Got it. Thanks, Jim. Operator : Thank you. We'll now go to our next question from Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, guys, and welcome aboard, Michael. Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : If I can squeak in maybe a two-parter, just first one was just what details can you share about the key terms of the management agreement with Hyatt for the three-pack that you guys purchased, just curious what you can talk about there? And then, maybe as a second question, I think there's long been a perception that Host has a segment of its portfolio in hotels that may be submarket dominant, but ultimately have lower growth prospects or have capital needs down the road, for example, airport or suburban hotels. Do you see this as a good moment to look at monetizing those sorts of assets or do you feel that they may be providing some earnings stability for the company? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Jeff, I'll answer your second question first. We have no systematic disposition plan in place for this year. I think that over the course of 2017, you saw us opportunistically sell hotels for a variety of reasons. And this year, of course, we've announced that we're going to sell the W Lex. So we're constantly looking at opportunities to dispose of assets that are in slower growth markets with higher CapEx needs and lower RevPAR assets. Are we sitting here today saying that we're going to package up $2 billion or $3 billion? We're not saying that. And the reason we're not saying it is because we really like what we own today. And we continue to invest in our assets. There's obviously a differential between capital allocation to an asset like The Fairmont Kea Lani or the Hyatt Ka'anapali or the San Francisco Marriott Moscone (sic) [Marquis] relative to a suburban hotel. But there is nothing on the table right now to suggest that we're going to just blow out a bunch of those properties. With respect to the management contract, I would tell you it's a market contract. The terms are proprietary. And really, it's a long-term contract, but beyond that, I really am not in a position to comment on it. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. We'll now go to our next question from Gregory Miller from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead. Gregory J. Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Morning, Greg. Gregory J. Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Morning. I'm on the line for Patrick Scholes. Could you elaborate on your views of potentially disposing some of your international assets, particularly in an environment of recent RevPAR strength in some of the regions? Thanks. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, as we discussed, we sold our assets in New Zealand. We sold the Hilton Melbourne last year, which took us out of both Australia and New Zealand. And there had been another Four Points that we owned in Perth, Australia that we sold a couple of years ago, several years ago. We have three hotels in Brazil, one in Mexico and two in Canada, as well as our interest in our European JV. So from our perspective again, it's we start with the fundamentals. And the fundamental is what do we think asset's worth to us versus what is the market prepared to pay us for it. And that's the screen that we do on every asset, whether it's international or in the U.S. So, of course, if we are looking at the potential exit of an investment in a market where RevPAR is accelerating, we'll take that into consideration when we determine what we think the whole value is of that hotel. Gregory J. Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. We'll now move to our next question from Robin Farley from UBS. Unknown Speaker : Hi, guys, this is actually Raffi on for Robin. Just had two quick questions, first on group, what was the group pace in the quarter for 2018 and 2019? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I'm sorry, the current group pace for 2018? We have... Raffi Bhardwaj - UBS Securities LLC : In the quarter, yeah. Yeah, for 2018 and 2019. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I think that group pace has been around 2% in the quarter for 2018. 2019, I don't have that number in front of me. We're really focused on 2018 right now, but it's probably around the same, I would think, at this point. Raffi Bhardwaj - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then, the last one is since kind of this overhang of the uncertainty over tax reform has kind of cleared up, what have you kind of seen in the change of behavior from buyers and sellers out there in the transaction market? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, frankly, over the course of 2017, we underwrote a number of transactions that would fit the profile of asset that we would like to own. We obviously weren't able to come to terms with a transaction that underwrote to our requirements. This year, we're hearing that there may be a few more assets of this ilk coming to market. Nothing's in the market right now. I talked recently with an investor who owns some high-end hotels, of course, to gauge this individual's interest as to whether or not they might want to consider talking to us about selling them, and the response was given the interest rate environment that we're in, we just put 15-year financing on the properties and we're really not interested in disposing. So I think that you'll see owners of hotels become sellers of hotels if they have unique reasons to do so. And one of the unique reasons that Hyatt had was that they're going to asset-light. And they announced on their call last quarter, that they intended to sell $1.5 billion of hotels. So there has to be, I think, a particular reason why someone today would decide that it's time to sell when financing markets are still relatively attractive. Raffi Bhardwaj - UBS Securities LLC : All right. That's great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll now go to our next question from Chris Woronka from Deutsche Bank. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys, and appreciate the expanded disclosures. Wanted to ask you the Starwood, Marriott question, but from a different angle, which is, we've heard that they are continuing to kind of cull the portfolio and I know that's a lot of Sheratons and maybe few other things. To the extent that you guys maybe have a little bit of visibility into that, what do you think the net impact on you competitively is in terms of where some of those assets end up versus the markets that they might be in where you have overlap? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: When you say cull, Chris, are you talking about Marriott's disposing of the real estate that they acquired in the purchase? Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No, more kind of on the Sheraton side. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Oh, I got it. Yeah. I got it. In terms of pushing Sheratons that have not been properly renovated out of the system. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, correct. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Today, we are down to four Sheraton hotels in the U.S. We own : the Sheraton in Boston, on the Back Bay; the Sheraton, New York; the Sheraton in San Diego; and the Sheraton in Parsippany. So from our perspective, I don't think that the culling process in and of itself is going to impact us negatively. Of course, it's going to be much better for us once the Sheraton brand standards are reinvented and pushed out to the system. And I think Marriott is really making great progress on that front. It's going to take them some time to make this happen. But I think they're very dedicated to fixing Sheraton. Starwood had tried a number of times and really couldn't seem to get to the finish line. So we're supportive of it. And anything we can do to improve the performance of our asset and the guest perception of our asset, I think is a plus. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, very good. Thanks, Jim. Operator : Thank you. That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jim Risoleo, President and CEO. Please go ahead. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you for joining us on the call today. We are very pleased with our 2017 results and excited about the strategic transactions we have announced. We look forward to discussing first quarter results and how the year is progressing on our next call. Have a great day, everyone. Operator : Thank you. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts, Incorporated First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Gee Lingberg - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts first quarter 2018 earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our first quarter results and our outlook for 2018. Michael Bluhm, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide details on our first quarter performance by markets, discuss margins, and the balance sheet. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you, Gee, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report a quarter that materially exceeded our internal expectations on the top and bottom line and beat consensus estimates for adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per diluted share. Based on this performance, we are raising our full year guidance for RevPAR, adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per share. For the full year, we have increased the midpoint of our comparable RevPAR guidance 50 basis points to 2%, increased the midpoint of adjusted EBITDAre by $25 million to $1.525 billion, and increased the midpoint of adjusted FFO per share by $0.05 to $1.70. These results continue to demonstrate the benefits of our geographically-diversified portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels, our unprecedented scale and platform to drive internal and external growth, and the power and flexibility of our investment-grade balance sheet. Together, these key pillars formed the foundation of Host, the premier lodging REIT. As mentioned in our press release, we closed on the previously-discussed three-hotel portfolio of iconic Hyatt properties on March 29. Recycling out of low RevPAR, low growth, and high CapEx assets into these high RevPAR, high growth, and low CapEx hotels at roughly the same cap rate with an outstanding use of capital and instantly upgraded the overall portfolio. Although still early in our ownership, the Hyatt portfolio is performing above our initial underwriting. Keep in mind, this is before we begin implementing many of the value enhancement initiatives we identified in our underwriting. We are encouraged by early results and look forward to enhancing performance and value at these fantastic properties. Looking forward, we are maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation and are not including any additional purchases in our revised full-year guidance. We anticipate closing on the previously-announced sale of the W New York this month for $190 million. Please note that we have included one additional asset sale in our revised guidance for 2018. This sale will result in the expected loss of $6 million of EBITDA. As it relates to investing in our portfolio, we spent approximately $115 million on CapEx in the first quarter, which is consistent with our plan to spend between $475 million to $550 million this year on total CapEx. The most notable repositioning projects include the completion at The Phoenician and the start of a comprehensive renovation at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis, in addition to significant facade and other work occurring at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples Beach Resort. As I mentioned, our first quarter exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom line, particularly given the difficult comparison of 3.8% domestic RevPAR growth in quarter one 2017, which benefited from the inauguration and Women's March in Washington, D.C. These results are a testament to Host's scale and platform, particularly our asset management and enterprise analytics teams. While Michael will describe the quarter in greater detail, here are some of the highlights. While we expected to see some impact from the Passover holiday shift from April to March, and the earlier timing of the Easter holiday, transient demand significantly exceeded our expectations to the upside. As a result, on a constant currency basis, comparable hotel RevPAR improved 1.7% in the first quarter to $177, driven by a 170 basis point increase in occupancy, partially offset by a 60 basis point decrease in average rate. For the quarter, occupancy for our comparable hotel properties was 77.6%, the highest first quarter occupancy for the company in more than 15 years. This translated into adjusted EBITDAre of $370 million for the quarter and adjusted FFO per share of $0.43; both were significantly above consensus estimates. Transient demand increased 5.2% in the quarter, some of which was due to the holiday shift, but materially higher than we anticipated. Although average rate was relatively flat, this consistent demand throughout the first quarter resulted in transient revenues increasing 5.2%. As mentioned on our last call, we begin to see signs that business travel was picking up in the fourth quarter of 2017. This positive trend accelerated in the first quarter, and we estimate that both business travel revenue for the comparable portfolio grew over 6.5%. This growth occurred in most markets and was driven largely by the consulting, technology, and pharma sectors. While it is a bit early to predict where this trend is going for the remainder of 2018, we are optimistic that business travel will continue to strengthen over the course of the year and we will be monitoring this segment closely. As we anticipated, our group business was impacted by difficult comparisons in Washington, D.C. and Houston, which benefited from the Super Bowl last year. In addition, the earlier timing of the Passover and Easter holidays impacted group demand, as these holidays are typically weaker for group demand and stronger on the transient side. For the quarter, group revenue decreased 3.5% due to these events and holiday shifts. We expect group business to rebound in the second quarter as these calendar items abate. As we look to the remainder of the year, our group booking pace is strong, with group revenues up 4.5%. The fourth quarter of this year looks to be the strongest quarter with group revenue 6.5% ahead of last year. Overall, our group revenue pace is up approximately 2.2% to where we were at the same time last year. With approximately 85% of our group revenues on the books for 2018 and occupancies at all-time highs, we continue to see the booking window extend. As was the story in 2017, we continue to do a great job improving profitability at our properties and driving comparable EBITDA margin growth. In the first quarter, comparable EBITDA margins grew 60 basis points. We received a one-time tax rebate at the Westin Grand Central in New York, which positively impacted margins by 28 basis points. The balance of the margin lift was a result of increased productivity, strict cost controls, continued utility reductions as a result of sustainability investments and an increase in ancillary revenues. I should point out that we had made over $170 million in sustainable investments since 2015 and are achieving combined annual saving yield in excess of 14% on those investments. We also received numerous awards and recognitions in this area, including the 2017 NAREIT Leader in the Light award. We are committed to sustainable business practices and happy to be recognized for our achievements. Our asset management and enterprise analytics groups continue to be focused on driving cash flow to the bottom line. A 32 basis point improvement in margin on comparable hotel revenue growth of 1.5% is a testament to their efforts. To further enhance our analytic capabilities, we entered into an agreement with IBM Research, to leverage IBM's artificial intelligence expertise. This will allow us to improve our predictive capabilities by extracting insights from both structured and unstructured information. This is another example of taking advantage of our scale and access to information to develop leading-edge technologies and processes to drive long-term investment returns. This combination of better-than-expected first quarter results and increased macroeconomic optimism is driving the across-the-board raise to our full-year guidance. The global economy continues to exhibit strength and appears supportive of industry growth. The economic indicators we closely follow, corporate profits and nonresidential fixed investments continue to remain strong. As mentioned earlier, the pickup in business transient travel is positive and gives us further reason to be optimistic. Leisure demand continues to be strong, given record levels of consumer confidence. We also began to see some improvements in international travel to the U.S. in the first quarter. Although, this is a smaller part of our overall business, improved international visitation should bode well for demand in some of our major gateway markets. As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our comparable RevPAR growth guidance by 50 basis points to 2% on a revised range of 1.5% to 2.5%. This is predicated on our continued belief that the first quarter will be the weakest quarter of the year and that the second half of the year should be stronger than the first. The support for this outlook is the visibility provided by solid group pace for the remaining three quarters of 2018. Correspondingly, we are anticipating comparable EBITDA margins of minus 10 to plus 30 basis points based on our revised RevPAR range. At the new midpoint of 2% RevPAR growth, we expect EBITDA margin growth of 10 basis points, an increase of 10 basis points from our prior guidance. 2018 adjusted EBITDAre has been raised by $25 million at the midpoint to $1.525 billion on a revised range of $1.505 billion to $1.545 billion. I would point out that this increase would have been higher by $6 million if we had not included the expected loss related to the unidentified disposition that I discussed earlier. Therefore, the $25 million full-year increase in EBITDAre includes our $17 million first quarter beat versus consensus estimates, an additional $14 million increase over the balance of the year less the expected loss of $6 million from the unidentified disposition. We are increasing 2018 adjusted FFO per share by $0.05 at the midpoint to $1.70 on a revised range of $1.67 to $1.73. We are anticipating continued improvement for the remainder of the year relative to our budgets, which were completed in December 2017. In closing, we are pleased with our beat-and-raise quarter, as it continues to demonstrate the attributes of our premier lodging REIT. A diversified portfolio of irreplaceable assets, our unmatched scale and platform, and our investment-grade balance sheet positions us well to continue to outperform our peers in the near, medium, and long term. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael, who will discuss our operating performance and our balance sheet in much greater detail. Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you, Jim. Good morning everyone. As Jim mentioned, we had an outstanding first quarter with impressive beats to our internal top and bottom line results as well as consensus estimates, enabling us to increase guidance meaningfully for the full year. Comparable RevPAR increased 1.7% driven by an occupancy increase of 170 basis points, and comparable EBITDA margins expanded by 60 basis points. Before getting into some of the details of our corporate performance, let me provide some operational results in our top markets for the quarter. Our best-performing domestic markets this quarter were Philadelphia, the Florida Gulf Coast, Maui, and Oahu. RevPAR increases range from 10% to 16% in these markets, generally benefiting from strong transient business exhibited by the double-digit transient revenue increases in these markets that range from 11% to over 26%. Our hotels in Philadelphia significantly outperformed our portfolio this quarter with RevPAR growth of 16%, exceeding Smith Travel Research upper-upscale results by 190 basis points. Our hotels benefited from the post-renovation ramp at The Logan Hotel, the NFL Playoffs, and the parade that resulted from winning the Super Bowl. Group and transient revenues increased 7% and 17%, respectively, and the hotels grew average rate by 6.5%. The RevPAR growth at our Florida Gulf Coast hotels exceeded our expectations with an impressive increase of 11.6% in a market where the STR upper-upscale results decreased by 30 basis points. Our iconic and irreplaceable hotels, such as The Ritz-Carlton in Naples, benefited from demand generated by the rooms out of service in the Caribbean and the Florida Keys because of hurricanes last year. Our hotels had a strong average rate growth of 9%. It's worth noting that the transient average daily rate at our Ritz-Carlton resort in Naples is over $1,000 for the quarter, an increase of over 10% last year. In Maui and Oahu, our iconic hotels, including our top RevPAR asset, the Fairmont Kea Lani in Wailea, grew RevPAR 9.7% in the quarter and exceeded the STR upper-upscale results by 680 basis points. The growth was driven by an 8.4% improvement in average rate and 110 basis point increase in occupancy. Our hotels in this market experienced both strong transient and group business, which improved 10.7% and 5.6%, respectively. Demand continues to be strong for our Hawaiian assets, providing our managers the ability to grow rate at our hotels. I would also point out that even though they are non-comp, two of the three Hyatt assets we recently acquired were in Maui and the Florida Gulf Coast, two of the top performing markets this quarter. Host, not unlike the overall industry, experienced challenges in the quarter in Washington, D.C., Houston, and San Antonio. While RevPAR at our hotels declined from 7% to 17.4%, these results outperformed our expectations and the hotels in Houston and San Antonio markets experienced better than expected transient demand. RevPAR at our hotels in Washington, D.C. declined 17.4% this quarter, with a 400 basis point decline in occupancy and a 13% decline in average rate. As is well known at this point, city-wide events last year, such as the inauguration and the Women's March in Washington, D.C. provided for difficult year-over-year comparisons at our hotels this quarter. In Houston, while RevPAR decreased 9%, the results exceeded our expectations due to stronger than expected transient demand. It was encouraging to see transient demand growth of 3.4% this quarter. However, our hotels were impacted by the decline in group revenues as our hotels posted high-rate Super Bowl groups last year. Interestingly, excluding Washington, D.C. and Houston, comparable RevPAR for our portfolio for the quarter would have been up 3.8%. Our hotels in San Antonio experienced a RevPAR decline of 7% in the first quarter as weaker city-wide contributed to the declining group business. However, based on the improved group bookings through the remainder of the year for San Antonio, we expect these hotels in this market to outperform the portfolio as a whole for the rest of the year. Looking at our forecast for the full year, we expect Miami, Philadelphia, and San Antonio to outperform our portfolio. Conversely, we anticipate Washington, D.C., Houston, and Atlanta to underperform. Moving to our profitability and margin performance, we remain impressed by the exceptional job of our property and asset managers in bringing more profit to the bottom line. Adjusted EBITDAre exceeded our internal estimates at $370 million this quarter, which was $17 million or 5% above consensus estimates. In addition, adjusted FFO per share exceeded our internal estimates at $0.43 and was $0.03 or 7.5% above consensus estimates this quarter. As Jim noted, comparable hotel margins were up 60 basis points in the first quarter with 28 basis points of that a result of a one-time tax rebate in New York at the Westin Grand Central. This rebate was an exchange for the investments we made to reposition the property. However, removing that one-time item, margins were still up 32 basis points on comparable hotel revenue of 1.5%, which is remarkable. We saw continued productivity improvements as room productivity improved 1.4% in the quarter. A primary driver of those results came from Marriott's Green Choice initiative which, we believe, still has room to improve going forward. We also witnessed the increased F&B productivity improvement as an additional eight hotels restructured their room service programs. Finally, we saw continued savings from our time and motion studies, although the year-over-year benefit was less impactful on the overall portfolio because we're moving the studies to our small- and medium-sized hotels. Additionally, undistributed operating expenses remained well below inflation at only 50 basis points, aiding margin improvement throughout the quarter. For instance, utility expenses remain low, increasing only 30 basis points for the quarter. This result was partially due to the benefits from our continued efforts to implement energy ROI-saving projects. Other departmental revenue was also a contributor to margin outperformance this quarter as we saw a pickup in high margin ancillary revenues and cancellation fees. Cancellation fees were up primarily from group cancellations at only five properties, but we also witnessed increases in transient cancellation. With attrition flat in the quarter, this speaks positively to the overall customer demand and also indicates continued customer adoption of the longer cancellation windows our managers have been implementing across the portfolio. Speaking of booking trends, travel agent commissions declined in the quarter, providing 10 basis points in the margin benefit. Notably, during the first quarter, we saw direct bookings grow more than OTAs since Marriott introduced its book direct initiative in early 2016. This is an encouraging trend at the end, demonstrates that customer habits are evolving, which is great as the customer acquisition costs are materially lower than what people book through Marriott.com. Moving to our dividend, in April, we paid a regular first quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of approximately 4% on our current stock price. In addition, this represents a payout ratio of 47% on our adjusted AFFO per share. We did not repurchase any shares in 2018 but have $500 million of capacity available under the current repurchase program, and used as one of the tools in our toolkit to create enhanced shareholder value at the appropriate point in time. Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility as we are the only lodging REIT with an investment-grade balance sheet. The advantage of our strong balance sheet was clearly demonstrated in the efficient execution of our $1 billion acquisition of the Hyatt portfolio. As you'll recall, there was a tremendous increase in stock market volatility around the time we went under contract on that acquisition, which we believe hindered potential buyers. Host's liquidity and investment-grade balance sheet was a key differentiator of our ability to perform, thus, enabling us to secure that iconic portfolio of assets from Hyatt. At March 31, 2018, we had cash of $323 million and $511 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Total debt was $4.3 billion with an average maturity of 4.8 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%. In addition, we have no debt maturity until 2020. Our leverage ratio is approximately 2.7 times as calculated under the terms of our credit facility. We intend to use the net proceeds from the W New York sale and the newly-announced, unidentified asset sale to repay outstanding amounts under our credit facility or for general corporate purposes. We have the only investment-grade balance sheet in the lodging REIT space, which we are committed to maintain as it is a prominent differentiator to our peers and provides flexibility to take advantage of value-creation opportunities throughout the cycle. Lastly, as you model and forecast out the remainder of 2018, please keep in mind that we generally earn 29% to 30% of our total adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our strong operating results, which enabled us to increase our guidance across the board for the year. Furthermore, we are excited to close on the $1 billion acquisition of three Hyatt hotels and plug them into our industry-leading enterprise analytics and asset management platform. Overall, our performance continues to demonstrate that owning a portfolio of iconic, irreplaceable, and geographically diversified hotels, having the scale and platform to drive value, combined with a powerful investment-grade balance sheet is a strong strategic position to deliver significant value to our stockholders over the long term. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To be sure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : And first from Barclays, we'll hear from Anthony Powell. Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Morning, Anthony. Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Morning. Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Morning. Could you talk about your capital allocation priorities for the rest of the year? Are you seeing attractive acquisition opportunities in the market? And given the increase in merger activity in the space in recent years, are public company acquisitions a more realistic possibility for you right now? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: That's a multiple-part question, Anthony. Let me break it down a little bit for you as I answer it. First of all, I would tell you that we're not seeing a large amount of individual or portfolio acquisition opportunities that fit our profile. And when I say fit our profile, I'm not only talking about the nature of the asset, but I'm talking about the disciplined way in which we underwrite these potential investment opportunities. So, that's one of the reasons why we didn't include any additional acquisitions in our guidance for the balance of the year. Of course, we're still looking at opportunities as they present themselves, and we're trying to get out ahead of the pack and bring to bear the attributes of the company and our scale and our access to information, and the fact that we do have an investment-grade balance sheet as opportunities present themselves. On the M&A front, I would say that, as I've said in the past, we are very open-minded and we evaluate all opportunities to enhance NAV, and we'll continue to think about our strategy in that context going forward. Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Next question will come from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Good morning, Chris. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. I wanted to ask about some of the changes that have come into play recently with some of the cancellation policies. I guess both Marriott and Hilton and \u2013 do you think those are beginning to have a more sustainable positive impact on rate growth and revenue management, given that the booking window has continued to extend out? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: We're very pleased with the implementation of the new cancellation policies. We have seen a, clearly, have seen a difference in booking patterns at the hotels. And most importantly, we're delighted that our property managers are enforcing the policies. We saw an uptick in cancellation fees in quarter one. It wasn't across the portfolio, it really dealt with the groups at five different hotels. But to be able to collect cancellation fees from groups, that is really something new. And we're also seeing it happen with the transient customer as well. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Very good. Thanks, Jim. Operator : Next from BTIG, we'll hear from Jim Sullivan. James Sullivan - BTIG LLC : Good morning, guys. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Hey, Jim. James Sullivan - BTIG LLC : Jim, I wonder if you could comment about New York. The results were pretty decent in the quarter. And kind of two-part question here. What's your outlook for the balance of the year in that market? And secondly, in connection with that, do you have any read on international inward bound traffic trends, either in the quarter or currently? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: A couple questions. All right. With respect to international inbound, we did see a pickup on international inbound. And in conversations we've had with Marriott International, they've seen a pickup of about 13%. So, our total of our book of business, and it's spread across various gateway markets, New York being one of them, we generate about 10% of our business from international travel. So, we expect that that will help us not only in New York but in some of the other gateway markets where we operate, such as San Francisco, Miami, Los Angeles, and Seattle as well. With respect to New York, Jim, I think our take on the city is, yes, we did see a pickup in the first quarter. We saw a nice bump in demand. We did see business travel return to our New York markets. However, there is still a lot of supply coming online this year and a lot of supply coming online next year. So, I would not anticipate seeing a material acceleration in performance in New York in 2018. James Sullivan - BTIG LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Hi. Morning, guys. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Morning, Rich. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Thanks for taking the question here. So, I just want to go back to one of the prepared comments on the pickup in business transient during the quarter and the balance for the rest of the year. So it seems like demand is getting unambiguously stronger, but pricing was a little soft. Is that just sort of a timing issue? There's usually a lag between demand and pricing power, and if that's the case, is there any sort of ADR pickup in transient demand folded in the guidance at this point? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. Rich, I had a little bit of a difficult time hearing you. I think your question was related to the pickup in business demand in \u2013 if I could paraphrase it, tell me if I'm on the right track here. When is rate going to fall off? Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Yeah. That's generally correct. And then, how much of that is baked in the guidance as well? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, we have seen in the first quarter business transient demand pick up in really across the board but mainly in a handful of markets. We saw business demand pick up in Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Denver, and San Diego. And with respect to the rate, we continue to look at corporate profits, and we continue to look at the business investment number, or non-fixed residential investment number, which is strong and has been increasing over the last several years. That's a pretty good indicator from our perspective of what's going to happen with the business traveler. So in the first quarter in particular, while business demand room nights was up, as I mentioned, our group pace was down predominantly as a result of the holiday shifts, as a result of Easter and Passover shifting, and group business going down. So, we were not in a position in Q1 to really drive rate and yield the business traveler. We are hopeful that that will change over the course of the year. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thanks for that, Jim. Would you say that any such pickup is reflected in guidance at this point? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: No, it's not, Rich. As I mentioned, we're optimistic but \u2013 and we're going to be tracking business travel very closely over the balance of the year, but while I'd like to say that one quarter makes a trend, we're not ready to predict that just yet. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : All right. Great. Thanks for that, Jim. Operator : Moving on, we have Michael Bellisario from Baird. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Hey, Mike. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Just want to go back to the first question on capital allocation. Maybe can you share your thoughts on the assets and portfolios that you have seen transact? And then maybe how has that changed the way you think about monetizing more of your assets or maybe selling some of the lower-tier properties within your portfolio? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, of course, we track every deal in the market even if it's not an asset that we may be interested in acquiring. So, we're getting a fairly good sense of what's happening on the acquisition side, the bid-ask between buyers and sellers and the debt capital markets are strong. So, as we sit back and think about what does that mean to us, I'll start with a premise that we're very comfortable with the portfolio that we have today. That said, we would certainly be opportunistic sellers if we could achieve pricing on an asset or group of assets that exceeds our hold value. We look at every hotel at least on an annual basis, if not, more frequently to draw a point of view of what that asset is worth to us. And if we see the pendulum swinging in a way that we may be able to meaningfully beat those hold values, then of course, we would take advantage of that opportunity. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Next from Citi, we have Smedes Rose. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. You mentioned in your opening remarks that the trends in the leisure markets were strong in the first quarter, and some of it, I think, was related to displacement from markets being out of service. I mean, when you talk to the operators, do you have a sense of how much of the incremental demand is that versus just continued strong trends from organic leisure growth? And I guess what I'm kind of wondering is, are we setting up for just sort of a really tough comp as those other markets come back online? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Smedes, I don't think we're setting ourselves up for a tough comp as other markets come online. Are the markets you're referring to the Caribbean and the Florida Keys in particular? Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Well, just the Caribbean in general. Post-hurricane, there's a lot of rooms out of service, and there's been a lot of negative headlines around Mexico. And I'm just wondering if you're saying \u2013 if we're just moving people from those places to your resorts, which is great, but I'm just wondering how sustainable is that? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I think that, as we think about transient revenues in the first quarter, roughly \u2013 our rough breakdown is \u2013 if you think about our segmentation at the top line, we're roughly 40% group, 55% transient, 5% contract. Of the transient base, about 40% of that is leisure and about 50% is business, and about 10% is government. So, if you break it down from that perspective, we saw a pickup in leisure business, and we saw a pickup in business transient traveler really across the board. I mean, the markets that drove leisure for us in the quarter, in addition to the Florida Gulf Coast, were Maui, Phoenix, and Orlando. And as I mentioned before, the markets that really drove business for us were Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Denver, and San Diego. I think this really points out, Smedes, to the nature of the assets we own and the broad geographic diversification of the portfolio that we have. So, we fill in where we can and we drive business in all the markets. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. I appreciate that color. I just wanted to ask you, so could you maybe just talk a little bit about group trending specifically in 2019 and particularly in San Francisco, and maybe any thoughts \u2013 are there any change in strategy with the Hyatt that you acquired there in terms of group versus transient of that property or any kind of thoughts you can provide there? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure. Well, as we all know, 2018 \u2013 coming into the latter part of 2018, and 2019, and 2020, San Francisco is forecasted to have some very good growth. And we're excited to participate in that growth as we go forward. The Hyatt is roughly a 20% group house, 80% transient, 20% group. And I can tell you that, as we underwrote that transaction, we had a clear view into group bookings for 2018 and 2019, and we're very comfortable with the forecasted RevPAR performance for that hotel going forward. The same with the Marquis, we took a look at that asset and made a decision that \u2013 just given the scale that we have and our ability to effectively manage complex renovations and think about displacement at that hotel, that it made sense to get the bulk of the work done this year, all the public space done this year, most of the rooms done this year, and modest rooms out of service going forward, so that we can also participate in a pickup in group business in 2019 at that hotel. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next question will come from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. Couple of questions on current trends. Can you give us any commentary around either quarter-to-date or April RevPAR? And then, you may have given this, I didn't hear, but what would 1Q RevPAR been ex the holiday adjustments \u2013 the holiday? Thanks. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thomas, I am not sure that I have the data to tell you what Q1 would have been ex the holiday. The only thing I will point to, again, which I think is impressive is if you were to exclude Houston and Washington, D.C. from our results, our Q1 RevPAR would have been 3.8%, which I think is really strong performance. I mean, it is really strong performance and we're very proud of the ability of our managers and asset managers and enterprise analytics to drive that number going forward. With respect to April, we don't have April results in yet. We have most of them in, but given that we have a couple of days left in the quarter to report, I'm not comfortable giving you a hard number, but I will tell you April was in line with our expectations, maybe a little stronger. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then... James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: A little stronger than our expectations. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: A little stronger. Okay. Perfect. And then just a follow-up, the UNITE HERE, the union put out a report about some of your peers talking about how they were entering to negotiations this summer after five years \u2013 after having not done so in five years. Where are you in terms of labor negotiations for major properties? Thanks. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, we don't sit at the table with UNITE HERE or any of the other unions, but we do collaborate with our management companies with respect to the positions that we feel are most appropriate as conversations are had with representatives of the labor unions. And negotiations and conversations have begun in the Boston marketplace and in Los Angeles. So, our best guess of what that looks like is baked into our guidance for the year. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Next from UBS, we have Robin Farley. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : On the \u2013 great. I know you highlighted already some of the reasons that margins were up even though rate was down, and I guess my question is how sustainable is that when we look after your guidance for this year, when we look to next year, in terms of maintaining that? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Robin, we \u2013 there were a number of factors that drove margin performance in the first quarter. Clearly, we had ancillary income increases in a number of different areas that tracked increased demand. And as I mentioned, we had the one-time tax rebate at Westin Grand Central, which contributed 28 basis points. But that said, we were able to increase our full-year EBITDA margin guidance by 10 basis points. So, we saw improvements in rooms productivity. We saw improvements in food and beverage productivity. We saw a decline in food procurement cost. We continue to see benefits from Marriott's implementation of Make a Green Choice, which was a Starwood legacy program that is really helping us. I think we saw the Make a Green Choice program accelerate about 3.4% in the quarter. We think there's a lot more room to go with that initiative going forward. We saw improvements in procurement cost on the Starwood legacy hotels as they get plugged into Avendra going forward. And there are a number of other things that we're excited about in connection with the Starwood integration into Marriott as we go forward. And we think that we'll continue to find ways to improve margin performance both on the Marriott legacy hotels as well as the Starwood legacy hotels. Another example is that Marriott is implementing Starwood's best practices on worker compensation at our Marriott legacy hotels, which is also helping us reduce cost. And then again, we have time and motion studies available to us on the balance of the portfolio, the medium and smaller hotels. We certainly wouldn't expect to see the same level of benefits as a result of those time and motion studies that we saw on the bigger box hotels. But we will continue to see productivity improvements and cost savings along those lines. I just want to leave you with one thought, we're never done. So, we're always looking for the next opportunity to increase productivity and to reduce cost as we look at our assets going forward. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the sort of idea that RevPAR has to be up 2% to 3% in order to see margin growth, do you think that will be different in 2019? In other words, given the initiatives you just laid out for us, is that kind of benchmark lower than for 2019? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I would tell you that our forecast would have flat margins at 2% RevPAR growth. I don't see any reason to move off of that at this point. I mean, this year, we're going to increase margins 10 basis points to 2%. So, I think a good bet is if you have 2% and flat margins, that should be achievable. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Maybe kind of a two-parter. First was, just Marriott recently put through a plan to reduce third-party commission rates. So, I'm just curious, how much of your business came through that third-party channel, and maybe how that has affected your group pace in 2018 or 2019? And maybe just as a follow up, what is it about the opportunity with IBM that led you to approach them, and what specifically do you hope to improve? I'm just curious how, I guess, Watson is differentiated from the service the brands provide you. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Let me answer the first question \u2013 second question first, Jeff, because we're really excited about our newfound relationship with IBM Research. The world is moving to artificial intelligence and predictive capabilities. And while we all, everyone in our space has access to a lot of structured data, we have access to new supply, we have access to historical RevPAR, we have access to projected RevPAR, which doesn't always turn out to be what the forecasts are. We had several meetings with the researchers at IBM to look at ways that we can predict RevPAR, which I think is something a bit different and it would be much more quantitative than is available to anyone today. They were willing to enter into this arrangement with us, given our scale and access to information. So we can look at various markets across the country and look at unstructured data in addition to structured data, such as what's happening in, pick a city, X, Y, Z city, what's happening in terms of businesses moving to those cities. What's happening with respect to the municipality's support of the growth in industry and jobs? What's happening in higher education, in housing? And that data is out there, but it's pretty difficult to go into any particular market, particularly when we operate across the country and corral it and say, okay, this is where we should be allocating capital in 2019, 2020, 2021. So we're hopeful that our relationship with Watson is going to give us that extra analytic capability to really look a little bit into the future, to understand trends that today are not so easy to predict. So your question regarding the Marriott's negotiation with the travel agent, the group travel agent commissions, most of our business \u2013 I shouldn't say most \u2013 but I'd say 60% of our group business is obtained through third-party intermediaries. That business has been growing over the years. We feel very strongly that decreasing the commissions will benefit the owners over the long term. We saw a little bit of an increase in booking activity in March. As I'm sure you're aware, the way the program works with Marriott is the Big Four, the four biggest intermediaries, are maintaining their 10% commission through the balance of this year. Effective January of next year, it will be reduced to 7%. The balance of the group intermediaries saw that change occur as of April 1. So, we saw a bit of a pull forward in some business, but as we sat around and talked about it yesterday, the order of magnitude of the business that we saw pull forward relative to our absolute level of group bookings, frankly, was immaterial. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks, guys. Operator : Next, from Raymond James, we have Bill Crow. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning. That leads me into my question, which is, see if you can quantify the impact, not only of the 10% to 7% shift, but also in anticipation of Marriott's negotiations with the OTAs later this summer, let's call it, 100 basis points, every 100 basis points of take rate \u2013 commission rate goes down, what's the impact to you? I get the sense it's more impactful for Host than it is for many others. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Bill, you're referring to the OTAs or the tender stuff? Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. I think there's two topics, right? The one that was just discussed, which is the big group commissions , if you save 300 basis points on a full-year basis, what does that translate into for you all? And then the second one is the OTAs and the negotiations, what every 100-basis-point reduction in that take rate would mean to you all? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, I don't have the math in front of me, Bill, but I will tell you that we're getting roughly 10% of our business through the OTA channels. We can certainly do the math and get back to you on that number. With respect to the group commissions, we looked at a number of different scenarios before this program was rolled out. We sat down with Marriott and looked at upsides scenarios and downside scenarios. So, without giving a specific number, we feel that there will be benefit to the bottom line as we transition from 10% to 7% going forward. And that's why we were prepared to sign onto the program. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Do you have a number for budget for group commissions for 2018 that we get that adjust? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I don't. Not in front of me anyway. Well, let us look something up and we'll give you a call back. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: You got it. Appreciate it. That's it for me. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Next, we have Gregory Miller with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Gregory J. Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. I'm on for Patrick. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Greg. Gregory J. Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Morning. I have a couple of questions related to the Hyatt acquisitions. I'm hoping that you could elaborate on the short-term and long-term opportunities with the three hotels and how long do you think it will take until you're at a stabilized level of operating performance? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure. I think whenever we announced the acquisition last quarter, we talked about a stabilized yield somewhere in the mid-6s over the next two to three years. We saw a number of opportunities, and I don't think that's changed, Greg, by the way. If anything, we're very pleased with the performance out of the box of these three assets. We see opportunities at the Andaz Maui to develop a 19-acre parcel of land which we've allocated $15 million to for either for-sale housing or additional units that we can pulled into the hotel that wasn't underwritten when we made the acquisition. We see opportunities in Maui to collaborate with the Kea Lani Palace, which is four hotels up the beach from the Andaz and also collaborate and centralize services with our Hyatt Regency K\u0101\u02bbanapali which is also on the island. We also \u2013 just as a general statement, we will be rolling out time and motion studies at all three hotels as we go forward and looking at ways that we can enhance productivity and drive down cost. In San Francisco, very much the same story. The Grand Hyatt Union Square, we see an opportunity to add some guest rooms to re-concept the food and beverage offerings to save money and make those offerings more efficient. Again, opportunities to collaborate between (56:50) and the Grand Hyatt which were in the same market, and opportunities to collaborate and centralize some services between the Grand Hyatt Union Square and our Hyatt Regency Burlingame. And by the way, with respect to collaborations between the hotels that may be managed by different brands but owned by Host, we've successfully done this in San Diego, where we own the Manchester Grand Hyatt and it sits right next door to the San Diego Marriott Marquis. And with respect to the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point, there are a number of initiatives that we identified in our underwriting that we will be moving forward on such as the possibility, early underwriting stages of building a new spa with a built-in base of business given some of the demographic trends that are occurring in that submarket, and also looking at how that hotel is performing relative to our other properties on the Gulf Coast, which includes three, the Don CeSar, The Ritz-Carlton Beach Resort, The Ritz Carlton Golf Resort, as well as a couple of other properties on the East Coast, The Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island and the Harbor Beach Marriott. So, we're really excited about the ability to create value with these assets. One of the reasons that we got so excited about acquiring them, they truly are iconic. They're in markets which expect to be the fastest-growing markets in the country going forward. And we're delighted to be able to work with Hyatt. We have a great partnership with them. We now own 10 Hyatt hotels and enjoy the relationship. Gregory J. Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thanks so much. It sounds like there's a lot of tremendous opportunities there. Appreciate it. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure thing. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for the day. I'd like to turn the floor back to Jim Risoleo for any additional or closing remarks. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, everyone, thanks for joining us on the call today. We look forward to discussing second quarter results and how the year is progressing on our next call. Have a great day, everyone. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, once again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Farley - UBS Securities LLC Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC Operator : Good day and welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts, Incorporated Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Gee Lingberg - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts second quarter 2018 earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre, and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our second quarter results and our outlook for 2018. Michael Bluhm, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide details on our second quarter performance by markets, discuss margins and the balance sheet. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you, Gee, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report a quarter that once again materially exceeded our internal expectations on the top and bottom line, and beat consensus estimates for adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per diluted share. For the quarter, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 2.8% with comparable hotel EBITDA margins up 90 basis points. Adjusted EBITDAre increased 6.7% to $476 million and adjusted FFO per diluted share increased 10.2% to $0.54. Based on our second quarter performance, we are again raising our full-year guidance for RevPAR, adjusted EBITDAre, and adjusted FFO per share. For the full year, we have increased the midpoint of our comparable RevPAR guidance 12.5 basis points to 2.1%, increased the midpoint of adjusted EBITDAre by $20 million to $1.545 billion and increased the midpoint of adjusted FFO per share by approximately $0.04 to $1.74. These results continue to demonstrate the benefits of our geographically diversified portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels, our unprecedented scale and platform to drive internal and external growth, and the power and flexibility of our investment-grade balance sheet. Together, these key pillars form the foundation of Host, the premier lodging REIT. As mentioned in our press release, we closed on a previously announced sale of the W New York on Lexington Avenue on May 9 for $190 million. In addition, we also stated that we have placed the W Union Square under contract for $171 million. The W Union Square has significant money at risk, and we anticipate the sale closing before the end of the third quarter. Once complete, these two asset sales will have sold for a combined cap rate of approximately 1.3% and reduce our exposure to profitability-challenged assets in New York, a market that faces headwinds as a result of significant supply increases and continued expense inflation. Selling the W Union Square exemplifies our continuing efforts to upgrade the quality and profitability of the portfolio. Including the W Union Square, over the last 18 months, we have recycled out of over $1 billion of low RevPAR, low-growth, and high CapEx assets at an aggregate 5% cap rate into hotels with higher RevPAR, higher growth, and lower CapEx needs at the same cap rate. This accretive activity has only served to bolster the iconic and irreplaceable nature of our hotels. Please note that included in the guidance is a one additional asset sale we discussed on our last quarter call. The timing in that sale has been delayed, but we still do anticipate a closing by year-end. The combination of the newly announced W Union Square disposition and the delay of our additional asset sale incrementally reduced our full-year adjusted EBITDAre by approximately $2 million. As Michael will discuss in further detail, our investment-grade balance sheet has never been in better shape. With leveraging only 2.4 times, over $500 million of cash on hand, and $700 million of capacity available under our credit facility, we are well positioned to drive shareholder value whether by acquiring assets, investing in our iconic portfolio or buying back stock. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to capital allocation; and although we are evaluating and monitoring several acquisition opportunities, we are not including any additional purchases in our revised full-year guidance. As it relates to investing in our portfolio, we spent approximately $86 million on CapEx in the second quarter, which is consistent with our plan to spend between $475 million to $550 million on total CapEx. Notable projects during the quarter, including guest room and restaurant renovations at the Swiss\u00f4tel Chicago, and a lobby and public space at the Westin Seattle. We also completed our multi-year transformation of The Phoenician during this quarter as we delivered the tennis and activity center and upgraded the golf course. The Phoenician is nothing short of spectacular and we anticipate that the transformation will position the property to drive meaningful increases in revenue and profitability. As I mentioned, our second quarter results exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom line as our scale and platform continued to drive operational outperformance. Working with our managers, our asset management and enterprise analytics teams did another exceptional job of driving margin growth in the quarter. Here are just a few of the highlights. While the second quarter wasn't as dramatically impacted by holiday shifts as it was in 2017, holidays certainly influenced results in April and June. April was by far our strongest month of the quarter, with RevPAR up 5% as Easter shifted to the beginning of the month from mid-month in 2017. On the back-end of the corner, we saw the last week in June positively impacted by the July 4 holiday falling on a Wednesday, as business was pulled forward into the last week of the second quarter. As a result, our comparable hotels had a historic high RevPAR of nearly $197 in the second quarter, an increase of 2.8%. This was driven by a 2.2% increase in average room rate and a 50-basis-point increase in occupancy. Year-to-date, RevPAR increased 2.1% to $185, driven by a 110-basis-point increase in occupancy and a 70-basis-point increase in average rate. Given the holiday shifts, group business led the way this quarter and improved 3.1%, rebounding from the first quarter as we expected. This was driven primarily by rates, which increased 2.7%, while group occupancy was up 40 basis points. Notably, corporate group revenues were up 15.2% and had a material impact on banquet and AV spend, which was up 6.6% in the quarter. We continue to see the quality of our groups improve, which is reflected in the significant banquet spend. The strong group performance in the quarter gave our managers the confidence to push transient rate and continue to enhance profitability. Overall for the quarter, transient revenue increased 2.2%, driven by an increase in rate of 2.3%, offset by a slight decline in occupancy. Speaking of transient, we witnessed the continuation of the first quarter theme on the business transient traveler returning in the second quarter. Combine that with a sizeable increase in corporate group business and banquet F&B spend in the quarter, and it is reasonable to conclude that the corporate customer is healthy. We are optimistic that business travel will remain strong over the course of the year and into next year, particularly as non-residential fixed investment and corporate profits continue to project mid-single digit increases. Looking comprehensively at revenue, total comparable hotel revenues increased 3.7%, boosted by an F&B revenue increase of 4.8% and other revenues increasing 9.8%. Our asset managers continue to do an excellent job working with our property managers, finding ways to increase ancillary revenues at our properties. These contribute meaningfully to our overall market performance. As was the story in the first quarter, we continued to do a great job improving profitability in our properties and driving comparable EBITDA margin growth. In the second quarter, comparable EBITDA margins grew 90 basis points. We received a tax rebate at the Marriott Marquis in New York, which positively impacted margins by 40 basis points. The balance of the margin lift was a result of increased ancillary revenues, increased productivity and reductions in undistributed operating expenses. This translated to adjusted EBITDAre of $476 million for the quarter and adjusted FFO per share of $0.54. Both were significantly above consensus estimates. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA was $846 million and FFO per diluted share was $0.97. As we look into the second half of the year, our group booking pace is very strong with group revenues up 4.7%. The fourth quarter of this year remains the strongest group quarter with group revenue 5.4% ahead of last year. With approximately 95% of our group revenues on the books for 2018 and occupancies at all-time highs, we continue to see the booking window extend. The global economy continues to exhibit strength and appears supportive of industry growth. The economic indicators we closely follow, corporate profits and non-residential fixed investment, remained strong. The forecast for non-residential investment has surprised to the upside and now stands at 6.5% for 2018 with 4.5% improvement forecast for 2019. As mentioned earlier, the pickup in business transient travel continues to gain traction and provides reason for optimism. Combined with a healthy group pace for the second half of the year, the stage is set for continued increases in rates, which should drive profitability at our hotels. This is only bolstered by continued strong leisure demand, resulting from record levels of consumer confidence and low unemployment. This combination of better than expected first half results and increased macroeconomic optimism is driving the across-the-board raise to our full guidance. As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our comparable RevPAR growth guidance for the full year to a revised range of 1.75% to 2.5%. This is predicated on our belief that the first half, which materially outperformed our expectations from the beginning of the year, will match our long-held top line expectations for the second half of the year. We feel very confident that this is achievable given the strength of our second half group pace and supportive macroeconomic factors. Consistent with this trend, we are anticipating comparable EBITDA margins of 25 basis points to 75 basis points based on our revised RevPAR range. At the new midpoint of 2.1% RevPAR growth, we expect comparable EBITDA margin growth of 50 basis points, an increase of 40 basis points from the midpoint of our prior guidance. 2018 adjusted EBITDAre has been raised by $20 million at the midpoint to $1.545 billion on a revised range of $1.525 billion to $1.565 billion. I would point out that this increase is on top of the $25 million increase in guidance we posted last quarter, while also factoring in an incremental $2 million in lost EBITDA due to the W Union Square sale, offset by the delayed closing of one additional asset sale. We are increasing 2018 adjusted FFO per share by approximately $0.04 at the midpoint to $1.74 on a revised range of $1.71 to $1.76. In closing, we are pleased with another beat-and-raise quarter as it continues to demonstrate the attributes of our premier lodging REIT. Our diversified portfolio of irreplaceable assets, our unmatched scale and platform, and our investment-grade balance sheet positions us well to continue to outperform our peers in the near, medium, and long term. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael, who will discuss our operating performance and our balance sheet in much greater detail. Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. As Jim mentioned, we had an outstanding second quarter, with impressive beats to our internal top and bottom line results, as well as consensus estimates, enabling us to increase our guidance for the full year. Comparable RevPAR increased 2.8% on a currency-neutral basis, of which 80% was driven by average room rate and, in part, drove comparable EBITDA margins to increase an impressive 90 basis points this quarter. 40 basis points of the margin expansion was related to a tax rebate at the New York Marriott Marquis, with the remainder of the strong performance driven by rate-driven RevPAR growth, better-than-expected F&B revenues, an increase in ancillary revenues and broad operational efficiency. As a result, adjusted EBITDAre increased 6.7% to $476 million this quarter, which was $21 million or 5% above consensus estimate. In addition, adjusted FFO per share grew over 10%, which was $0.03 or 6% above consensus estimate this quarter. We remain impressed by the exceptional job of our property and asset managers to bring more profit to the bottom line. Now, I would like to address the Marriott Starwood integration that has been the topic of discussion this earnings season. We have not seen any measurable impact from the sales integration. In fact, the RevPAR index for our legacy Starwood portfolio actually outpaced that of our Marriott legacy portfolio in the quarter. Furthermore, we continued to reap the benefits from the Marriott Starwood revenue and cost synergies. In particular, we continue to accrue benefits from reduced OTA charges, procurement, credit card, reward and centralized system cost. We will continue to monitor and work with Marriott to ensure a smooth transition, and we are very pleased with what we have seen to date. Looking at specific performance in our individual markets, our best-performing domestic markets this quarter were New Orleans, San Antonio, San Francisco and Orlando. RevPAR increases range from 8% to almost 12% in these markets, generally benefiting from strong corporate group business. Overall, group revenues increased double digit in these markets with growth ranging from 12% to over 14%. Our New Orleans Marriott outperformed this quarter with RevPAR growth of 11.8%, exceeding the STR upper upscale results by 440 basis points. The impressive results were driven by increases in average rate of 7.4% and a 3.4 percentage point increase in occupancy. Strong citywide demand in the quarter resulted in an increase in corporate group room nights, which allowed our managers to drive transient rate. Group revenues increased 13.5% and transient rate increased over 9% this quarter. In addition, the strong group business at the property contributed to a 7.5% increase in the more profitable banquet and catering business. Our hotels in San Antonio increased RevPAR by 10% this quarter driven predominantly by average rate that grew 8%. Strong group business, in particular, improved group revenues over 14% and boosted food and beverage growth by almost 19%. The RevPAR growth at our San Francisco hotels exceeded our expectations with a significant increase of 8.6%, driven by a 6% improvement in average rate and a 2.1 percentage point expansion in occupancy. The Fisherman's Wharf Hotel benefited from its rooms renovation, while other hotels benefited from strong corporate group business. Total group revenues increased 13.5% and food and beverage revenue grew 15.4% with a more profitable banquet and catering revenues increasing 19%. Our Orlando World Center Hotel continues to benefit from strong overall leisure transient demand. However, in the second quarter, the hotel's RevPAR growth of 8% was primarily driven by strong group business. Group occupancy grew 6.3 percentage points and group average rate increased 5.7%, combining for 12.4% group revenue growth. Once again, strong group business allowed for more aggressive pricing, driving up the average rate by almost 7% and increased banquet and catering revenues by over 10%. Looking to markets that were more challenged in the quarter, our hotels in Boston experienced a RevPAR decline of 2.9% in the second quarter as weaker citywides contributed to the decline in group business. There was a 40% drop in the number of citywide this quarter and only one event at the Heinz Convention Center, which impacted our two large hotels in Boston. RevPAR in our hotels in Atlanta decreased 2.7% in the quarter, primarily from an average rate decline of 3.2%. Our performance was particularly challenged from the renovation disruption at The Whitley, a Luxury Collection Hotel, which is undergoing a conversion from a Ritz-Carlton. In Los Angeles, RevPAR at our hotels declined 2.2%, resulting from a 2.9% decline in average rate, slightly offset by a 60-basis-point increase in occupancy. Impact from the Marriott, LAX and Manhattan Beach Marriott renovations in 2017 negatively impacted our properties in the market. If we exclude Boston, Atlanta, and Los Angeles, the remainder of our portfolio grew RevPAR at 3.7%. Moving away from our quarterly results and looking to our forecast for the full year, we expect our hotels in Miami, Philadelphia, Maui, and San Francisco to outperform our portfolio. Conversely, we anticipate the DC, Houston and Atlanta markets to underperform. In July, we paid a regular second quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of approximately 4% on our current stock price. In addition, this represents a payout ratio of 46% on our adjusted FFO per share. We did not repurchase any shares in 2018, but have $500 million of capacity available under the current share repurchase program. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility as we are the only large REIT with an investment-grade balance sheet, which we are committed to maintain as we believe it is a prominent differentiator to our peers and provides flexibility to take advantage of value creation opportunities throughout the cycle. As of June 30, 2018, we had cash of $646 million and $551 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Total debt was $4.2 billion, with an average maturity of 4.5 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4%. In addition, we have no debt maturities until 2020. Subsequent to the quarter-end, we repaid $150 million under the revolver portion of our credit facility and, as a result, have approximately $500 million of cash and $700 million of available capacity. Our leverage ratio is approximately 2.4 times as calculated under the terms of our credit facility, providing a significant dry powder for external growth opportunities. Moving to outlook, lastly, as you model and forecast out the remainder of 2018, please keep in mind that we generally earn approximately 20% to 21% of our total adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our strong operating results which enabled us to increase our guidance across the board for the year. Our performance continues to demonstrate that owning a portfolio of iconic, irreplaceable and geographically diversified hotels, having the scale and platform to drive value combined with a powerful investment grade balance sheet, is a strong strategic position to deliver significant value to shareholders over the long term. This concludes our prepared remarks. And we are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Rich Hightower from Evercore ISI. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Good morning, guys. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Good morning, Rich. Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Good morning, Rich. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Thanks for taking the question here. So, I've got one. I'll make it count. With respect to capital allocation, clearly Host is interested in portfolio recycling which entails both buying and selling assets, and you guys have done a fair amount of both recently. My question here is, on the acquisition side, given the fact that private markets are pretty strong, there is liquidity out there looking to be allocated to hotels and a lot of that carries a low cost of capital, how do you sort of thread that needle between being a public vehicle with a certain cost of capital versus the private market for acquisitions which may or may not accommodate that at any given time? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure, Rich. Happy to address your question. So, as we think about our strategy which we have articulated very clearly, it is to continue to build out the iconic and irreplaceable portfolio of hotels which we identified in our supplemental disclosure, the top 40. The top 40 hotels which have a RevPAR of roughly $234 accounted for roughly 62% of our EBITDA last year and generated close \u2013 over $900 million in EBITDA. So the portfolio within the portfolio is larger than any other standalone REIT that's in the public marketplace today. So we think about iconic and irreplaceable. We think about having scale and geographic diversity. And the last pillar really is the investment-grade balance sheet. So as we sit back and say, how do we get there, how do we continue to build out iconic and irreplaceable, our view is that there are two ways to do it. If the markets are \u2013 depending on where the markets are, you either buy hotels or you sell hotels. And we take a constant read of acquisition opportunities in the marketplace. We take a constant read of where the capital markets are today. And if we see an opportunity to recycle capital out of lower RevPAR hotels with slower growth prospects and in need of CapEx, that's certainly something we would consider to do because it's very consistent with our strategy. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Okay. And maybe one quick follow-up there. I mean, where \u2013 what do you think the public markets are telling you to do right now? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Be prudent allocators of capital, maintain your discipline, and don't be shy about recycling when you see the right opportunities, and don't be shy about buying when you see the right opportunities. And if your stock price... Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Got it. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: If your stock price happens to dip and you think your stock is a good buy, we have $500 million authorization and we certainly won't be shy about buying back shares. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Got it. Thank you, Jim. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays Capital. Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Good morning, Anthony. Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. In New York, there's talk that there could be hotel undersupply over the next few years given strong office space construction and increasing Airbnb regulation. How do you balance the opportunity maybe to continue to monetize the assets in New York at low cap rates versus what seems to be improving long-term outlook in the market? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, Anthony, I think we would agree that that New York generally as a market is always going to be a good hotel market. Clearly, it's the highest RevPAR market in the country. I would tell you that we look asset-by-asset as we always have and we look at how we think our hotel is going to perform over the near to medium term and build out whole value scenarios and we look at alternative usage for every property in the portfolio, including our New York hotels. And as we mentioned in our release, we closed on the W Lex and we have the W Union Square under contract. And as we looked at the right strategy for each of those assets, we took all those factors into consideration. I think for the near term, New York is going to continue to have supply headwinds. We're obviously very in line with what's happening, with leveling the playing field from an Airbnb perspective, but New York is still going to have a lot of supply for the next two or three years, in our opinion, and it's a high-cost market in which to operate. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we're taking steps to reduce our exposure to profitability-challenged hotels, and those are hotels with high expense ratios, high expense flows and expense inflation and hotels that are in the need of CapEx. Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Good morning, Michael. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I just wanted to stick to the topic of CapEx. I guess maybe you think out to 2019, how are rising costs, both labor and materials, kind of affecting your thinking? And does it change timing of any projects that you have in the hopper and kind of how does it move up and down or how do assets move up and down on the potential sell list as you think about CapEx needs? Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, CapEx is obviously one factor that we look at, Michael, when we evaluate what we think a hotel is worth to us. We are early into the budgeting process for our comprehensive 2019 capital plan. We'll have some meetings in September to really drill down, and as we do every year, look at hotel by hotel project by project and make some determinations on if owner-funded CapEx is required, is there a value play and are we willing to invest in the asset. So obviously, we have a full in-house capability with our design and construction group, and we're very current on trends in both labor and materials cost. And when we sit down, we will have all those facts and figures in front of us. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Understood. And then, as you think about acquisitions and what you're underwriting, does that change any \u2013 your thought process on maybe redevelopment or deeper repositioning opportunities for the potential deals you might \u2013 may or may not be looking at today? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I think that when it comes to acquisition underwriting, it's the same process. And, of course, if we feel that as part of our underwriting that the CapEx needs of any particular potential acquisition or any value enhancement project that we might undertake are such that we will not be able to underwrite to our return hurdles then that will change our point of view about moving forward. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That's all from me. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask you... James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Hi, Smedes. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. When you look at some of your larger hotels in the portfolio, is there an opportunity or would you take the approach to kind of incrementally group up that others seem to be having some success on? You mentioned some hotels are like more profit-challenged. Would that be a strategy at some of your hotels? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I think, we developed \u2013 Smedes, we developed a optimal revenue strategy for every property in the portfolio. And those strategies are revisited on a daily basis quite frankly. So, as I mentioned, we have 95% of our group on the books. And we saw a nice pickup in corporate group, which is frankly more profitable given the higher total spend with food and beverage and AV revenues. So I think there's a balance. And clearly at some hotels, it makes sense to take more group, depending on what's happening in a particular market in a particular year. In other hotels, you want to take less group because you feel that you can drive corporate group, which is short-term bookings and higher-rated transient business into the property. So we have always had the strategy of optimal group transient mix. It's nothing new for us. It's something we've been doing for years, and we're right at about 40% group now, and it's going to vary by hotel and by market. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then I just wanted to ask you. You mentioned the tax rebate for the Marriott Marquis in New York. Was that related to just an appeal or something else? And then as you look at your margin expectations going forward, are there any tax rebates expected in those numbers? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: It's not related to an appeal, it was an inducement; an inducement to redevelop. As you may recall, we in partnership with Vornado, redeveloped a retail parcel there, and we had some help from the city. We also got some help from the city on the Westin Grand Central. There will be minor tax ICAP rebates in the second half of the year, but it's nothing material or worth talking about. Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: On the margin side, Smedes, right, as we mentioned on the call, we had a \u2013 the property tax rebate had a 40 basis point impact to our margins. That's the same amount for the year-to-date. For the full year, the ICAP margin impact will be 17 basis points. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just following up on the last question. Were those tax rebates included in guidance before, or that helped, guys, I think, you still would have raised even if it's new. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I'm sorry, Tom. Can you ask that question one more time? Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. So you said you raised your full year guidance by $20 million, right? Were the tax \u2013 was the Marriott Marquis New York tax rebate in your prior guidance or was it not in your prior guidance? And I imply that it helped you by $5 million to $6 million. Is that fair? Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thomas, it was not in our guidance and your assessment is fairly accurate. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So you still would have raised, but by not as much. And then on the W New York sales, you highlighted earlier on that you sold them at a 1.3 cap rate. Obviously that's a very impressive cap rate for a sale. One would assume the buyers have or don't want the 1% cap rate. Can you just talk about what you expect they'll do? And did you look at other options for those properties and kind of how is your thought process around the eventual sale? Thanks. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure, Thomas. Yes, we did look at other options for the properties. We go back to \u2013 let me take you back to 2006 for a moment, because we've been involved in New York for a long time, and in 2006, just to give you a sense of how we think about New York City, we own the Drake Hotel at 57th and Park, and we saw an opportunity to increase the FAR available to that hotel through purchasing air rights from adjacent property owners, really on 56th Street. And we assembled incremental FAR and we're able to deliver the hotel free and clear of the management contract, it was exquisitely timed, and recognized significant value. We sold the hotel for $440 million. And I think that was somewhere in the mid-20s from an EBITDA multiple perspective back then. I can say that by way of background to let you know that we look at all options that are available to us on every asset, and we are keenly familiar with New York and the current legislative landscape and what you can do and what you can't do. And that's all been taken into consideration. And we were very comfortable and very happy with the pricing we achieved. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Good morning, Chris. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I was hoping we could \u2013 morning. I was hoping we could drill down a little bit on some of the components of margins and just kind of conceptually. I know there's been some help with food and beverage strength, and I know there's been some help on some of the resort fees and other fees, and some of the green programs that might help on housekeeping costs. And then there's obviously core inflation working against you. Can you kind of bucket that, whether you want to look at it for the quarter or the full year? What are some of the pluses and minuses, and how sustainable do you think some of them are going forward? Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure. So, a couple of things. So, first \u2013 so why don't we talk about the margins, the 90 basis points of which rate 40 basis points was attributable to property tax rebate taking us down to 50 basis point of sort of operational improvement. Of that, it was a mixture \u2013 it really was a very broad mixture of things, both top line and bottom line. In particular, we saw super strong F&B revenues, particularly banquet A&B, driven by over 15% corporate group business in the quarter. We also had \u2013 we talked about earlier, 80% of our ADR growth this quarter \u2013 or 80% of our RevPAR growth this quarter, driven by ADR, which as you know, just drives more profitability to the bottom line. We had a fair amount of an increase in utility revenues which are high profit, and our managers continue to try to find ways to continue to find those higher-profit opportunities in ancillary revenues. But then, when you go down to departmental expenses as well, we saw a fair amount of efficiencies coming out in those departments as well as on distributor operating expenses. So when I sort of think about where we were finding savings and opportunities, it really was very broad, both top and bottom line. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: And then the one thing I would also throw in there on the food and beverage, we saw improvements in productivity and we saw improvements in food cost. And with the outsize spend in beverage being driven by corporate group and improvements on the flow-through that really helps our margin performance. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Very good. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Good morning. Just to follow up on that, on the margin question, maybe to package it a little differently though, obviously, you guys called out some of the very favorable initiatives that Marriott's kind of merger is delivering for you guys now that that's complete. Would you have any ability to break that piece out separately and say, okay, look, when we kind of look at Marriott's initiatives, they're contributing this much versus our core operating efficiencies and some of the mix shift things you just mentioned are contributing, why? So just kind of internal versus external a little bit. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. I think it's a little challenging, Shaun, to break it down with respect to what Marriott is doing. I will tell you that as we think about what Veenie (44:46) has said, that they continue to see margin improvements, they continue to work hard for the owners to reduce costs and expenses that we should see continued benefits from the various initiatives at Marriott. Whether it's reduced OTA commissions, we'll start seeing a benefit when the rewards programs are merged together with lower charge-out ratios on the expense side as we get our Starwood legacy hotels fully integrated into Avendra. We'll see lower procurement costs. We're seeing lower workers' comp costs on Marriott legacy properties as a result of Marriott implementing Starwood workers' compensation policies. So think about it in 2019 that maybe that's worth 50 basis points. Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: And we're still expecting now a fair amount of expectation around revenue synergies driven by the sales force integration, loyalty program integration among others, so. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, guys. That's perfect. Jim, you mentioned the 50 basis points in 2019. Is that incremental or that will be sort of all-in, including some gains that are being recognized this year? Appreciate that a lot of things you said are still on the comm. So maybe more of it's next year, but is that like incremental or sort of \u2013 or total all-in? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I would think about it as being all-in, Shaun. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. No, thanks for the clarification. Thank you very much, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Khoa Ngo - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Khoa Ngo on for David. If I can just jump back on to the capital allocation topic, there's clearly a big event going on in this space among your competitors. I'm just trying to get your thoughts on your decision-making process around company level versus the asset level. That would be great. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I'll answer the question first by saying, David (sic) [Khoa] (47:06), you never say never. However, our strategy has been clearly enunciated that we are focused on iconic and irreplaceable hotels and with scale and broad geographic diversification and investment grade balance sheet. So, when we look at individual assets versus portfolios versus other companies, our first screen is iconic and irreplaceable hotels, and that's how we think about it. Khoa Ngo - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Maybe a follow-up on that one. Thanks for taking the question. As you look at the non-top 40 hotels, how would you characterize the typical potential buyer of those types of assets? How demand from that group may be evolving and how you would generally expect sales of those assets as you compare one-offs versus the portfolio? Thanks. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure. I think the buyer can come from different places. The buyer could be another REIT. The buyer could be a private equity firm, or the buyer frankly could be a sovereign. And we stay in close touch with everyone and keep a close view into the capital markets and what that financing might be available and what the cost of that financing might be and level of proceeds, and all that informs our decision as to what course of action we might take. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And then maybe one unrelated follow-up and maybe I missed this in the beginning of the call, but I guess what are you seeing when you referenced the forward-booking strength, are you seeing any deviations across markets or cities? And any kind of color you can provide there as you look into the back half of 2018 and even 2019? Thanks. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: We're really not seeing any deviation. As you know, some markets \u2013 performance flips market-to-market, but all-in-all, we're not seeing any deviation. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Jim... James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Hey, Bill. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: There are published reports that you are marketing $1.2 billion worth of assets; and a) curious on that front and where you are in that process; and b) as you think about if those reports are accurate, the use of proceeds would either be to build a war chest for transactions that may be on the market or coming to market and I think we can all kind of identify a strategic in a couple of other things that are out there. Or it's maybe to take quicker action on shifting the portfolio makeup kind of in response to some of the Street's requests through the years. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about what you would do if you in fact are selling that portfolio. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, Bill, you know that we don't comment on published reports. We only talk about press releases that we might issue. But if you think about what I said earlier with respect to our desire to really build out the portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable assets and if iconic and irreplaceable assets are not available or if it would make economic sense and be accretive to shareholders to buy back stock or reinvest in our portfolio, those are always all levers that we have to create shareholder value. But to answer your question a little more directly, there are two ways that we can build out the iconic and irreplaceable portfolio. We can do it, number one, by buying those types of hotels; or number two, we can do it by selling hotels that don't fit that profile. From a sales perspective, everything that we do starts with a disciplined review of each asset and our view of value \u2013 our whole value taking into account what we believe is a reasoned operating pro-forma as well as the capital needs of the asset going forward. That is the first screen when we're thinking about selling a hotel and when we're buying a hotel as well. So, we'll wait and see what happens. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. I appreciate that. If we fast forward a year, 18 months, do you think you still have investments outside the U.S.? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: We continue to \u2013 as we talked earlier, Bill, over the course of the last several quarters, we continue to explore options with respect to the Euro JV. We're making good progress. I have nothing to report at this time. I hope to be able to have something to report over the next two calls with respect to the Euro JV. The other assets that we have, we have three hotels in Brazil and one in Mexico City and a couple hotels in Canada that really would be the balance of our exposure outside the U.S. So, we're focused on bringing our complete focus back to the U.S. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Great. Thanks. I wondered if you could give a little bit of color. I think you mentioned the increase in group in 2018, I don't know if I heard 2019. And then I'm also just wondering how that pace of future group for 2019 changed during the quarter. Others have suggested that some of the improvements in GDP haven't necessarily translated into better demand yet. I'm just curious for your take on that. Thanks. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure, Robin. Group booking pace in the quarter for all future periods is up 22%, and group booking pace in the quarter for 2019 is up 10%. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : And then in terms of any thoughts on how changes in macro improving the GDP has affected demand in your view or not affected, as the case may be? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I'll point to the outsized performance we had at corporate group in the second quarter. It was up almost 15%, and we saw strong spend with food and beverage, and AB revenues. And we are hopeful we're going to continue to see that trend continue over the balance of the year. We may not get a full 15% for the rest of the year, but we still anticipate corporate group to be up. And we also are hopeful that we're going to see corporate group continue to come back to our hotels in 2019. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Two-part question for me. I mean, can you talk about what you're seeing with international inbound demand right now and whether you've seen any impact from the stronger dollar? And then just to follow-up on that last question, as I think about the demand environment, everything we're seeing whether it's record occupancies, 4% GDP, tax reform, et cetera, historically you'd think you'd see a little bit more than 2% RevPAR growth right now. So, maybe you can talk a little bit about what you think is limiting that upside right now and some of this group booking pace has been building, if going forward into next year and beyond, you could start to see some acceleration from there? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure, Jared. We'll talk about international inbound demand first. We saw about a 13% pickup in the first quarter, and we saw an incremental 5% pickup in the second quarter. And the inbound demand was really very broad-based in Q2. International accounts were roughly 10% of our business and it's obviously on the coast where it's most impactful, so it's a tale of different markets as everything is in the hotel business. San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, a lot of that inbound demand is coming from Asia and New York, Boston, and Florida, it's coming from Europe and Mexico, Middle East, so we're really seeing it across the board. That was one question. Can you repeat the second question? Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. It was really sort of a follow-up to Robin's question and just the demand environment overall seems pretty strong right now with.... James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Whether... James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, we finished this quarter with 84% occupancy in our hotels. We have not seen that occupancy since 2000. And going into the balance of the year, the hotels continue to remain full. 95% of our group is on the books for this year. Where we have opportunities to yield out lower rated business and increase rate, we are doing that. We see the leisure traveler as being particularly strong. No signs of any weakness on that front. We're encouraged that corporate group is coming back. We're encouraged that the business traveler has returned. And I am confident that over time, assuming that those trends hold, which we have every reason to believe that they will, that we will be able to increase rates. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And I'll just add to that. Now, remember this quarter was interesting because you look at sort of what the attribution of RevPAR growth was last quarter \u2013 in the past couple of quarters compared to this quarter where you had 80% of your RevPAR growth driven by rate. We're certainly seeing our ability to start pushing ADR. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hello everyone. Can you go provide an update on the retail and signage at the Marriott Marquis? How much if at all is this helping other revenue growth this year? And then talk about the inducements at that property, is this a one-time event? Should we back it out for next year? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: The retail is virtually completely leased as is the signage. I think we have one space left. The ICAP will be around, but it will be \u2013 it will be around for a number of years, but it's going to be in lesser amounts. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then... James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: It... Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Go ahead, continue. Okay. So for that leasing, I mean, how much of that rent is \u2013 or I guess the lease payment, is that increased? If I recall correctly, that has various step-ups. Will you start to get \u2013 I imagine just a higher lease based on, I forget the formula but maybe a percentage of the lease rent at the property or can you give a quick update reminder how that works? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Hey, you might \u2013 well, why don't we take this one offline. There's a lot of detail behind it and probably best to view that separately. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jim Risoleo for closing remarks. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We look forward to discussing third quarter results and how the year is progressing on our next call. Everyone, please enjoy the rest of your summer. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC Operator : Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts, Incorporated Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead. Gee Lingberg - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thanks, Nicole. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts third quarter 2018 earnings call. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filing to the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will discuss our recent transaction, provide an overview of our third quarter results and our outlook for 2018. Michael Bluhm, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide further details on our third quarter performance, discuss margins, and the balance sheet. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you, Gee, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report a quarter that once again exceeded our internal expectations on the bottom line and beat consensus estimates for adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per diluted share. While top line results were impacted by two hurricanes, we were encouraged that on a comparable hotel RevPAR increase of 1.6%, our operators were able to increase comparable hotel EBITDA margins by 50 basis points. Adjusted EBITDAre increased 7.8% to $344 million and adjusted FFO per diluted share increased 12.1% to $0.37, beating consensus estimates by $18 million and $0.02 respectively. These results continue to demonstrate the benefits of our geographically diversified portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels; our unprecedented scale and platform to drive internal and external growth; and the power and flexibility of our investment-grade balance sheet. Together, these key pillars form the foundation of Host, the premier lodging REIT. As noted in our press release, we were very active on the capital recycling front in the quarter. This strategic activity followed through on two key initiatives we set early on in my tenure as CEO. Reducing our exposure to New York and exiting our international assets to focus our attention back to the U.S. where we have the greatest scale and competitive advantage. In the quarter, we closed on the previously-announced sale of the W Union Square for $171 million. We also announced that the Westin New York Grand Central is under contract for $300 million, inclusive of the FF&E reserve. The Westin had significant money at risk and we anticipate the sale closing early in 2019. Including the W New York which was sold earlier in the year, by early 2019, we will have sold three assets in New York for a combined EBITDA multiple of 28 times, significantly eliminating our exposure to profitability-challenged hotels in the market. New York is a market that continues to face headwinds due to significant supply increases and continued expense inflation. For reference, since 2007, New York supply has increased by 55% or 43,000 hotel rooms at a compound annual growth rate of over 4%. In the quarter, we also sold the retail, signage and theater condo space at the New York Marriott Marquis for $442 million. In partnership with Vornado, we redeveloped this space beginning in 2012. The sale was at a very attractive price and is another example of our asset managers identifying, implementing and executing on a real estate value creation opportunity. The sale resulted in an EBITDA multiple of 26 times and 19 times on 2018 and 2019 respectively, with substantially all the proceeds used to close out the reverse like-kind exchange structure for the acquisition of the Andaz Maui which we purchased earlier this year. The balance of these proceeds were used to establish a new forward like-kind exchange escrow. Our scale and platform provide us the opportunity to create value from our asset base. And we will continue to identify, evaluate and execute on value enhancement opportunities to drive shareholder value. On the international front, we also sold the JW Marriott Mexico City for $183 million or approximately a 15 times EBITDA multiple on 2018 forecasted results. We held a 52% interest in the hotel in a joint venture with Marriott International. For reference, this was a previously unidentified asset sale we mentioned on our past two earnings calls. As I mentioned earlier, we are going to focus our investment activity in the U.S. To that end, we have reached agreement with our two European joint venture partners to sell them our approximate 33% interest in the Euro JV. The gross asset value of our interest is approximately \u20ac700 million and equates to an EBITDA multiple of 17 times on 2018 forecasted results. After accounting for fund level debt, we anticipate the sale will generate net proceeds of approximately \u20ac435 million, a portion of which we intend to use to repay our outstanding \u20ac207 million draw on our credit facility. This outstanding amount was drawn to hedge our equity interest in the venture. While we have been successful with our platform in Europe and very grateful to our partners for helping to build a strong business over there, we believe it is the right time for the company to focus its efforts where we can have the most impact for shareholders, which is owning a geographically diverse portfolio of assets here in the U.S. After these two international sales, less than 2% of our EBITDA will come from outside the country, with only two hotels in Canada and three hotels in Brazil. For the remainder of the year, there are no additional asset sales or acquisitions included in our revised guidance. The combination of the disposition of the New York Marquis retail, the Euro JV interest, and the JW Marriott Mexico City sale incrementally reduced our full-year adjusted EBITDAre forecast by approximately $7 million. Again, we expect the Westin Grand Central to close early in 2019. Given the significant amount of disposition activity, Michael will walk through the specifics of how those sales will preliminarily impact 2019 EBITDA in his prepared remarks. Michael will also discuss how our investment-grade balance sheet has never been in better shape and continues to get stronger. With leverage in only 2 times, over $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash, and $700 million of capacity available under our credit facility as of the end of the third quarter, we are well positioned to drive shareholder value, whether by acquiring assets, investing in our irreplaceable portfolio, or buying back stock. I should note that the leverage ratio and cash balance I referenced do not include the proceeds from the pending Westin Grand Central and Euro JV interest sale. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to capital allocation and are evaluating and monitoring several acquisition opportunities. As it relates to investing in our portfolio, the company spent approximately $48 million in the quarter on redevelopments and return on investment expenditures, and approximately $71 million on renewal and replacement expenditures. Major projects completed in the quarter include meeting space renovations at 10 hotels, and restaurant and public space renovations at 4 hotels. For the full year, we expect to spend $280 million to $300 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures and $190 million to $220 million on redevelopment in ROI projects. Another exciting initiative we concluded in the quarter was an agreement with Marriott International to execute a portfolio of transformational brand reinvestment capital projects beginning this year with the San Francisco Marriott Marquis and carrying through the next three years. These portfolio investments will position the targeted hotels to compete better in their respective market and enhance long-term performance. Some of these assets are among the most recognizable in our portfolio, including the San Francisco Marriott Marquis, The New York Marriott Marquis, the Boston Marriott Copley, the Orlando World Center Marriott, and the Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island among others. Marriott has agreed to provide us with priority returns on agreed upon investments, which will result in reduced incentive management fees. Additionally, they will provide operating profit guarantees as protection for the anticipated disruption associated with the incremental spend. This transformational program is expected to increase our total CapEx spend by approximately $150 million to $200 million per year through 2021. We believe this is a great use of our capital. Transformational brand reinvention projects have typically resulted in meaningful increases in RevPAR yield index, which translates to strong improvement in EBITDA. On the operations front, comparable RevPAR increased 1.6% on a constant currency basis, driven by a 1.5% increase in average rate and a 10 basis point increase in occupancy to 81.4%. Third quarter occupancy is the highest since the third quarter of 2000. While our top line performance was in line with expectations and the bottom line results were better than expected, we were impacted by several factors in the quarter. We anticipated the timing of the 4th of July moving to a Wednesday and the Jewish holidays moving from weekends to midweek, but we could not predict the impact of hurricanes Florence and Lane. An active hurricane season affected our Hawaii market in August and our Atlanta and Washington D.C. markets in September. While the D.C. markets did not experience a significant weather impact from Hurricane Florence, local governments in the area declared a state of emergency in advance of the storm which led to cancellations. We estimate that the impact of the hurricanes cost us 30 basis points of RevPAR in the quarter. Year-to-date, comparable RevPAR on a constant currency basis increased 1.9% to $180, driven by a 1 point increase in average room rate and a 70 basis point increase in occupancy to approximately 80%. We've reported adjusted EBITDAre of $344 million for the quarter and adjusted FFO per share of $0.37. Both were significantly above consensus estimates. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDAre is $1.19 billion and FFO per diluted share is $1.34. As we look to the fourth quarter, our group booking pace is very strong with group revenues up 4.5% and projecting to be the strongest quarter of the year. With approximately 98% of our group revenues on the books for 2018 and occupancy levels at all-time highs, we continue to see the booking window extend. While we are early in the 2019 budgeted process and have limited visibility at this time, the global economy continues to exhibit strength and appears supportive of industry growth. The economic indicators we closely follow \u2013 corporate profits, non-residential fixed investment, and consumer confidence \u2013 all remain strong and GDP continues to improve. The pickup in business transient travel continues to gain traction and provides reason for optimism. This is bolstered by continued strong leisure demand, resulting from record levels of consumer confidence and low unemployment. Having said that, we continue to monitor the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, potential global trade wars, rising interest rates and the performance of global equity markets and how that could affect lodging demand for the remainder of the year and into next year. Overall, though, we believe industry fundamentals are on solid ground. Given our year-to-date performance, we are narrowing the range of our full year guidance as follows. Our revised comparable RevPAR guidance is now 1.9% to 2.1% for the full year. The slight reduction to the midpoint of our prior RevPAR guidance is due entirely to the impact of Hurricane Florence and Lane in the third quarter. On the bottom line, we are increasing the midpoint of adjusted EBITDAre by $5 million to $1.55 billion on a revised range of $1.545 billion to $1.555 billion. This translates to an increase in the midpoint of adjusted FFO per share by approximately $0.01 to $1.75 on a revised range of $1.74 to $1.76. Including the $5 million raise to 2018 adjusted EBITDAre this quarter, we have raised guidance by $50 million at the midpoint since our earnings call in February. In closing, we are pleased with another beat and race quarter as it continues to demonstrate the attributes of our premier lodging REIT. We are also pleased that RevPAR will be accelerating this year over 2017 with our revised midpoint 70 basis point higher than the 1.3% comparable RevPAR growth we reported last year. Our diversified portfolio of irreplaceable assets, our unmatched scale and platform, and our investment-grade balance sheet positions us well to continue to outperform our peers in the near, medium, and long term. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael who will discuss our operating performance and our balance sheet in much greater detail. Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim mentioned our scale and platform continue to drive operational outperformance. Let me provide some details on the results for the quarter. Despite the impact of holiday timing and weather events, our comparable RevPAR on a constant-currency basis increased 1.6%, driven by a 1.5% increase in average rate. As we mentioned on the last call, the set up for the quarter was strong, given the group pace we had on the books and it played out as expected, which allowed us to compress business and grow RevPAR predominantly by average rate. Group RevPAR was up 2.3%, led by association business, which was up 8.8%. Additionally, the strong group business enabled our managers to capture more profitable banquet and AV business. Our transient business was led by corporate travelers and business transient revenues increased 2.2%. We continue to see improvements in the business transient traveler as revenues in that segment increased for the third consecutive quarter and we remain optimistic that business travel will remain strong over the course of the remainder of the year, particularly as nonresidential fixed investment and corporate profits continue to project mid-single-digit increases. Looking comprehensively at revenue, total comparable hotel revenues increased 2.8% driven by F&B revenue increase of 5.1%, of which the more profitable banquet and AV business was up 7.6%, and other business increase up 7.6% and other revenues increased 9.4%. For the second consecutive quarter, group turnout was better than expected, which is reflected in the significant banquet spend. Additionally, our asset managers continue working with our property managers to find ways to increase high margin ancillary revenues at our properties. We continue to do a great job improving profitability at our properties and driving comparable EBITDA margin growth. In the third quarter, comparable EBITDA margins grew 50 basis points. Margins benefited from strong productivity gains especially in F&B, an increase in ancillary revenues, reductions in undistributed operating expenses, and a one-time distribution related to the sale of Marriott centralized purchasing company. As we anticipated, we continue to see the benefits from the MI integration take hold this quarter as declines in credit card expenses, loyalty program cost, and IT system costs contributed to the margin expansion. We believe that the benefits from the Marriott-Starwood merger will generate 40 basis points to 50 basis points of incremental margin improvement annually for the near-term. Now, let me spend some time on specific performance in our individual markets. Our best performing domestic markets this quarter were San Francisco, San Antonio, Philadelphia and Miami. The RevPAR growth at our San Francisco hotels exceed our expectations with an increase of 7.5%, driven by a 6% improvement in average rate and a 1.1 percentage point expansion in occupancy. The large sales force city-wide that move from November last year into September this year boosted the entire market and allowed our hotels to drive transient average rate by 9.2%. Our hotels in San Antonio increased RevPAR by 12.8% this quarter exceeding the STR upper-upscale results by 770 basis points. Strong city-wides led the solid corporate group business which contributed to F&B revenue increases of 11.5% in this market. The two hotels in Philadelphia grew RevPAR by 10.4% this quarter, driven predominantly by the Logan's 36% increase in group business, enabling the hotel to reduce discount channels and maximize transient ADR which increased over 15%. Our Philly assets beat STR upper-upscale results by 380 basis points. In Miami, our hotels increased RevPAR by 9.5%, while the STR upper-upscale \u2013 where the STR upper-upscale market declined 8.1%. As you may recall, our Miami Biscayne Bay Marriott had over 200 rooms out of service last year following Hurricane Irma, which are now all back in service. The hotel will continue to benefit from this in the fourth quarter and outperform the market. Looking to markets that were more challenged in the quarter. Our hotels in Washington D.C. experienced a RevPAR decline of 8.6% in the third quarter as weaker city-wides and cancellations related to Hurricane Florence contributed to decline in demand. As Jim mentioned, while the D.C. market did not experience a weather impact, the local governments declared states of emergency in advance of the storm, resulting in cancellations. In addition, there were three fewer city-wides this quarter when compared to the same time last year. In Los Angeles, RevPAR at our hotels decreased 7.7% in the quarter. The hotels were impacted by new supply downtown and with groups that did not repeat this quarter, which meant our managers are required to take more discounted business. In addition, our Westin LAX had difficult comps this year as the hotel benefited from the Marriott LAX renovation last year. In the Florida Gulf Coast, RevPAR at our hotels declined 3.3%, resulting from a 1.5% increase in average rate offset by a 2.9 percentage point decrease in occupancy, due to the tougher comparables to the third quarter last year. As you may recall, certain of our hotels remained open and benefited from hurricane-related business last year. In addition the Ritz-Carlton, Naples Golf Resort had meeting space and ballroom renovations this year. Our New York hotels RevPAR declined 2.8% this quarter with a decline in occupancy of 2.2% and a decline in ADR of 40 basis points. The declines were primarily driven by a decrease in transient revenues of 5.8% this quarter, partially mitigated by strong group business which was up 4.5%. Moving away from our quarterly results and looking to our forecast for the full year, we expect our hotels in Miami, Philadelphia, Maui and San Francisco to outperform. Inversely, we anticipate our hotels in the D.C., Houston, Los Angeles and Atlanta market to underperform. Now, let me spend a little bit of time talking about our capital position. In October, we paid a regular third quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share which represents a yield of approximately 4.2% on our current stock price. In addition, this represents a payout ratio of 46% on our adjusted FFO per share. It remains our policy to pay out 100% of our taxable income to shareholders. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility. We are the only lodging REIT with an investment-grade balance sheet which we are committed to maintaining as we believe it is a prominent differentiator to our peers and provides flexibility, take advantage of value creation opportunities throughout the cycle. As of September 30, 2018, we had unrestricted cash of almost $1.3 billion, and $702 million of available capacity under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Total debt was $4.1 billion with an average maturity of 4.3 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.1%. In addition, we have no debt maturity In addition, we have no debt maturities until 2020. Our leverage ratio is approximately 2 times as calculated under the terms of our credit facility providing a significant dry powder for opportunities to increase long-term shareholder value. As Jim noted, we've been very active on the capital recycling front. Year-to-date, we sold five assets for a total sales price of $1.2 billion. Additionally, we have $1.1 billion under contract, the Westin Grand Central and our pro-rata portion of the Euro JV. Collectively, this $2.3 billion of asset sales, when closed, will have been sold at an approximate EBITDA multiple of 20 times 2018 forecasted EBITDA. Upon closing of the two pending transactions, along with the repayment of the corresponding debt related to the Euro JV, and the payment to our minority partner in the JW Marriott Mexico City, our cash balance will increase by approximately $400 million to approximately $1.6 billion, and our capacity available on our credit facility will increase to $942 million. All of these recent sales and anticipated sales had been reflected in our guidance for 2018. However, to help with modeling for next year, the pro forma effect of our net acquisition and disposition activity is a decrease of $64 million from our 2018 forecast EBITDA. Overall, we are pleased with our strong operating results which enabled us to increase our adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per share guidance for the year. Our performance continues to demonstrate that owning a portfolio of iconic, irreplaceable and geographically diversified hotels having the scale and platform to drive value, combined with a powerful investment grade balance sheet, is a strong strategic position to deliver significant value to our stockholders over the long term. This concludes our prepared remarks and we are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible. Please limit yourself to one question. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Anthony Powell from Barclays. Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. You're building a pretty significant cash balance and investment capacity balance. What's the timeframe for investing in that capacity and if you are unable to transact on an acquisition of a hotel over the next few quarters, would you move quickly to buybacks or are you comfortable holding that cash for long period of time? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Anthony, thank you for the question. As we think about our capital recycling activity, I do want to point out that the assets that we sold have achieved superior pricing. And they have resulted in following through on two key strategic objectives that we set out about two years ago, when I first became CEO, and that's reducing our exposure in New York City to profitability-challenged assets and really becoming more focused on the U.S. So we've accomplished that in a very attractive manner. With respect to use of proceeds, as we sit back and think about reallocating that capital, we believe that there are three areas that make sense for us. One is buying assets to further upgrade the overall quality and growth and free cash flow generation of the Host portfolio. The second is investing in our portfolio where we can drive meaningful returns by reinventing properties such as \u2013 we'll talk about later I'm sure the Marriott transaction that we did \u2013 or buying back stock. So I don't think that we are in a rush by any means today to get the capital deployed. I will point out that we have not been shy about buying back stock in the past. Between 2015, 2016, we repurchased $890 million stock at an average price of about $17.15. So as we think about deploying capital, we really do run the screen on an acquisition or investing in our portfolio relative to buying back stock at current prices and that drives our decision making. Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Maybe just one more follow-up. I think there were some media reports a few months ago about you were thinking about selling a large portfolio of non-core assets at presumably higher cap rates than your recent deals, is that something you would still consider or have you been able to generate enough proceeds with these recent large, low cap rate transactions? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Anthony, we're not out to generate proceeds for the sake of generating proceeds. We're out to opportunistically take advantage of dislocation in the market and we start internally for every asset that we consider selling by doing our own internal hold value and that hold value takes into consideration our view of the likely performance of that asset over the near term, looking out over a 10-year timeframe. But obviously, it's a little difficult to forecast anything over 10 years. But certainly over the next three to five years, you can get a pretty good handle on it taking into account that the full capital requirements of any particular property and then, just kind of get back at what we consider to be appropriate discount rates using a market residual cap rate. So, that's where it starts on dispositions. The same way we look at acquisitions. There are always a lot of media reports out there. We don't comment on anything until the deal is either done or we have a hard money contract. Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Morning, Chris. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning. So, you're now, it seems like, pretty complete on the strategy to reduce New York. So, I guess the question is as you look across the board, does that \u2013 are there certain markets or segments where you'd like more exposure with a higher transaction? You picked up a couple resorts. You picked up San Francisco. Is there anything that kind of stands out to you, again, either market or segment wise? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: We continue to like the resort market, Chris, given the dearth of new supply that that's being built in those markets today. It's particularly the type of properties that we feel we are very good at owning given the scale and access to data and information that we have which differentiates us from others. The business information systems, the business intelligent systems allow us to really understand where we can drive value in resort properties. So, we'll continue to be focused on resorts. The other area that we feel we are differentiated in many ways is in big boxes. Again, the same metrics apply. We have an incredible database of information that allows us to benchmark any potential acquisition against the performance of our existing assets, and from a supply perspective, it is very low. I think it's less than 40 basis points. So those are the two areas that we'll be focused on. Additionally, we will continue to think about assets that will outperform the rest of the portfolio, assets that are more sustainable from a CapEx perspective to fund capital needs out of the FF&E reserve, and thus will result in higher free cash flow generation. Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Very good. Thanks, Jim. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure thing. Operator : And our next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning, everyone. I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit more about what you guys are seeing on the Marriott integration front. I think last quarter you were very clear in your comments. Some other peers or competitors are out discussing that they are continuing to see some latent disruption issues. And then also if you could just kind of hit on the union point, if you have any hotels exposed, and if that's dragging down your 4Q expectations at all. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure, Shaun. Let me talk about the union point first and then I'll get to the Marriott integration question that you asked. We had experienced strikes at our Westin in Seattle and the Chicago River \u2013 Westin Chicago River North property. Both of those strikes have been settled. The union is currently striking in San Francisco and in Boston. We are monitoring the situation very closely and have a good handle on what's happening at the hotels. I am not in a position, given the sensitivity of the negotiations, to talk about whether performance is up or performance is down at either property. I will tell you that we've taken the likely performance of those hotels into consideration as we've developed our forecasts for the balance of this year and our full year guidance. Now, with respect to Marriott integration, we continue to monitor it very closely. Of course, there were a few hiccups along the way, but really no measurable negative impact. What distinguishes Host from others who may have experienced more disruption is first, the scale of our portfolio, but really, the size of our hotels. Our properties have our sales management teams on site. So, there was not a need to transition those sales teams to regional offices, and the attendant disruption that came from that. And I understand there was disruption for others, but I can tell you we saw no measurable impact at our properties. And more importantly, on a very positive front is that now our Starwood legacy hotels have access to 30,000 additional business-to-business accounts that Marriott had. And we've seen benefits already inuring to the Starwood legacy properties as a result of having access to that account information. So we receive benefits on the top line and lower cost on the bottom line as well. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Michael Bellisario from Baird. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Good morning, Mike. Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Good morning. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Just wanted to talk on \u2013 and ask on 2019 outlook \u2013 maybe one just on group pace and how you're seeing that shape up for next year. But then just high level, how you're thinking about the macro backdrop heading into next year, especially relative to the performance that you guys have achieved this year? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure. I'd talk about the macro backdrop a bit. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we think that industry fundamentals are on solid grounds today, and we're optimistic that steady as she goes will continue. The hotels are running at record occupancies. All of the indicators that we focus on non-residential fixed investment, consumer confidence, GDP, corporate profits, they're all strong. As I mentioned, our third quarter occupancy was the highest it's been since 2000. So the table is set for continued growth. We're also and have been keeping a keen eye on supply. And while we'll have some new supply next year, it's manageable. And we expect it will see just a bit more in 2020 and then supply taper down. So our view is steady as she goes. Things are looking pretty positive next year given the fact that we're 100 months into the cycle right now. So that said, we are keeping an eye on other things. We're keeping an eye on the impact the potential trade wars could have on the U.S. economy and U.S. businesses and business travel, the rising U.S. dollar, it's been bouncing around quite a bit, and rising interest rates and the volatility in the stock market. So, we're optimistic, but we are being thoughtful and being very aware with what's happening around us. With respect to 2019 group pace, we are a bit behind in group room nights. As I mentioned, the hotels are running at record occupancies. However, our total revenue on the books between group room nights and F&B revenues is about flat to where it was this year. A part of that is being driven by fewer city-wides in a few markets. Boston, Chicago, San Diego and Washington, D.C. Additionally, we will see a little less group pace in a market like Orlando and a market like New York. The New York Marquis. But keep in mind what I said we're getting \u2013 that's because those two hotels will be part of the Marriott branch transformation program. Really important to understand that that's not going to impact our bottom line because we are getting disruption guarantees. So we feel that the portfolio is really positioned to produce optimal revenue mix. We are not concerned about the lack of city-wide in the markets that I referenced. We feel good about what we have been seeing on short-term corporate group bookings and strong leisure and transient demand. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That's all helpful. And just one really quick housekeeping item just \u2013 what are the tax implications of bringing back the capital from the Euro JV relative to the $505 million of net proceeds you mentioned in that 17 times EBITDA multiple? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. Well, let's start with Europe first, just to understand the valuation of the sale and then we'll bring it back to today. So, our 33% interest was valued at $700 million. That valued the entire portfolio 2.1 \u2013 \u20ac700 million. That valued the entire portfolio \u20ac2.1 billion and the valuation on our interests was 17 times EBITDA. That is \u2013 the capital that we're bringing back, a portion of it is a capital gain and we will make a determination as to how we deal with that capital gain. We obviously had two options. One option is to distribute. The other option is to pay taxes on it and retain the cash. So as we get into planning for next year and the budgeting process, I think we have to make this decision by the end of January and that's the timeframe within which we will operate. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Smedes Rose from Citi. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to just ask a little bit about some of the parameters around the performance guarantees that Marriott is providing? And I guess \u2013 first, are they allocated on a per asset basis or is it a sort of a large sum that you can draw from depending on the amount of disruption? And then also, as the Marquis San Francisco kind of being retroactively added to this pool now? I couldn't tell from your opening remarks, if that was in that set or not? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Sure, Smedes. Let me let me back up before I answer your specific questions and maybe give you get a bit of color on the program. I think I was pretty clear in the prepared remarks as to why we think this is a good use of capital. But it might be helpful to frame it so that so then you can see how the priority returns and the disruption operating guarantees work. So as we step back and \u2013 yeah, San Francisco was, I would say, the \u2013 as we call it the Bell Cow here. The property needed to be reinvented. It's a main-in-main asset and one of the best markets in the country. So we had talked with Marriott about what could we do together to really \u2013 I'll use a word that you hear other times, really make that hotel relevant. To make it number one in its competitive set in the market. And let me stop on competitive set for a moment, because our objective on every brand transformation project we undertake is to bring that property to number one in its competitive set. And we had worked out a deal with Marriott where they would provide us disruption guarantees and a priority return on the San Francisco Marriott Marquis. So when we saw how that would work and we had the framework of a deal, we sat back and took a look at other assets in our portfolio that were going to need to be renovated over the next several years \u2013 beyond the next several years. And we looked at the total CapEx spend that was going to be required on those assets. Our experience has been that if you completely transform a property, you can expect a meaningful lift in RevPAR yield index, somewhere around 3 to 5 points, and I think that's on the conservative side. But those are the numbers that we looked at. So by pulling those renovation projects forward and increasing the spend over what we would have spent, but really when we get into one of the assets, we're going to completely renovate the entire property including : activating the lobby; activating the bar area; activating food and beverage; upgrading fitness facilities; doing tub-to-shower conversions in the guest rooms; in appropriate markets doing hardscape flooring in the guest rooms. To really make these hotels fit with what people are looking for today, and as I said, make them number one in their set. And we came to an agreement that Marriott would provide us with additional priority returns on our investment, which serve to reduce their incentive management fees. And additionally, it's on a property-by-property basis. Now to get to your question about disruption, to provide operating performance guarantees, to deal with the anticipated disruption on a hotel-by-hotel basis. And I want to point out that that is unique to anybody in the industry. This is capital 70% of it, plus we would have to spend anyway. But we are getting compensated for doing this, and we're really excited about it. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough, thank you. Then just Michael you mentioned the dividend paid in October as we head into yearend, would you expect to have to kind of true up in order to distribute 100% of taxable income above the $0.20? Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. I think \u2013 I'm sorry. Yes. Again, our policy is to get 100% of our taxable income. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So you would expect this special dividend in addition to the regular dividend in the fourth quarter or... Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: We can't comment on that at this point. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Hey, good morning, guys. I'm going to waste a bullet here on a follow up to Smedes question on the guarantee in terms of the mechanics. So when we talk about full operating profit protection, is that based on a prior time period or some sort of baseline projection for the asset just in terms of how we come up with that number? And then can you also walk us through the timing on the spending. Is it pretty ratable across the next four years in terms of that incremental $150 million to $200 million or is it more concentrated in certain periods over that four years? Just help us in terms of the modeling mechanics there. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. So let me clarify one thing, Rich. When we're talking about four years, it starts with 2018 because the Marriott Marquis in San Francisco, as we've talked about before, is a $110 million brand transformation. So it's 2019 and the next three years, and it is ratable over that period of time. We spend, on average, roughly $500 million a year on maintenance, repair and replacement FF&E. And we've been doing that now for 25 years. Part of enterprise analytics is a group, it's capital financial planning. And every year, as we develop our capital plans, we determine what the attendant disruption is going to be and we factor that into our budget. So, we have really solid data across all markets with all types of assets, and have a very good handle on what a room's renovation is going to do to the bottom line, what a ballroom renovation is going to do the bottom line, what repositioning the lobby will do to the bottom line. And that's how we developed the anticipated disruption in connection with the brand transformation project and that is the amount of guarantee that we negotiated with Marriott. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Okay, Jim. That is helpful color. Let me ask you one follow-up here. We haven't spent a whole lot of time on labor expense on this call as I think we have in the past. Can you \u2013 I know you said kind of a 3% to 4% CAGR is probably a good run rate for the next few years. Is there a way to break that down across East Coast, West Coast or union versus nonunion hotels, just so we understand the differentiation there as you roll up to the aggregate? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. There's really not, Rich. I think it really does vary by market and it's across the board and it's not consistent in any given market. It's really property by property. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to go back to some of your group comments, because I think last quarter you were seeing good production in terms of what you had on the books for 2019, as far as the bookings in the quarter for 2019. So to be a bit behind on group room nights in 2019, that seems like it's lower from where you were before, but can you just confirm if that's the case and maybe talk about why that is? And then if you could also just tell us your total group production in the quarter for all future periods? Thank you. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, what I talked about last quarter was activity in the quarter. What I'm talking about today is actual \u2013 use it in a different way, pace \u2013 and what we're seeing from a pace perspective. And I don't think that there has really been any change quarter-to-quarter from what we've been seeing. We've been focused on the assets in markets where there are weak citywides. I will tell you this that our pace for 2020 and 2023 right now is up 6.4%. So we're very bullish as we see the booking window continue to extend and beyond 2019 and into 2020 and beyond. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And just a quick housekeeping for me. Can you just tell us how much your competitive industry supply in your markets is up this year and next year, and then you had mentioned an acceleration into 2020. So that would be helpful to get that year as well. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: I would say this year, next year roughly 2.3% to 2.5%, and then 2020, we're seeing a decline. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : A decline. Okay. Thank you. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. A decline in 2020. Right. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Most of my questions have been answered. I guess maybe just circling back from a moment to the Marriott deal just to better understand that. And I certainly understand from your perspective why you do it. It seems like a great deal if you have a guarantee to be made whole kind of well into the cycle here. But just to understand how it works when we think about those properties and how performance might compare next year versus this year. When you talked about the process of kind of estimating the disruption impact and then Marriott would sort of guarantee that amount of disruption impact. But I assume if performance is down because of disruption, one can always debate sort of what the cause of it is. So I guess I just want to understand, is the guarantee that basically your first x percent of decline, whether that's 5% or 15% or 20%, whatever, that from the EBITDA in 2018 that you report, that the first x percent of that decline you're going to be made whole. Is that the way to think about? So from an EBITDA perspective, we wouldn't even know there's anything going on at those properties unless you dropped below a certain amount of decline. Is that the right way to think about it? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Robin, no. I think it is based on the anticipated disruption. So, you can paint two scenarios. One scenario is that we have a meaningful reacceleration in top line performance and an attendant increase in flow-through in EBITDA at a hotel that's part of this program. The operating guarantee still gets paid, okay? So it's regardless. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : So, there is less... James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: And it goes the other way as well. If the EBITDA declines, the operating guarantee is set at a fixed amount. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. So, you'll make that amount. In theory, if there were no disruption, you would have an increase in EBITDA from that property because you're going to get paid that amount anyway. Is that the way to think about it? James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's the right way to think about it. Yes. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And I guess, I don't know, and maybe this is really a question for Marriott, because again it seems like a great deal for Host, and I guess I'm just trying to think about, the Host, more typically, you will do renovations and add meeting space and ballroom space, and you do this at properties all the time without typically getting that kind of guarantee. So, I guess just trying to understand what's different now. Was it just a decision on Host's part that you didn't want to have CapEx pick up to the level that maybe some of these properties required or like, I guess, why the change in what is sort of typically the case for kind of who bears the cost of renovations and the risk of disruption and all of that. I guess what's sort of behind that? Thanks. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: A couple of things, Robin. Our renovations have typically been staged over a number of years. To paint the backdrop, you do rooms in a property in 2018, and then in 2019 or 2020 you might touch the meeting space. And then you're going to get into the F&B outlets in the lobby, and then you're right back to doing your rooms again. So the thought here was we accelerate the spend. We're going to spend a little more than we typically would have. But when we are done in a compressed period of time, we're going to have a fully renovated hotel that plays very well to the consumers and will clearly be number one in its competitive set. I think what's important to Marriott is the fact that we own the best Marriotts in the system. Some of the assets that I mentioned, the New York Marriott Marquis, Orlando World Center, Boston Marriott Copley San Francisco and down the list. And I think from a brand perspective, to be able to showcase what brand transformation means, they've undertaken this exercise in other properties like the Charlotte Marriott, the Portland Marriott and a few others along the way. But to be able to showcase these assets, I think and I'm hopeful that other owners of Marriott hotels will follow down the same path. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And that is all the time we have for today's Q&A session. I would like to hand the conference back over to our speakers for any concluding remarks. James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.: Well, thanks everyone for joining us on the call. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our third quarter results and outlook with you. We look forward to talking to you in San Francisco. And if you're not in San Francisco in February, to discuss our yearly 2018 results, as well as providing you with more insight into 2019. Have a great day. Operator : And once again ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation today.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Gee Lingberg : Thanks, Evony. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filing with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide his remarks on our fourth quarter and full-year results, our 2018 achievements, including the acquisition of the One Hotel South Beach and conclude with our capital allocation strategy and outlook for 2019. Michael Bluhm, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide commentary on our fourth quarter and full-year performance, including markets, margins, balance sheet and our guidance for 2019. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. James Risoleo : Thank you, Gee, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report another quarter that exceeded our internal expectations on both the top and bottom line and beat consensus estimates for adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per diluted share. We finished the year strong with fourth quarter comparable constant dollar RevPAR growth of 2.3% and an increase in comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 45 basis points. Adjusted EBITDAre was $372 million for the quarter and adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.43, beating consensus estimates by $8 million and $0.02, respectively. 2018 was a solid year for Host with comparable RevPAR growing 2% and gross margin growing an impressive 60 basis points. This resulted in a 3.4% EBITDAre expansion to $1.562 billion and a 4.7% increase in adjusted FFO per share to $1.77. We had a consistent beat and raise year with margins, EBITDAre and FFO, all coming in well ahead of the top-end of our initial guidance provided last February. We beat the midpoint of our original RevPAR guidance by 50 basis points, margins by 80 basis points, EBITDAre by $62 million or 4% and adjusted FFO per share by $0.12 or 7.3%. These strong results continue to underscore the advantages of our geographically diversified portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels, our unprecedented scale and platform to drive internal and external growth and the power and flexibility of our investment-grade balance sheet. Together, these key pillars form the foundation of Host, the premier lodging REIT. As noted in our press release, 2018 was an incredibly active and successful year across several fronts. In addition to achieving industry-leading margin improvements, we advanced our long-term strategic vision and executed on several important initiatives that we believe better position our irreplaceable portfolio to continue outperforming the industry and creating value for Host Hotels' investors. We sold non-core assets, including those profitability-challenged in New York as well as our international assets, all at attractive pricing and reinvested a portion of that capital into higher growth, low CapEx need assets to create long-term stockholder value. On the disposition front, we actively reshaped the composition of our portfolio by following through on two key initiatives we setup early on in my tenure as CEO; reducing our exposure to New York and exiting our international assets to focus our attention on the U.S., where we have the greatest scale and competitive advantage. In total, we executed on $2.2 billion of non-core asset sales, since the beginning of 2018, at a combined EBITDA multiple of 21x. As it relates to New York, on January 9, we closed on the previously announced sale of The Westin New York Grand Central for $302 million, inclusive of the FF&E reserve. With the completion of that sale and including the New York Marriott Marquis retail and signage, we sold over $1.1 billion in the New York market or 25x EBITDA. As a result, we have reduced our percentage of hotel EBITDA from New York to less than 7%, significantly eliminating our exposure to profitability-challenged assets in the market. On the international front, we closed on the sale of our 33% interest in our European joint venture to our two former partners, for a growth asset value of our interest of approximately \u20ac700 million and an EBITDA multiple of 17x on 2018 results. After accounting for fund level debt, we subsequently used a portion of the net proceeds of approximately \u20ac435 million to repay the outstanding \u20ac207 million draw on our credit facility, which was drawn to hedge our equity interest in the venture. We also sold the JW Mexico City for $183 million or approximately a 15x EBITDA multiple on 2018 forecasted results. We previously held a 52% interest in the hotel in a joint venture with Marriott International. As a result of these two sales, approximately 1% of our EBITDA now comes from outside the country with only two hotels in Canada and three hotels in Brazil. 2018 was also an exciting year from an acquisition standpoint, as we further enhanced our irreplaceable portfolio by adding four world-class assets. As many of you know, we purchased three iconic and irreplaceable hotels from Hyatt in March of 2018; the Andaz Maui, Grand Hyatt San Francisco and Hyatt Regency Coconut Point in Florida. These hotels had outperformed our underwriting and based on our 2019 budget, are currently yielding 70 basis points higher than where we initially purchased hotels last spring. This translates into a 14% growth in net operating income. In addition, and as noted in our press release, we recently closed on the acquisition of 1 Hotel South Beach in Miami, Florida for $610 million. This extraordinary resort is located on prime beachfront real estate in the vibrant South Beach area Miami Beach, has no near-term CapEx needs and carries a RevPAR of over $488 and total RevPAR of $764, making it one of the top three in our portfolio. Additionally, it is LEED-certified, has some of the largest guest rooms in our portfolio, over 160,000 square feet of meeting space, restaurants, pools, luxury retail space and other amenities. The property generated $45.8 million of EBITDA in 2018 or 13.3x our purchase price. This equates to $107,000 per key. Based on our 2019 budget, the purchase price equates to 13x EBITDA and EBITDA per key of over $109,000. The 1 Hotel is expected to add $36 million in EBITDA and $0.05 of FFO per share in 2019. Our ability to convert high EBITDA multiple asset sales of non-core, high CapEx and profitability-challenged hotels into a resort of this caliber, was materially improved the overall portfolio, is an excellent example of disciplined and prudent capital recycling. Another exciting accomplishment in 2018 was our agreement with Marriott International to execute a portfolio of transformational capital projects, beginning last year with the San Francisco Marriott Marquis and carrying through 2021. As we have described these portfolio investments will position the targeted hotels, which are some of the most notable in our portfolio to compete even better in their respective markets with the goal of enhancing long-term performance and becoming number one in their competitive sets. Notably, Marriott will provide operating profit guarantees as protection for the anticipated disruption associated with the incremental spend and increased priority returns on the agreed upon investments, which will result in reduced incentive management fees. We believe this is a great high return use of shareholders' capital, as transformational capital projects have typically resulted in meaningful increases in RevPAR yield index, which translate to strong improvement in EBITDA. Turning to our capital structure. We entered 2019 with the strongest balance sheet in the Company's history, providing us with substantial flexibility to continue executing on our strategic initiatives. Michael will discuss this in further detail, but on a high level with leverage at only 1.8x, over $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash after accounting for the sale of The Westin Grand Central and the acquisition of 1 Hotel South Beach and $945 million of capacity available under our credit facility as of the end of the year, we are well positioned to continue driving stockholder value. Finally, in 2018, we listened to your need for greater transparency and insight into our business. We overhauled our investor presentation and added enhanced supplemental financial information that provides property level detail into the top hotels that drive our overall performance. Looking forward, we are off to a strong start to 2019 with the acquisition of the 1 Hotel South Beach and the sale of The Westin Grand Central. In addition to acquisition and disposition opportunities, we will continue to mine the portfolio for value enhancement projects, including the extension of ground leases and looking for redevelopment opportunities where we can either take advantage of underutilized spaced or redevelop an area from the ground up. As we contemplate future capital allocation, we continue to be very disciplined with respect to both our underwriting and balance sheet position. Given the $1.2 billion of cash on hand and 3x being the high-end of our leverage target range, we have total investment capacity of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. We do not intend to move higher than our targeted leverage range, nor do we intend to invest beyond that capacity. As there has been recent speculation about Host, I want to be clear that while we are always open to opportunistically looking at value enhancing assets, we are not focusing on pursuing large scale portfolio acquisitions at this time. We are very happy using our current investment capacity to make smart, targeted add-on acquisitions, like the 1 Hotel South Beach announced today, to invest in our portfolio, as we are doing with the Marriott transformational capital program or to buyback our stock. We remain focused on acquisitions that have a high return and complement our iconic irreplaceable portfolio. We are thrilled with the portfolio we have today, which we believe is the best in the industry, but we'll continue to opportunistically prune it to maximize value for shareholders. As always, our team is laser focused on maximizing portfolio operations in what remains a stable operating environment with positive fundamentals, albeit in an environment that is now 10 years into the current cycle. As we sit here today, the U.S. economy continues to exhibit strength and appears supportive of industry growth. Importantly, the economic indicators we follow closely, including corporate profits, non-residential fixed investment and consumer confidence, while slightly lower than last year, remain quite strong relative to historical levels. Specifically, corporate travel demand improved in 2018 and is anticipated to remain stable in 2019. And while the growth in non-residential fixed investment is anticipated to slow, it is still healthy and we anticipate it will remain that way. We expect leisure travel to continue to grow, but at a slower pace, supported by strong consumer income growth, solid employment and healthy sentiment. On a macro level, we continue to monitor the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, the ongoing global trade dispute including its impact on businesses' willingness to invest and the performance of the overall global economy. While a modest 2019 GDP deceleration is why we anticipated as the near-term benefits of the Tax Cut paid and the government shutdown gave the industry a slower start than we otherwise would have expected, we believe that overall industry fundamentals are on solid ground. Taking all that into account, our initial guidance, our comparable RevPAR growth of 0% to 2% and comparable EBITDA margin guidance of minus 50 to plus 10 basis points results in adjusted EBITDAre of $1.515 billion to $1.580 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.72 to $1.81. While our headline RevPAR is impacted by approximately 45 basis points from the incremental capital expenditures we are making this year related to the Marriott transformational capital program, because of the operating profit guarantees we are receiving from Marriott, we were able to mitigate the impact on the bottom line. Included in our EBITDA guidance is an estimate of $23 million for the operating profit guarantee, $10 million of which is associated with comparable RevPAR. We remain focused on our bottom line results, which we continue to think will set the standard for the lodging REIT space. Given our optimal group and transient mix, we are pleased with our position going into 2019. 2018 was a record year for group room nights, with over 5 million group rooms booked for the year. For 2019, total group revenue pace is up 1.4%. We continue to see the group booking window extend and revenue pace is up almost 7% for the period 2020 to 2023. From a capital standpoint, we anticipate spending between $235 million and $275 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures and between $315 million and $350 million of redevelopment and ROI projects this year. The increase over last year is primarily due to the Marriott transformational capital program for which we are being well compensated. Some major renovation projects to be completed this year includes the San Francisco Marriott Marquis, New York Marriott Downtown, Coronado Island Marriott Resort, the Santa Clara Marriott and the Whitley in Buckhead Atlanta. Before handing the call over to Michael, I would like to reiterate that we are very pleased with yet another beat quarter, as it under - again underscores the strength and advantages of our premier lodging REIT. We are also pleased with our ability to continue to outperform on margins, despite the fact that we are in a lower RevPAR growth environment with strong employment. Our diversified portfolio of irreplaceable assets, our unmatched scale and platform and our investment-grade balance sheet, all position us to continue to outperform in the near, medium and long-term. We will remain disciplined in our approach to capital allocation. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael, who will discuss our operating performance and balance sheet in greater detail. Michael Bluhm : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, all of us at Host are pleased with our beat-and-raise performance in 2018 and a strong finish to the year. Through active portfolio management over the last 12 months, we've ensured that the Company is stronger than ever and well positioned for continued profitable growth. With that, let's discuss the details of our results. Our comparable RevPAR for the fourth quarter on a constant currency basis increased 2.3%, driven by a 2% increase in average rate and a 20 basis point increase in occupancy. Stronger than expected group business enabled us to compress business and grow RevPAR predominantly by average rate. We expanded our comparable hotel EBITDA margins by 45 basis points in the quarter, due to a combination of our internal initiatives and the continued benefits accruing to us from the Marriott-Starwood merger. These results led to adjusted EBITDAre of $372 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.43, which exceeded both our internal and consensus estimates. For the full-year, comparable RevPAR on a constant currency basis increased 2% with an impressive margin expansion of 60 basis points. Adjusted EBITDAre increased 3.4% to $1.562 billion and adjusted FFO per share increased by 4.7% to $1.77. Turning to the segments of our business, while some transient room nights were displaced by group, the holiday calendar was less favorable for transient business travel. Group demand exceeded our expectations as revenues grew 5.6% in the quarter, driven by volume growth of 2.9% and a 2.6% increase in average rate. October and December saw significant group room nights with corporate and other group revenues growing 4.8% and 14%, respectively in the quarter. Finally, our asset managers and enterprise analytics team in collaboration with our managers, continued to drive comparable hotel EBITDA margin growth and generate impressive profitability at our properties at this stage in the cycle. In the fourth quarter and for the full-year, EBITDA margins grew 45 basis points and 60 basis points, respectively due to productivity gains in the rooms and F&B department and synergies from the Marriott-Starwood integration in particular reduce travel agency commissions and loyalty program expenses. We continue to believe the benefits from the Marriott-Starwood merger will generate 40 basis points to 50 basis points of incremental margin improvement annually for the near-term. Turning to our individual markets. Our best performing domestic markets were Miami, San Antonio, San Diego and Seattle, all of which had double-digit RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter. RevPAR at a Miami hotels increased over 31%. The significant outperformance was due to the 200-plus rooms at the Miami Biscayne Bay Marriott that came back online after being out of service last year following Hurricane Irma. The Miami hotels improved average rate by 8.5% and expanded occupancy by 13.8 percentage points through strength in both transient and group business, which also contributed to the strong increase in food and beverage revenues of 22% this quarter. Our hotels in San Antonio grew RevPAR by 14.4% this quarter. Strong citywide led to solid group business that resulted in the ability to drive transient average rate of 8.6% and an increase in food and beverage revenue of 20%. The hotels in San Diego improved RevPAR by 11.7% this quarter, driven by the business generated from a large citywide and additional short-term transient in government-related business. The 24% increase in group business enabled our hotels to maximize transient average rate, which increased 7.7%. In Seattle, our hotels increased RevPAR 11.6%. Strong group business at our hotels which improved over 17% this quarter enabled our manager to drive the transient average rate growth of 8.7%. Now looking to markets that were more challenged in the quarter. Our hotels in Atlanta experienced a RevPAR decline of 9.2%. This was primarily driven by the conversion of the Ritz-Carlton in Buckhead for the Whitley. In Orlando, RevPAR declined 6.8% this quarter with an occupancy decline of 5 percentage points and average rate increase of 70 basis points. The Orlando World Center Marriott had difficult comparisons to last year because of the hotel benefited from the post Hurricane Irma business last year and some of its competitors had rooms out of service for renovations during the fourth quarter of 2017. Washington D.C. experienced a RevPAR decline of 3.3% in the fourth quarter, as attendance from citywides were lower than anticipated, hindering our ability to drive higher rated transient business and requiring the hotels to take more discounted business. Moving to 2019, we expect markets such as the Florida Gulf Coast, Atlanta, Hawaii and Miami to outperform the portfolio from below average supply growth and continued strength in corporate and leisure demand and strong citywides. Conversely, we expect Seattle, Boston and D.C. to underperform the portfolio due to above average supply or weak citywide calendars. Moving to our balance sheet. In January, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, which included a special dividend of $0.05 per share, bringing the total dividends for the year to $0.85. This represents a yield of approximately 5% on our current stock price and a payout ratio of 48% on our 2018 adjusted FFO per share. In addition, we announced a first quarter dividend of $0.20 per share. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility. We are the only lodging REIT with an investment-grade balance sheet, which we are committed to, maintaining as we believe it, is a prominent differentiator, relative to our peers and provides flexibility to take advantage of value creation opportunities throughout the cycle. At December 31, 2018, we had unrestricted cash of $1.5 billion, not including $213 million in the FF&E escrow reserve, and $945 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed on the sale of The Westin Grand Central and the acquisition of the 1 Hotel South Beach Miami. The net effect of these transactions is a decrease to our cash balance of $308 million, resulting in unrestricted cash of $1.2 billion as we sit here today. Total debt at the end of the year was $3.8 billion with a weighted average maturity of 4.2 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%. In addition, we have no debt maturities until 2020. Our leverage ratio at the end of 2018 is approximately 1.6x as calculated under the terms of our credit facility, providing a significant dry powder for opportunities to increase long-term shareholder value including potential acquisitions, organic investments and/or share repurchases. Now, let me take a few minutes to discuss some assumptions included in our 2019 guidance. Our comparable RevPAR guidance for the year is 0% to 2%. Notably, we estimate a 45 basis point impact of RevPAR due to the renovation disruption related to the Marriott transformational capital projects. As Jim mentioned, without this impact, the midpoint of our RevPAR guidance would have been approximately 1.45%, which is mitigated by $10 million of the operating profit guarantees that has been included in our comparable hotel EBITDA. For 2019, we expect to receive a total of $23 million of Marriott's operating profit guarantees for both comp and non-comp transformational capital projects, which have been included in our guidance for EBITDA. In addition, our outsized leverage to the Marriott-Starwood integration along with our internal initiatives from our asset management and enterprise analytics team are also driving forecasted margin outperformance. At the midpoint, a decline of only 20 basis points on RevPAR growth of 1% is quite impressive, given the current environment of wage and benefit increases. Lastly, keep in mind; we generally earn 25% to 26% of our total EBITDA in the first quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our strong operating results, which meaningfully be our initial guidance provided last February. Our performance continues to demonstrate that owning a portfolio of iconic, irreplaceable and geographically diversified hotels, having the scale and platform to drive value, combined with a powerful investment-grade balance sheet, creates a strong strategic position to deliver significant value to our stockholders over the long-term. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure that we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Anthony Powell : Hi, good morning, everyone. You made it pretty clear that you are not focused on large scale portfolio deals right now. How many more deals like the 1 South Beach are out there? What kind of pipeline do you have for acquisitions and how confident are you in your ability to deploy that $2 billion to $2.5 billion of capacity over the next couple of years? James Risoleo : Anthony, I'm glad you picked up on the fact that we're not interested in large scale portfolio of acquisitions. With respect to the pipeline, there are always transactions, there are always opportunities that present themselves, there are opportunities that we go after - that aren't on the market. So we will continue to look for assets that fit our profile. We will be disciplined in our underwriting criteria and we will be opportunistic in investing going forward. So it's very difficult to talk hypothetically about any deal. But we have a number of assets that are in the pipeline that we're evaluating today and we'll just see if any of those pencil out. I can tell you with respect to the 1 South Beach, we've been working on that deal for two years. So we are very patient and we wait for the right opportunities to come to us. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Please go ahead. Michael Bellisario : Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to focus on the South Beach deal. Could you maybe give us your view on that market or the Miami market broadly, your outlook and then kind of your underwriting assumptions for that asset in 2019 and 2020, because it looks like you're not assuming much growth there? James Risoleo : Yes, couple things about South Beach, Michael. It's the second best performing - over the last 20 years, second best performing RevPAR market in the country, only following the Florida Keys; Key West in particular in the surrounding islands. So we are very bullish on the Miami Beach market. It's really, you know, there are multiple demand drivers that drive business into that market. For the 1 Hotel in particular, it's a mix of high-rated leisure business and high-rated corporate group. The segmentation is roughly 75% leisure, 25% group. It's a terrific hotel and we would expect the market to continue to exhibit growth. You're right; we were conservative in our underwriting. I pointed out, what the hotel did last year, $45.8 million in EBITDA and we're roughly, call it $46.7 million this year. We were thoughtful about trends. We want to make certain that we put a budget out there that we're very comfortable with and that is achievable if not beatable and we're excited about some other things that are happening in that market. In late 2019, the Convention Center will reopen, which we think is going to serve to drive additional demand into the South Beach market, into our hotel in particular. We're also have underwritten, but haven't included it in our numbers, going to be developing a beach club at the hotel. We have a fantastic beach there. I think it's the best beach on South Beach hands down, 600 foot of white sand beach. So we think putting the beach club there will enhance topline revenues. And additionally, we will go into the property as we do on all of our assets and look for additional ways to enhance topline revenues and to bring efficiencies to the bottom line. Lastly, I would just add that the Super Bowl is being held in Miami in 2020, so we feel confident about how 2020 is going to perform as well. So we have been conservative. We think that's the right way to approach the business today. Operator : Moving next to Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask also on the 1 Hotel, you mentioned that you'd been negotiating for the last two years and I'm just wondering if you could just talk about a little more about the origins of the deal and were there other bidders at the table and it seems like a fairly favorable multiple for such a large luxury asset. I'd just be interested in hearing a little more color on the background, how you were able to get it? James Risoleo : Sure, Smedes. I wouldn't say negotiating for two years, I would say we started our quest of the project two years ago and there were other players that were interested in the hotel, high net worth individuals, family offices, offshore interest primarily from the Middle East. At the end of the day, we distinguish ourselves above and beyond everyone else. And we're delighted to be associated with this hotel and with the 1 brand. So we bring an institutional pedigree to the property and to the 1 brand going forward. So that's all I can say. I cannot give you dynamic on other bidders and their views of the world. I can only talk about how we view it. Operator : Next we'll move to Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please go ahead. William Crow : Good morning, Jim. Two part on RevPAR growth, like ex the renovation disruption, you said 1.45% midpoint for this year, should we be happy with that? I mean, it feels like that's pretty conservative to start the year and maybe that's the case, but the second part is, if you could just talk about how the renovations will progress through 2020? And is it going to be a greater impact or lesser impact as we think about next year? James Risoleo : So I think you should be happy with the - call it a midpoint of 1.5% out of the box and that's how I would look at it. As I mentioned, we had a great year last year. We saw 2.3% RevPAR growth in the quarter. We actually saw a pickup in group in the fourth quarter that gives us confidence. As we do our bottom up budgeting process on a property by property basis, this is where we're comfortable giving initial guidance. So I think you should be comfortable with it. I think you should be really comfortable with our margin assumptions and our margin performance. So with respect to - your second question with respect to the big deal in 2020, was that it, Bill? William Crow : Yes. James Risoleo : Hang on one second; I'll get the data on that. We don't have it on hand, but my recollection Bill is, it's similar spend to 2019. So think about the RevPAR disruption in around the same way for 2020. Operator : Next we'll go to Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Donnelly : Good morning, guys. Can you just give us an update on where the Hyatt three-pack and Don CeSar acquisitions finished in 2018 versus your original underwriting? I'm just curious what drove any variances there, whether it's sort of market, or just taking share, or losing share or just how your margin is sorted out? James Risoleo : Hang on, Jeff. Let's see - I don't have the numbers for 2018 in front of me. But I can reiterate that on our 2019 budget for the three Hyatts, we expect to finish 70 basis points up, which equates to a 14% improvement in NOI. And I am happy to get the numbers for you on the Don and performance in 2018. I know that Don has performed really well in 2018. We're well ahead of budget on that of our pro forma and I don't want to quote numbers because I don't have it in front of me, but I know we performed really strong and we had said when we bought the hotel that we anticipated turning that, I think it was 6.5% cap rate into an 8%. And last I looked and I would know we were ahead of our projections. But we'll get you the specific numbers. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Richard Hightower : Hey, good morning, guys. Just want to follow-up on the earlier - what sounds like a categorical statement about not pursuing a very high profile portfolio that's potentially in the market here pretty soon. If I'm accurate in sort of describing it this way, or asking the question this way, has anything changed in terms of your thinking about that particular transaction? Is it partially a function of the fact that you did a $600 million deal recently and you just kind of running up against capacity constraints financially or did something change philosophically or with respect to feedback from investors or just a little more color on that would be helpful? James Risoleo : Well, Rich, I think we're not going to comment on hypothetical deals that may or may not be in the market. What I will tell you is that we're going to be opportunistic. And we're going to continue to pursue assets like the Hyatt three pack and like the 1. It's nothing more complicated than that. We'll be opportunistic on the acquisition side and we will be opportunistic as we think about selling hotels. It's a same thing. Nothing is in guidance or additional acquisitions or additional sales, because we don't have anything to talk about. And when we have something to talk about, we'll be glad to share that with you. Michael Bluhm : And I think just Rich to add on to that. I think we continue to be incredibly happy with our scale. We're not going to grow for growth sake. As you can see with the 1 Hotel, we can absolutely execute upon our strategic vision and the upgrading of the portfolio through other means, and certainly as we sort of think about where we are in the current environment and being thoughtful about how conservatism and underwriting into this type of environment. I think all this has to sort of play into how we think about acquisitions at any degree of scale, frankly. And of course, again, and I guess one final point will be, right, we want to be incredibly prudent with our balance sheet. Again, at this part of the cycle, I think it's paramount that we're doing that. Operator : Our next question will come from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chris Woronka : Hey, good morning, guys. Had another question on the 1 Hotel and that's - can you maybe give us a little general sense or flavor on the structure of the management contract and does that involve kind of a franchise fee to the 1 brand? And along those lines, are you willing to consider other assets from that brand as it expands? James Risoleo : The 1 Hotel is going to be - it's not a franchise fee, it's a management agreement. And it is a market negotiated management agreement with the manager that we're very comfortable with. The answer with respect to, are we willing to consider other hotels in that brand. Again, it depends on pricing. It depends on the opportunity, but I will tell you that Barry Sternlicht has been very successful in the past, creating brands, think W. This is an incredible LEED-certified, mission-driven luxury lifestyle brand, it's inspired by nature, it fits right in with how we think about sustainability and some of the awards we received, the Leader in the Light award from NAREIT and things we've done around corporate responsibility and sustainability. You may know that there are current hotels in Manhattan and Brooklyn, as well as the 1 in South Beach and there are hotels that are expected to open and he has them under control in West Hollywood, Cabo San Lucas, Kauai, Sunnyvale and we would certainly look at most of those with our focus on U.S. centric investments today probably wouldn't be looking Cabo and they have one in the works in Sanya. So it's a real brand and it's going to grow and we're excited about it. Operator : Next we'll take a question from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. James Risoleo : Hey, Stephen. Stephen Grambling : Hey, how are you? James Risoleo : Good. Hey, Stephen, let me just respond in a little more detail to Bill Crow's question about the MI transformational capital plan because we pulled the number up. Our spend in 2019 though anticipated to be $225 million, in 2020 it's anticipated to be $207 million, so slightly less. Sorry, Stephen. Stephen Grambling : No, that's helpful too. I guess one more hotel follow-up on the 1 Hotel. Could you give a little more background on the history of the 1 Hotel on the brand change as it relates to the fundamentals of the property? James Risoleo : Well, I think this was the flagship one, or the one in - two in New York, one in Brooklyn, one in Manhattan and this property it was really the brand. I mean, this is how the - this is where the brand was formed and founded. The property had been the Gansevoort hotels and the Gansevoort had been in financial difficulty over the years and a venture led by Starwood Capital brought the property and they invested $300 million in the asset, which is something that I hadn't pointed out. So it's a brand new hotel. It has no near-term CapEx needs and given the high RevPAR of this asset, the ability of this property to support itself through the FF&E reserve is very strong and highly likely. So in addition to upgrading the overall metrics of our portfolio from a RevPAR - total RevPAR EBITDA per key perspective, this goes a long way to enhancing the free cash flow position of Host. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Katz : Hi, good morning, everyone, and congrats on a good quarter and your acquisition. I hope you'll humor us and allow me to just beat the horse one more time. But with respect to the perspective large portfolio out there that - I think if we're understanding correctly, it's not formally on the market yet. And so for that reason and that context, there wouldn't be anything to talk about at this stage, but at some point it could hit the market in whole or in part. I just want to be clear about sort of where the line is that you're drawing and is it because something is not in the market yet or available or you're setting some sort of firm boundaries that will be there when it is. And the second part of my question was we're just trying to gauge your appetite for share repurchases, given the liquidity that you have, given the strength of the business and sort of where you are? Thank you. James Risoleo : I'm going to take the first part of this. I'll let Michael talk about share repurchases, David. I think my comments were pretty clear. And I would encourage you to take them literally that we have - investment capacity today of between $2 billion to $2.5 billion at 3x leverage. We intend to stay within that range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion and 3x leverage. That's how we're viewing the world today. Michael, you wanted to discuss? Michael Bluhm : Sure. I think, look David, I would say as we think about share repurchases, I put that in the context of all capital allocation decisions whether investing organically in our portfolio through capital reinvestment like we're doing with the transformational projects and the Marriott program or where we're looking externally for opportunities like the 1 Hotel, which I think is fantastic in a lot of ways as Jim's pointed out, and I think hit accretion from fairly just about every metric, whether it's earnings, free cash flow and frankly, I'd even argue on NAV, day one. I think as you know, we do have authorization for a buyback and it is a tool that we will look to. But again it's in the context of all other investment opportunities that we think about and how we're looking out to - the sort of the outlook for 2019 and what we think that's going to bring in terms of both acquisition opportunities as well as value enhancement opportunities. Operator : Moving next, we'll go to Jim Sullivan with BTIG. Please go ahead. James Sullivan : Good morning, guys. Just another question on capital allocation if you would, and this really relates to the transformational Marriott program as you've described it the way you're investing some $200 million plus a year. Can you - you have talked about this as the objective in terms of operating results as to take each asset up to number one in its comp set. And I wonder if you could just help us understand how that - what kind of ROE you're projecting that to deliver on the capital investment? James Risoleo : Sure, Jim, because obviously - before we commit any capital, we start with a detailed return on investment analysis and we did that with this deal as well. We believe that the IRR unlevered on the Marriott transformational capital program will be in the low to mid-teens. That's how we've looked at it. We think it's a great use of our capital. The properties are clearly going to gain market share. Marriott in cases that they've already completed can see up to 6 points in yield index growth from really transforming and reinventing our hotel. We weren't even that aggressive when we did our IRR analysis, we assume somewhere between 3 points to 5 points on each asset. Operator : Next we'll go to Patrick Schultz with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Patrick Schultz : Hi, good morning. When we think about what markets that you'd like to get into, and others that you'd like to get out of certainly Miami getting into, New York getting out, how do you think about that going forward? James Risoleo : Yes. Patrick, we will continue to be focused on markets that have multiple demand generators, that have high barriers to entry with respect to new supply and just good growth fundamentals all lining up from top to bottom whether it's a favorable labor environment to the support of the local or municipal authorities, and again, high barrier to growth is probably top of the list, because new supply is what can get you. Michael Bluhm : And I think certainly, importantly diversification continued to be paramount to our overall investment strategy. So if we sort of think about different market, we certainly have a keen eye on making sure that we're not overly weighting to certain markets. Patrick Schultz : Okay, thank you for that. And then secondly, I may have missed it. Did you say what - group pace is shaping up? James Risoleo : What's that, Patrick? You cut out. Patrick Schultz : I'm sorry, didn't hear you. James Risoleo : I'm sorry. I didn't hear your question. Patrick Schultz : Okay. I'm sorry if I missed it, did you say how your 2019 group pace is shaping up? James Risoleo : Yes, I did. Its total group revenue pace is up 1.4%. Operator : Next we'll go to Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good morning, everyone. I know you're keeping it tight, so my main question was one to the Analyst Day in South Beach, but I don't know if you're going to comment there. So instead maybe you guys could just give us a little bit of color on, I think we noticed towards the end of the year there was a lot of stock market volatility, obviously, there is also a big strategic change here in terms of sort of your discussion plan around the portfolio deal. But you didn't actually buy any stock in the fourth quarter and I'm kind of curious just big picture, how the stock buybacks fit into the broader strategy here as it relates to kind of what you're seeing out there and deployment of that capital relative to kind of what you can do with your own stock? James Risoleo : Yes, Shaun, we think about deploying capital, obviously, we've talked about it before, but just let me hit the highlights real quick for you. Due to buying assets like the 1, investing in our portfolio like the transformational capital program or buying back stock, right. But it all starts with sources and uses of cash. And as we sat here at the end of the year, we did not buyback any stock. We knew what we had in the works from an acquisition perspective. We knew that we had The Westin Grand Central under contract, but we had no assurance that that deal was going to close. So that's not to say that we won't be buyers of our stock in the future. We did not buy it now, because we wanted to be thoughtful about the balance sheet and where we were going. Michael has anything to add to that. Michael Bluhm : No, I think that's a good point, I mean as I think we all know, we sat here on Wednesday - or sat here in December of last year and the market was pretty volatile, and certainly volatile in one direction. And so as we were sort of looking at things like cash flow, cash that we had coming in throughout the dispositions, acquisitions we were making there was in time where we just need to be incredibly thoughtful about balance sheet preservation. Operator : Moving next to Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Thomas Allen : Hey, good morning. So about a year-ago, you talked about selling land at The Phoenician, where are you in that process? Thanks. James Risoleo : It's a process, Thomas. We are moving forward. We have the entitlement. We're moving through the plotting with the City of Phoenix. We continue to be optimistic that that's going to happen, but I don't have anything to discuss right now because we don't have a deal done. Operator : And next we'll go to Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Thanks, two questions. One is, you've talked about opportunities looking at the existing portfolio. Are there other things with other Marriott properties that are not part of the agreement you've done already? Or if not, are there other operators that have kind of expressed interest in something similar after seeing that Marriott deal or is that really a very unique sort of one-off kind of arrangement? And then I was just going to ask a clarification on group business, you mentioned the pace being up like 1.4%, last quarter you talked about fewer citywide events in 2019. So is it just the pace coming in, but you're still expecting maybe to be down in 2019? Or has your view on the group outlook changed? Thanks. James Risoleo : Robin, let me answer the group question first. Yes, I mean, we do have some issues, as you and anyone that owns hotels in Boston, in particular, with a reduction in citywide so this year. That 1.4% number takes that all into account and consideration. So we don't expect to see slippage in the 1.4% number. If anything, and this is not baked into our forecast for the year, we really liked the way we're positioned this year and in those markets where we might have targeted holes, we believe that given the corporate group that we saw in the fourth quarter and over the course of 2018, that gives us some terrific opportunities to the upside. I might also add that after the third quarter call or on the third quarter call I said, our total group revenue pace was flat. And now, it's up 1.4%. So we feel good about that. And with respect to additional transformational capital projects, there's only so much we can push through the system at any one point in time. And I will just tell you, nobody but Host could do what we're doing. And I applaud our design and construction team, and our asset managers, and others in the organization to manage this process. We will work with our operators, both with Marriott on additional transformational opportunities as well as Hyatt on assets that we feel may need to be repositioned, but we're going to be thoughtful, cautious and judicious as we move forward on the process. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Risoleo, I would like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. James Risoleo : Well, thank you, everyone for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate the opportunity to discuss our fourth quarter results and our 2019 outlook with you. We look forward to talking with you in a few months to discuss our first quarter results as well as providing you with more insight into how 2019 is progressing. Have a great day. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Gee Lingberg : Thanks, Evony. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts first quarter 2019 earnings call. Before we begin, I like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filing with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our first quarter results, our capital allocation strategy and our outlook for 2019; Michael Bluhm, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide commentary on our first quarter performance, our capital position and our guidance for 2019. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. James Risoleo : Thank you, Gee, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report another strong beaten raised quarter. Our first quarter results exceeded our expectations and beat consensus estimates for adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDAre increased 10% to $406 million for the quarter and adjusted FFO per diluted share grew 11.6% to $0.48, beating consensus estimates by $20 million, and $0.04 respectively. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we indicated in our prepared remarks last quarter that 25% to 26% of EBITDA would be earned in the first quarter, we beat that forecast by $11 million. These strong results were primarily driven by an impressive EBITDA margin improvement of 50 basis points. Comparable hotel EBITDA margins improved for the sixth consecutive quarter and meaningfully exceeded our expectations, demonstrating the benefits of our scale and integrated platform, key elements underpinning our ability to deliver operational performance. We continued to benefit from our internal initiatives, the Marriott, Starwood merger synergies, the receipt of operating profit guarantees from the Marriott transformational capital program and increases in other ancillary revenues. These bottom line results are remarkable, considering the comparable constant dollar RevPAR decline of 1%. The RevPAR results were driven by an occupancy decrease of 180 basis points, which was partially offset by a 1.3% increase in average rate, the factors that affected RevPAR this quarter, including estimated 40 basis points of impact from the disruption related to the Marriott transformational capital program, an estimated 30 basis points impact from the government shutdown and a softer than expected March. Despite these headwinds comparable total RevPAR which includes all hotel level revenues, including food and beverage and other revenues increased 30 basis points to $274 million. These strong results continue to underscore the advantages of our geographically diversified portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels, our unprecedented scale and platform to drive internal and external growth and the power and flexibility of our investment grade balance sheet. Together these key pillars form the foundation of Host, the premier lodging REIT. Next, I would like to discuss our disciplined capital allocation as Michael will provide additional color around the key segments of our business and provide further details around our margin expansion. In addition to achieving industry-leading margin improvements, we advance our long-term strategic vision through active portfolio management, which ensures that the Company is stronger than ever and well positioned for continued profitable growth. Specifically, we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions of properties in key markets with strong demand generators while divesting non-core assets, including international assets, as well as profitability challenged assets like those in New York. This capital recycling strategy has been highly effective, enhancing our strategically advantaged competitive position to continue outperforming our industry. Consistent with this approach, during the quarter, we closed on the previously announced acquisition of the 1 Hotel South Beach and the disposition of the Western New York Grand Central. We have been very prudent and disciplined in our underwriting and balance sheet position. And as I stated last quarter, we intend to maintain our investment grade balance sheet with a high end of our leverage target set at three times. This provides us with a total investment capacity of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. We do not intend to move higher than our targeted leverage range, nor do we intend to invest beyond that capacity. However, we will continue to be opportunistic and adding value enhancing assets like the 1 Hotel South Beach, and plan to use our current investment capacity to make similar smart, targeted acquisitions. We will also continue to invest in our portfolio, as we are doing with the Marriott transformational capital program. And we will continue with our opportunistic approach to returning additional capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our capital allocation decisions over the last few years have improved the composition and performance of our portfolio. Since early 2017, we dispose of $2.8 billion of non-core and profitability challenged assets, many of which required meaningful capital investment and acquired $2 billion of high RevPAR, high quality, irreplaceable assets with no meaningful near term capital requirements in markets we expect to outperform the industry. As presented in our investor presentation on our website, on a trailing 12 month basis, since 2017, we sold 10 assets with a blended RevPAR of $186, total RevPAR of $266 and EBITDA per key of $24,000, at a cap rate of 4.9%. We recycled much of that capital into six assets with a blended 2018 RevPAR of $313, total RevPAR of $505, and EBITDA per key of $55,000 at a cap rate of 5.8%. The improvement of these transactions to the portfolio is impressive. You can see this transformation even more clearly by comparing our top 40 hotels today to where it was just two years ago. Since 2016, as a result of our investment decisions, we turned over approximately 20% of our top 40 hotels, resulting in an increase in total RevPAR and EBITDA per key of $15 and $2200 respectively. In addition, the case studies provided in our investor presentation show that our recent acquisitions have performed well. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation is yielding the desired results and we intend to continue to pursue this strategy going forward. Shifting to reinvesting in our existing portfolio. We anticipate spending between $235 million and $275 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures, and between $315 million and $350 million on redevelopment and ROI projects this year. The ROI projects include $225 million, related to the Marriott transformational capital program for which we are being well compensated. The program which carries through 2021, began last year with the San Francisco Marriott Marquis. As we have described, these portfolio investments will position the targeted hotels, which are some of the most notable in our portfolio as even stronger competitors in their respective markets with the goal of enhancing long-term performance and becoming number one in their competitive sales. Notably Marriott is providing operating traffic guarantees as protection for the anticipated disruption associated with the incremental span. In addition, we will receive increased priority returns on the agreed upon investments which will result in reduced incentive management fees. We believe this is a great high return use of shareholders' capital, as transformational capital projects had typically resulted a meaningful increases in RevPAR yield index which translates through strong improvement in EBITDA. We anticipate the ROI on these investments to be in the low to mid-teens. In 2019, as I have stated, we intend to spend approximately $225 million on 10 projects with four to be completed during the year. Those four are the San Francisco Marriott Marquis, New York Marriott Downtown, Santa Clara Marriott and the Coronado Island Marriott which is already complete. Only three of the 10 hotels where we're allocating this capital, the San Francisco Marriott Marquis, the Minneapolis Marriott City Center and the San Antonio Marriott River Center are excluded from our forecast comparable results. The seven that are still included in our comparable results have impacted RevPAR in the first quarter by an estimated 40 basis points and we expect the impact - we expect will impact full year comparable RevPAR by 45 basis points. However the RevPAR impact is mitigated by the operating profit guarantee of $1.5 million and $10 million that has been included in comparable hotel EBITDA for the quarter and full year forecasts respectively. For 2019, we expect to receive a total of $23 million of operating profit guarantee payments for both comp and non-comp transformational capital projects which has been included in our guidance for EBITDA. Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of 2019. Our bottom line results for the first quarter exceeded our expectations and we expect improvement as the year continues. While I recognize that we are in the latter part of the economic cycle, the U.S. economic outlook is healthy and appears supportive of industry growth. Importantly the economic indicators we follow closely, including corporate profits and non-residential fixed investments while slightly lower than last year are still strong and we anticipate that will continue. We are monitoring the impact of stronger U.S. dollar, the ongoing global trade dispute including its impact on business' willingness to invest and the performance of the overall global economy. While our modest 2019 GDP deceleration is wildly anticipated as the benefits of the tax cut paid and the government shut down gave the industry a slower start than we otherwise would have expected, we believe that overall industry fundamentals are on solid ground. While the elongated spring break season impacted the demand in March for business travel, based on the solid non-residential fixed investment in corporate profit outlooks, we expect business travel to improve as the year progresses. In addition we expect leisure travel demand to remain steady, as this segment is supported by strong consumer income growth, solid employment and healthy settlement. Given our optimal group and transient mix, we are pleased with our position. As we mentioned last quarter 2018 was a record year for group room nights with over 5 million room nights booked for the year. Group revenue booking activity in the quarter for the remainder of the year was up 5% and up 20% for the second quarter. For 2019 total group revenue pace is up 70 basis points. Our outlook for the full year has not changed and we have reaffirmed our initial guidance of comfortable constant dollar RevPAR growth of zero percent to 2%. We believe RevPAR for the first quarter will be the weakest quarter of the year with the second half of the year expected to be stronger than the first. Based on our margin outperformance in the first quarter and our confidence that the increases are sustainable through the remainder of the year which Michael will discuss further in his prepared remarks, we are meaningfully increasing our comparable EBITDA margin guidance to minus 25 basis points to plus 35 basis points, lifting the midpoint by 25 basis points, equating to an additional $13 million of comparable EBITDA for the year. We also expect an additional $7 million of EBITDA related to our non-comparable hotels, bringing the total increase from operations to $20 million. In addition, we are now including the sale of the Westin Mission Hills and two additional unidentified assets, which decreases our EBITDA forecast by $7 million from our previous guidance. This is mitigated by an increase in forecasted interest income. In assets, our total full year raise is $27 million. These assumptions result in full year adjusted EBITDA ROE of $1.535 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.76 to $1.84. At the midpoint, adjusted EBITDA ROE increases $20 million and adjusted FFO per share increases $0.03. Before handing the call over to Michael, I would like to reiterate that we are very pleased with yet another beaten raised quarter is that again underscores the strength and advantages of our premier lodging REIT. We are also pleased with our ability to continue to outperform our margins, and note that this is our sixth consecutive quarter of margin expansion, despite the fact we are in a lower RevPAR growth environment with record low unemployment. Our diversified portfolio of irreplaceable hotels, our unmatched scale and platform, and our investment grade balance sheet all position us to continue to outperform in the near, medium and long term. We will remain disciplined in our approach to capital allocation. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael who will discuss our operating performance and balance sheet in greater detail. Michael Bluhm : Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Building on Jim's comments, all of us at Host are pleased with the strong results we delivered in the first quarter. Through active portfolio management we have ensured that the Company is stronger than ever and well positioned for continued profitable growth. With that, let's discuss the details of our results. As expected demand was impacted by the government shutdown earlier this year and some renovation disruption as part of our Marriott transformational capital program. As a result on a constant currency basis, comparable RevPAR decreased 1%, driven by 180 basis point decrease in occupancy, partially offset by a 1.3% increase in average rate. Comparable total RevPAR which includes all hotel revenues, including food and beverage and other revenues, however, exceeded our internal forecast and improved 30 basis points to $274. Comparable hotel EBITDA margins, as Jim mentioned, improved for the sixth consecutive quarter exceeding our expectations and improving an impressive 50 basis points. These margin enhancements, the details of which I will discuss in a moment demonstrate the benefits of our scale and integrated platform, key elements underpinning our ability to deliver operational outperformance. These results led to an increase of 10% in adjusted EBITDAre to $406 million and 11.6% growth and adjusted FFO per share to $0.48, which exceeded both our internal and consensus estimates. Let me provide some additional color around our margin outperformance. Our asset managers and enterprise analytics team in collaboration with our managers continued to drive comparable hotel EBITDA margin growth and generate impressive profitability at our properties at this stage of the cycle. Our 50 basis points of margin expansion was 180 basis points greater than we would have expected with a RevPAR decline of 1%. Let me provide a quick high level context to our margin outperformance. First, the timing of the tax rebate related to the New York Marriott Marquis benefited the quarter by approximately 25 basis points. As you may recall, we did not start receiving the tax rebates related to the Marquis until the second quarter of last year. The remaining improvements are divided roughly evenly between our internal initiatives and the benefits of our relationship with Marriott. Let me give you little bit more details about our internal initiatives which are driving productivity improvement in rooms and food and beverage while decreasing operating expenses. Some of these initiatives include, working with our operators to reimagine operating models to more efficiently deliver services to guest when and where they want them. It can be as simple as messaging with guests prior to arrival to expedite check in process or more substantial like creating marketplace and grab and go food concepts in place of traditional restaurants and room service. During a quarter with essentially flat comparable revenues in declining occupancy, we saw a year over year productivity in rooms and F&B. Lengthening the cancellation window and implementing technology to ensure consistent charging of cancellation fees. This has continued to help drive other revenue growth and has the added benefit of allowing for more reliable short term revenue management at the property level. In addition the increases in other revenues from the improved collection of attrition and cancellation fees, ancillary revenues increased from the newly renovated Golf and Spa destination. Minimizing utility expense the investment in energy efficiency ROI projects. Over the past year, Host has completed 25 energy ROI projects which are expected to generate not only utility savings, but also take advantage of rebates available on projects such as low flow water fixtures, LED lighting and guestroom energy management systems. Utility costs in the quarter was down 2.7% at the same time last year. Our enterprise analytics team, along with our asset managers have done a fantastic job working with our operators to streamline food and beverage operations and improve the cost of goods for a number of years now. Properties continued to improve on pricing, menu design, waste and leveraging of major food purchasing programs. During the quarter where F&B revenues were essentially flat, two thirds of our properties had year over year reduction in food costs. In addition to these initiatives, we continued to improve benefits from the synergies of Marriott Starwood merger, Marriott continues to use its increased scale to improve programs in combined systems to lower charge rates to its owners. This quarter we see a reduce fees related to the loyalty and rewards program, credit card commissions and group and travel agent commissions. And finally, the receipt of $1.5 million related to the operating profit guarantees for Marriott for the comparable hotels that are part of the Marriott transformational capital program is enhancing margins by 12 basis points this quarter and will continue through the remainder of the year and into 2021. Let's move to the performance of the segments of our business. Starting with our transient segment. Overall first quarter transient revenues decreased 0.6% as demand declined 1.6% it was partially offset by a 1% increase in average rate. The decrease in demand was due to the partial government shutdown in January an Easter holiday shift. Group revenues declined 1.5% as occupancy fell 3.9% partially mitigated by a 2.5% increase in average rate. The decline in group occupancy was driven by a decrease in association business predominantly due to the lack of city wide events in San Diego, Boston and Chicago. To partially mitigate this decline, our managers pursued corporate group business which improved 4.1% this quarter. The increase in corporate group business which represents the largest segment of all business this quarter for the banquet and catering out performance. Overall, we are pleased with our optimum group mix for our portfolio. As you recall, 2018 was a record year for group nights with 5 million group rooms booked for the year. Consistent with last year, we have 85% of our group business booked for 2019 providing a strong base of business. In addition, as we think about our business for the rest of the year, activity in the quarter for the remainder of the year was up 5%. Looking at individual markets, our best performing domestic markets this quarter were Atlanta, Jacksonville, Phoenix and San Francisco with RevPAR increases ranging from 6% to 16%. Atlanta's RevPAR improvement of 16% exceeded our expectations, primarily driven by the strong average rate growth of 17% due to the Super Bowl. In addition, we were able to capture stronger group demand the week following the Super Bowl and throughout March. Our hotel in the Jacksonville market outperformed the STR upper tier market by a wide margin with RevPAR growth of 14%. This growth was driven by a 7.3 percentage point increase in occupancy and 3.6% improvement in average rate. Exceptional group performance at the Ritz Carlton, Amelia Island fuel the growth with volume up 32% over last year, which enabled the hotel to drive transient rate up 11%. RevPAR for our Phoenix hotel outperformed our portfolio this quarter with RevPAR growth of 7.5%. This was primarily driven by 22% and 12% increases in RevPAR at The Venetian and Scottsdale suites respectively, both of which benefited from strong corporate demand. We also saw an increase in Golf and Spa revenues their definition from the redesign Golf Course and the new Spa, which was under construction in the first quarter last year. In the San Francisco area comparable RevPAR grew by 6%, which was driven by an increase in average rate of 12% and partially offset by a decline in occupancy of 4.2 percentage points. This performance reflects the Santa Clara Marriott and the Marriott Marquis being under renovation. Additionally, the Grand Hyatt San Francisco which remains non-comp, because it was acquired as part of the Hyatt portfolio last year, saw a double-digit RevPAR growth. Now looking at the markets that were more challenged in the first quarter. Our hotels in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia, saw RevPAR declines ranging from 7% to 13%. Our hotels in New York saw RevPAR decline of 13.2%, which lagged the results for upper tier hotels in the New York market. We performed in line with the market if we adjust for the renovations at the New York Marriott Marquis and the Marriott New York Downtown, both of which are part of the Marriott transformational capital programs and remain comparable in our portfolio. It was a tough quarter in New York for everyone with first quarter demand declining for the first time since 2009. The magnitude of the impact, the New York market has had in our portfolio was interesting. If we removed New York hotels from our comparable results, comparable RevPAR would have increased 0.4%. Importantly, through reducing our exposure to profitability challenge hotels in the market, which we have executed upon over the past year, strengthen the overall portfolio. RevPAR in our Chicago hotels declined 11.5% due to weaker citywide activity impacting transient and group demand. Many of the conferences held in Chicago during the first quarter of last year rotated to other cities this year. Despite the hotel's ability to increase corporate group business, the software market conditions hindered results. While Philadelphia's RevPAR declined 7.5%, it still exceeded our expectations and achieved 180 basis points improvement above the STR upper tier market results. Last year, we benefited from the 2018 NFL playoffs and Super Bowl parade as well as a January 2018 citywide [indiscernible]. Looking ahead to the full year, we expect RevPAR at our hotels in Atlanta, the Florida Gulf Coast, Jacksonville and Philadelphia to outperform the portfolio due to strengthened corporate and leisure demand, as well as strong citywide. Conversely, we expect RevPAR at hotels in Seattle, New York and Chicago to underperform our portfolio due to weak citywide calendars and ongoing room renovations at our New York assets. Moving to our balance sheet. In April, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of approximately 4% on our current stock price. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility. We are the only lodging REIT with an investor grade balance sheet, which we are committed to maintaining. We believe it is a prominent differentiator relative to our peers and provides flexibility to capitalize on value creation opportunities throughout the cycle. At quarter end, we had unrestricted cash at $1.1 billion, not including $191 million in the FF&E escrow reserve and $944 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Total debt was $3.9 billion with a weighted average maturity of 3.9 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.3%. In addition, we have no debt maturities until 2020. Our leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter is approximately 1.9 times as calculated into the terms of our credit facility. As we have discussed before, our investments grade balance sheet is a competitive advantage and we intend to maintain that position. And as Jim mentioned previously, with the high-end of our leverage target at 3 times, provides us with a total investment capacity of $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion. We do not intend to move higher than our targeted leverage range, nor do we intend to invest beyond that capacity. We will continue to be opportunistic to increase long-term shareholder value and potential smart targeted acquisitions, reinvesting in our portfolio and through share repurchases. Let me take a few minutes to discuss some assumptions included in our 2019 guidance. Our comparable RevPAR guidance for the year of zero percent to 2% remains unchanged. As Jim stated, we believe RevPAR for the first quarter will be the weakest quarter in the year, with second half of the year expected to be stronger than the first. We continue to estimate a 45 basis point impact on RevPAR due to renovation disruption related to the Marriott transformational capital projects. Without this impact, the midpoint of our RevPAR guidance would have been approximately 1.45%, which is mitigated by $10 million of the operating profit guaranteed that has been included in our comparable hotel EBITDA. For 2019, we continue to expect to receive a total of $23 million of Marriott operating profit guarantees for both comp and non-comp transformational capital projects, which have been included in our guidance for EBITDA. In addition, I hope the details that I provided surrounding our outsides leverage to the Marriott-Starwood integration and the internal initiatives of our asset managed enterprise analytics teams, help you understand how we can continue to drive margin outperformance. Based on a strong margin performance in the first quarter, we have increased the midpoint of our EBITDA margin outlook by 25 basis points to negative 25 to plus 35 basis points. These assumptions result in adjusted EBITDAre of $1.535 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.76 to $1.84. At the midpoint, adjusted EBITDAre has been raised by $20 million. This increase would have been higher by $7 million if we had not sold the Westin Mission Hills, and included two additional unidentified dispositions. Therefore the $20 million full increase in EBITDAre includes $13 million from our comparable hotels and additional $7 million related to our non-comparable hotels. With decrease in EBITDA from asset sales of $7 million is mitigated by our anticipated increase in interest income. Lastly, keep in mind that we expect to earn 29% to 30% of our total EBITDA in the second quarter. Overall, we are pleased with the strong bottom line operating results, which meaningfully beat guidance we provided in February. Our performance continues to demonstrate that owning a portfolio of iconic, irreplaceable and geographically diversified hotels, having the scale and platform to drive value and maintaining a powerful investment grade balance sheet creates a strong strategic position to deliver superior value to our stockholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be happy to take questions. To ensure that we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Anthony Powell : Well, good morning, everyone. James Risoleo : Good morning, Anthony. Michael Bluhm : Good morning. Anthony Powell : Good morning. Wanted to focus on the Marriott-Starwood integration benefits. It seems like you're doing even better than a 50 basis points of improvement that Marriott itself identified for it's a managed portfolio this year. What surprised to the upside from that integration? What's next for Marriott later this year and next in terms of further benefit? And as a result of this, do you think that you can maintain growing margins slightly at a 1% RevPAR growth level next year and year after? James Risoleo : Anthony, I'll give you a little color on some of the benefits in a more granular level that we receive this year. The - we calculate the total benefit in the quarter of about 78 basis points from Marriott Starwood integration, and roughly, let's call it 40 basis points to 50 basis points of that, is a result of lower travel agent group intermediary commissions, loyalty program, expenses and the establishment of that program services fund, that is very helpful and our ability to control costs, charge off and alike. The other piece of it is that we have, say - call 30 basis points or 40 basis points immediate ranges here in savings that are related to the new credit card program and the operating profit guarantee. So, we're confident that the margin performance is going to carry through for the rest of this year, and we would expect to see, I'm not going to say full point, but, call it another 50 basis points over the next couple years. Michael Bluhm : I mean, Anthony, I would say, to your question, it really wasn't any surprises. I mean, much of this is what we've been annotating to the market about what our expectations were around the benefits of these synergies and to your question of kind, what's coming next. I mean as you recall there is fair amount of things that really just start getting put in place over the past six months or so, in particular things like the reservation and yield management systems which really just integrated the end of last year. And so we still really haven't seen the benefits of that, particularly from revenue synergy. Group commissions for the large group intermediaries going through that reduction in group commission going to - into place until the end of last year. Last March was a smaller intermediaries where they changed it. The integration of the loyalty program just occurred towards the end of last year, the program services fund was in place at the beginning of this year. So there is still a fair amount of things that we sort of expect to continue to help drive the 40 basis points to 50 basis points of improvement for the next couple years that we've consistently talked about. James Risoleo : The other thing I would add, Anthony, is that a big driver for us in the quarter was the transient cancellation being pickup. The fees are now being automatically charged. So it's not like we're --- I'm not suggesting for a moment that we have higher cancellations, but the cancellations do occur are being charged to the customer. Lastly, too early to quantify but were very confident that over time as a result of the integration when it's done and we look back we will see significant top line impact going forward. I mentioned this a couple calls ago, our Starwood legacy hotels gained access to 30,000 business-to-business accounts that were in the Marriot pipeline that Starwood didn't have. So I don't even think we have seen the tip of that going forward. Operator : And our next question will come from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask you just about - and so being a large owner of Marriott's hotels, your thoughts on Marriott entering the home sharing business here in the US. Do you see that it's just a totally separate business or what are your thoughts around that? James Risoleo : Yeah. Smedes, we view the business as really complementary to our business, it is a different business. We actually view it positively because it's going to give our existing guests another place to go and to earn points or redeem points as part of the loyalty program. It will take some pressure off some of our hotels from that perspective. And it should also over time reduce the charge our cost associated with loyalty. We spent a fair amount of time looking at this and talking to Marriott about it and the test program that they run in London Tribute Homes by Marriott generated 7,000 room nights from customers who went on the Marriott website to look at a Tribute Home but ended up booking a standard hotel room. So we think more traffic through the system is good. These - the properties that they are contemplating putting into this program are not going to be competitive with us, there is going to be a minimum of three night stay whereas, our average stay is two night and its geared toward the leisure customer. Lastly, I would tell you that it's going to be initially heavily weighted internationally in markets that Marriott doesn't have a presence today. And in the US it's, for the most part going to be rolled out in markets where they don't have a presence today. So complementary, not competitive. And were excited for it going forward. Operator : Moving next now to Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jeff Donnelly : Yeah. Just circling back on the synergies, the Marriott and thinking about what's transpired since Marriott and Starwood got together. Do you guys know offhand how your RevPAR index of your hotels has performed in the past year? Ideally those hotels, not affected by renovations, I'm just curious if you have also seen revenue share gains, as well as expense savings as a result of the combination. James Risoleo : I would say - no, it's a good question, Jeff. No, we've actually seen a slight uptick in our index from our Starwood hotels. Operator : Our next question will come from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Banc. Please go ahead. Chris Woronka : Hey, good morning guys. James Risoleo : Good morning, Chris. Michael Bluhm : Hey, Chris, good morning. Chris Woronka : Want to ask about some of the internal initiatives that are driving the margin performance, you guys have been working on those for a lot of years you are getting really strong results right now and you did last year too. I guess the question is kind of; a, how sustainable. But more than that, it's really, I think it would be a strong term just say, you're redefining the cost structure hotels. But some of these things relate to food and beverage, seem like they still have legs. So maybe give us a big picture view of what you still want to do in the hotels on the - on some of these costs initiatives. James Risoleo : Sure. Our outperformance on margins is directly tied to our scale and our integrated platform, which we think distinguishes us from other lodging REITs in this space today. The amount of data that we have available to mind throughout the portfolio is - it is quite extensive. And we receive monthly data feeds from all of our properties that allow us to identify best practices from property to property. And as we wrap our arms around, something that property a might be doing and decided has the ability to be rolled out to the entire portfolio. That's something we take up with the brand. So we think that puts us in a very unique position. And, if you want to get a little more granular about it, we're going to continue to think about consolidating kitchens and reducing costs from that perspective, to be more efficient, New marketplaces grab & goes, we're doing them in New Orleans and the Logan and the Sheraton in Boston. And where we can we will consolidate wage codes and combine jobs but being very thoughtful about our associates and making sure that they're well taken care of. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Please go ahead. Mike Bellisario : Good morning, everyone. James Risoleo : Hey Mike. Mike Bellisario : You may be talking about your disposition outlook a little bit, how you're thinking about some of the non-core properties that still might be in your portfolio. And then also New York City too with what remains there to potentially sell just kind of buyer interest pricing trends and kind of how you're thinking about the potential sources and uses of that capital that might be coming in the door. That'd be helpful. James Risoleo : Yeah, it's - as you know, Mike, it's a hypothetical question, but I'll give you some color around it as I can. As we think about continuing to prune the portfolio, we will be opportunistic in taking assets to market, responding to unsolicited offers, where we feel that we can achieve a value that's in excess of our internal hold value. And we continue to be very disciplined with respect to our underwriting for new investment opportunities, as well as for assets we might want to sell by looking at the near term, RevPAR performance of an asset in a particular market, the capital needs and what we think is a fair and reasonable residual cap rate. So, if market opportunities present themselves we will continue to prune. If they don't, we're very comfortable with the portfolio we have today. We're not in any rush to grow the portfolio or shrink the portfolio. I want to make that really clear. We're very comfortable with the assets that we own today. So, you asked specifically about New York. You can look at what we've done in New York over the last year and the fact that we've sold three hotels which we deem profitability challenged. We're very happy with the execution that we were able to achieve. And much like the commentary I just gave you around how we view value, that's how we view value on all assets, regardless of what market we might be in. Operator : We'll take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead. Robin Farley : Great, thanks. The margin improvement in the quarter was so strong. I wonder if you can help us think about how much the reduction in occupancy, just since losing occupancy is kind of a better piece of RevPAR to lose and losing the rate because of all the variable expenses. Just maybe help us think about how to quantify how much margin is helped by losing, 100 basis points of occupancy, rather than losing 100 basis points of REIT? Thanks. James Risoleo : Robin, I don't know that I can quantify that to the detail today. But I will tell you that we are very, very happy with the fact that we were able to increase productivity, both at the room's level and at the food and beverage level with a decrease in occupancy. Operator : Our next question will come from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Jared Shojaian : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So I want to ask you about your RevPAR in the quarter which was down 1%. And appreciate all the color you've given us on the call so far. But you're also keeping the guidance unchanged for the full year of flat to plus 2%. Is there anything you're seeing in bookings rather than some of the macro day that you talked about that's giving you the confidence you'll see accelerating RevPAR growth throughout the year? And I guess a different way to ask this is, do you need demand to accelerate or does the current booking environment support flat to 2% growth as some of the non-comp hotels and other noise rolls off? James Risoleo : Sure. If you look at the 1%, down for the quarter and you take into consideration the disruption from the Marriott capital program of 40 basis points and the effects of the government shutdown of 30 basis points that left us with, call it another 30 basis points to get back to even. A lot of that was the result of a slowdown in business travel in the month of March, that we saw as a result of - and we are proud about this a lot and talked to a lot of people about it, including our operators and others, the spring break season this year, given the late Easter was elongated. And that really put a crimp in business travel. So as we look at the remainder of the year, I mentioned in my comments and Michael did as well that we saw strong booking activity in the quarter for the second quarter of 20% and 5% for the year, we have 85% of our group business on the books, which is exactly where we were last year. We were very encouraged in the quarter with a pickup in corporate group bookings, which was up 4.1% and higher food and beverage spend, which was quite profitable business and we hopefully we would continue to see that over the course of the year. And then lastly we saw a pickup in business transient pace, revenue pace for the year, up about 1.3% in the quarter. So all the factors we look at make us - put us in a very comfortable position to maintain our RevPAR guidance of zero percent to 2%. The other thing I would add is that we always anticipated that our first quarter was going to be the worst quarter of the year. And as we look out, I've said that the second half of the year is going to be stronger. And it gives us confidence to hold the course. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Richard Hightower : Hey, good morning guys. James Risoleo : Hey, Rich. Richard Hightower : So, Jim I want to ask, I guess one question about out of room spend, but it's a two parter question. First of all, are you guys able to quantify the margin benefit from some of those spend categories, whether it's on the F&B or the catering side and just help us understand the margin and flow through profile of that segment. And then secondly, it's not the first quarter or the first company where we've seen non-room spend outpace room revenues. And I'm just wondering is there anything structurally related to that, in terms of the ability to price, one segment of the business versus the room segment and anything we should be paying attention to there? James Risoleo : Yeah, there's a lot in that question. I just want to make sure I heard it clearly. So the question is, give it a little bit more background on the margins in different departments, as well as sort of understand kind of what's happening with trends out of room spend. Richard Hightower : Yeah, that's right. And then, on the second part, is there anything structural that we need to focus on between room revenue and out of room revenue, in terms of pricing power overall? James Risoleo : Yeah. Rich, I don't know that there's anything structural that we're seeing in the business, per se, but as we think about our absolute margin performance, and really break it down a little more granularly; food and beverage operations contributing 19 basis points; rooms productivity contributed 8 basis points; so - utilities was another 9 basis points; fund distributor operating expenses was 5 basis points; so - and I mentioned earlier today the pickup in cancelation fees 20 basis points. So it's a number of different areas of the P&L that are being touched. And our intention, going forward is to continue to be focus on this and look for other opportunities to improve our margin performance whether it's - we have continued lower charge out rates for the loyalty program, we're receiving benefit from lower travel agent commissions from Marriott's book direct campaign and we saw a pickup of about of 2.3% in the quarter. So I don't there's anything really that's structurally has changed. Operator : Our next question will come from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Patrick Scholes : Hi good morning. Two questions for you. How do you think the quarterly trajectory of RevPAR growth looks for the rest of this year? That's my first question. And how are you pacing overall for your Company for group in 2020 and in 2021? James Risoleo : Yes. For us for the balance of the year, and it may be different for others in the industry and for the broader industry, we would expect that our third quarter will be our strongest quarter; our fourth quarter will be the second strongest; the second quarter, third; and the first, the weakest. So it's in line with we anticipated at the beginning of the year. For 2020, Patrick, our group revenue is - group revenue pace, total revenue pace is up 3.5% and we have about 50% of the room nights on the books for the year compared to 34% last year. Operator : Our next question comes from David Katz with Jeffries. Please go ahead. David Katz : Hi good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. You've covered a lot of ground and a lot of detail and I appreciate that when you made some comments earlier about some of the detail that's available to you in the operating model, from the plethora of data that's available to you. And I found some of those examples to be interesting. Can you elaborate a bit more on those and what inning you are in and how much more of that bodes for you to do and further degree that we can maybe process that into some earnings power overtime, that would be helpful. Michael Bluhm : Yeah. Look, I think there's a couple of things to talk about here. I mean if you kind of think about how operationally we've been [technical difficulty] of these markets that we talked about in our prepared remarks and it is very broad, right. It was sort of top line right, stronger the revenues, strong F&B capture particularly from our corporate group business. Rooms and F&B productivity we continue to find ways to beat that savings and as Jim pointed out in a declining occupancy environment, it's pretty spectacular. We did point out utility expenses and how much we save here, but in aggregate undistributed operating expenses in total were sub-inflationary which is very impressive when you sort of think about an environment that we're in today. The Marriott's sell with synergies we continue to really hold tight on sort of the 40 basis points to 50 basis points a year. So as we sort of think about the duration of our ability that really ease our savings as compared to our peers we feel pretty good that we've got a nice setup going in the year or two to continue. Operator : Moving next to Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Stephen Grambling : Thanks. Coming at the M&A environment from a slightly different angle. What are you seeing in the supply of iconic assets coming to market and where a seller expectations? And perhaps as a follow up as we think about the $2 billion to $2.5 billion in liquidity, did I hear you correctly that you're more focused on individual assets versus portfolios and where do buybacks fit into that creation? James Risoleo : Yeah. I'll take the part on the M&A landscape today and how we're thinking about the market. I have been very clear that our investment capacity is $2 billion to $2.5 billion assuming we go to three times leverage. And we don't intend to invest beyond that level. I would tell you that we're rather agnostic with respect to whether it's a one property deal or a multiple property deal. It all starts with the assets, the markets, seller expectations, our underwriting. And that's how we're approaching the business. So with respect to the landscape today, we always have an ebb and flow of assets in our pipeline. And that exists today, we have a fairly healthy pipeline of assets and we're underwriting. It is very difficult to opine on hypothetical situations of what seller expectations are until you get to the table and see if you can make a deal. So it really is all over the board. Sellers are motivated by different reasons. Michael Bluhm : Yeah. Let me - just a quick comment on buybacks. I mean, it remains obviously one of our - one of our key investment opportunities, and we think about it in the context that we think about any investment opportunity, whether it's investing in our own assets, whether it's buying, growing externally. And so as we sort of think about different opportunities, it absolutely sort of factors into our thinking about sort of where we think we can generate the highest rate of return for our shareholders. This quarter, we did not buy back any shares. But that again, is more of a function of just sort of our investment opportunities. Operator : Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Shaun Kelley : Hi, guys. A lot of the ground's been covered. So just a quick one on, could you just elaborate on the program services fund savings and the charge out ratios? Just maybe a little bit more of the mechanics of how that works, when that has gone into effect? And what kind of the magnitude that drives of savings that drives for Host? Michael Bluhm : Yeah. Shaun let me I start off with the program services line, because - and I'd say the majority of what the - that entails is potential reservation system, where we expect we're probably going to save somewhere around 8 basis points in costs associated with that. And really that's a function of - and good on Marriott, really sort of rewarding the largest contributors to their system overall. And when they sort of think about fair sharing of costs, it's all taken into consideration. And so, certainly a decent margin benefit that we expect to get and continue for the year. Operator : And this does conclude today's question and answer session. At this time I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Risoleo for additional or closing remarks. James Risoleo : Thank you for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate the opportunity to discuss our first quarter results and 2019 outlook with you. We look forward to talking with you in a few months to discuss our second quarter results, as well as providing you with more insight into how 2019 is progressing. Have a great day. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may not disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts Incorporated Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Gee Lingberg : Thanks, Shantelle. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts second quarter 2019 earnings call. Before we begin, I like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filing with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our second quarter results, and update on our capital allocation activities and our outlook for 2019; Michael Bluhm, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide commentary on our second quarter performance, our capital position and our guidance for 2019. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Risoleo : Thank you, Gee, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I want to start by emphasizing how proud I am of all that we have and are accomplishing in here at Host. Our successful execution continues to underscore the advantages of our geographically diversified portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels our unprecedented scale and platform to drive internal and external growth and the power and flexibility of our investment-grade balance sheet. Together, these key pillars form the foundation of Host, the premier lodging REIT. On the operations front, we delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $460 million and adjusted FFO per diluted share of $0.53, which was in line with the consensus estimates for the quarter. Our performance this quarter was driven by 10 basis point increase in comparable total RevPAR to $305 which includes all hotel level revenues including food and beverage and other revenues. We had strong comparable hotel EBITDA margins despite flat revenues and pressure on wages and benefits. Our EBITDA margin declined 20 basis points, which included a 30 basis point negative impact related to the timing of the receipt of the New York Marriott Marquis tax rebate which we received in the second quarter of 2018 and six basis points related to severance from a planned operational restructuring at one of our properties this year. Excluding these one-time impacts, our EBITDA margin would have increased an impressive 16 basis points. We generated exceptional bottom line performance results despite the comparable hotel RevPAR decline of 1.5% in the second quarter. The second quarter RevPAR results was driven by an occupancy decrease of 140 basis points which was partially offset by a slight increase in average rate. The factors that affected RevPAR this quarter include an estimated 90 basis points impact from disruption related to the Marriott transformational capital program weaker-than-expected transient demand in major markets like New York and supply growth in Seattle. New York and Seattle had a meaningful impact on RevPAR for the quarter. Excluding those two markets our comparable hotel RevPAR would have increased 20 basis points. This performance once again demonstrated the benefits of our scale and integrated platform, key elements underpinning our ability to deliver outsized results. We continue to benefit from our internal initiatives, the Marriot-Starwood merger synergies, the receipt of operating profit guarantees from the Marriott transformational capital program and increases in ancillary revenues. Michael will provide additional commentary on our continued margin outperformance in his prepared remarks. In addition to our continued outperformance on our EBITDA margins we have made significant progress on the capital allocation process. Year-to-date we bought back $245 million of common stock and we are opportunistically taking advantage of the current market conditions to divest some of our low RevPAR high-capital expenditure assets amid a strong capital margin environment. During the quarter, we closed on the previously announced sale of The Westin Mission Hills, as well as two additional assets. Our leasehold interest in the Washington Dulles, Airport Marriott and the Newport Beach Marriott Bayview. Subsequent to quarter end, we sold the Residence Inn Arlington Pentagon City, The Courtyard Chicago Downtown and Chicago Marriott Suites O\u2019Hare, which we closed late yesterday. Including the Westin Grand Central sold in the first quarter year-to-date we completed seven asset sales for $609 million and have an additional five assets under contract for sale. For all assets sold year-to-date and those assets under contract after taking into consideration the estimated capital we would have spent on these assets the combined EBITDA multiple and cap rate on the trailing 12-month results would be 15.3 times and 5.7% , respectively. We continue to focus on advancing our long-term strategic vision of owning iconic and irreplaceable properties in key markets with strong demand generators and high barriers to entry while divesting low RevPAR high capital expenditure assets through active portfolio management, ensuring that the company is well-positioned for continued growth. As announced in our earnings press release, our Board authorized an increase in our share repurchase program to $1 billion. After taking into consideration, the $245 million brought back to-date, which includes amounts brought back in the second quarter and through the 10b5-1 program subsequent to quarter end, we have $755 million of capacity remaining. In addition, we further strengthened our balance sheet in the quarter by taking advantage of the strong bank debt markets. We refinanced our revolving credit facility in term loans, upsizing it from $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Michael will discuss this further in his prepared remarks. The balance sheet has never been in better shape and we are committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating. Shifting to reinvesting in our portfolio, we anticipate spending between $235 million and $265 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures and between $315 million and $345 million on redevelopment and ROI projects this year. The ROI projects include $225 million related to the Marriott transformational capital program for which Marriott provides operating profit guarantees to cover the anticipated disruption and enhanced owners' priority returns on the incremental spend. The transformational capital program, which carries through 2021 will position the 17 targeted hotels, which are some of the most notable in our portfolio as even stronger competitors and their respective markets with the goal of enhancing long-term performance and becoming number one in their competitive sets. We believe this is a great high return use of shareholders capital as transformational capital projects have typically resulted in meaningful increases in RevPAR yield index, which translates to strong improvement in EBITDA. We expect the ROI on these investments to be in the mid-teens. In 2019 as I have stated we intend to spend approximately $225 million on 10 projects with four to be completed during the year. Thus far both the Coronado Island Marriott and the New York Marriott Downtown have been completed. Two additional hotels the San Francisco Marriott Marquis and Santa Clara Marriott are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. Only 3 of the 10 hotels where we are allocating this capital, the San Francisco Marriott Marquis, the Minneapolis Marriott City Center and the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter are excluded from our forecast comparable results. The seven that are still included in our comparable results have impacted RevPAR in the second quarter by an estimated 90 basis points and we expect will impact full year comparable RevPAR by 50 basis points. However, the RevPAR impact is mitigated by the operating profit guarantee of approximately $5 million and $10 million that has been included in comparable hotel EBITDA for the second quarter and full year forecast, respectively. For 2019, we expect to receive a total of $23 million of operating profit guarantee payments for both comp and non-comp transformational capital projects. This has been included in our guidance for EBITDA. Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of 2019. The U.S. economy slowed, but still grew a solid 2.1% in the second quarter. Strong consumer spending offset a drop in business investment. Consumer confidence is at an all-time high, while employment is at a 50-year low. The consumer is in good shape and leisure demand remained strong. Businesses were cautious in the quarter likely driven by the global slowdown and the uncertainty surrounding the ongoing trade negotiations. Full year non-residential fixed investment while still healthy declined 40 basis points since the first quarter to 3.6%. We believe this led to a decline in business transient demand especially in major markets such as New York and San Francisco. All of these factors resulted in weaker result than we and the industry anticipated. Overall, as we look to the second half of the year and amid the growing uncertainty of a trade deal with China being concluded in the near-term, we do not see any near-term catalyst to induce business transient demand. As a result, we are revising our full year guidance to reflect a slightly softer operating environment. Our outlook for the full year for comparable constant dollar RevPAR growth is now flat to down 1%. Based on our continued margin outperformance in the second quarter and our confidence that the increases are sustainable through the remainder of the year, we are increasing our margin guidance. We now expect comparable EBITDA margin to be down 25 basis points at the low end and up 25 basis points on the high end of our guidance. Michael will provide further details surrounding our second quarter margin outperformance as well as reasons for our confidence for the remainder of the year in his prepared remarks. These assumptions result in full year forecasted adjusted EBITDAre of $1.5 billion to $1.54 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.73 to $1.78. Keep in mind that our new guidance now includes a reduction of $21 million through our forecasted EBITDA for the sale of the Residence Inn Pentagon City; Chicago Marriott Suites O\u2019Hare and five additional anticipated asset sales. If we do not sell these assets at the midpoint, our guidance for adjusted EBITDAre would have been $1.541 billion and adjusted FFO per share would have been $1.79. Before handing the call over to Michael, I would like to reiterate that we are very pleased with our ability to continue to outperform our margins and continue to execute on our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our diversified portfolio of irreplaceable assets, our unmatched scale and platform and our investment grade balance sheet all position us to deliver shareholder value in the near, medium and long-term. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael who will discuss our operating performance and balance sheet in greater detail. Michael Bluhm : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, all of us at Host are pleased with our strong continued bottom line performance this quarter. Our asset management and enterprise analytics teams continue to assist their managers with controlling costs to drive margins in a low total RevPAR environment. With that, let's discuss the details of our result for the quarter. On a constant currency basis, comparable total RevPAR, which includes all hotel level revenues including food and beverage and other revenues, improved 10 basis points to $305, representing an all-time high for the company. Strong food and beverage spend and ancillary revenues resulted in the record performance. Comparable room RevPAR decreased 1.5% on a constant currency basis, which was driven by a 140 basis points decrease in occupancy, partially offset by a 30 basis point increase in average rate. As Jim mentioned, renovation disruption from the Marriott transformational capital program reduced our second quarter comparable RevPAR by 90 basis points. Consistent with STR data for the overall industry, we experienced weaker than anticipated RevPAR in the second quarter due to softness in business transient demand especially in the top markets. Our relative overweighting in the U.S. in Seattle, which declined a combined 10% also hindered portfolio performance. Excluding these two markets, comparable RevPAR increased 20 basis points. Moving on to comparable hotel EBITDA margins, we continue to deliver impressive margins through our internal initiatives and the benefits from the Marriott-Starwood merger synergies, demonstrating the benefits of our scale and integrated platform to deliver continued operational outperformance. As Jim mentioned for the quarter, comparable hotel EBITDA margin declined by 20 basis points. However, after factoring in 30 basis point impact related to the timing of tax rebates for the New York Marriott Marquis and six basis points related to severance from our planned operational restructuring at one of our hotels, our comparable hotel EBITDA margins increased by 16 basis points. This is remarkable given a 1.5% decline in RevPAR this quarter. These factors resulted in adjusted EBITDAre for the quarter of $460 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.53. Now let me provide some additional color around our margin outperformance. As we highlighted on the first quarter earnings call, a variety of internal initiatives are continuing to drive ancillary revenue growth, productivity improvement and decreased operating costs. These efforts are serving to offset increases in wages and benefits, which are accelerating in this low unemployment environment. In addition to these initiatives, we continue to receive outsized benefits from the synergies with the Marriott-Starwood merger. Marriott continues to use its increased scale to improve programs and combine systems to lower charge-out rates to its owners. This quarter we've seen reduced fees related to the loyalty and rewards program, IT systems and group and travel agent commissions. And finally the receipt of approximately $5 million related to the operating profit guarantees from Marriott for the comparable hotels that are part of the Marriott transformational capital program is enhancing margins by approximately 40 basis points this quarter and will continue through the remainder of the year and into 2021. Now let's discuss the performance of our business mix. Starting with our transient segment. Second quarter transient revenues were up 40 basis points and underperformed their expectations as an increase in demand was partially mitigated by an average rate decline of 50 basis points. These results were lower than on our forecast due to weaker-than-expected business transient demand, especially in top markets such as New York and San Francisco. The weakening fundamentals around the global economy along with the uncertainties surrounding the resolution of the China trade issues weighed on business transient demand this quarter. On a positive note leisure travel continues to be strong and improved as expected, as revenues increased 4% driven by an almost 8% growth at our resorts. As expected group revenues declined 4.7% in the quarter driven by a lack of citywide events in San Diego, Seattle, Chicago, New Orleans and Washington D.C. The late Easter resulted in the group volume decrease in April for us and the industry. Our managers were very successful in partially mitigating, the group volume decline by pursuing corporate group business, which proved successful as this segment improved 6.4% this quarter. This increased in corporate business, which represents the largest segment of all business this quarter towards the banquet and catering outperformance. Overall, we're pleased with our optimal group mix for our portfolio. As you recall, 2018 was a record year for group room nights with five million group rooms booked for the year. Consistent with last year, we had over 90% of our group business booked for the remainder of 2019 providing a strong base to business. Looking at individual markets. Our best performing domestic market this quarter were Philadelphia, the Florida Gulf Coast, Phoenix and Maui with RevPAR increases ranging from 5% to 12%. Our hotels in Philadelphia outperformed STR's luxury and upper-upscale market by a wide margin with RevPAR growth of 11.5% versus STR luxury and upper-upscale RevPAR of 3.6%. Strong group business at our properties in Philadelphia allowed the managers to drive average rate, which increased 10.6%. Florida Gulf Coast RevPAR increased 7.7% outperforming STR luxury and upper-upscale due to stronger business, which was up 18.5% this quarter. The strong group business resulted in increased food and beverage revenues by 9% and increased banquet and catering sales by almost 13%. In addition, weather-related events in the Southeast benefited the Tampa Airport Marriott. RevPAR for our Phoenix hotels outperformed our portfolio this quarter with RevPAR growth of 6.6%. This was primarily driven by strong leisure demand as transient revenues grew 10.7%. The Phoenician was the exception to this trend in which displays transient occupancy did a stronger group performance and was able to grow transient ADR over 23%. Now moving on to the markets that were more challenged in the second quarter. Our hotels in Seattle, Orlando and New York saw RevPAR declines ranging from 10% to 11%. The Seattle hotels saw RevPAR decline of 11.2%, which was in line with STR market luxury and upper-upscale hotels. The RevPAR decline was related to the lack of citywide demand in the quarter putting downward pressure on group and transient pricing. The entire market was down 5% in group room nights in the quarter. This coupled with new supply especially the new 1,300 room Hyatt Regency in Downtown Seattle has put pressure on pricing in the market. RevPAR at our Orlando World Center Marriott declined 10.6% in the second quarter underperforming our internal forecast. Weaker-than-expected group business drove this decline paired with transient rate softness from lack of compression. In addition, the rooms renovation is part of the Marriott transformational capital expenditure program began in the second quarter. New York hotels RevPAR declined 9.8% as softer demand experienced in the first quarter continued into the second quarter and demand for the Times Square submarket was worse than the overall New York market. STR's luxury and upper-upscale RevPAR was down 1.9% for New York while the Times Square sub-market was down 4.2%. In addition, major disruption from the renovations at our New York Marriott Marquis and New York Marriott Downtown contributed to the RevPAR decline. However, as these are part of the Marriott transformational capital program, EBITDA related to the disruption was protected through the Marriott operating profit guarantees. Lease demand was also down and there was a large cancellation at the Sheraton New York for which we received cancellation fees. The New York market continues to experience weakness from both business and leisure customers and new supply, reducing our exposure to profitability challenged hotels in this market over the past year has strengthened the overall portfolio. Looking ahead to the full year, we continue to expect RevPAR at our hotels in the Florida Gulf Coast, Jacksonville and Philadelphia to outperform the portfolio due to strength in corporate and leisure demand as well as strong city-wides. Conversely, we expect RevPAR at our hotels in Seattle, New York and Chicago to underperform our portfolio due to continued weakness in business transient demand, weak citywide calendars or additional supply. Moving to our balance sheet. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility. We are the only lodging REIT with an investment-grade balance sheet, which we are committed to maintaining. At quarter end, we had unrestricted cash of $1.1 billion, not including $203 million FF&E escrow reserve and $943 million of available capacity of remaining under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Total debt was $3.9 billion with a weighted average maturity of 3.7 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.3%. Our leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was approximately 1.8 times as calculated under the terms of our credit facility. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed $2.5 billion of bank financing capitalizing on one of the lowest borrowing cost in the company's history. To this end, we refinanced our two term loans totaling $1 billion and expanded our revolving credit facility by $500 million to $1.5 billion. As a result, we enhanced our liquidity, extended our weighted average maturity to 4.6 years, pushed at our nearest maturity to 2021 and reduced our borrowing cost by again 10 basis points across the grid. Turning to our return on capital discussion. In July, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share which represents a yield of approximately 4.8% on our current stock price. In addition, as mentioned in the press release, we repurchased 10.9 million shares during the second quarter at an average price of $18.32 for a total purchase price of $200 million. Subsequent to quarter end we bought back an additional 2.7 million shares at an average price of $16.83 for a total purchase price of $45 million under 10b5-1 program. Finally, we recently received authorization from our Board to increase our buyback capacity up to $1 billion, providing us incremental capacity of $755 million. Notably, year-to-date we have returned $725 million of capital to our stockholders. Let me take a few minutes to discuss some assumptions included in our 2019 guidance. As Jim described, we revised the comparable RevPAR guidance for the year to negative 1% to flat, indicating that we expect RevPAR for the second half of the year to be stronger than the first, albeit at a lower level than we forecasted last quarter. Included in this range is our estimate of a 50 basis point impact to our full year RevPAR from the renovation disruption related to the Marriott transformational capital projects. Without this impact, the midpoint of our RevPAR guidance would have been approximately flat. For 2019, we continue to expect to receive a total of $23 million of Marriott's operating profit guarantees for both comp and non-comp transformational capital programs, which have been included in our guidance for EBITDA. In addition, I hope the details I provided surrounding our outsized leverage to the Marriott-Starwood integration and the internal initiatives of our asset management and enterprise analytics teams help you understand how we can continue to drive margin outperformance. Despite our downward revision of the RevPAR guidance, our outlook for our EBITDA margins has improved. Several factors give us confidence in our margins. First, all hotels that have experienced a softening in top line expectations relative to budgets have put in place profit improvement plans to mitigate the impact to EBITDA and maintain margin. Additionally, here is the savings associated with the Marriott integration have exceeded our expectations, mainly travel agency commissions, royalty cost and allocated expenses for programs and services. The actualized savings are now fully reflected in our outlook. Ancillary revenues have also continued to come in stronger-than-expected. The focus on capture of transient cancellation fees is positively impacting margins. Further, the Phoenician and its world-class spa and golf facilities are earning great guest reviews and surpassing our expectations on both the top and bottom line. Finally, the operational profit guarantees we are receiving on properties under the Marriott transformational capital program are also providing a boost to our margins. The reduction in our comparable RevPAR and margin assumption results in a $27 million decrease to our forecasted adjusted EBITDAre for the second half of the year. In addition, we reduced our 2019 adjusted EBITDAre guidance by $21 million to remove the EBITDA related to the sale of Pentagon City Residence Inn and the Courtyard Chicago Marriott Suites -- I'm sorry, the Courtyard Chicago and the Chicago Marriott Suites O\u2019Hare and five additional anticipated asset sale. The combination of these items results in our new guidance ranges for 2019. Adjusted EBITDAre of $1.5 billion to $1.54 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.73 to $1.78. Lastly, keep in mind that we expect 19% to 20% of our total EBITDA in the third quarter and the third quarter is projected to be the stronger of the two remaining quarters driven by the Jewish holiday shift. Overall, we are pleased with our strong bottom line operating results. Our performance continues to demonstrate that only a portfolio of iconic, irreplaceable and geographically diversified hotels, having the scale and platform to drive value and maintaining a powerful investment-grade balance sheet, creates a strong strategic position to deliver superior value to our stockholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be happy to take questions. To ensure that we have time to address questions from many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we would like to open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Smedes Rose, Citi. Smedes Rose : Good morning. I guess I wanted to ask you really -- I think in the past you've said about $2 billion to $2.5 billion of total investment capacity, including share repurchases. So now that you've resumed the repurchase activity, is that kind of the priority going forward, particularly given that shares obviously are lower now than where you've been buying them back half? Jim Risoleo : Yes, Smedes, as with any time we deploy capital, we will assess the underlying fundamentals and our view of likely future performance and value when we are making a decision to invest in our portfolio to buy an asset or to buyback stock. So, I just point you to the fact that we had a $1 billion authorization. We had $755 million remaining for the year. We will take calls of underlying operating trends and a view of our NAV given current facts and circumstances and act accordingly. Smedes Rose : Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Anthony Powell, Barclays. Anthony Powell : Hi. Good morning, guys. Jim Risoleo : Hi. Anthony Powell : Hi. In terms of the asset sales, could you remind us how many assets and even number or percent of EBITDA fit into kind of the low profitability bucket? And how quickly could you sell these assets over the next few quarters? Jim Risoleo : Anthony, we haven't really sat back and said that this is the portfolio of hotels we want to dispose off. We look at sales on an opportunistic basis whether we see a need for high capital expenditure investments in properties, markets that we don't have a favorable view of for the long-term. On every asset that we evaluate whether or not to sell, we start with doing a whole value which is a 10-year pro forma including 10 years of CapEx over and above the FF&E reserve. And if we feel that we're able to transact in the market at a price that's greater than a whole value and the market dynamics are such that we think the buyer can perform as today with strong financing markets -- financing markets have never been stronger quite frankly both from a proceeds perspective and an interest rate perspective then we'll move forward. But we have no problematic plan in place to sell assets. Anthony Powell : Okay. Are you marketing more assets currently? Jim Risoleo : I think that what we will point to you is the assets that we've discussed on the call. Anthony Powell : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from David Katz, Jefferies. David Katz : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Jim Risoleo : Good morning, Dave. David Katz : Listening to your commentary as well as the commentary of others and then looking at the capacity that you have, I'd love to hear your commentary around the availability of assets to acquire right as well as what the tolerance for loan to values and valuations has done over the past couple of weeks as best as you can assess it. And just I'd love to hear your thoughts about how you're thinking about that? And whether having the capacity and just sitting tight for a period of time is not maybe a very solid choice. Jim Risoleo : Sure. David, I'll take the first part of the question and Michael can talk about the financing market. With respect to the acquisition marketplace, we always have a pipeline of assets that we are evaluating and underwriting. We've been very disciplined and our view towards performance of these assets. Going forward, and we have taken into consideration that the current economic times that we live in today and we'll look at buying an asset relative to as -- an example buying back our stock. It's not to say that if a very attractive opportunity presented itself that we wouldn't pursue it, but to date we just haven't seen a lot out there that make sense for us. There is a gap between buyer-seller expectations. And I think part of that is being driven still by the flush financing market that's available to buyers today -- to sellers today to refinance our assets. So, I don't know if you want to talk about the... Michael Bluhm : Yeah. I think that's a great point. I mean look, David the financing markets remain quite hot. And you've seen from a lot of our peers selling assets into it. It really has given the ability to drive pricing. I mean today in the CMBS market, you can still sort of get 75% LTV financing at really record low borrowing rate. And that's both from the single borrower as well as in the conduit market. And when you look in terms of the bank financing, you saw we just typically are one of the biggest branch in the company has done $2.5 billion of bank credit that market right in a low and longer environment we continue to -- that will continue to expect and be a big catalyst for the -- for borrowers and, again, also an environment where you're seeing a record low borrowing rates. David Katz : Perfect. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Bellisario, Baird. Michael Bellisario : Good morning, everyone. Michael Bluhm : Good morning, Mike. Jim Risoleo : Hey, Michael. Michael Bellisario : Just on the capital allocation front, maybe ask a little bit differently. Maybe could you tell us how much of your buyback activity is being driven by the absolute returns you're seeing in your stock today versus the relative returns compared to where you're selling assets at net that valuation arbitrage that would be helpful? Michael Bluhm : Michael, a couple of things in there. So look first of all, I\u2019d say that relates on -- we don't know necessarily what type of IRRs or buyers are I think they're buying at. We certainly have as Jim had pointed out; we have whole values that discount back the cash flows of properties as well as the capital requirements at our cost to capital. And when someone's paying a higher price in that then presumably they're getting a higher return and/or expect to get a higher return than what we think it's going to get. Look as it relates to the capital allocation, we took you through kind of what we bought in the open market as well as in the 10b5 and collectively sort of fair to say is kind of the weighted average price at sort of $18.04, which works out to about a 20% discount to consent NAV, which look in today's environment I think when you think about sort of -- some of the return profiles of a lot of the assets we look at in the past as well as the stuff that we're selling we think that's a pretty good use of capital. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Rich Hightower, Evercore ISI. Rich Hightower : Good morning, guys. Michael Bluhm : Morning, Rich. Jim Risoleo : Morning, Rich. Rich Hightower : Maybe just to shift gears a little bit, so with all of the moving parts in the portfolio in terms of asset sales and what's in the comp pool out of the comp pool and so forth, wondering if you guys could help us bridge to a number for pro forma historical RevPAR, so that we're comping against the right number as we model going forward, or maybe you could cash it in terms of the assets we sold over X-percent below our average RevPAR for the portfolio, just something to help us with the numbers there? Jim Risoleo : Yeah. Rich the assets that we've discussed and sold year-to-date going back to the Westin Grand Central and the assets that have recently closed and the ones that are under contract, the combined RevPAR for that portfolio I think is around $136 that's about 27% below our company RevPAR. Is that the direction you're going with the question Rich? Rich Hightower : Yeah. That's very helpful. And then maybe translating that number into an overall impact on what exists today that we should be comping against in forward period right? So that could be a 3% or 4% whatever sort of number that is almost on a weighted basis? We can talk offline if I'm not maybe being clear. Jim Risoleo : Yeah. We should probably talk offline. I think that -- I think based on the assets that we've sold we've probably seeing a tick-up in our total company RevPAR from call it $180 to $183. Rich Hightower : Okay. Yeah, that's exactly what I'm after there. And then maybe secondly while I've got you, you did throw out some group pace numbers last quarter for 2020. I think maybe in the low single digit area. If you don't mind reprising those numbers where we sit today? And then maybe describe any changes in the 2020 group pace numbers versus 90 days ago? Jim Risoleo : Yeah. So, the group pace for 2020 it's holding, it's hanging in there. Total group revenue pace at this point is at 5.4% for 2020. Rich Hightower : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Bill Crow, Raymond James. Bill Crow : Good morning guys. A question for Michael on the housekeeping front, and then one for Jim. Michael, could you just kind of build us a bridge based on asset sales? And what the impact will be on 2020 EBITDA? Michael Bluhm : On 2020, yes\u2026 Bill Crow : Everything that's either -- that's been incorporated in your guidance to date for this year what is going to be full year number for next year? Michael Bluhm : Yes. If we go all the way back to the Westin Grand right that's a full year impact of $50 million. Bill Crow : Okay. For all of the assets relative to what this year's guidance is. Okay, got it. And Jim I guess, my question is when we think about what you\u2026 Michael Bluhm : I want to make one adjustment -- hey Bill I just want to make one adjustment, because I'm working off a sheet here that it's net $27 million. Bill Crow : Okay, all right. And maybe we'll follow-up just to make sure I'm clear. But Jim on the ancillary revenues that you call them and I'm thinking about parking, I'm thinking about fees the guest may pay et cetera. What is the ability to push those again next year? I mean, we can project RevPAR growth. We can think about food and beverage based on group and RevPAR et cetera, but the ancillary it feels like we're playing catch-up to some extent this year and I'm just wondering whether the growth goes out of the balloon next year? Jim Risoleo : I think it's going to be an ongoing process first, Bill. I don't have hard numbers to talk about, but we're being thoughtful with respect to making certain that our customers are understanding day one what they're being asked to pay and they're achieving real value for any fees that they might be asked to pay. I would expect that we will continue to see increased capture on cancellation fees just from some automated systems that have been put in place, not that we're seeing a tick-up in cancellations. I don't want to call anybody with that thought because we're not seeing a pickup in cancellations. And we are continuing to see a strong out of room spending definition in particular with respect to golf and spa. So, it's an area that we continue to be focused on going forward. Bill Crow : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Wes Golladay, RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : Yes, good morning everyone. I just want to go back to that comment about the business travel being a little bit softer and the consumer hanging in there. How does this translate into the resource? It sounds like the Phoenician is doing quite well. Is the corporates still spending there? Jim Risoleo : Yes. Actually, I think in Michael's prepared remarks, I'll let him talk about a little more, but we saw a very strong group performance at the Phoenician to the point where some of the transient business was yielded out in favor of group, allowing us to really compress transient rate with respect to what collets. The leisure travel continues to be strong overall. Revenues increased 12% in the quarter and that was driven by almost an 8% increase in our resorts. Wes Golladay : And you're modeling this divergence to continue throughout with the guidance that sort of we should expect? Jim Risoleo : Our guidance is granular. I mean this is property-by-property forecast to arrive at our guidance for the full year. Wes Golladay : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Patrick Scholes, SunTrust. Patrick Scholes : Hi, good morning Jim and Mike. Just another way of asking the capital allocation question here. Is it fair to assume that all the proceeds from this next round of asset sales will be used for repurchases? And then, it looks like in 2Q, your repurchases were from asset sales. Would you also consider dipping in at this point, dipping into the balance sheet to do repurchases? Thank you. Michael Bluhm : Patrick, to Jim's point, I mean I think how much cash is tangible. And we're thinking about in the context of whether we're investing externally investing in our portfolio or buying back stock. We just talked about kind of where we brought back or close to $0.25 billion of stock certainly don't like that price, but like being a buyer at that price. But again, we have to take that into consideration there are other -- all of our capital investment opportunities. Jim Risoleo : The only thing I'd add to that Patrick is that acquisitions carry a very high volume there. Patrick Scholes : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Shaun Kelley, Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good morning everybody. I was just wondering if you could speak a little bit more about the operating profit guarantees for Marriott are going to play through once the renovation start to roll-off, right? So you're in the middle of the process now and obviously they've been creating a lot of cushion. What happens as the renovations are completed? And did it sort of made whole up until you return to a certain level of profitability, or do they roll-off as soon as sort of the CapEx is down and you've kind of have to fight for yourself while you're stabilizing? Jim Risoleo : We're hopeful and we believe that the first, for yourself is going to put us in a very good place Shaun because, as these properties are fully renovated, we do expect meaningful increases in yield index which should translate into strong improvements in EBITDA. The way the operating performance guarantees were calculated is really based on the anticipated disruption at each property based on the scope of the renovation and based on our 20-plus years of data related to renovations and our ability to really forecast displacement of business whether you're doing rooms, whether you're doing rooms and bathrooms or a lobby or food and beverage or a meeting space. So, it's a property-by-property analysis. We have some ability to adjust those based on timing of the renovation and the like. But instead of said amount -- I think that the said amount was $83 million in the aggregate. And as we stated earlier today between comp -- non-comp for this year, we will receive $23 million. Shaun Kelley : Got it. Yes it is. Sorry, I don't think I framed -- phrased that pretty good well. But that's what I was looking for. And then secondarily Jim or Michael can you just mention what you're seeing on group bookings for sort of 2020 and beyond just sort of the all future periods type level of interest or demand on the really leading or really far out group side would be helpful. Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Yes. I'd tell you -- I mentioned the number for 2020. We're seeing total group revenue pace up 5.4% for 2020. For 2023, the numbers are up approximately 2%, but it's really a little bit early to start thinking about any years beyond 2020. Michael Bluhm : And Shaun the only thing I would add there is that for how the year shape up in 2020, we've got almost 60% of the room rents on the books already. Shaun Kelley : Great. Thank you, both. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Woronka, Deutsche Bank. Chris Woronka : Hey, good morning guys. I wanted to ask about margins and you've got through a lot of color on some of the things that were impacting you this year between the renovations and the out of room spend. But as we look forward and in consideration to the fact that the performance guarantees ultimately burn off, is there anything secular that has changed in terms of the margin structure at the hotels? So, in other words if we enter a softer patch, do you think margins hold up better this time, or is there something tangible that you can point to that's hotels now that maybe wasn't there last time? Michael Bluhm : Look I think as far with -- I think we've all learned a lot to the last recession about sort of really deploying resources quickly to adapt to changing fundamentals. I mean I think you saw that this quarter. We talked about it. I mean as soon as we started think these things slow down, we are very front footed and putting together action plans particularly around employee management. And as a result we're adding -- we were able to kind of adapt quickly. And when we sort of think about going is the extent of things are going to continue slowing down, we're going to be very quick to adapt. I'll give you a fair amount of -- a fair amount of how you came out of this quarter. I mean we kind of get a little bit more granular. We saw really interesting productivity gains in both rooms and food and beverage which was again very much of it prescribed by our hotel managers and our asset managers working with our managers to work around scheduling and sort of employee management better. I'm also very quick on inventory control around F&B and every facet really well and our cost of goods sold, cost structure and how that improved from last quarter. And look as we talked about last quarter, we did have a fair amount of gives and takes on the undistributed operating expense column whether with any due to related things or a lot coming out of the Starwood Marriott synergies that helped us enable to keep that below inflationary growth. And so what I think -- I think you're getting a feel for the way that we are approaching slowdowns and as you can expect sort of a similar proceeds until we slowdown any further. Jim Risoleo : Yes, the only thing I would add Chris is that's changed and I think we're going to continue to see change in a positive way is technology. And our -- we embraced technology. We think we're on the forefront of technology working with our operators. That will allow us to continue to improve productivity going forward. So, I think that's only going to get better. And I do believe that it's a new paradigm for the operating expense model in the world of hotels. Additionally, we are keenly focused on cost creep. It's so easy when times are good for the extra body here or the extra controllable whether it'd be in rooms or F&B to come back into the system. So, we're keeping a keen eye on all of that. Chris Woronka : Okay, very good. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Robin Farley, UBS. Robin Farley : Great. Thank you. My question is actually along similar lines that you were talking about. Just that you've done such a solid job of incremental things to offset the margin pressure that I'm just wondering what there might be sort of incremental in 2020. And I know you're talking about sort of further productivity, but I was thinking specifically are there Starwood synergies that will be incremental in 2020 that aren't contributing in 2019 yet? Anything that doesn't sort of start to contribute till next year? And then can you remind us the Marriott, I think you said it was $23 million of profit guarantees in 2019. And is that -- I'm sorry if I missed if you said that upper down next year versus the incremental amount of that in 2020? And then anything else sort of incremental to I believe the cost save this year will continue into next year but just thinking about anything incremental? Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Yes. Robin, I'll start with our forecasted operating profit guarantee payments based on our anticipated construction spend next year for the transformational capital program. It's likely at this point that we're going to be circa $200 million plus or minus. We won't know until we get through the capital budgeting process, which is starting in earnest in the next week or two actually, but we won't be done with this until the end of the year. Right now we would be looking at operating profit guarantees of $16 million again plus or minus. I don't want to give you a hard number because both of those numbers are subject to change, but just directionally that's kind of how we are seeing things. I think that as the Starwood acquisition gets fully integrated into the Marriott system that the focus is likely to change. Believe me, we're not going to take our eye off the cost side of it, but the focus is likely to change to yield index and improvements in the top-line we bought. We also see we think incremental benefits from the rollout of Marriott's enhanced reservation system going forward that's very early stages. So we are constantly looking at the next initiative that we can to drive top-line as well as bottom-line. Robin Farley : And just to clarify the operating profit guarantee, $16 million plus or minus obviously not a firm number yet compares to the $23 million in 2019, but not all of that goes into the comp hotels. So is it possible that the amount that's applied or attributed to the comp hotel base is actually up next year or will it be... Jim Risoleo : Now, we can get back to you on that one. I don't have the comp numbers in front of me right now for next year. Robin Farley : Okay. All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Thomas Allen, Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Hey. Good morning. So couple of questions on RevPAR. First your -- and you just had answered me was that ADR is still growing and occupancy is down a lot. I think there are a lot of dynamics at play. So can you just talk about why that's happening? Michael Bluhm : I'm sorry, Thomas. Could you repeat the question? Why... Thomas Allen : When we look at first half RevPAR, right your occupancy is down a lot, but your ADR is up. I think there are a lot of dynamics that's driving that. But I just want to kind of hear from you why occupancy will be down and rate will be up? Jim Risoleo : Well I think what has happened -- so let's take New York for a minute and just focus on that market. And then we can also talk about Seattle to say it's the same dynamic, but it's slightly different. Both of those markets have a lot of new supply. New York's new supply is I think it will be our forecast 28,000 rooms coming online this year \u2013 28,000 29,000 rooms. Seattle just had a 1,300 room hotel opened in downtown Seattle. Seattle had less city-wides over the course of the year. So some of the lower-rated transient business did not show up in Seattle as well. And the same thing in New York, we saw lower-rated transient business not show up in New York. Both of those markets are driven by international inbound travel. We had seen a decline in international inbound travel from -- in particular from Canada and Mexico. And I think that's why you're seeing occupancy decline, but rates go up. Thomas Allen : That's helpful. So two follow-up questions actually on the same topic. So first is can you quantify what international inbound travel is declining? And then second, just when you think about guidance and Michael in your prepared remarks you said that the midpoint of guidance implies that second half is in line with the first half like it feels like things have deteriorated in the past few months. And so are there things that are kind of supporting and that's adjusting for the Marriott renovation guarantees? Are there things that are supporting the second half from like a comparability standpoint or anything else that should kind of stabilize RevPAR versus continue to deteriorate? Thanks. Jim Risoleo : With respect to international inbound Thomas -- very fine market obviously, but year-over-year according to the data from U.S. travel is flat. Michael Bluhm : And then look Thomas as it relates to the forecast, I'll point you a couple of things. I mean, first of all, I'll start with it actually would be a record group room nights and we get 90% of our business -- we will give you the update on kind of how we're looking for 2019 and we get the 90% of the business on the books start there. And second, we spend a lot of time with our properties in the past -- over the past month or so really understanding what they're seeing in the individual markets? What they're seeing within their comp set? And how they're competitively positioned? What they're and certainly what those markets individually are experiencing. As we talked about, New York and Seattle were big drivers of the quarter. New York in particular, where I think, you get into sort of May. I think everyone was almost surprised by that market in particular. And so, as we thought about forecasting it was very much and sort of detailed bottoms-up analysis with our properties. Very thoughtful about the direction that thing has been heading in the past, couple of months. We carried that direction forward, and -- but certainly did not bring it down further, assuming a further decline. Beyond the type of -- the type of that we've been experiencing over the past few months. Again, I think we've seen from a lot of other companies as well, is getting the information we have in front of us today. And the outlook based on what we've seen over the past couple of months. And we shared that forward. And we think we were in pretty conservative in our outlook. Thomas Allen : Excellent, thank you. Michael Bluhm : Thank you, Shaun. Operator : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we have no further questions in the queue. So I'd like to turn this conference, back to Mr. Risoleo, for any closing remarks. Jim Risoleo : Thank you all for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate the opportunity to discuss our second quarter results and our 2019 outlook with you.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts Incorporated Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, it is now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s call over to Ms. Tejal Engman, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Tejal Engman : Thanks, Carrie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts third quarter 2019 earnings call. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today\u2019s call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today\u2019s earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. This morning Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our third quarter results and update on our capital allocation activities and our outlook for 2019. Michael Bluhm our Chief Financial Officer will then provide detailed commentary on our third quarter performance, our capital position and our guidance for 2019. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Risoleo : Thank you, Tejal, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We remain focused on creating value for our shareholders on multiple fronts in the third quarter, which exceeded consensus expectations for adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per diluted share. We grew comparable hotel Total RevPAR by 120 basis points in the third quarter and delivered our strongest comparable Total RevPAR and RevPAR performance year-to-date. We continued to successfully execute our capital allocation strategy by completing $565 million of asset sales and repurchasing $200 million of stock during the third quarter and have sold an additional $297 million of assets subsequent to quarter end. We strengthened our balance sheet by refinancing $650 million of Series Z and B bonds, with the first green bond issuance in the lodging industry and achieved the lowest effective bond pricing in the company\u2019s history. In addition, we increased the capacity of our revolving credit in term loan facility by $500 million to $2.5 billion. And finally, we made significant progress on our pipeline of ROI projects, which we expect will unlock embedded value at several of our iconic and irreplaceable assets. I will now discuss our comparable revenue performance, revised 2019 operational outlook, capital allocation and our pipeline of ROI projects. Michael will detail our third quarter comparable EBITDA margin performance, recap our balance sheet improvements and provide the specifics on our updated 2019 guidance. Beginning with our third quarter revenue performance, we drove comparable total RevPAR 120 basis points higher year-over-year through relatively strong growth in food and beverage as well as other revenues. While our comparable RevPAR declined by 20 basis points, it solidly outperformed STR\u2019s 80 basis point decline for luxury and upper upscale in the top 22 Host markets. Notably, our comparable RevPAR was impacted by an estimated 50 basis points of renovation disruption related to the Marriott transformational capital program. Adjusting for which, comparable RevPAR grew by 30 basis points year-over-year. Moreover, the tropical storms and hurricanes experienced during the quarter displaced comparable room revenue by approximately $1.2 million which impacted comparable RevPAR by another 20 basis points. Third quarter hotel occupancy was flat year-over-year, while ADR decreased by 20 basis points, primarily due to a decline in the association group business driven by a weak citywide calendar in markets such as Boston, Seattle and San Diego. We worked closely with our managers to partially mitigate this anticipated decline by growing our corporate group business by 8.3%. Additionally, strong contribution from our corporate group helped banquet and audio-visual revenues, which grew 3.8%. Third quarter transient revenue grew 70 basis points, driven by 2.8% growth in room nights due to leisure demand, bolstered by significant loyalty program redemptions. Loyalty program redemption revenues grew 7% driven by growth in both room nights and average rate. Our properties benefited from a solid increase in redemptions in the Florida Gulf Coast, Los Angeles and Orange County markets. We continue to realize improvements quarter-after-quarter from Bonvoy, which now has 137 million members and continues to grow rapidly. Growth in leisure more than offset the continued weakness in business transient, which reflects greater business cautiousness. The continued uncertainty of a long-term U.S. China trade deal, domestic political turbulence and decelerating global economic conditions are impacting business investment. Full year expectations for U.S. non-residential fixed investment have declined by 140 basis points since the beginning of the year and currently stand at 2.7%, which would represent the slowest pace of business investment growth since 2016. As discussed last quarter, we anticipated much of the revenue-led softness that the lodging industry experienced in the third quarter. As our expectations for business transient revenues have moderated further due to continuing macro uncertainties, we have revised our outlook for full year comparable constant dollar RevPAR growth to range between down 25 basis points to down 1%. We therefore expect comparable EBITDA margins to be down 20 basis points at the low end and up 10 basis points on the high end of our guidance. These assumptions result in full year forecasted adjusted EBITDAre of $1.505 billion to $1.530 billion and adjusted FFO per diluted share of $1.75 to $1.78. At the midpoint, our new adjusted FFO per diluted share is $0.01 higher than our prior forecast, primarily due to our share repurchases. Keep in mind that our revised guidance now includes a reduction of $2 million of forecasted EBITDA for the sale of Hyatt Regency Cambridge and the Sheraton San Diego and a reduction of approximately $2.5 million for the impact of the tropical storms and hurricanes in the third quarter. Michael will provide further detail on our EBITDA guidance in his remarks. Shifting to total group revenue pace, as I had discussed last quarter, our full year 2009 total group revenue pace is essentially flat, coming off a record year for group in 2018. Our fourth quarter total group revenue pace is up 1.1% and we have approximately 99% of our group business booked for 2019. 2020 is shaping up to be a better year for group business, with total group revenue pace nearly 4% ahead of the same time last year and with more than 65% of our rooms on the books. While we expect to see continued pressure on business transient, if the current macro uncertainty prevails, having a healthy total group revenue pace and group business on the books provides us with a solid base heading into next year. Considering the current macro environment, our managers continue to focus on group revenue pace. We hold monthly group pace discussions with both property management teams and senior sales leadership at the corporate level. We also provide feedback on implementing group campaigns and promotions to drive additional group demand and seller incentives to increase closure. We believe these incentives have helped ensure a focus on additional group pickup. Moreover, the citywide convention calendar is more favorable for our portfolio in 2020 relative to this year. Markets with better citywide demand in 2020 include Boston, Washington DC, Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, Phoenix and San Diego. Additionally, Miami is hosting Super Bowl 54 and is expected to outperform the industry. We expect notable year-over-year declines in citywide in Atlanta, which hosted the Super Bowl this year, San Francisco and Philadelphia. As to capital allocation, we closed on the previously announced sale of eight assets for a total of $565 million during the third quarter and sold two additional assets, the Hyatt Regency Cambridge and the Sheraton San Diego for a total of $297 million subsequent to quarter end. In aggregate, we have sold approximately $1.3 billion of low RevPAR capital-intensive assets this year. After taking into consideration the estimated capital we would have spent on these assets, the combined EBITDA multiple and cap rate on trailing 12-month results would be 14.1 times and 6.3% respectively. We continue to take advantage of the current market conditions and execute on our strategy to refine our portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels in key markets with strong demand generators and high revenue generation, while opportunistically by divesting a lower RevPAR, higher capital expenditure assets. On the share repurchase front, we bought back $200 million of stock at an average price of $16.51 during the third quarter. Our buybacks through the third quarter totaled $400 million or 23 million shares on a year-to-date basis at an average price of $17.36. We have bought back an additional $14 million of stock subsequent to quarter end and have approximately $586 million of capacity remaining. We have been actively investing in value enhancing ROI projects across our portfolio. We are constructing a 165 key premium select service AC by Marriott Hotel on excess surface parking at the Westin Kierland in Phoenix. We expect to spend a total of approximately $36 million on this project, which remains on budget and on schedule to complete construction by late May 2020 and to open around mid year. We have also begun site development on 19 villas at Andaz Maui, which will be added to the 11 villas owned or rented within our hotel program. The existing villas in the rental program achieved a RevPAR of approximately $1,700 and exhibit strong demand throughout the year. We expect to invest a total of approximately $52 million and to complete construction by March 2021. This expansion was not a part of our underwriting when we acquired the asset last year and we are pleased to be capitalizing on another opportunity to create value for our shareholders. Lastly, we have continued to focus on enhancing the value and profitability of our portfolio through utility and water saving ROI projects, an important part of our award-winning and industry-leading corporate responsibility program. Year-to-date, we have underwritten and approved over $19 million to be invested in energy and water savings sustainability projects, and over the four-year period ending 2018, we completed over 650 projects with sustainability attributes totaling $210 million. We recently published our second corporate responsibility report available on our website where you can see additional information on this important program. In aggregate, we expect to invest $107 million in these value creation projects combined and to generate stabilized cash-on-cash returns in the range of 11% to 13%. Now, to an update on the 1 Hotel South Beach, which we acquired earlier this year. The hotel is performing better than our underwriting on EBITDA and the beach club ROI project is well underway with completion anticipated by year end. We expect to spend approximately $7 million and achieve a low teens stabilized yield on cost. Finally, we have made significant progress on the Marriott transformational capital program, with work underway or expected to be completed on 13 of the 17 properties by year end. As we have previously disclosed, three of four Marriott transformational capital projects, Coronado Island Marriott, New York Marriott Downtown and the San Francisco Marriott Marquis are now complete with the final project the Santa Clara Marriott completing in another week or so. An additional nine projects are underway. Importantly, we are close to completing nearly 40% of the total estimated spend by year end and are currently under budget for the program. The timing of the Marriott transformational capital program is highly beneficial to our shareholders. Completing these renovations in a low RevPAR growth environment minimizes the impact of the disruption and leaves us well positioned to achieve meaningful RevPAR index gains and accelerate EBITDA growth at stabilization and when RevPAR growth improves. Additionally, we are benefiting from operating profit guarantees that support EBITDA in a low RevPAR growth environment as we negotiated for protection for the disruption associated with the renovation spend. Moreover, we have negotiated increased priority returns on our investment, which will reduce incentive management fees and further boost our long-term EBITDA growth. Overall, we are well positioned in the currently challenging operating environment. Heading into next year, both the citywide convention calendar and the holiday calendar shift in our favor. Importantly, with leverage at 1.7 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA at quarter end, our investment grade balance sheet is in its best shape ever and we remain laser-focused on driving near and long-term value creation for our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael. Michael Bluhm : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $312 million and adjusted FFO per diluted share of $0.35 this quarter. Adjusted EBITDAre was approximately $12 million higher than we expected, primarily due to a shift in the timing of approximately $9.5 million of corporate and other expenses from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. These were expenses related to the recent IT upgrade investments, consultancy fees as well as the office move, which is now taking place in the fourth quarter. Note that certain costs related to our office move will be reclassified as an impairment in the fourth quarter and therefore added back to EBITDA. Finally, interest income in the third quarter exceeded our expectations by approximately $2 million. Comparable hotel EBITDA margins in the third quarter declined by 85 basis points. To put that in context, the 20 basis point decline in comparable RevPAR will typically result in a greater than 100 basis point decline in comparable EBITDA margins, assuming normal expense growth. Moreover, the year-over-year comparable EBITDA margin comparison was negatively impacted by 31 basis points from a one-time benefit received from the sale of Marriott centralized purchasing company in the third quarter of 2018. Finally, the receipt of approximately $2 million of operating profit guarantees from Marriott benefited comparable hotel EBITDA margins by 20 basis points. Overall, expense growth is primarily driven by increased wage and benefit expense, which as anticipated from faster in the third quarter than in the first and the second quarters. We collaborate closely with our managers on a variety of internal initiatives to drive ancillary revenue growth, improved productivity and increased operating costs. For example, food costs improved by 40 basis points and controllable expense growth was held at sub-inflation levels. Such initiatives serve to partially offset the increases in wages and benefits this quarter, which continue to accelerate in this low unemployment environment. We estimate that 60% of our margin outperformance this quarter was driven by internal initiatives. Whereas approximately 40% of our margin outperformance is driven by benefits related to the Marriott Starwood integration. These include reduced fees related to loyalty and rewards program and lower group and transient travel agent commissions as Marriott continues to use its increased scale to improve programs and combine systems to lower charge-out rates to its owners. While Jim detailed our comparable RevPAR performance by segment, let me provide additional color on comparable RevPAR and market basis. Our best performing domestic markets this quarter was in New Orleans, Miami, the Florida Gulf Coast, Maui and Philadelphia. We achieved RevPAR increases ranging from 4% to 17.6%. Our worst performing market this quarter was Jacksonville, where Amelia Island was evacuated and there was forced hotel closure during hurricane Dorian as well as New York, Orlando, Seattle and San Francisco. Overall, as Jim mentioned, our third quarter comparable RevPAR has outperformed STR\u2019s luxury and upper upscale segments in the top 22 Host markets by 60 basis points. Looking at 2020, we feel optimistic about the group business in several of our key markets. Beginning with Miami, we expect special events such as the Super Bowl and the return of the Ultra Music Festival at Bayfront Park helped create compression in the first half of the year. In Phoenix, we have a strong 2020 group booking pace and the Phoenician continues to outperform the market and its competitive set through strong leisure occupancy and ADR growth. Washington DC also had a stronger citywide calendar next year with one additional event and room nights up by double digits. But it is an election year which may impact days and session and overall demand. The Florida Gulf Coast has a strong 2020 group pace, while the supply of new direct competitors is not a major factor. The Don CeSar and the Ritz Carlton, Naples are therefore likely to continue to outperform the market next year. While Los Angeles will still feel the impact of supply absorption, citywides are expected to be up next year and our properties are attracting a healthy group pace. In Denver, we also have a solid group pace and expect the supply to accelerate. And finally, Boston is also gearing up for better citywide next year. As Jim mentioned, we\u2019re pleased to be going into 2020 with a solid base of group business on the books, particularly as we expect to see continued pressure on business transient as the current macro uncertainty prevails. Moving on to the balance sheet, we achieved several milestones in the third quarter and in October. To begin with, we achieved an upgrade of our corporate credit rating BBB minus from BB plus by S&P Global ratings. We refinanced our Series D and B bonds maturing in October 2021 and March 2022 respectively. By issuing the first green bond in the lodging industry with a coupon of [indiscernible], which is the lowest effective 10-year bond pricing in the company\u2019s history. And as Jim mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, we refinanced our two term loans totaling $1 billion and expanded our revolving credit facility by $500 million to $1.5 billion. In aggregate, we completed over $3 billion of bank financing and have capitalized on the low borrowing cost environment. We have extended our weighted average debt maturity from 3.7 years to 5.7 years and reduced our weighted average interest rate from 4.3% to 3.9%, with an appropriately balanced floating to fixed ratio of 26%. In addition, we have eliminated debt maturities until 2023, while maintaining a balanced pro forma debt maturity schedule with no more than approximately 7% of our debt as a percent of enterprise value maturing in any given year. We ended the third quarter with $4.4 billion of total debt and $2 billion of cash. But subsequent to quarter end, we repaid our Series D and B bonds and completed $297 million of asset sales. As a result, our total debt is currently approximately $3.8 billion and our adjusted cash balance is approximately $1.6 billion, providing us with approximately $3 billion of liquidity, including the availability under our revolver. At quarter end, our leverage ratio was approximately 1.7 times as calculated under the terms of our credit facility and it\u2019s slightly lower pro forma for the asset sales completed subsequent to quarter end. In addition to the $400 million of buybacks completed year-to-date, we recently paid a regular third quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of approximately 5% on the current stock price. Turning to guidance, let me take a few minutes to detail the assumptions underlying our 2019 guidance. To begin with, we continue to expect to receive a total of $23 million of operating profit guarantees from Marriott for both comp and non-comp transformational capital programs, with approximately $3 million in total to be received in the fourth quarter. As Jim mentioned, we revised our comparable RevPAR guidance to a range of down 25 basis points to down 1%, indicating that we expect year-over-year RevPAR performance in the fourth quarter to be flat at the midpoint of our range. We expect the fourth quarter benefit from the lowest amount of renovation disruption in 2019 as well as a better December holiday calendar relative to 2018. We expect comparable EBITDA margins to be down 20 basis points at the low end and up 10 basis points at the high end of our guidance, which essentially implies unchanged margins despite flexible RevPAR expectations. These assumptions result in a full year forecasted adjusted EBITDAre of $1.505 billion to $1.530 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.75 to $1.78. We are revising our 2019 adjusted EBITDAre range to a new midpoint of approximately $1.518 billion, downward adjustment of $2 million from our previous guidance. The sales of the Hyatt Regency Cambridge and Sheraton San Diego, the tropical storms and hurricanes in the third quarter and the change in comparable RevPAR guidance range reduced adjusted EBITDAre by approximately $7 million at the midpoint. These were offset by approximately $5 million of lower corporate and other expenses in the fourth quarter as certain costs related to our office move will be reclassified as an impairment and therefore added back to EBITDA. With regards to a run rate 2019 EBITDA, the net impact of our 2019 dispositions and acquisitions will lower our run rate by approximately $58 million, which includes an approximately $30 million impact from the sale of the Hyatt Regency Cambridge and the Sheraton San Diego, as well as the previously disclosed $27 million impact related to net asset sales completed in the first three quarters of the year. To conclude, we are pleased to have delivered another quarter of successful capital allocation and to have further strengthened our balance sheet. We anticipate a much of the softness experienced by the lodging industry in the third quarter and are tightening our assumptions and guidance to reflect the incremental impact of continued macro uncertainty in the fourth quarter. We are well positioned for 2020 with a total group revenue pace of nearly 4% higher than the same time last year and with more than 65% of our rooms on the books. With that, we\u2019ll now be happy to take questions. To ensure that we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Q - Anthony Powell : Hi, good morning, everyone. Jim Risoleo : Good morning, Anthony. Michael Bluhm : Good morning, Anthony. Anthony Powell : Good morning. You mentioned that the Marriott capital plan is under budget and it seems to be going a bit faster than you originally guided to. Could you just update us on the total spend the cadence of the spend over the next couple of years and will there be less renovation disruption in 2021 relative to this year? Michael Bluhm : Yes. So this is definitely going to be our biggest year of disruption, Anthony. For 2019, the CapEx spending curve associated with projects about $225 million. For 2020, it\u2019s about $200 million, and in 2021 it\u2019s $175 million. And when you sort of think about right sort of the operating profit guarantees and sort of a measurement of disruption in 2019 where we talked about it, we\u2019ve got $23 million of operating profit guarantee that we have or will receive. In 2020, that number drops down to $16 million and then closes up to $19 million in 2021. Anthony Powell : Got it, thanks. And you also mentioned that you\u2019re seeing more redemptions from Bonvoy. What\u2019s the redemption mix in your portfolio and to those redemption of revenues continue to increase in future years? Michael Bluhm : Yes, look. I mean, I think you saw Marriott International talk about Bonvoy redemptions up 20% or something like that last quarter. I will tell you that we saw in our loyalty program of 7.1%, it was certainly a big strong contributor to the business, and particularly in a market where we really needed the transient to lean in, given the weak group calendar. Michael Bluhm : The dollar impact was year-over-year was about $3 million top line. Anthony Powell : All right, great. That\u2019s it from me, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Michael Bellisario : Good morning everyone. Michael Bluhm : Good morning Mike. Jim Risoleo : Good morning. Michael Bellisario : How are you guys, if at all changing your revenue management strategies, heading into next year? And then how do the group pace numbers that you provided, how does that compare to same time last year? Jim Risoleo : I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re making any material change to our revenue management strategies Mike. We\u2019ve said it\u2019s really a dynamic pricing model. And it\u2019s something we think about on a weekly basis quite frankly. I did mention in my comments that we\u2019re working very closely with our managers across our hotel portfolio both at the property level and at corporate to stay more keenly focused at this point in time on group, given the fact that we are still seeing some weakness in business, transient, travel. So nothing really different from the way we manage it before. Just a difference in focus, which changes from time to time. Additionally, you asked the question of what is our group bookings going into 2020 this year relative to last year. Last year at this time we had about 62% of our business on the books, this year we are at 65%. Michael Bluhm : Rich just to add to Jim\u2019s comment, typically we would see sort of 60% to 65% towards the high end and make note that\u2019s coming off of the record group year with five million group rooms nights. Jim Risoleo : Yes. One other thing I would add is Marriott is rolling out the enhanced reservation system. And we\u2019re working closely with them to really maximize revenue on a hotel-by-hotel basis by making certain that different room types, different room locations, different room categories are priced appropriately. It\u2019s just one more lever that can be pulled to enhance revenue at each property. Michael Bellisario : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Bill Crow : Good morning everybody. Jim we\u2019ve heard a lot of positive comments from not only your team, but others on the group pace for next year in certain markets. I think that\u2019s all fine and good. But the problem this year has not really been group, it\u2019s been leisure, it\u2019s been business transient, it\u2019s been inbound international, it\u2019s been supply. I guess I\u2019m just trying to get how much confidence you have based solely on this uptick that you think you\u2019re going to see in a number of markets? Jim Risoleo : Bill, we were faced with a very weak citywide calendar in 2019. And our under performance in Q3 was directly related to weakness in association group, which we anticipated. I think the number was down 4.3% for us in the quarter. So it did have a meaningful impact, 4.3% in room nights for us in the quarter on the group side of it. You raised the issue of new supply. As we think about the business, obviously we think about our segments starting with through association, corporate group, business transient, leisure transient contract and then we always have supply to deal with as well. So you are correct in saying that supply has been a headwind, particularly in the top 25 markets where we are strongly represented in 22 of those 25 markets. I take great encouragement that we were able to handle the outperform STR in the third quarter in the top 22 market segments as related to upper upscale and luxury. We actually picked up about 30 basis points in yield index in the quarter. So we\u2019re really focused on gaining market share and maximizing revenues through each category. When group isn\u2019t there, then we\u2019ll turn \u2013 when association group isn\u2019t there, we will turn to corporate group. When business transient isn\u2019t there, we will turn to leisure. Supply is going to tick along in 2020. But from our perspective, we see 2020 as the peak year for supply. Bill Crow : That\u2019s helpful. If I could just follow-up with one other question, when you have these massive renovations that you\u2019re undertaking now completing, what has been your experience with TripAdvisor scores or other review scores? How hurt do they get and what do you do to kind of change the momentum once you reopen? Jim Risoleo : Yes, of course, hotels in, let\u2019s say, not optimal condition, your TripAdvisor scores in ratings are going to be impacted. I think the example that I can point to that is from my perspective, I think, the poster child of what renovations can do for a property is the Phoenician. Prior to our renovation, the hotel was very tired. It hadn\u2019t had any investment for an extended period of time.  And in regards to the point where meeting planners just weren\u2019t even comfortable, taking groups to the property. Even though it\u2019s a great physical asset, great volumes over 600 rooms, great indoor meeting space, great outdoor meeting space, it had a spa which was underwhelming, it had a golf course which was under whelming. And by renovating that asset in a manner that we did, we\u2019ve seen it turnaround and just outperform in an incredible way. And next year, the group pace of that property is up well and we\u2019re seeing very strong leisure bookings also. So when a hotel is completely renovated, the TripAdvisor ratings and scores get wiped out and when it comes back online, it\u2019s re-rated at a higher level. Bill Crow : Okay, thanks. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Rich Hightower : Hey, good morning guys. Jim Risoleo : Hi Rich. Rich Hightower : So just a really quick question on 4Q guidance. If I\u2019m doing the arithmetic correctly, it seems like the implied range there from top to bottom is something along the lines of negative 1.5% to positive 1.5%. So correct me if I\u2019m wrong there, but if I\u2019m not wrong, what would drive the low end versus the high end kind of given the number of days left in the year? And then I\u2019ve got one follow-up after that. Michael Bluhm : Yes, let\u2019s just correct the math a little bit. On the high end, it is 1%. On the low end, it\u2019s 1.6%. At the midpoint, it\u2019s flat. Rich Hightower : Okay. So any qualitative factors kind of driving that range at least? Michael Bluhm : Yes, look, I think, as Jim pointed out, I think the fourth quarter is setting up to be a nice setup, right? We\u2019re going into with 1.1% up under group pace. December is in particular with Hanukkah moving to the back half of the month, really creates a nice clean December. So I think we feel like \u2013 you don\u2019t necessarily need to believe a lot to get to that level, but nonetheless anyway. Jim Risoleo : Yes, a couple of other \u2013 I will elaborate on that a bit, Rich. I referenced in my comments that we have 99% of our total group revenue pace on the books already, and that we saw a 1.1% pickup in total group revenue pace for Q4. Our Q4 bookings are currently standing at 94%. So we have a bit of room to fill in to really drive revenues at the properties in quarter four from a group perspective. We\u2019re hoping we would see another pickup in corporate group like we did in Q3 with the higher food and beverage spend. Two other points with respect to Q4 to give us confidence in our numbers. Number one, it\u2019s going to be the lowest renovation disruption quarter from the Marriott transformational capital program. We\u2019re anticipating about 10 basis points in renovation disruption in Q4. And lastly, we are getting an extra week in December relative to where we were last year. Given the fact that Hanukkah is virtually on top of Christmas. Rich Hightower : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then my follow-up here, if you take a step back, Host has sold something along the lines of $3 billion in assets over the past three years. I know some of that\u2019s opportunistic, some of that is part of sort of a targeted strategy of selling what you don\u2019t want to own into the next cycle and all that makes sense. But how far along do you think we are in that process and when do you sort of think we\u2019re going to have the team on the field that we want so to speak at the end of that process? Is there a way to sort of handicap that at this point in time? Jim Risoleo : I would say, I think, we\u2019re very far along, Rich. I mean there were unique reasons why we elected to sell the Sheraton San Diego and the Hyatt Cambridge, which I\u2019ll come back and talk about in a minute, but if you look at some of the assets that we\u2019ve sold, I would describe them as profitability challenged hotels. And that was really a focus on the assets that we sold in New York City, the 2Ws and the Westin Grand Central. We made a decision to exit for the most part all of our international assets and we sold our European JV position. You may recall, we also sold the JW Marriott, Mexico City, bringing in the coast to be much more of a U.S.-centric company. We have very little international exposure today, with three hotels in Brazil and two in Canada. So the rest of the assets and opportunistic was the sale of the Marquis retail. A lot of the other assets were really those assets that were generating very low RevPAR in markets that we view is dynamic and had high CapEx needs. And I would tell you that, I think, the Sheraton San Diego falls right into that category. The Hyatt Cambridge doesn\u2019t, and we evaluated each of those hotels on a standalone basis taking into consideration likely future performance, CapEx needs of each property and derive the whole value, and we have one buyer for both of them. I\u2019m not at liberty to disclose the buyer due to confidentiality in our documents, but we have one buyer for both hotels. And what that allowed us to do was really to exit the Sheraton in San Diego where, as you know, we have three really terrific assets with the Manchester Grand Hyatt, which is 1,600 feet and the San Diego Marriott Marquis which is 1,300 rooms and Coronado Island Marriott. So we had keen insights into that market and really understand the dynamic of what makes that market tick in, where demand comes from and where demand goes into what properties. Now Sheraton, I don\u2019t think we have another hotel in our portfolio like it from the perspective that it\u2019s a dysfunctional box in two towers and it\u2019s in a submarket location that I would say is probably third tier in San Diego. So as we think about it, that\u2019s probably the toughest asset that we had. We\u2019re happy to be able to exit that at what we consider to be a very fair price. The other hotel that we\u2019ve talked about from time to time is the Sheraton in New York. So we continue to explore the market for that asset and look at other alternatives for that property, but in general, I think, we\u2019re in very good shape. Rich Hightower : Awesome, thanks for that. Jim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Chris Woronka : Hey, good morning guys. Jim Risoleo : Good morning. Chris Woronka : Good morning. One of the big surprises, I think, this year has been kind of the continuation and the strength of the out-of-room revenues, especially on the, I guess ancillary and fee side. Can you maybe share with us how impactful that\u2019s been relative to your initial expectations? And then, is there a tail to that? How long do some of those ancillary gains continue as we look out into the future? Jim Risoleo : I think there are obviously a number of different components when we talk about ancillary revenues, Chris. And we\u2019ve seen increases in all of them, and we\u2019re going to continue to drive them because we think it\u2019s really important that while you realize RevPAR is a marker for overall performance, total RevPAR is a very good indication of how you\u2019re running your hotels and really speaks a lot to profitability of the properties. So we continue to see pickups in food and beverage and AD revenues across the portfolio. We have better capture of cancellation fees now, not that cancellations are higher, but due to automated systems. We are still continuing to see a ramp in spa and golf revenues. I would expect we\u2019ll continue to see that through the course of 2020 at the Phoenician, as I talked about it before, we\u2019ve redone the golf course and redone the spa and it\u2019s really paying off. And as we think about the higher rated corporate group customer, they also bring a higher spend and bank what revenues. So those are areas that we\u2019re focused on. Obviously another area of ancillary revenues continues to be resort and destination fees. We are continuing to focus on greater capture at our properties, making certain that any fee that we\u2019re charging is transparent to the customer and that there is a solid value proposition received on a case-by-case basis. Chris Woronka : Okay, great color. And just as a follow-up, it appears as if Marriott, you are based on our kind of analysis of all the numbers including your portfolio had some of their brands had lost share in the last couple of years maybe as a result of the integration, but now you know, starting with this quarter, certainly it looks like the gained relative share. Do you guys \u2013 is there a way for you guys to handicap that or underwrite that? And would you assume that the Marriott brands continue to gain relative share next year? Jim Risoleo : Yes, I would hope so that they will continue to gain share. We gained 30 basis points in share in quarter three, and we\u2019re very excited about that actually. Marriott is working very hard to improve the Sheraton brand. I think they realized that they have an issue with Sheraton across the system, and they are also going to reinvent the W brand, which I think are probably the two laggards when it comes to market share for Marriott. So they are undertaking efforts to fix those two brands going forward. I talked about Bonvoy, I talked about 137 million members. And what we\u2019ve seen in terms of a pickup in redemptions, it\u2019s clearly going to be a big impact going forward. And I think it will help across the system with gains in market share. It just goes without saying now as the two programs are integrated, the SPG member now has access to all the Marriott properties and the all Marriott Rewards member now has access to all of the legacy Starwood assets. So we saw a pickup in our portfolio in the third quarter and let\u2019s see what happens next year. Michael Bluhm : A couple of other quick data points. We saw direct booking channel go up 4% as well. And the other thing, and Jim touched on this in his comments, you know how we get a large percentage of our business with Marriott and Starwood in aggregate, and for us to outperform the top 25 markets, the top 22 markets so meaningfully, I think, really speaks to the effect that our operator in particular Marriott had done throughout the quarter. Chris Woronka : Okay, very good. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. I just wanted to go back on the dispositions. It sounded like you\u2019re towards the end of the program, but it would be interesting just to hear any thoughts you have on the current financing environment if there\u2019s been any changes there. And then just as a point of clarification, you mentioned a multiple of 14.1 times on the asset sales. Could you provide that multiple without including the CapEx that you would have invested into the properties that you continue to own them? Jim Risoleo : Sure. I think it\u2019s 11.3 times, Smedes. And if you look in our supplement, on Page 33 we clearly lay out and we\u2019ve done this quarter to quarter, we clearly lay out the methodology that we use in determining what the avoided CapEx is. It really is a component of our build-up to our whole value. We look at both the aggregate CapEx when we think about the reserves on the property as a marker for EBITDA and then we look at the owner-funded CapEx as a marker for cap rate. Those amounts were discounted back over a 10-year time frame, which is the way we do all of our whole values utilizing a discount rate of 8%. So it\u2019s a real number, it\u2019s in the disclosure document. Smedes Rose : Okay, great. Jim Risoleo : I will let Michael talk about the financing markets. Michael Bluhm : And then with respect to the financing markets, couple of observations. From the equity side, Jim has talked about before, private equity has been the marginal buyer today for the asset sales that we\u2019ve done as well as sort of the market in general. They are sitting today with a record amount of dry powder. The debt capital markets, particularly the CMBS market continues to be wide hot, the financing, sort of the financing on strategic hotels has been talked about as a bit of a head scratcher, but super low debt yields, record low interest rates. As long as that market continues to hold up both in the conduit and single asset securitization market, I think, makes for a pretty healthy backdrop with respect to transaction activity. Smedes Rose : Are you seeing any kind of increase in LTVs or\u2026 Michael Bluhm : No, we haven\u2019t. But interestingly enough, sort of notwithstanding how the market has sort of slowed down, the CMBS market continues to hold pretty tightly as the sort of same the debt yields even see into the past couple of years. Smedes Rose : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Great, thanks. I wanted to ask about plans for the balance sheet. You have already investment grade and then with these asset dispositions, you have a very strong balance sheet. What\u2019s the plan for that, you know, being so kind of under-levered? Is there a potential that you want to buy something and you want to be in a position to do that, or are you just trying to be defensive going into \u2013 concerned about a downturn? How should we think about what you\u2019re likely to do with your balance sheet at these levels, the leverage level so low? Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Robin, we certainly are not wishing for a downturn. We have been very active on the capital allocation front, and we view three outlets for capital today. One is on the acquisition side, which I\u2019ll come back and talk about in a minute. The second is investing in our portfolio, which we spend a lot of time talking about that in connection with the Marriott transformational capital program as well as the sustainability ROI projects and the other ROI projects that we\u2019re undertaking, and it is something that we continue to mine the portfolio for to look for other opportunities to create shareholder value. And the third is obviously share buybacks. And share buybacks to date have equated to $400 million plus a little more in the third quarter. So as we think about capital allocation going forward, we will take a measured approach on when and what amount to continue to buy back stock based on our view of the macro conditions in the world and our view of the operating cadence of our business as we think about getting into the budgeting process for 2020. On the acquisition front, in the last call, I talked about acquisitions having a high bar given the \u2013 frankly given the uncertain macro environment, but there may very well be a transaction or more than one transaction that makes sense. So it\u2019s going to depend on starting with what market the asset might be located in, what the demand drivers are, what the pricing is and what we think we can achieve going forward from asset management initiatives and improving the operating performance of a particular property. So I think there are a lot of things on the table. You never say never to anything, but by no means are we in any rush to get all this money invested. Michael Bluhm : Yes, look \u2013 and you should say, Robin, there is no read through for what we get on the financing other than it would capitalizing on what\u2019s probably one of the best financing environment we\u2019ve seen in our lives. Again, Jim\u2019s comment earlier, you never know where you\u2019re headed, but we had a couple of maturities coming up and we went back and you look at kind of what happened in last downturn, Marriott international bond spreads grew at 1,000 basis points for almost 18 months. So it was sort of certainly, it was a pretty prudent time to really push out the maturity schedule, and clean up the balance sheet and position us for whatever market was going into the next couple of years. Robin Farley : That makes sense. I guess maybe just one follow-up would be, is there sort of a target leverage ratio that I realize at any given point, you are evaluating share repurchase or an asset or two out there that you might want to buy? What should we think about as your targeted leverage range? Jim Risoleo : I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s changed from where we talked about in the past, and we are thinking about leverage in the range of 2.5 times to 3 times debt to EBITDA. Robin Farley : That leaves a pretty substantial potential in terms of what you could do with share repo transactions or acquisitions right, based from where you are now to get to 2.5 times to 3 times? Jim Risoleo : That\u2019s about $2 billion to $2.5 billion of dry powder. Robin Farley : Okay, all right, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our final question will be from Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors. David Bragg : Yes, this is David on for Lucas. Just two quick ones, for you on San Francisco. First off, just curious what your expectations are for that market next year, given your comments, Jim, on a weaker citywide calendar? And then the second one is just I\u2019m curious what you anticipate for your two Hyatt Hotels in that market with the new Grand Hyatt opening up at the airport? Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Yes, I\u2019ll talk about the two Hyatts first. The Hyatt at the airport is obviously an in-terminal hotel. We see it not impacting either of our properties in any material way going forward, I mean we have a lot of meeting space at Burlingame, it\u2019s really \u2013 so it\u2019s more toward a group house. I think the Hyatt at the airport is going to be transient. And Union Square is a unique hotel in an unique location. So next year, we\u2019re probably looking at San Francisco RevPAR performance of 2.5% to 3.5%, somewhere in that range. David Bragg : Got it. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Jim Risoleo for closing remarks. Jim Risoleo : Thank you for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate the opportunity to discuss our third quarter results and 2019 outlook with you. Look forward to seeing you at NAREIT and talking with you in a few months to discuss our full-year results as well as providing you with 2020 guidance. Have a great day, everyone. Thank you.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Tejal Engman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Tejal Engman : Thanks, Travis. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre in our comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP information in today's press release and our 8-K filed with the SEC and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide overview of our fourth quarter results, key business trends, and our outlook for 2020. Brian MacNamara, our Principal Financial Officer and Controller, will then provide detailed commentary on our fourth quarter performance, our capital position and our guidance for 2020. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James Risoleo : Thank you, Tejal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Before I address our 2019 results and 2020 guidance, I want to take a moment to thank Michael Bluhm for his service as CFO. We had significant accomplishments under his tenure that Brian will address and we wish him well as he begins his role as Global Head of Lodging for Morgan Stanley based in Los Angeles. 2019 was another highly productive year for Host. We successfully executed large value-enhancing capital allocation transactions and delivered a solid operational performance, which exceeded our adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per diluted share expectations for the fourth quarter. We capitalized on favorable market conditions and sold 14 of our lower total RevPAR, higher capital expenditure hotels for $1.3 billion. We further upgraded the quality of our portfolio by acquiring the iconic 1 Hotel South Beach, completing 4 renovations as part of the Marriott transformational capital program, and investing in multiple value-enhancing development projects across the portfolio. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while further strengthening our best-in-class investment-grade balance sheet. Finally, we delivered our strongest comparable total RevPAR and RevPAR performance for 2019 in the fourth quarter, while achieving solid margins in the year challenged by accelerating wage and benefit expense growth. We exceeded the top end of our full year 2019 adjusted EBITDAre guidance range, primarily due to stronger-than-expected total revenue growth at our noncomparable hotels. Comparable hotel total RevPAR was 190 basis points due to better-than-expected food and beverage as well as other revenues. We will discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail later. I would like to now focus on the 4 key business trends that impacted our 2019 operational performance and that are expected to impact 2020 as well. First is the strong food and beverage and other revenue growth that we experienced in the quarter and year. We delivered comparable total RevPAR growth that is 200 basis points higher than comparable room's RevPAR growth for the quarter and160 basis points higher for the year. Food and beverage revenues grew largely because of corporate in-house group business, which typically had robust contribution ratios. Other revenues were bolstered by miscellaneous increases, including higher golf and spa revenues. Our solid total RevPAR growth speaks to our ability to grow revenues through multiple channels at our hotels. Approximately, 35% of our revenues are earned from food and beverage, conference and meeting space, spa and other amenities. In an environment where the industry is near peak occupancy with modest ADR growth, our ability to grow revenues through nonroom sources is a key strength of our portfolio. While we expect continued total RevPAR growth in 2020, its growth rate should be roughly the same as RevPAR due to a tougher year-over-year comparison. The second trend is the strong growth we've experienced in loyalty redemption revenues, which has supported our leisure demand. Some of the increase is due to structural changes that Marriott International has introduced Bonvoy redemption, such as the opportunity to earn greater redemption revenue through increased occupancy tiers. Marriott introduced Bonvoy in early 2019 with the rollout across all consumer touch points, including our property sales and marketing channels, digital, mobile and co-branded credit cards. Additionally, the launch was boosted by a multimillion dollar media campaign. In late 2019, Marriott announced peak and offpeak redemption schedule, which should further support our 2020 growth expectations. Our redemption revenues have grown well in excess of the revenues outlined in the business case Marriott made for Bonvoy in 2019. In the fourth quarter, we grew Marriott Bonvoy redemption revenues by nearly 22% for our comparable hotels and 24% for all our own Marriott hotels, with the Venetian Ritz-Carlton, Naples and Ritz-Carlton, Marina del Rey achieving the highest redemption revenues in the portfolio. Although redemption revenues will also face tough comparisons this year, Host's ability to leverage Marriott's powerful loyalty program is another key strength for our business. The third trend is the continued acceleration in wage and benefit expense growth. Wage and benefit expenses increased 370 basis points in the quarter and 290 basis points for the year on a year-over-year basis. We were able to largely offset this expense growth through a variety of external and internal initiatives, which allows us to achieve breakeven margins at 1% RevPAR growth in 2019. Our external initiatives were driven by near-term Marriott-Starwood merger synergy, which were largely realized in 2019. Our internal initiatives, we expect smaller incremental efficiencies in 2020 relative to last year. Meanwhile, we expect wage and benefit expense growth to increase by approximately 5% in 2020 over 2019 as unemployment remains at all-time lows and job openings in the lodging sector reach record highs. Our 2020 guidance for comparable hotel expenses, however, is for 2.5% to 3.5% growth per available room, primarily due to productivity gain, partially offsetting wage and benefit expense growth. As a result, we expect breakeven margins at 3.5% to 4% RevPAR growth in 2020. We will further detail the impact of wage and benefit expense growth on our 2020 EBITDA margins. But here are 3 key takeaways on this issue. First, we expect the rate of wage and benefit growth to peak in 2020. Second, we are continuing to work with our operators to adopt productivity-enhancing technology that will decrease our operating costs over the long term.  And third, our exposure to world-class operators like Marriott and Hyatt leaves us relatively well positioned in a tight labor market, given their best-in-class retention and low turnover. Finally, we see prolonged macro uncertainty continuing to negatively impact expectations for U.S. nonresidential fixed investment, which has slowed materially from 6.4% in 2018 to 2.1% in 2019 and is now expected to grow by just 70 basis points in 2020. RevPAR is highly correlated with this metric, which is being impacted by trade and political uncertainty in an election year as well as by coronavirus. A sustained increase in nonresidential fixed investment would be a positive catalyst for the industry. But until it accelerates, our expectations for business transient travel remain muted, and our managers continue to focus on driving group and leisure business. Moving on to our outlook for group business in 2020. We are pleased to begin the year with total group revenue being 4.2% ahead of the same time last year as we benefit from a favorable citywide convention calendar 2020, with San Diego, Miami, Orlando and Washington, D.C. all pacing ahead. We had approximately 77.5% of our group rooms on the books and are 150 basis points ahead of the same time last year. Thus far, we haven't experienced a material direct impact on our business from coronavirus as Chinese travelers contribute approximately 1.5% of our room revenues. That said, the situation continues to evolve and the prevailing uncertainty could put further downward pressure on business transient revenues.  Additionally, supply is continuing to grow this year with a 2.3% increase expected across all scales on a net basis. As a result, we expect full year comparable constant dollar RevPAR growth to range between flat to up 1%. We would note that the addition of the 1 Hotel South Beach added approximately 10 basis points to our newly defined 2020 full year comparable RevPAR growth guidance as we owned the hotel for nearly all of 2019. We expect comparable EBITDA margins to be down 165 basis points at the low end and down 125 basis points at the high end of our guidance. These assumptions result in full year forecasted adjusted EBITDAre of $1.360 billion to $1.405 billion. While the midpoint of our -- of our 2020 total EBITDA guidance reflects a 10% year-over-year decline, approximately 60% of this decline is attributable to 2019 asset sales and declines in our noncomparable hotels due to renovation. Notably, our comparable hotel EBITDA is expected to decline by only 2.5% to 5% year-over-year. Finally, with much of the decline in EBITDA mitigated by our stock repurchase program, we expect adjusted FFO per diluted share of $1.65 to $1.71. Although margins are being impacted by accelerating wage and benefit cost growth this year, it is important to note that comparable EBITDA margins have improved by 80 basis points from 28.2% in 2016 to approximately 29% last year. We have held total expense growth steady at less than 1.5% for the last 3 years through a variety of external and internal initiatives. As mentioned earlier, wage and benefit cost growth is expected to peak this year, and we are working with our operators to adopt productivity-enhancing technology that we anticipate will decrease our operating costs over the long term. Shifting to the Marriott transformational capital program. 2 of the 4 renovations we completed last year, Coronado Island Marriott and New York Marriott Downtown have already achieved meaningful RevPAR index gains and are well positioned to accelerate EBITDA growth and stabilization. The San Francisco Marriott Marquis and Santa Clara Marriott were completed in the second half of 2019. And while it's too early to measure improvement, we have high expectations for these 2 properties. We expect to invest between $180 million to $200 million in the program this year and to complete renovations at the San Antonio Rivercenter and Minneapolis Marriott City Center in the first and second quarter, respectively, and JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead in the fourth quarter. We will also complete the second phases of 3-phased renovations at both the New York Marriott Marquis and the Orlando World Center. By the end of 2020, this program will be 60% to 70% complete. We are pleased to be completing these renovations in a low RevPAR growth environment, which minimizes the impact of the disruption and leaves us well positioned to achieve meaningful RevPAR index gains and accelerated EBITDA growth at stabilization. In addition to the Marriott transformational capital program, we are also implementing multiple value-enhancing ROI projects across the portfolio. We categorize these as product development, operational projects and energy efficiency or sustainability projects. Product developments include developing a 165-key AC by Marriott on excess surface parking at The Westin Kierland in Scottsdale and adding 19 new two bedroom luxury villas at the Andaz Maui. Operational projects include adding meeting space at the Orlando World Center, converting underutilized lobby space into grab-and-go marketplaces, repositioning F&B office and adding keys at several properties. Additionally, we have multiple energy efficiency projects which are an important part of our industry-leading corporate responsibility program and include major systems overhauls, LED retrofit and solar panels, among others.  We have historically achieved a high-teens average cash-on-cash return on these ROI projects, and we expect to grow this program going forward as an important piece of our capital allocation strategy. We differentiate ourselves through extraordinary execution, which achieves both a strong business case and prioritizes our sustainability goals for these projects. We have been recognized for our leadership and performance on sustainability, earning our seventh consecutive Green Star and Overall Global Sector Leader designation as well as a 5-star rating from GRESB this year. We have also been named to the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index for the first time and the North America Sustainability Index for the third time. Have won the NAREIT Lodging and Resorts Leader in Light Award four times in the past five years and most recently have been named to CDP's A list for leading our action against climate change. To conclude with capital allocation, let me briefly review our execution over the last two years within the context of our long-term strategic vision for Host. Since 2018, we sold $3.3 billion of relatively lower quality and lower total RevPAR assets in our portfolio. We have invested $1.6 billion into iconic assets with 2019 total RevPAR with more than double that of the assets we sold. All 4 of our acquisitions are in excellent condition, with limited near-term capital needs. We achieved higher blended cap rates and EBITDA multiples on our acquisitions than on our dispositions and have thereby minimized dilution to earnings while significantly upgrading the quality of our portfolio. In addition, we have bought nearly $610 million of stock since mid-2019, amounting to nearly 5% of our weighted average share outstanding. Finally, we have meaningfully strengthened our balance sheet by increasing our liquidity, extending our debt maturities and lowering our borrowing costs. Our asset recycling has reduced our CapEx intensity and improved the blended cap rate and long-term NAV profile of our portfolio. Our share repurchases have been accretive to FFO per diluted share, and the enhanced flexibility of our balance sheet has provided us with greater optionality to create significant long-term value for our shareholders. Today, our flexibility and willingness to use the appropriate value creation tool, whether it's stock buybacks, asset recycling, development or redevelopment at the opportune time to create meaningful value for our shareholders is what best differentiates Host from most of its lodging REIT peers. We have clearly demonstrated our willingness to use these value creation tools in 2019 and will continue to do so in 2020. Our long-term strategic vision is to own iconic and irreplaceable assets with high total RevPAR and limited near-term CapEx needs in key markets with strong and diverse demand generators. Market conditions over the last couple of years have enabled us to substantially reposition our portfolio at an accelerated pace. We believe that apart from a small number of assets that we would like to eventually monetize, our portfolio is where we want to be at this point in the economic cycle. With regard to acquisitions, while the bar remains high, we will continue to evaluate assets that meet our strategic objectives, focusing on opportunities where we can leverage our competitive advantages such as the owner, broker and operator relationships, our ability to do large transactions and our reputation for providing speed and certainty of closing and the flexibility of operating, taxes and e-structures to sellers. Overall, we are very well positioned with a favorable citywide convention calendar supporting operational performance this year and balance sheet flexibility providing us with greater optionality to create significant long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian MacNamara : Thank you, Jim. We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $355 million for the quarter and $1.534 billion for the year. As mentioned, we exceeded the top end of our 2019 adjusted EBITDAre guidance mainly due to strong revenue growth at our noncomparable hotels. Noncomparable total RevPAR grew 940 basis points for the quarter, primarily due to a post renovation lift at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis and strong redemption revenues at the Ritz-Carlton Naples. For the fourth quarter, comparable total RevPAR grew 190 basis points primarily due to higher food and beverage and other revenues. While fourth quarter comparable RevPAR declined 10 basis points, it would have been flat if adjusted for the estimated 10 basis points of renovation disruption related to the Marriott transformational capital program. During the quarter, occupancy was unchanged, but ADR decreased by 10 basis points, primarily due to the anticipated decline in group business, driven by an unfavorable citywide convention calendar. Transient revenue grew 270 basis points due to the growth in leisure demand which more than offset the continued business transient weakness. Although business transient revenues for the fourth quarter were down 350 basis points, driven by a room night decline of 340 basis points, we would note that the fourth quarter was the least affected by declines in business travel due to the favorable holiday shift in December. Looking at individual market performance for the fourth quarter. Our top 5 total RevPAR growth markets were : Orlando, Florida Gulf Coast, Atlanta, Denver and Phoenix, while New Orleans, Seattle, San Antonio, Northern Virginia and Hawaii trailed the portfolio. We think an important measure of our success in 2019 was our ability to deliver strong margin performance. Comparable EBITDA margins only declined 10 basis points for the quarter and 5 basis points for the full year, in line with the midpoint of our full year 2019 guidance. We believe this is an impressive performance as wage and benefit expense grew 370 basis points, driven by hourly wage rate increases, most notably in Southern California. While California was especially affected, the unemployment rate in most of our markets was below the national average of 3.7%, driving significant increases in wage and benefit expense across the portfolio. Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended 2019 with $3.8 billion of total debt, $1.6 billion of unrestricted cash and $1.5 billion of available capacity under our credit facility revolver. During 2019, we achieved several major financial milestones. First, we refinanced $1 billion in term loans and expanded our revolving credit facility by $500 million to $1.5 billion. Second, we achieved an upgrade of our corporate credit rating to BBB- from BB+ by S&P Global Ratings. Third, we refinanced $650 million of senior notes by issuing the first green bond in the lodging industry, with a coupon of 3 3/8% and yield to maturity of 3.467%. These represent the lowest effective 10-year bond pricing and overall yield achieved in our history. Lastly, we have minimal debt maturing until 2023, with a balanced debt maturity schedule with no more than 7% of our debt as a percentage of enterprise value maturing in any given year. In summary, we have executed over $3 billion of refinancing, which resulted in extending our total weighted average debt maturity to 5.4 years, reducing our weighted average interest rate to 3.8%, all while maintaining an appropriately balanced floating rate mix of 26%. Finally, in 2019, we returned significant value to our shareholders with $482 million of stock repurchases as well as a total cash dividend of $0.85 per share, which represents a yield of approximately 5% on our current stock price. We also just announced the first quarter dividend of $0.20 per share. Turning to the forecast. Let me take a few minutes to detail the assumptions underlying our 2020 guidance. As Jim mentioned, we expect our revenue performance to be driven by group and leisure transient business as a result of the citywide calendar, growing economy and strong employment numbers. While the U.S. economy continues an unprecedented growth cycle, we have been thoughtful about the impact of the global economy and our own election cycle, which we believe continues to constrain the level of business investment. Overall, we expect our performance to be stronger in the first half of 2020 due to the strength of our group booking pace and more difficult comps in the second half of the year. We will also continue to benefit from owner's priority and operating profit guarantees related to the Marriott transformational capital program. Our forecast includes a total of $16 million of operating profit guarantees from Marriott, of which $9 million is included in comparable hotel EBITDA. Equally important, we expect as more properties are completed, we should begin to see an increase in each hotel's RevPAR index, which should bolster overall EBITDA for the properties. For modeling purposes, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter will range from 26% to 28% of our annual forecast. Lastly, total shares currently outstanding are approximately $705 million, reflecting the additional shares repurchased in the first quarter. In conclusion, we believe that Host Hotels & Resorts is the premier lodging REIT in the industry. We have a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio whose consistent performance is driven by strong in-house analytics and by working with the best operators in the business. With the only investment-grade balance sheet among lodging REITs, we are well positioned to continue to execute on our strategic vision to create long-term value for our shareholders. With that, we will now be happy to take questions. [Operator Instructions]. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Anthony Powell, Barclays. Anthony Powell : Question on your commentary about cost increases peaking in 2020. I'm just curious why would that be given unemployment is still pretty low? Is it because of your own initiatives to increase productivity and efficiency? Or do you think that underlying inflation may start to decline next year and beyond? James Risoleo : I believe that the underlying reason that we're seeing 5% increases in wages and benefits in 2020 really has to do with wage parity in certain markets. It's not a -- the 5% number is not rolled out across the portfolio, but it's in markets like Orange County, California and Houston, Texas. And we think that as we roll wage increases out, bring our associates at the hotels to parity, that we'll see more normalized wage increases going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Smedes Rose, Citi. Smedes Rose : I just wanted to ask you on your decision to change the same-store guidance. So I know that it affected for the new -- more newly acquired properties, but does it also change the timing from when renovated properties will come back into the same-store pool? James Risoleo : It does not, Smedes. We have -- we studied this. We've thought about it and talked about it quite a bit internally. And I'm sure you're aware there is really no consistency among the lodging REIT peer group with respect to how we handle renovation projects and when renovations are deemed to be noncomp and when they come back into the comp pool. So we're still thinking about that. We obviously had a number of projects this year. There is a noncomp, and we frankly didn't think it was appropriate to make any changes with respect to the renovation side of the definition at this point in time. One thing that is consistent though that we have before not done is to report acquisitions on a pro forma basis. And everybody in the world of lodging REIT does report acquisitions on a pro forma basis, and that's why we made the change with respect to the 1 Hotel South Beach, and we will handle that in that way going forward. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Bill Crow, Raymond James. William Crow : I'm actually going to ask 1.5 questions. Half a question is really focused on a follow-up from Anthony on labor costs. Just wondering how that's manifesting itself in your operations? In other words, are you seeing turnover dramatically higher? And is it fair to go back to the brands and ask for some flexibility in brand standards when it comes to labor, given the stress that everybody is under? James Risoleo : Bill, we're not seeing inordinate amount of turnover. In fact, we benefit from the labor practices of two world-class operators who run most of our hotels, Marriott and Hyatt. They had very good retention rates. They're very attractive organizations for people to work at. So it really is solely as a result of wage parity in certain markets. That's why we're seeing the large increases this year. William Crow : All right. And the real question is more strategic in nature. And thinking about it from a capital allocation perspective and even the share repurchase perspective, how would you do things differently if we're -- if you thought we were kind of trapped in the slow growth environment for several years? James Risoleo : Well, Bill, you asked one question that keeps us up at night. Again, it's something that we think about from a -- not only from a capital allocation perspective, but also from an operation perspective. We have lived through some pretty meaningful down cycles. I won't go back beyond 9/11. But of course, we learnt a lot, given what happened to our industry in the post 9/11 world and then lived it again in 2008, 2009. So I think if we were to find ourselves in this type of tepid RevPAR growth environment or flat to negative RevPAR growth environment with resulting EBITDA declines, we would be having meaningful conversations with our operators about lasting brand standards. And that can mean everything from taking a look at restaurant offerings and hours of operation to in-room guest amenities, to guest amenities in concierge lounges and club lounges. Not that we're not doing this today. We would really push beyond those lines labor scheduling and technology.  So I think that's one of the first things that we would do if we found ourselves near to this environment for an extended period of time. On the capital allocation front, our balance sheet has never been in better shape. We -- as we sit here today, we have $1.6 billion of unrestricted cash. And if we were to go 3x leverage today, we could buy $2.5 billion plus of assets -- $2.5 billion to $3 billion plus of assets. As we think about the macro environment that we operate in today, we are being measured in our capital allocation decisions. We like the optionality that our balance sheet gives us today. If we're in a slow growth environment, couple of things we would consider doing might include accelerating investment in our portfolio going forward. We have the ability to do that, so that our assets are very well positioned when we see a reacceleration of RevPAR. We might consider if our stock price comes under pressure, enhancing the buyback program.  And lastly, I think that if we are in this environment for an extended period of time, you're likely to see some distress in the hotel world. We're seeing it already in New York. There's been a number of articles written regarding the level of default in New York City going up. And we like the position we're in with the balance sheet that we have, the optionality and flexibility to pivot one way or the other in good times or in tough times. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Hightower, Evercore. Richard Hightower : So like Bill, I'm going to ask 1 question with two totally unrelated parts. So here it goes. So really quickly the first part, just talk about maybe the thought process behind a relatively narrow range of comp RevPAR guidance, 100 basis points from top to bottom? And then -- so that's the first one. And then quickly, just more on the topic of cost controls. Are you seeing -- when we think about sort of more catastrophic weather events around the country, around the world, are you seeing a tightening in insurance market, specifically? And how do you sort of think about that with respect to your Florida exposure and maybe some other at-risk areas? James Risoleo : The tight range, Rich, was really based on our view of the group visibility that we have today with 4.2% total group revenue pace and 77.5% of our group on the books. I would add that, I didn't address this in my comments, our group business is weighted more heavily towards the first half of the year than the second half of the year, which gives us comfort and visibility. And we continue to see strong leisure business -- transient leisure business. We're not seeing anything, frankly, on the business transient side. So we were very comfortable with the range we gave, primarily based on group visibility. And your second question was related to cost controls -- was it related to insured cost? Richard Hightower : Yes. Just related to insurance cost, specifically, as we think about your Florida, your California exposure and is -- I guess, is Host in a position where you're big enough to where you can self-insure to some extent and so you see maybe a little less inflation in that particular cost category? James Risoleo : No, we don't self-insure. We are in a unique position given the platform that we have, the scale that we have across a very diversified set of market. Our insurance cost will be going up this year. The insurance renewals occur midyear. So we would expect to see insurance cost increase in July, going forward lapping. Insurance cost is about 10% of our total cost basis. So it's not that meaningful. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Bellisario, Baird. Michael Bellisario : Just on your development and redevelopment comments that you made in the prepared remarks, is there room to do more here? And then how do you think about returns on these types of projects and then the risk associated with doing more redevelopment and development projects at this point in the cycle? James Risoleo : Well, returns on development and redevelopment projects will at stabilization be double-digit cash-on-cash. It's going to range from property to property. Our returns on the Andaz Maui villas given the cost associated with developing and building Hawaii is likely to be on the lower end of that range, whereas we're in the process of moving forward with a large part at the Orlando World Center Marriott, where we expect very meaningful cash-on-cash returns as a result of putting that amenity in place and what that will allow us to do is shoulder a weakened transient business.  So the attractive returns we think that in addition to buying back our stock, which we view as incredibly inexpensive today, that investing in our portfolio is a very good place to be allocating capital. It's easier to underwrite these returns given our knowledge of the assets and the in-house expertise that we have. We have a best-in-class team, both on the asset management side and on our design construction side with years and years of experience of doing these types of projects. We are not going to say we never had a surprise, but we had very few surprises when it comes to construction budgets and timing. And we're very comfortable with our underwriting. I would just point out on the Marriott transformational capital program, where we're slightly underbudget in the aggregate for all the deals that we have undertaken today, and those are major products. Michael Bellisario : Got it. And just fair to assume though that maybe versus 12 months ago, your appetite for doing more redevelopment and development is higher? Is that fair? James Risoleo : I wouldn't say that -- I wouldn't really say it any differently. I mean, again, we have -- I have talked about it before. I mean we have the optionality given our balance sheet to allocate capital in a lot of different areas, whether it's within our portfolio, whether it's making acquisitions or buying back our shares. Operator : Our next question comes from Gregory Miller, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Gregory Miller : Jim and Brian, I'm on for Patrick Scholes. Just a quick question. How sustainable do you see the dividend today given the trajectory of RevPAR margins this year and next as you mentioned earlier about the balance sheet being in -- never being in better shape? James Risoleo : We feel that this dividend based on our forecast for this year and how we're looking out to 2021 is sustainable at its current level. If we were to take into consideration our discretionary CapEx, not our maintenance CapEx, but our discretionary CapEx, our AFFO payout ratio is approximately 70%. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Malkin, Capital One Securities. Neil Malkin : I'm just going to ask one question with zero follow-ups. So I guess, just relating to the political landscape in California, you've seen the Oracle canceling the event in San Francisco, moving to Vegas, citing homelessness, drug, et cetera. You have split roll coming potentially at the end of this year. Just, I guess, what are you guys doing to combat these issues that seem to be garnering more and more headlines? Are you guys doing things with other peers, lobbies, et cetera? I'm just interested to know how you think about that area and your plans to navigate that going forward. James Risoleo : Well, as I'm sure you will -- Neil will accept, myself and others at Host are very involved in various trade associations. I'm an officer of NAREIT, I'm an officer of AHLA. Struan is involved with AHLA. Nate is involved with AHLA. We are keenly focused on these issues not only at Host, but in concert with our constituent groups at those respective organizations. So when we think about split roll, it's something that we talk about internally, that we talk about at AHLA and NAREIT. And I would tell you that there is a unanimous point of view about how that will be approached going forward from a lobbying perspective and otherwise. Neil Malkin : Okay. I guess, so in terms of like maybe San Francisco, does -- I mean do you think there's more to come, in terms of people leaving or anything like that would be helpful as well? James Risoleo : We don't see anything more on the horizon there. Rich, actually I want to clarify something I said about insurance. I put an extra 0 behind the expense growth, it's 1% of expenses, it's not 10% of expenses. Operator : Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley, Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Jim, just wanted to clarify the -- maybe -- I think it was in the remarks to an earlier question, but just to make sure I caught it correctly. At least one of the big hotel operator -- brand operators did mention a little bit of positive activity on the sort of the demand or transient side over the last few weeks. Curious if you can corroborate anything you've seen in your hotels or anything that stands out maybe on the transient or the corporate side? And then -- so that would be the positive. And then on the cautious side, you gave the Chinese exposure on the coronavirus and that's really helpful. But we have seen some evidence of some group cancellations. Anything that's impacted Host Hotels or sort of just discussion points in the industry on group cancellations would be helpful. James Risoleo : Yes, sure. On the business transient side, Shaun, we just don't see pickup. In business transient, our long history is really driven by nonresidential fixed investment. And the uncertain macro environment that we're living in today is driving nonresidential fixed investment down to a forecast of 70 basis points for 2020, off of a high -- not high, off of a 6.4% number in 2018. So I think businesses are being very cautious. Small businesses, in particular, are being cautious about spending money in this environment. So we have more clarity on the election and more clarity on coronavirus. I do think we still need clarity on trade policies. I know we've implemented a Phase 1 deal with China. I think there's a Phase 2 deal with China that needs to happen. And there's uncertainty with respect to our trading partners in Europe today. So we're not seeing it on business trend.  I wish I could tell you that we were, but we're just not. We are comfortable with the cadence in our guidance based on our group visibility, which is weighted towards the first half of the year. And we expect to see further pickup in leisure transient going forward. So coronavirus, we've seen a total impact top line revenues of about $1.5 million. We -- this year that there's a 1 group -- Facebook canceled a meeting in San Francisco. It was about 14,000 room nights scheduled for the first week of March. We really don't know why they canceled that meeting. There's some speculation that it was as a result of coronavirus, but definitively, I can't say it was for that reason or something else. And we're not sure of anything else at this point in time. Operator : Our next question comes from Aryeh Klein, BMO Capital Markets. Aryeh Klein : So loyalty redemptions have been very healthy. How sustainable do you believe those are, with some of that pent-up demand post the merger and just customers essentially cashing in? And maybe if you can talk to the visibility you have there going forward? James Risoleo : Our loyalty redemptions have been healthy. As I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we saw a meaningful pickup at three of our hotels, in particular, the Ritz-Carlton Naples, The Rich-Carlton Marina del Rey and The Phoenician as well. The changes that were made to the pricing structure, the tiered pricing structure and the occupancy levels to allow the owners to benefit in a greater way than have been structured under the old bed program we think are very sustainable going forward. We saw a meaningful pickup relative to the numbers that Marriott provided us when they were making changes to Bonvoy and more than double that the business cases they provided to us. And we expect to see additional pickups this year. The other thing that happened in the latter part of 2019 was a rolled out -- Bonvoy rolled out a peak/offpeak tier structure that we also think will provide benefits to the owners going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Woronka, Deutsche Bank. Chris Woronka : Jim, I was hoping to get your opinion on -- as we see the big brand companies kind of introduce more and more brands and soft brands and semi-soft brands, what's your position on whether those are truly competitive with some of your, I would say, smaller kind of non-big group box properties? And at what point do you think owners -- is it something that the owners have to address with the brand companies? James Risoleo : My personal point of view on supply is supplying that. I don't care what kind of supply it is. It's going to nip around the edges, we call it ankle biters. When we have big room houses and you've got a select-service hotel that's built in your submarket, it clearly is going to have some impact on you. The good news about our portfolio is that it's well diversified. We don't have any more than 10% of our EBITDA coming out of any one market. And it's something that we talk about with the brand all the time. I mean we are in a constant dialogue with them regarding impact of new development projects. It's just something that Host and all other owners are talking about and talking to the brands about today. Operator : Our next question comes from Wes Golladay, RBC Capital Markets. Wesley Golladay : Just another question on business transient trends, are you seeing much variance by region? James Risoleo : Not really, Wes. I'd say it's fairly flat across the portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Sullivan, BTIG. James Sullivan : Quick question on the strength of the balance sheet as well as the appetite to buy back more shares. I think in the prepared comments, Jim, you mentioned that in terms of optionality, if shares come under pressure, you could obviously buy back more stock. And I wonder if you could help us understand what kind of flexibility you have and -- whatever metric you want to give, debt-to-EBITDA, is obviously very helpful. In terms of where you think you could go in that ratio, in terms of buying back shares before you'd be, well, maybe hesitate to go any further. How much more debt can you put on the balance sheet to buy back shares before the investment-grade rating becomes an issue? James Risoleo : Well, I think this is a very hypothetical question, Jim. But in theory, and I'm not suggesting for a moment that we would do this, we could borrow up to $2 billion and that would take us to 3x leverage. And that is not anything that we're contemplating at this stage of the cycle given the macro uncertainty that exists in the world today. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Powell, Barclays. Anthony Powell : Just a question on the mix of customers. I think, historically, we thought that Host had about 2/3 business with group and corporate transient combined. It seems like transient -- I mean corporate side has been weak for a number of years. What's the updated customer mix between group, corporate transient and leisure transient in your portfolio? James Risoleo : Corporate transient is about 59%, Anthony. And of that 59%, roughly 60% business and 40% leisure, contracts about 5% and groups right around 36% to 37%. Operator : This concludes today's Q&A portion. I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Risoleo. James Risoleo : Thank you for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate the opportunity to discuss our fourth quarter results and 2020 outlook with you. Look forward to seeing you at NAREIT and talking with you in a few months to discuss our first quarter results as well as providing you with more insight into how 2020 is progressing. Have a great day, everyone. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Tejal Engman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Tejal, please go ahead. Tejal Engman : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Before we begin please note that none of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC and in the supplemental financial information on our Web site at hosthotels.com. Participating in today's call with me will be Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Macnamara, Principal Financial Officer and Controller; and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President Strategy and Analytics. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Risoleo : Thank you, Tejal and thanks for joining us this morning. We hope that you and your families are safe and healthy and we extend our deep [indiscernible] for those affected by COVID-19. [Indiscernible] the lodging sector is navigating its unprecedented towards that is expected to be at least twice as severe as the Great Recession. After a strong January and February, U.S. RevPAR posted deepest decline on record and is expected to further deteriorate in April according to SER data. Although we couldn't have anticipated the outbreak of a global pandemic, Host is well positioned to withstand the magnitude of its impact due to years of prudent capital allocation that emphasized maximizing balance sheet capacity and liquidity towards the end of the cycle. Today, we not only expect to persevere through this crisis, we fully expect to emerge with a stronger operating model, the highest quality portfolio in the company's history and the ability to capitalize on future opportunities to create value for all our stakeholders. This morning, I will address our liquidity and cash flow position, key business segment trends and our revised capital plan. Brian will discuss our first quarter performance and [indiscernible] and provide our forecast for April. We began this year with the lowest leverage in the company's history at 1.6x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. No near-term debt maturities, $1.6 billion of cash on hand, a fully unencumbered consolidated portfolio and an investment credit balance sheet. We drew down our $1.5 billion credit facility revolver in mid-March and ended April with approximately $2.7 billion of cash including FF&E reserves after paying approximately $140 million first quarter dividends which were declared in February. At quarter end, our leverage ratio as defined in our credit facility was at 2x, our interest coverage ratio was at 6.8x and our fixed charge coverage ratio was at 4.6x, all of which are well within the limits specified in our credit facility covenants. We expect to remain in compliance with all our credit facility covenants through the second quarter and are currently in discussions with our supportive bank vending group to secure greater flexibility on our covenants requirements. Moving on to expenses, we and our operators responded to the precipitous decline in revenues in March and April by implementing portfolio wide cost reduction and are unprecedented in their magnitude. These include reducing the fixed portion of our property allocated costs by as much as 2/3rds. The suspending contributions for hotels FF&E escrow accounts, suspending most brand standards and unfortunately furloughing up to 80% of the hotel workforce. As of yesterday, operations at 35 of our 80 consolidated hotels representing 43% of our total room account are suspended. We work with our operators to determine whether to suspend operations at our hotels based on the properties ability to generate revenues that are greater than the incremental cost associated with remaining open. If the hotel is expected to achieve this incremental threshold, it remains open. Our preference is to leave hotels open as long as it is financially justifiable to do so because we believe an operational property is better positioned to capture demand when it begins to recover. Our scale within several markets such as New York, Washington DC, San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange County and Chicago has helped us generate operational efficiencies and to further benefit from consolidating low levels of demand at multiple properties into the hotels that remain operational in that market. For example, we have gained operational efficiencies in Washington DC, with the leadership of the JW Marriott overseeing the Washington Marietta Metro Center in the Westin Georgetown. The same has been achieved in New York and other markets. Demand consolidation is benefiting our hotels in Los Angeles, San Antonio and San Diego, where we are able to consolidate demand into one property in each of those markets. For the hotels that remain open, our managers have significantly scaled down operations by closing guests room floors and meeting spaces and suspending food and beverage outlet operations. Due to timing, we expect to see the full benefit of these operating expense reductions in April. When total hotel operating expenses are expected to be 70% to 75% lower than our initial forecast from February. At the corporate level, we expect to further conserve cash by reducing our capital expenditures by $100 million to $125 million and our corporate expenses by 10% to 15%. Finally, we expect to either suspend our second quarter dividend or cut it to $0.01 a share which is a reduction of approximately $140 million compared to our prior $0.20 per share quarterly dividend. As a result of these anticipated cash savings initiatives and a worst-case scenario where all of our hotels are effectively closed through the end of 2020 and the dividend remains expensive or reduced, our monthly cash outflow would average $120 million to $140 million per month, reflecting average hotel level expenses of $70 million to $80 million a month, as well as estimated capital expenditures, interest payments and general corporate overhead. Importantly, in this worst-case scenario, we would end 2020 with approximately $1.65 billion of cash, including the FF&E reserve, leaving us with ample liquidity to support operations as the economy recovers. Moving on to group and transient business trends, through May 4, we have lost an estimate of $1.3 billion of expected 2020 revenues. This represents approximately $630 million of total group revenues known to-date and $660 million of total transient revenues forecasted for the first half of the year. Approximately 90% of our total group revenue cancellations have been for the first half of the year, with over 60% in the second quarter alone. Of the approximately 10% of total group revenue cancellations in the second half, less than 3% for the fourth quarter, while the low levels of cancellations for the fourth quarter are encouraging. We believe that the near term pace of group and transient business remains uncertain until the consumer feels comfortable travelling again. Our operators have revoked approximately 12% of our total 2020 loss group revenues with the majority revoke for the second half of 2020. Although we expect a significant portion of our total group revenues to be lost due to timing, as they were driven by a favorable 2020 citywide convention calendar a majority of our group customers have expressed a desire to be booked at our properties. Finally, we have collected $32 million cancellation fees to-date with $10 million recognized in the first quarter. Shifting to 2021 total group revenue pace, we began this year with 2.3 million definite rooms on the books for 2021 and pace was nearly 3% ahead of the same time last year. Although 2021 group booking activity is half what it was last year and our total group revenue pace is now flat. We believe group demand return over time with decision makers on the sidelines and wait and see mode, we believe the pace of recovery in both group and business transient will depend upon customers feeling safe to travel. Markets with stronger group for 2021 are San Antonio, San Diego, Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago, whereas New York, Orlando, San Francisco, San Jose, Denver and Boston currently have pace opportunities. Given the current uncertainty, pace by market could change considerably in the weeks and months to come. We continue to believe in the long-term viability of the group business, while the association business model relies upon generating income from large group meetings a more intangible reality is that most group meetings allow members within an industry to connect with and learn from each other while building relationships and trust in a manner that we don't think it's possible to replicate digitally. In the long run, we believe using group volumes to compress, supply and generate productive yield management will remain a cornerstone of the lodging business. That said, we are positioning ourselves for the recovery to be led by drive to leisure destinations. As observed in China and other parts of Asia that are several weeks ahead of the United States. The recovery thus far has been like -- been led by domestic leisure stay and drive to destinations. With renovations recently completed and construction are planned within the next 12 months, over 70% of our portfolio and our strongest drive to leisure markets will be fully refreshed. Specifically, our hotels in Phoenix, San Diego, Orange County, San Antonio and Florida, which represent over 13,000 keys or nearly 30% of our total portfolio are very well positioned to capture a recovery and drive to leisure demand. We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and guests. Most of our hotels are managed by large brands who are known for reliably delivering consistent service and standards. These brands are now raising their cleanliness standards to even higher levels with new protocols to address the current circumstances. We believe branded hotels, communication around and execution of rigorous cleaning standards will resonate well with customers. Moreover, we expect the strength of their loyalty programs to be a strong driver of demand to our properties. Turning to our supply outlook, while will take several quarters before we have a complete understanding of the change in hotel supply growth, [we've tucked] [ph] our internal net supply expectations for 2020 in half based on broad assumptions surrounding project delays or announcements and existing hotel closures. We now expect supply growth of roughly 1% in 2020, with average growth over the next three years remaining below the long-term historical trend. Moreover, we believe there is a high probability that several projects that have not yet begun construction will be cancelled or significantly delayed. Although no one knows the timing or shape to recovery, we are hopeful that occupancy declines may have stabilized and found a bottom in April. We are frequently asked what level of occupancy will allow us to breakeven at the hotel [ebill line] [ph]. As you may imagine, it's difficult to provide a number as it varies greatly by property requires ADR assumptions and is likely to change on a monthly basis. We have done the analysis based on a single month of operations in the current environment with significant expense reductions remaining in products. In that scenario, assuming ADRs decline 15% to 30%, on a year-over-year basis, we would expect to see hotel, even our breakeven at 35% to 45% portfolio occupancy. Our enterprise analytics and asset management teams are working closely with our operators to strengthen a long-term hotel operating model with near term goals of achieving breakeven and generating higher profitability and lower levels of occupancy. In the 2009 recession, several operating expense line items were significantly reduced and continue to improve through the cycle. While we expect our hotels with new expenses, especially ones related to new clean standards, downturns compel owners and operators to reevaluate brand standards, programs and above property expenses and exercise that can result in long-term saving and a healthier hotel operating model that better serves customers changing needs. Turning to CapEx, we have reduced our 2020 capital expenditures by $100 million to $125 million, which represents an approximately 50% reduction to the portion of the CapEx budget that was already spent, underway or committed. Approximately 85% of our CapEx savings are derived from eliminating non-essential renewal and replacement CapEx spend, with the remainder coming from suspended ROI projects. We continue to plan on spending $180 million to $200 million on the Marriott transformational capital program and now expected to see $20 billion in operating profit guarantees this year. It makes sense for us to complete these renovations for these reasons. First, we benefit from $20 million of operating profit guarantees without experiencing commensurate revenue disruption given the current unprecedented low RevPAR environment. Second, we expect the renovations to position us to achieve meaningful RevPAR gains through the cycle, particularly as most hotel owners are compelled to cut back on renovations due to liquidity constraints. And third, construction bids are coming in below budget and market pricing is expected to decline by at least 6% to 10%, which provides us the opportunity to buy out construction at lower prices. In addition to all of this, as the performance of these properties return, we will receive enhanced owners priority on this investment, which will reduce the incentive management fees we pay Marriott. As part of this year's Marriott transformational capital program, we have completed renovations at the San Antonio River Center Marriott and we will finish the Minneapolis City Center Marriott in just a few weeks. Later this year, we plan to complete the JW Marriott bucket. In addition, we expect to start the Ritz Carlton Amelia Island, which is scheduled to complete in the first quarter of 2021. Finally, we will complete the second phases at both New York Marriott Marquis and the Orlando World Center Marriott, which are scheduled to complete in the third and fourth quarter of 2021 respectively. Combined with the properties completed as part of last year's capital program, including Coronado Island Marriott Resort and Spa, New York Marriott Downtown, San Francisco Marriott Marquis and Santa Clara Marriott, the Marriott transformational capital program being nearly 70%, complete by the end of 2020. While the program consists of a mix of group and leisure dominance in hotels and markets, these transformational renovations are expected to have a useful life of 7 to 10 years will help our property gain market share and outperform through the next cycle. While our revised CapEx plan as soon as projects will be completed substantially as scheduled, COVID-19 has impacted our ability to implement renovations as supply chains have been disrupted and certain state and local orders have deemed construction non-essential. We will continue to provide quarterly updates on our capital plan for the year. As I reflect on leading hosts over the last few years, and now through this crisis, it is gratifying to know that our prudent and disciplined capital allocation strategy towards the end of the cycle has served our stakeholders well. In 2018 and 2019, we sold $3.3 billion of our relatively lower quality and lower total RevPAR assets at the top of the market. Additionally, we capitalize on the favorable debt capital markets last year, tax acute over $3 billion of refinancing, which extended our debt maturities and reduced our borrowing cost at an opportune time. While we also acquired $1.6 billion of high quality assets, bought back $629 million of stock, and invested in developing and redeveloping parts of our portfolio. We deployed each of these value creation tools and then measured in disciplined manner, not knowing when the cycle would end, but discerning that balance sheet strength and capacity would be a paramount importance when it did. Today, as we enter a new logic cycle, we feel hopeful about our future where the threat of this pandemic has passed. In the meantime, we are taking the opportunity this crisis provides to further stress that our operating model and to learn how to do generate higher levels of profitability and lower levels of occupancy. We are excited to be entering a new cycle with a highest quality portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable assets in the company's history and likely in the lodging industry. When demand recovers, we believe that the quality of our assets, many of which will be newly renovated will be a true differentiator that will help us gain RevPAR index share and outperform the industry. We continue to believe in the strength of both geographic and demand diversity through the cycle. Geographic diversity will serve us through an uneven recovery of various states and markets and their lockdowns at different times. Demand diversity will help us drive optimal revenue management and pricing through the cycle. Finally, we expect our relative balance sheet strength to continue to be a differentiator that will provide us with greater flexibility to capitalize on future long-term value creation opportunities that meet our strategic objectives. With that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian Macnamara : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Prior to the spread of the pandemic in the United States, business was off to a strong start in 2020. For the total portfolio in January and February, RevPAR was up 220 basis points driven by 120 basis point increase in occupancy. Total RevPAR was up 490 basis points for the same period. As a result at that point in the quarter, we were ahead of last year by approximately $20 million, March, however, experienced 65% decline in RevPAR, driven by a 52% drop in occupancy, we lost 730,000 rooms nights due to shelter in place orders and widespread changes in business travel policies. March room revenues declined by $200 million year-over-year and drove over first quarter RevPAR decline of 23.3% as occupancy fell 17% year-over-year. Our first quarter results include a $43 million wage and benefit expense associated with moves to suspend operations and the necessary changes to hotel level staffing. These costs include an $8 million cash payment to hotel employees in March and the $35 million accrual for furlough benefits in April and May. If our operators extend those benefits for the approximately 80% of the workforce that is currently furloughed, we would expect the carrying costs for those employees beyond May to average $15 million to $17 million per month for the entire portfolio. As Jim mentioned, we have worked closely with our operators to reduce operating expenses and expect to realize that 70% to 75% reduction in hotel level operating expenses in April compared to our initial forecast. As a reminder, our initial forecast in February implied that hotel level expenses at the midpoint would be approximately $3.8 billion for the full year. On the revenue front, we expect the total RevPAR for April will decline by 90% to 95%, reflecting the extremely low occupancies in most markets. Demand in April has largely been restricted to medical professionals and airline crews. For example, The Sheraton New York Times Square and the New York Marriott Marquis achieved occupancies close to 50% in April, primarily driven by medical and first responder business, being two of the largest hotels in the city to remain open, has provided the Sheraton and the Marquis with a great opportunity to capsule this business. With New York City thankfully continuing to make progress from earlier peak infection levels, this business is expected to taper off in early to mid-May. By the end of March, we had suspended operations at 13 properties. As occupancies continue to decline through April, we suspended operations at an additional 22 properties, bringing the total number of suspensions to 35. A typical staffing model for properties that have suspended include a management team of 5 to 7 associates working as scheduled that has been reduced anywhere from 20% to 40%. Further, there is management oversight of the security department and in certain circumstances, properties have layered in additional sales and event department management to assist with the rescheduling and planning of future group business. Hourly positions are generally limited to single associate per shift in the engineering and security departments. Properties that are operational will generally have the same base management coverage as suspended properties as well as minimal rooms management, though again, working at significantly reduced hours. Typically, these managers are covering both the housekeeping department in front desk as well as actively working to shift in one of those departments. Hourly positions in addition to the security and engineering positions previously mentioned may include a housekeeper shifts based on occupancy and front desk coverage. In the very limited cases where food service is provided, one chef or kitchen shift would be added to prepare a limited to go menu. Although visibility remains limited, we do not anticipate additional suspensions at this time. Timing with regard to reopening the 35 hotels where operations are currently suspended, however, remains unclear. Our reopening criteria are based on the timing of state and local authorities and the pace of our bookings and revenue growth projections. We are working with our operators to determine how cost can be managed through the impending recovery, such that we can achieve breakeven levels as quickly as possible, with the goal of generating higher levels of profitability at lower levels of occupancy over time. Shifting to market performance, our top performing markets in the first quarter were all in negative territory, although they outperform the STR, upper tier segment in their respective markets. Top performing markets include Phoenix, San Francisco, New Orleans, Atlanta, Miami, San Diego, New York and the Florida Gulf Coast. The underperformers were San Antonio, Maui/Oahu, Jacksonville, Orange County, Denver, Northern Virginia, Washington DC, Seattle and Houston. The majority of the $630 million of total group revenue loss that Jim mentioned has been driven by six markets : San Diego, New York, Orlando, Phoenix, San Francisco and Boston. However, we have experienced cancellations across the portfolio with 24 markets showing greater than $5 million in total group revenue cancellations. We are not providing any 2020 guidance at this time. Our lack of visibility regarding the depth and duration of the pandemic, the timing of the reopening of individual states and localities and the expected operating restrictions for businesses as well as individual company travel restrictions is simply too uncertain at this time. I would note that in prior recessions peak to trough declines in hotel level EBITDA have been roughly twice as large as the peak to trough declines in RevPAR. Although this 2 to 1 ratio should have deteriorated considerably in a near zero revenue environment, we believe it will continue to hold true for our portfolio due to our significant success in reducing fixed costs at the property level. Our confidence in our ability to not only persevere through this crisis, but to be able to drive value for stakeholders is based on the strength of our investment grade balance sheet. We have significant liquidity to withstand the worst-case scenario of a complete shutdown of our entire portfolio until year end 2021 subject to our success and obtaining covenant waivers for our COVID hit facilities. Moreover, we have no significant debt maturities until 2023 and have approximately $2.7 billion of available cash as of April 30. Finally, the company has access to other sources of liquidity, including secured debt, asset sales and capital market transactions. To be clear, the company has no need to tap into additional sources of liquidity. But I mentioned them to provide reassurance that we do not expect liquidity to be an issue for host. Today more than ever, we believe that Hosts Hotels & Resorts is the premier lodging REIT in the industry. We have a high quality, well-diversified portfolio whose consistent performance is driven by strong in-house analytics and by working with the best operators in the business. With the only investment grade balance sheet among lodging REITs, we are well-positioned to deal with this crisis and to continue to execute our strategic vision to create long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you. And with that, we will now be happy to take questions. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible. Please limit yourself to one question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Anthony Powell from Barclays. Your line is now live. Anthony Powell : Yes. I'm well in New York. Things are okay here getting better. Just a question on your credit facility amendment that you're seeking a lot of the other amendments that have come with restrictions on dividends, buybacks and acquisitions. How do you ensure that you maintain flexibility to take advantage of opportunities and your balance sheet strength even as you kind of secured amendment [indiscernible] facility to give you more comfort around your covenants? Jim Risoleo : Sure. We made a conscious decision to let some time pass before we fully engaged with our bank lending group, which I'm glad has been incredibly supportive. We have long standing relationships with all of the lenders in our credit facility, some going back 25 years since the time Host was formed. So we're in a really unique position because as you heard today, we have the runway in a very worst-case scenario to take us through 2021 from a liquidity perspective, we do have access to multiple sources of capital should we need it, which we don't believe we're going to need it. We'll only need it to play offence at the time when opportunities present themselves and we can see greater visibility going forward. So as we're having conversations with the Bank Group, we're keeping into consideration -- taking into consideration maximum optionality and flexibility to put us in a position to play offence going forward. And, we feel really good about the fact that we're going to be in compliance with all of our credit facility covenants through at least the second quarter. And I would expect in the next several weeks, we will be in a position to announce publicly through a press release and a 8-K with the amendments to that credit facility look like. Anthony Powell : Just a clarification, I believe you said, you expect 2 to 1 RevPAR and EBITDA client at this time. I think STR had a 50% RevPAR decline assumption for this year. Does that mean you expect you'd rather be zero this year that environment with bottoms down or is that too simplistic to see? Jim Risoleo : Yes. If you STR data that would be a correct assumption. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Bellisario from Baird. Your line is now live. Michael Bellisario : Just thinking on that same topic of playing offence question is kind of one, what do you cueing off of to make that decision? And then how were you thinking about the different ways to ultimately create long-term value today, or at least when those opportunities present themselves? Jim Risoleo : Mike, we are in a unique position given the strength of the company and the fact that we came into the year at 1.6x debt to EBITDA with $1.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet, we are truly in a position to persevere through this downturn through this pandemic and come out the other side in a position to play offence. Now when does that happen? I think right now it's very premature at this point in time, I don't think you're going to see us or anybody else in a position to acquire hotels until we have greater visibility on the case of how the U.S. economy is going to perform and how it's going to recover. I think everyone is in agreement today that we are in a recession. We just don't know the depth of the recession, nor do we know the duration of the recession. There are numerous conversations occurring between hotel owners and lenders today with respect to waivers, interest forbearance, it's a question of how that's all going to play out and where the opportunities are going to be. I think it's a little too soon to know. But when we have visibility and when we start seeing opportunities come to market, we will be in a position to take advantage of those opportunities. We're talking to our bank group about giving us some optionality to acquire hotels as we move forward. Obviously, the hotels are going to have to be a strategic fit for us. They're going to have to be priced appropriately, they're going to have to allow us to believe that we're going to be able to create shareholder value or we're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation. We think it served us very well toward the end of this cycle, and given us an opportunity to play offence. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Rich Hightower from Evercore. Your line is now live. Rich Hightower : So Jim, I want to go back to the sort of the breakeven occupancy calculation. And I think you guys said that it includes an assumption for 15% to 30% declines in ADR. And I'd like to maybe hear your opinion on the art of pricing a hotel room, coming out of COVID given that everything is at a standstill and starting from scratch. How do you anchor the customer's expectation to that sort of a rate starting from zero base, and what do you think the progression for ADR, might be over the next few years kind of in that framework? Jim Risoleo : Sure. We are having daily conversations with our operators regarding reinventing the revenue management model. We don't think revenue management is by anything -- by any means a thing of the past today, we think it's more important than ever. And our primary concern is going to be focused on rate integrity and not rate degradation. It's tricky and a low RevPAR environment, low occupancy environment that will grant you that. But as an example, in the month of April, we ran at a very low occupancy for the portfolio of about 13%, just north of 12%. We ran $135 ADR, that doesn't sound great, but when you're selling rooms in hotels that -- in many instances, if you put New York aside or running it, low single digit occupancies to maintain a rate in that level is pretty good from our perspective. So as we look at breakeven occupancy in ADR, it's really a quite a variable exercise, it's going to change hotel by hotel, it's going to change its occupancy and demand increase and expenses creep back into the property. So that the numbers we gave you with respect to occupancy declines and ADR declines are really based on the low level of expenses that we're experiencing today. So as those expenses increase, it's going to be a balance between incremental expenses going into the property against occupancy and ADR gain. Is that helpful to you rich? Rich Hightower : Yes. That's helpful, Jim. I will hop back to the queue. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Smedes Rose from Citi. Your line is now live. Smedes Rose : I just wanted to ask kind of bigger picture I kind of picked off Rich's question. I think coming into this typically labor cost for a typical hotel have been kind of in the 40% to 45% range, assuming we return to some kind of more normal, business environment, where do you think that number can go to? It seems like there's going to be a lot of thoughts around maybe not cleaning hotel rooms when guests are using them, but there might be more cleaning outside of the rooms or where do you think that could just move to or do you think it just kind of stay with the same after everything's been reallocated? Jim Risoleo : I'll start. I'll give you a couple thoughts here, but I'm going to ask Sourav to jump in on this one. I can tell you this. We view this opportunity this crisis truly has an opportunity to redefine the hotel operating model. And there are going to be incremental costs associated with cleaning and sanitizing because we think that that is going to be critically important. It's always been important to the travelling consumer to know what they're getting when they check into a hotel room and the fact that the majority of our properties are managed by Marriott and Hyatt gives us great comfort because they are at the top when it comes to cleaning and sanitizing standards and their outreach to consumers has been meaningful and it will continue to be meaningful. So we think this is truly a distinguishing factor relative to the independent hotel operator because the customers are going to be comfortable, if they're going to stay in a Marriott managed hotel or a Hyatt managed hotel, that it's going to be sanitized. It's going to be clean. And safety is paramount today. I mean, we talked a minute ago about, ADR, and I can tell you based on some focus groups that have taken place, the customers don't really care as much about ADR as they care about their personal safety. So we think that between the brand standards with respect to cleanliness and cleaning, and the fact that we are affiliated with the best loyalty program in the space is going to give us a true competitive advantage as we come out of this pandemic. So I will let Sourav give you a little more color on how we're thinking about the hotel operating model. Sourav Ghosh : Hi, Smedes. I want to start-off by saying that our managers are truly committed to taking costs out versus putting costs back in. And where the opportunity really exists is going to be, I would put it in sort of three broad buckets. One is going to be reduction of about property costs. Second is the brands are really focusing on brand standards and figuring out which brand standards are archaic and can be either eliminated completely or modified. And the third is really adapting to the changing customer preferences, particularly leveraging technology. So think about would we really need the front desk as we know it today with the touchless technology that does exist, with a customer want to interact during the check-in experience. So that's the three broad buckets I would put it into. The incremental costs associated with cleaning, we believe should be offset by improvement in productivity. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is now live. David Katz : Hi, good morning, everyone. Good to hear everyone's voices. Thanks for taking my question and for all the information. I wanted to ask about group business, we are wondering and endeavoring to research around groups that maybe postponing or rebooking later on in the interest of avoiding a cancellation fee and/or sort of kicking the can down the road a bit. This may be more of a qualitative question relying on your experienced intuition, but I just wonder what you think about that. Jim Risoleo : David, I think that we think as a management team and then in consultations with our operators that if we agree with the premise that we're going to see a return of the leader customer first primarily led by drive to destinations, then we'll see a return of the business transient covenant customer. And lastly, we'll see a return of group. We feel that group is not likely to start meaningfully coming back to hotels until May 2021. At this point in time, a) we talked just a minute ago about the need for cleanliness and confidence in consumer safety. That's going to be paramount. And I would say that in till we have a vaccine it's not likely you're going to see group come back in any meaningful way. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Your line is now live. Robin Farley : Great, thanks. Most of my questions have been addressed already about potential M&A. I guess one question I had, you made a comment in the introductory remarks about I think you said group for next year being flat or pasting flat or something. I guess I just wanted to get a sense of how much are you seeing people holding off on booking new group for 2021? So in other words, maybe you are still flat with prior year, but how does that pace look, in terms of, are people holding off on next year already? Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Yes. Robin, I think that our pace, our numbers came down a bit year-over-year in terms of group booking pace, but I believe we said that we have 2.3 million room nights on the books for next year, which is about flat relative to where we were at the same time last year. So, people are still booking I think it really goes to the uncertainty surrounding the scope and depth of the crisis. We think group is a very viable part of the hotel business going forward. Associations have to have group meetings to survive. It's part of how they make money. But, the intangible is the fact that group meetings are very important for interaction and building relationships and building trust among the people that participate in group meetings. We don't believe that this is able to be replaced digitally. It's just not going to happen over a Zoom call. So, we feel that that group is going to continue to be a viable part of the business and I Sourav has something he wanted to add. Sourav Ghosh : I would just add for -- I think we're looking out into the future 22 to 23, our total group pay is still pretty strong at positive 2.5%. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Bill Crow from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Bill Crow : Jim, I think you mentioned you collected $22 million or $32 million of cancellation fees split between the first quarter and the second quarter. I'm just curious about that because it seems awfully tough to recoup cancellation fees, especially in the second quarter, given the lockdown and less than 10 people meeting restrictions and things like that. Can you give us some commentary on that? Jim Risoleo : Yes. Bill, I think this was the cancellation fees that we collected were collected early in the year early in the pandemic and we collected 30 million total, we recognized 10 million in the first quarter. I would not expect that you're going to see that cadence to continue as we move forward. So we're more interested in working with our customers, many of whom are long-term customers and we want to maintain those relationships and encourage them to rebook their business at our properties. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Woronka from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Chris Woronka : Want to ask you a little bit of longer term question. I know you guys have made a lot of progress over the years with food and beverage efficiency and getting margins up. So the question is, as we look out, three to five years, do you think it's going to become I don't know whether it's necessary or ideal to maybe have smaller food and beverage operations and I know that you needed it and a lot of your convention hotels, but a lot of the other hotels, it seems like, there's always a cap on profitability. So, do you think that's something you look at during this downturn and it looks different coming out? Jim Risoleo : Absolutely. We are having conversations already with our operators regarding the need for three meal a day restaurants in many of our hotels. We're having conversations around eliminating breakfast buffets in the restaurants, maybe only opening the restaurants for breakfast. If this is an opportunity to rewrite brand standards going forward, you're spot on that this is something that we're thinking about and talking about. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Shaun Kelley for Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Jim, I was hoping we could spend a little bit time on -- I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about, your sort of opportunistic sales on some of the non-core assets in the portfolio. And, obviously, you're quite successful on that over the last couple of years. Is there anything remaining in that bucket that you think needs to be addressed, I appreciate it's not the kind of ideal time but sort of maybe just what's the comfort range with where you're at with -- let's call it the go forward portfolio number one. And then number two, in that group of hotels that, if there is anything that doesn't fit the profile going forward. Is there a need to reopen in this environment? How do you think about sort of longer term closures and maybe property type obsolescence for some of those, let's call it non-core assets. Jim Risoleo : Sure, Shaun. I said over time that we are very comfortable with the composition the portfolio we have today, our sales are always opportunistic, we will sell a hotel, when we feel that the price we're receiving exceeds our hold value, which we do on a regular basis for each property in the portfolio. So, we'll continue to be opportunistic in the future. Today, there's no need for us to sell any properties and in this environment where we think pricing would be very challenging, we'd much rather be an acquirer and take this opportunity to add to the portfolio that we have today to continue to upgrade the quality through acquisitions as opposed to sales. So the short answer is, we'll be opportunistic when the time is right. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Thomas Allen : You talked earlier about more optimism around drive to resort markets. There's some positive data out of STR earlier this week. Are you seeing any increased bookings for your resorts any data points you can give? Jim Risoleo : Sure, Tom. That is a green shoot that we saw in May, we feel that occupancy hit a bottom in April, as Brian mentioned in his comments, the business that we booked in April was really related to medical and airline crews and some first responder business hit certain other hotels, some National Guard business, things of that nature. But in two of our drive to properties in particular, we're seeing very good booking numbers for Memorial Day weekend at the Ritz Carlton, Amelia Island. We are seeing a business on the books that would lead us as we sit here today to 60% occupancy over Memorial Day weekend. And the Don CeSar in St. Petersburg Beach, another terrific resort property, we expect to see occupancy in the 50s, as we sit here today. And hopefully those numbers will continue to grow. We're also seeing good booking activity in June and July. In June, we're seeing booking activity in the 13% to 15% range in July, it's significantly higher. So let's keep our fingers crossed and hope that that business continues to grow. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Steve Brunner from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Steve Brunner : So I know you guys stated that you don't have at this time timing of reopening by specific markets. But, if you guys had some sort of high level estimate, you are going to make I guess an educated guess which market do you guys see openings first? Jim Risoleo : It's a tough question to answer because 14 of the top 20 markets still have restrictions in place with respect to when people can get back to business as normal. So we just don't know. What I will tell you is that, as we've discussed and everyone believes that drive to leisure demand is going to be the first part of the business to return. We have over 13,000 rooms and drive to markets today. And those markets include Florida, San Antonio, Phoenix, Chicago for the summer; Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego. So we are closely watching when restrictions are lifted. And we would hope that those hotels in all those markets that I just mentioned, the 13,000 rooms that we have will be some of the first to reopen. But at this point in time, it's just difficult to really put a date on when that's going to happen because it's out of our control. Operator : Thank you. We've reached end of our question-and-answer session. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today. Jim Risoleo : Well, thank you all for joining us on the call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our first quarter results with you and we look forward to virtually seeing you at NAREIT and talking with you in a few months to discuss our second quarter results. Have a great day everyone and stay safe. We will all get through this pandemic and look forward to seeing you in person soon.",

We hope that all of you are staying safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. The lodging industry experienced a challenging second quarter with record revPAR declines in April followed by a slight improvement in lodging demand through May and June, working with our operators we responded swiftly to the changing demand landscape by reducing our second quarter hotel operating expenses by 72% year-over-year. As states and markets began to ease their lockdowns, our portfolio achieved over 100% hotel revenue growth from the lows of $24 million in April to $49 million in June. Toward the end of the second quarter, we successfully amended our credit agreement and achieved outstanding terms that preserve our liquidity and retain our flexibility to capitalize on value enhancing investment opportunities. All-in-all, we emerged from the most challenging quarter on record for Host and the travel industry with significantly lower operating costs, greater balance sheet flexibility and access to $2.5 billion of liquidity. Starting with operations, our second quarter expense reductions and revenue growth were driven by exceptionally agile asset management and the swift reaction of our world-class operators. As lodging demand plumbed a record lows in April, we worked with our operators to suspend operations at 35 hotels, reduce hotel fix costs by approximately 50% and reduce overall hotel operating costs by 72% year-over-year. Cost savings were primarily driven by steep reductions and wage and benefit expenses and the fixed portion of above property allocated cost, as well as by suspending most brand standards and contributions to hotels FF&E reserve accounts. At operational hotels, our managers significantly scaled down operations by closing guest room floors and meeting spaces. When leisure demand began improving through May and June, we swiftly pivoted to reopen hotels and work with our operators to drive 380 basis points of average occupancy gains and a 50% increase in average room rates across the portfolio from April to June. As of yesterday 64 of 80 our consolidated hotels representing 78% of our total room count were operational. We prioritized reopening eight suspended hotels located in drive two leisure markets including Florida, San Diego, Phoenix, San Antonio and Orange County as these markets captured leisure demand and delivered higher second quarter revPAR than the rest of our portfolio. We currently expect another six hotels to reopen in August with operational rooms representing nearly 90% of our total room count by month end. As a reminder, we work with our operators to reopen a property when it's expected to sustain approximately 10% to 15% occupancy levels. At those levels, we expect incremental revenues to exceed the incremental cost of being operational, resulting in marginally lower EBITDA losses. Our preference is for hotels to remain operational rather than suspended because an operational property is capable of capturing spontaneous, short-term demand and better position to attract future demand when the market begins to recover. All that said we continually review our hotel's occupancy trends and won't hesitate to suspend a hotel's operations when the marginal benefit of remaining operational turns negative. For instance, we are currently reviewing the New York and San Francisco markets. New York has been slow to reopen with the recent pause on indoor dining and the cancellation of the 2020 United Nations General Assembly and New York Marathon events, while San Francisco has enacted an onerous costly and unnecessary operating ordinance. As we deliver both significant expense reductions and gradual revenue improvement, we reduced our hotel level operating loss by nearly 50% from $73 million in April to $37 million in June. Our hotel level monthly operating loss averaged $54 million while above property corporate level monthly cash flows averaged $79 million in the second quarter with a latter reflecting a concentration of CapEx which is expected to decrease by approximately $100 million in the second half of the year. We ended the second quarter with $2.5 billion of available liquidity which includes $750 million of available capacity under the revolver portion of the credit facility, as well as over $150 million of FF&E escrow reserves. Assuming operational performance remains at second quarter levels, we would expect approximately to $100 million to $110 million of total monthly cash outflows, reflecting an average hotel level loss of approximately $50 million a month as well as estimated capital expenditures interest payments and general corporate overhead. In this scenario, we would expect to end with approximately $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion of total available liquidity. If operational performance remains at second quarter 2020 levels beyond year end, we would have ample liquidity until mid-2022 even with CapEx near 2020 levels subject to continued covenant waivers for our credit agreement. Moving on to our balance sheet. Our quarter end leverage ratio as defined in our credit facility was at 4.6x. Our interest coverage ratio was at 4.4x and our fixed charge coverage ratio was at 2.7x, all of which were within the limits specified in our prior credit facility covenants. With the amended credit agreement in place, our quarterly tested financial covenants were waived beginning July 1st, 2020 through the second quarter of 2021, with testing to resume for the third quarter of 2021. Although, the duration of this pandemic induced crisis remains unknown. We continue to expect our liquidity position and balance sheet capacity to remain key comparative strengths that differentiate Host is one of the few lodging REITs that is less likely to need to issue equity expressly to delever its balance sheet. Shifting to business performance. We saw clear signs of a recovery in consumer demand through May and June as state and market lockdowns began to ease. Our booking pace indicated a solid pickup in June and the trend leading into the third quarter but has since decelerated since daily infection rates in certain markets have spiked. 13 of our Top 20 markets have regressed their open reopening phases in the last three to four weeks while the other seven remain in their existing phase. Needless to say this trend has impacted our reopening plans. When Hawaii announced that on August 1st, they would lift the 14-day quarantine requirement for travelers who test negative for COVID-19 up to 72 hours prior to arrival, the on the books occupancy for our Mowry resorts quickly reached mid-teens. We therefore expected to reopen Andaz Maui and the Fairmont Kilani in august but have now delayed our reopening plans as Hawaii has extended the quarantine through at least the end of August. Surprisingly, we saw some group business in the second quarter despite the absence of a vaccine or an effective therapeutic. Excluding New York, which benefit from COVID-19 related emergency services group business, traditional group business showed signs of improvement as it grew from 1,700 room nights sold in April to 12,855 sold in June. For the whole portfolio, business transient room nights grew 150% to 12,459 room nights in June after bottoming at 4,850 room nights in April. While business transient demand has primarily been driven by defense contractors, we have begun to see consulting related business travel in July. Government transient room nights also improved from 650 room nights in April to 6,450 room nights in June. Finally, contract business held up relatively well in the second quarter, with 43,000 contract room nights sold in the quarter. Our San Antonio hotels increased airline crew volume year-over-year, while New York Airport, Hyatt Place, Waikiki and Grand Hyatt Buckhead all saw production improved throughout the quarter. As of June, our properties have 1.8 million group rooms on the books for the full year 2020, down nearly 62% from 4.6 million group rooms same time last year. Our total group revenue pace is down 81% in the third quarter and 49% in the fourth quarter. And we continue to expect group cancellations in the second half of the year. We have rebooked approximately $120 million of canceled total group revenues with an additional $96 million in the pipeline that collectively represent nearly 21% of the total group revenue that cancel this year. We are also working with our operators to find creative ways to fill the demand gap, with long-term group walks from schools, sports associations and corporates. For example, Houston Airport Marriott received a large corporate group booking of 175 rooms per night from July to December, in addition to another corporate group booking of 100 per night on a month to month basis. The rooms are being used to quarantine COVID-19 negative employees for 14- days prior to International deployment. Looking at next year, we are experiencing a high single digit deceleration in our total group revenue booking pace for 2021, as measured by definite revenues on the books. With most of the deficit concentrated in the first half of next year and minimal impact to the second half. Our tentative revenues, however, are tracking nearly 30% ahead of the same time last year, reflecting robust pent-up demand that's waiting for the current health and safety risks to subside. Our business outlook depends upon how quickly we as a nation can flatten the rate of new COVID-19 infections, while we await a more effective solution, which we expect will take the form of a vaccine. In the interim, increasing consumers' confidence and our industry has never been more important. The major hotel brands have been proactive in creating, implementing and communicating new cleanliness and health and safety standards, including corporate requirements for face coverings to be worn within indoor public spaces. These safety protocols help address the risk of contagion and establish trust with consumers specifically at Marriott long known for consistency and reliability, we expect their commitment to clean program to resonate with both business and leisure customers alike. Encouragingly, as a percentage of second quarter revenues, our direct sales through Marriott Dotcom increased 400 basis points over last year, compared with sales through OTAs increasing by 200 basis points. As we have consistently said, Host benefits from our strong affiliation with world class hotel brands. We continue to believe that beyond strong loyalty programs, brand trust and reliability will be differentiators that will help most outperform during the recovery. We remain deeply committed to redefining our operating model with the immediate goal of achieving breakeven as soon as possible and the longer-term goal of generating higher profit profitability and lower levels of occupancy. In the 2009 recession, several operating expense line items were significantly reduced and continued to improve through the cycle downturns compel owners and operators to re-evaluate brand standards, programs and above property expenses and exercise that can result in long term savings and a healthier hotel operating model that better serves customers changing needs. To that end, we are working with our operators to deliver permanent cost savings at the hotel level through the following three key initiatives. First, to achieve a long-term reduction in the fixed component of above property charges. Second, to adopt productivity enhancing technology, such as the use of mobile key. And third, to drive efficiencies through the cost utilization of management functions. While achieving these long-term permanent cost savings is conditional upon reaching an agreement with our operators, we have analyzed the potential benefit they could have on our operating model. Based on 2019 revenues, we believe these measures have the potential to reduce annual hotel level expenses for our current portfolio by an aggregate $100 million to $150 million, which represents approximately 3% to 4% pro forma 2019 hotel level expenses. Turning to our supply outlook, although there has been little evidence of a material decline in supply so far, there is a historical pattern of supply rationalization after large demand shocks, when we look at the historical supply trajectory for the top 60 to 70 markets, rooms under construction and major markets fell by 68%, two years after the peak of 2008 and were down 77% by mid-2011. We therefore expect supply will be mitigated over the long-term, with rooms under construction declining overtime, and likely bottoming at even lower levels than in the last recession, given a significantly greater degree of distress. In addition, we expect record levels of permanent hotel closures due to the unprecedented level of distress in the market. According to Trup, the lodging delinquency rate has risen from 2.7% in April to 19% in May, and has reached approximately 24% in June. Our analysis indicates and nearly 30% of upper tier hotels and our top 20 markets are temporarily closed. Seven hotels in our top 20-markets are reported to a permanently close already and we expect more of the temporary closures to become permanent.  To conclude, we have experienced four months of significant economic uncertainty as our nation lockdown began to reopen, flattened infection rates in certain markets and experienced sharp increases and others. Although, we expect economic uncertainty to prevail until the health and safety risks posed by the pandemic are fully addressed, we are encouraged by the following. First, our operators' ability to adapt the operating model to record low levels of demand by reducing our hotel level operating costs by 72%. Our goal is to make a portion of these cost reductions permanent and to achieve higher levels of profitability and lower levels of occupancy. Second, is the resilience of lodging demand, which began to return as states and markets reopened and as our booking trends indicated, would have been greater had infection rates continue to flatten rather than rise. Although, there is some debate about the future of business travel as professionals grow accustomed to virtual meetings, we would note that U.S. occupancy has achieved higher peaks following the last three downturns, including 9/11, when many believed air travel would be permanently impacted. While speculating on long-term behavioral trends in the midst of the biggest global health and safety crisis in a century is likely to be unproductive. Business transient and group business customers have a proven track record of choosing the effectiveness of in person interactions, despite the efficiency of video conferencing technology. Finally, we are confident in the strategic advantages provided by our financial capacity to withstand prolonged business disruption. Host is different in its potential to not only survive this crisis, but also to capitalize on future long-term value creation opportunities that meet our strategic objectives. We are excited to have entered a new cycle with the highest quality portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels in the company's history and likely in the lodging industry. When demand recovers, we believe that the quality of our assets, many of which will be newly renovated, will be a true differentiator that will help us gain RevPAR index share and outperform the industry. We continue to believe in the strength of both geographic and demand diversity through this cycle. Geographic diversity will serve us through an uneven recovery as various states and markets recover differently. While demand diversity will help us drive optimal revenue management and pricing through this cycle. My remarks would not be complete, if I didn't mention how conversations about confronting systemic racism have reverberated throughout our society. Diversity, equality and inclusion remain at the forefront of our priorities and integral to our corporate values. I was proud to recently join the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion Initiative and as an organization, Host remains committed to fostering these values in our company and our communities. With that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian Macnamara : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, the volatility in the second quarter was unprecedented as the demand landscape changed over the course of the quarter. Although, second quarter RevPAR declined by 93% year-over-year, it grew 133% from the depths of the crisis in April through the end of June, when 10 of our hotels exceeded or were close to achieving breakeven EBITDA. For the quarter, we delivered a RevPAR of over $14 driven by average occupancy of 8.8% and an average room rate of approximately $162. Total RevPAR of approximately $23 benefited from $14 million of mostly COVID related group cancellation and attrition revenues recognized in the second quarter, compared to $10 million of similar revenues recognized in the first quarter. In the second half of this year, we do not expect to recognize any further cancellation and attrition revenues related to the pandemic, as we continue to prioritize the rebooking of group business. Our second quarter results include a $45 million for health care benefits and special pay for the nearly 80% of hotel level employees that have been furloughed. We have accrued $35 million for that expense in the first quarter. In the second quarter, we accrued an additional $32 million for similar payments that will be made in the third quarter. The decrease in the third quarter primarily reflects the reopening of several suspended properties since April. As Jim mentioned, we work closely with our operators to reduce expenses and have realized a 72% decrease in second quarter hotel level operating cost. Our wage and benefit expands during the quarter was approximately 81% lower, excluding one-time wage and benefit related special cost. Our variable costs decrease 93% due to lower occupancy, while our fixed cost, including fixed wage and benefits expenses were approximately 50% lower. The decrease in fixed costs was driven by wage and benefits above property cost relief, utility expense and property specific sales and marketing reductions that partially offset other fixed costs, such as property tax and insurance. Although long-term costs associated with revised cleanliness protocols are yet to be fully determined. We believe the cost increase will be more than offset by productivity improvements. Our operators provided significant cost relief for above property shared service and allocated costs, which are normally considered fixed. These costs include sales offices, rent revenue management, advertising, the program services funded Marriott, centralized human resources, accounting, payroll, as well as IT. systems and support. These fixed costs saw unprecedented reductions, with some allocated costs reduced by as much as two thirds. Overall, we reduced operating expenses by approximately 72% year-over-year at our low occupancy hotels, and by approximately 75% at hotels were suspended operations. For the third quarter, we believe we will see continued cost containment for wages, benefits and variable expenses with cost reductions mirror reductions in overall volume. With regards to fixed costs, while the brands have not communicated above property service cost target as yet. We expect utility and property specific sales and marketing cost reductions to continue. Moreover, we would also expect the tax benefit we experienced in the second quarter to continue along the same trajectory. Moving to revenues. Portfolio wide average occupancy declined by approximately 73 percentage points year-over-year to 8.8%. And our average daily room rate was down 35% but still nearly $162. We have generally found that our operators are able to preserve and in some cases to even exceed rates versus the same time last year at properties that are in high demand on strong compression dates, such as national holidays. For example, our Florida hotels delivered remarkable ADR growth of approximately 12% year-over-year with ADR for the month of June approximately $97 higher. Thus far, this downturn has distinguished itself by the fact that average rates decline are not driving occupancy to the extent that they normally would. Customers are more sensitive to cleanliness and sanitation standards than to room rates. We are hopeful that rate degradation will be less severe than in prior downturns. And that branded hotels will benefit from having stringent cleanliness standards that should help gain customer trust and strong loyalty programs that should help drive demand. Shifting to market performance, hotels and our drive to leisure markets, which include Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Florida Gulf, Miami, and Jacksonville, we're running at 1.8% occupancy at the beginning of the quarter, and had progressed to 17.4% by the last week of June. Although the portfolio was in negative territory in the second quarter, markets with relatively better performance include Jacksonville, the Florida Gulf Coast, New York, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and Atlanta. The Florida markets, excluding Orlando, benefited from leisure demand. The Ritz Carlton Amelia Island outperformed STRs, upper tier RevPAR in Jacksonville by 600 basis points, while our Miami hotels outperform their STRs peers by 250 basis points of RevPAR. Our hotels in New York and LA benefited from medical related business as well as the closure of hotels within those markets. It is estimated that 50% of New York hotel inventory is in suspended operations and that 20% of closed hotels In Manhattan May not reopen. In Atlanta, our hotels in the market benefited from short term transient demand, as well as crew contract business. Our worst performing markets in the second quarter were Orlando, Boston, Mallya Wahoo, New Orleans, Seattle, San Diego and San Francisco, largely due to suspended operations at several of our hotels in those markets through much of the second quarter. Turning to CapEx. At the outset of the pandemic, we reduced our expected 2020 capital expenditures by approximately $100 million and through the second quarter, we have completed almost 60% of the total CapEx spend we have planned for the year. We received $8 million of operating profit guarantees at the Marriott transformational capital program, year-to-date, and expect to receive another $12 million over the second half of the year. As Jim mentioned, we successfully amended our revolving credit facility and term loans at the end of June. In the amendment, we accomplished three key objectives. First, we bought our portfolio time to make inroads into the recovery. We suspended the testing of financial covenants through the second quarter of 2021, and gained additional flexibility to accommodate our portfolios recovery for three quarters following the covenant relief period. Second, we preserved our ability to capitalize on opportunistic value enhancing investments during this period of extreme dislocation. Under the waiver, we have the ability to acquire $1.5 billion of assets using our existing liquidity while maintaining certain minimum liquidity requirements. We have the ability to issue equity without any requirement to repay debt. We have preserved the flexibility to use $750 million of net proceeds from asset sales for reinvestment purposes. And lastly, we preserve the flexibility to spend up to $500 million in ROI CapEx during the covenant waiver period. This provides us the ability to continue value enhancing repositioning and development projects within the portfolio without experiencing revenue disruption, as well as to continue the Marriott transformational capital program, which benefits from operating profit guarantees. On behalf of the Host management team, I would like to thank the members of our Bank Group for their continued support. Looking forward for the rest of the year. We are not providing 2020 guidance at this time, due to the continued lack of visibility on the depth and duration of this crisis, the timing of the reopening of individual states and localities and the expected operating restrictions for businesses as well as individual company travel restrictions. Once again, we would note that in prior recessions peak to trough the client and hotel level EBITDA have been roughly twice as large as the peak to trough declines in RevPAR, although this 2 :1 ratio should have deteriorated considerably in a near zero revenue environment. We believe that will continue to hold true for our portfolio due to the significant success in reducing fixed costs at the property level. Today, more than ever we believe that Host Hotels & Resorts is the premier lodging REIT in the industry. We have a high quality, well diversified portfolio, whose consistent performance is driven by strong in-house analytics and by working with the best operators in the business. We are the only investment grade balance sheet among lodging REITs, no significant debt maturities until 2023 and approximately $2.5 billion of available liquidity as of June 30th. We are well positioned to deal with this crisis and to continue to execute our strategic vision to create long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you. And with that, we will now be happy to take questions. To ensure, we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible. Please limit yourself to one question Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. AnthonyPowell: Hello, Good morning. Question on cash burn and capital allocation. How comfortable are you pursuing some of these opportunities like CapEx and acquisitions with cash burn at $50 million a month at the hotel level? Do you need to see cash burn come down more before you continue with your CapEx or would you consider maybe reducing CapEx, if cash burn want to stay to be levels for a long period of time? JimRisoleo: Anthony, the way we're thinking about the business today is really quite simple, liquidity is king and we are being very thoughtful about how we're allocating funds for CapEx in 2021. We -- it's something we talk about as a management team all the time. And, if we don't see the situation improve, you can expect to see us cut back. With respect to potential acquisitions, although, from a capital allocation perspective, we have the flexibility to invest in up to $1.5 billion of acquisitions with existing liquidity subject to maintaining $500 million of liquidity. I'll make a couple comments with respect to that. Number one; there aren't many opportunities in the marketplace today. We expect to see investment opportunities the latter part of this year and into next year as special servicers and other lenders resolve issues with their borrowers and in some instances properties are going to come to market. In other instances properties are going to be recapped. But it's the same thought process with respect to buying hotels at this point in time. We have to be comfortable that we're going to have the right amount of liquidity to ride through the crisis. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bellisario with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. MichaelBellisario: Good morning, everyone. Jim, you mentioned a big number of potential cost savings. Can you maybe give us some insight into the conversations that you're having with the brand and then how receptive they are to all those reductions that you listed? JimRisoleo: Yes, I want to point out that the number that we discussed was between $100 million and $150 million in permanent cost savings. And we were very careful, Mike, to use the word potential cost savings, because we have to reach agreement with our operators. And it's going to take some time to implement the cost savings on a permanent basis. So, I would tell you that they are very receptive. I think you're going to see and you've already seen it at Hilton, as an example, a meaningful reduction in their corporate headquarters staff. I think you're likely to see it unfortunately, at the other brands as well. And those functions, in many instances relate to the shared services that are above property. And we think that there is a good potential that we are going to be able to achieve these cost savings overtime. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line a Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. ShaunKelley: Hi, good morning, everybody. Jim, can you talked -- you talked about a sequential setback or downturn in your markets. Could you give a little bit more color there? Do you think we see in the industry data that the industry has leveled off, but we haven't seen really a step function lower in occupancy levels, even in some of the Sunbelt markets? For the hotel data, we probably see more abrupt turnarounds and restaurant and other data. So, you can just give a little, maybe a little bit more color about what you're seeing in some of those. I think you call out 30-markets where there has been some regression; just a little bit more color there would be helpful. JimRisoleo: Sure, absolutely. Shaun, as we think about it, maybe we were looking at the potential performance in an optimistic way. Because of the forward bookings we saw for the 4th of July weekend in particular, and I'll talk about one market that from our perspective was very meaningful and that is Miami Beach. We have the one hotel South Beach; we opened that property in early June. We saw good forward bookings. And going into the 4th of July weekend, we expected occupancy in the 70% plus range, it didn't materialize because they-- the mayor shut the beaches, shut the bars. As we all know, there was a surge in cases in Florida, and we ended-up running around 20% occupancy. So I think there's good news and bad news and what happened there, but the good news is that there is a lot of pent-up demand and whenever the virus is under control, we fully anticipate that people are going to get back on the road and continue to want to travel and to have a good experience in a luxury property. Obviously, the bad news is, there was a surge in cases and there's nothing we can do about that. I mean, we're all waiting as a nation to get the pandemic under control. And I think everyone's waiting for an effective vaccine or vaccines, or therapeutic to allow people to get back to business. So other markets continue to do well over the 4th of July. As an example, the Ritz -- two Ritz Carlton in Florida, the Ritz Naples and the Ritz Amelia Island, both ran occupancies in the 60s, and achieved ADRs of $600. Those rates were higher than same time last year. So again, we think if we hadn't seen the surge in cases in Florida then we would have done better than we did at those properties. So if I talk about seeing a deceleration, it's really based on our expectations. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your question. NeilMalkin: Hi, everyone. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to a group commentary you made a statement about 2021 group bookings being below this year. Just maybe one to get some more color and make sure I understand that and then with the group, maybe talk about the landscape for maybe the back half of next year, either in terms of people who have canceled in 2020 or incremental people, groups were maybe getting optimistic on what next year to look like? JimRisoleo: Sure. I think the message around group was that our total group revenue pays for 2021 is down high single digits for next year over the same period of time last year. And most of the cancellations that have occurred in 2021 have occurred in the first quarter. So the business is hanging in there certainly for the second half of the year. We all hope it's going to show up, we all hope by the end that we are going to have a vaccine and/or therapeutic and we'll continue to see groups want to get back into the hotels and have their meetings. Again, the positive is that our tentative business for 2021 is 30% over the same time last year. So that just goes to prove that there is a lot of pent-up demand. And we are fully confident that the group will recover. We've always said that the way this recovery was going to play out was drive to leisure transient first with business transient second and which group last and I think that's exactly how things are playing out. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. BillCrow: Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Two-part question, one topic, which is long-term or permanent impairment. And the first part is on business travel, you sounded confident that you thought business travel would recover to previous levels and decided some historical information. But we've never really been stressed like this. And we've never had the technology that's been proven in such a way. So I'm just curious about your thoughts. Why we wouldn't see a 10% or 15% or 20% permanent impairment in business travel in the future? And the second thing is; are we seeing a long-term or permanent impairment in values of hotels in certain markets where the government reaction to COVID, the labor reaction to reopening might change investors' views? Thanks. JimRisoleo: Sure. I'll take the second question first, Bill. I think it's too soon, really too soon to say what's going to happen to values over the long-term. I mean everybody in the public space is trading at a significant discount to replacement costs today. I think that we are probably less than 50% of replacement class. I mean we put some data on replacement costs in our investor presentation for everyone to see, and it's a very granular analysis that we provided. So some of the assets that are in the market today; at the height of the pandemic or trading a 20% discount to where they were valued at pre-COVID where they revalue February 1st. So I'm confident that that over time as cash flows recover, and as EBITDA recovers, that values for the most part across the country, will get back to pre-COVID levels and improve. I mean there are going to be some markets where-- I think it's going to be more challenging, quite frankly. And those are markets where you're still dealing with supply issues or you're dealing with high cost structures. And those assets might have a bit of a challenge maintaining their value going forward, but for the most part, I think we're going to get back to where we were pre-COVID and grow from there. And I'll just point out the fact that we have a very strong geographically diversified portfolio. So with no more than 11% of our EBITDA coming out of any one market. So we are very well positioned regardless of what happens going forward. And your question with respect to business transit, and whether or not business transit recovers to pre-COVID levels, I think that the technology has been helpful today. We're doing this on an earnings call and a couple different locations. And it's certainly not ideal and I know that we want -- we would all prefer to be in the same place, but we're being careful and thoughtful about safety and health as everyone else is, but I for one, and others are, I think I'm ready to get on the road. I'm done with zoom calls. I mean, we have had, on average 450 zoom video meetings a week at Host for the last six or seven weeks. So, I think it's good that to have zoom today. But we do think that the personal interaction is key notwithstanding that we have looked at what happens if the business transient doesn't come back to pre-COVID-19 levels? And I think a good proxy is we certainly listen to the commentary that the airlines gave, United has a point of view that it's coming back fully, Delta had a point of view that it might be 20% impaired. So, we looked at Delta's case of 20% down and said, what does that mean to us? What would we do with our portfolio, our existing portfolio today, and how could we remix the business and what would the financial impact be so? We looked at really re-mixing that business transient drop of 20% to leisure. And at the end of the day, it has a de minimis impact on EBITDA. The impact really is on the EBITDA margin because of the business transient slice of the businesses, our highest rated piece of business. So we're ready for whatever comes our way with respect to the recovery, and it's good to have the different levers to flex in our portfolio where we can take leisure. We can take more groups and really revenue manages the company on an asset by asset basis on almost a daily basis. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. RichHightower: Hey, good morning, everybody. So, Jim, just to just to follow up on the prior question, and maybe to combine it with another question on acquisitions. Look at some point. I mean, it's premature to maybe talk about this right now. But maybe sometime in the early to mid-part of next year, Host is going to have the flexibility to go on a shopping spree of sorts, certainly relative to several public and private peers. And so as you think about, what the portfolio looks like today, what you want to look like over the next 5 to 10 years, what's on your screen as far as that is concerned? And where's the puck going in terms of what Hosts should look like, again, and that sort of 5 to 10-year outlook as you think about what the portfolio needs to look like? JimRisoleo: Yes, Rich, I think that you're going to see the portfolio likely look like it looks today, with a continued focus on upgrading the overall quality of the assets that we own. It is a - let me step back for a minute and just talk about how we think about the business today. Number one, I've already said it, strong geographic diversification we think is critical. And investment grade balance sheet, we think is critical, two really distinguishing factors. And the best portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels in the industry, which we think we have today. So as we think about building the portfolio out over time, we like -- we talked about this. We like the model that we have with strong geographic diversification, with a business mixture differentiation in the hotel between a combination of leisure transit, business transit and group. So multiple demand generators and strong markets with high barriers to entry and that's how we would think about building the company over the next three to five years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question. LukasHartwich: Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jim, can you provide an update on the competitive dynamics for hotels versus short-term rentals? JimRisoleo: Sure, happy to. I would tell you that short-term rentals right now when I'm talking about Airbnb, in particular, have seen a surge and drive to leisure business. As you know, the same thing that we've talked about people wants to get out, and they have been driving to Airbnb in leisure and drive two leisure markets. Our point of view is as we start recovering, and markets start opening up, the urban markets in particular that are going to be more challenged. We think that the short-term rental business, some of the other platforms that are out there that were out there, I don't quite know what's going on with them, but Lyric and Sander and some of those, as well as Airbnb are going to face serious financial difficulties. And it's difficult enough for hotel owners that have well-heeled equity partners with them to work their way through this pandemic with literally no cash flow or minimal cash flow coming in. I think that issue is compounded by the individual Airbnb owners who have taken on a lot of debt, unfortunately and nowhere to turn, when it comes to servicing that debt. So I think you're going to see in the urban markets in particular, a recalibration of alternatives accommodations. LukasHartwich: Great. And then do you expect hotels to permanently close in large numbers in markets outside of New York? JimRisoleo: I don't know if I can say large numbers today. But I do think you're going to see a lot of hotels adapted for other uses in markets across the country. I think it's too soon to say, but there are markets that had excess supply coming into this pandemic. And those markets, I think, are going to be fairly challenged coming out. So I would expect that if people again, it's going to be dependent upon the wherewithal of the individual owners and what the dynamic and fundamental looks like on a market-by-market basis with respect to assets that may be taken back by lenders and what those lenders might do with those properties. And when they bring them to market whether the buyers going to continue to operate that particular facility as a hotel or look to an alternative use. So I do think it's a little too soon to say, but we would expect to see this happen across the country. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Please proceed with your question. SmedesRose: Hi, thanks. Jim, you mentioned in your opening remarks that Host is less likely to have to issue equity, I assume relative to other hotel REITs. Could you just talk about conditions where you think Host would need to issue equity relative -- particularly I guess relative to maintaining and investment grade rating. Potentially not passing the revised covenants, which I know has been pushed out. I mean it's just -- maybe just talked in general about the potential to have to do that or want to do that? JimRisoleo: Well, look, I mean, we think that we are in a unique position along with maybe one or two other REITs that are likely to have to issue equity just to delever the balance sheet. So, if we look at where our current leverage ratios are in credit covenants are today or even better go back and look at where we were at 2019. As we came into this year 1.6x leverage and interest coverage at north of 9x. We don't have to get back to 2019 levels to still be in a very strong position from a balance sheet perspective. So I don't see instances as I sit here today where we would have to issue equity to delever the balance sheet. We don't have to get back to 2019 levels to have a really strong balance sheet. We will be open minded around accretive investment opportunities and use our equity to pursue deals that makes sense for us. That will be accretive to our shareholders. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. ChrisWoronka: Hey, good morning, guys. Jim, I was hoping to circle back to that some of the commentary about potential chain or cost savings on the management side coming out of this, does that potentially extend to just less brand managed hotels, fewer brand managed hotels? Or is there is there possibility of negotiating some of the kind of the base rate fees or anything like that? JimRisoleo: Well, I don't know that it necessarily it -- I guess, Chris, what I would take from your question is that brand managed hotels aren't a good thing. That's not the way we view the world. We like the affiliation we have with Marriott and Hyatt; we think they do a fantastic job for us. We like their strength of their loyalty program and the strength of their group sales engines, in particular for some of our bigger hotels. That said I think that there are properties that are more fitting to be managed under a franchise operator model. Those would be the smaller hotels that they don't have a big group component. And I think the cost savings will come whether they're brand manager, whether they're franchise managed. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Risoleo, for any final comments. Jim Risoleo : I'd like to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. I know these are exceptionally difficult and challenging times for all of you. We really appreciate the opportunity to discuss our second quarter results with you. And we look forward to talking with you in a few months to discuss our third quarter results. Hopefully, we'll be able to get together in person in the not too distant future. So have a great day and a great weekend everyone. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Tejal Engman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tejal Engman : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Before we begin please note that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we're not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre, cash burn, and hotel-level results. You can find this information, together with the reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and in the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. Participating in today's call with me will be Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Risoleo : Thank you, Tejal, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. I hope all of you and your families remain safe and healthy. Over the last several months, we've transitioned from responding to the challenges posed by this pandemic, to rebuilding our business within its confines. To that end, I would like to highlight three key achievements since our last earnings call. First, we've achieved gradual but steady revenue growth, with our portfolio delivering sequentially higher RevPAR each month from a historic low of approximately $9 in April to a preliminary estimate of $37 in October. Although third quarter and October RevPAR remained more than 80% lower year-over-year. Third quarter revenues grew over 90% quarter-over-quarter, as our operators maximized their efforts to access all potential sources of wholesale demand, which continues to gradually increase. Second, we have reduced our third quarter hotel-level operating loss by approximately 40% from second quarter levels, including the benefit of a $23 million employee retention credit. Based on third quarter results, and excluding the employee retention credit benefit, we have reduced our monthly ongoing hotel-level operating loss by approximately 25% on average compared to the second quarter. Our sequential revenue growth has flowed through to our bottom line, as our operators have continued to do an outstanding job of minimizing expenses. Finally, we have further strengthened our robust liquidity by raising over $600 million of capital through opportunistic asset sales and debt refinancing and repayments. As a result, if fourth quarter operations are commensurate with the third quarter, we expect to end the year with approximately $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion of total available liquidity, including cash and FF&E reserves, with no debt maturities until 2023. As we enter the ninth month of the pandemic with daily COVID-19 case counts in the United States near all-time highs, we continue to believe that the demand recovery will remain gradual and choppy before the widespread availability of effective COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Therefore, our key near-term priorities remain : number one, working with our operators to continue to access all potential sources of demand; number two, minimizing expenses and reducing hotel cash burn; and number three, maximizing liquidity. We're equally focused on our longer-term objectives of structurally redefining our operating model, positioning our portfolio to gain RevPAR index share, and capitalizing on opportunistic investments to create long-term value for our stockholders. Let me walk you through our progress on these near and long-term objectives before handing the call over to Sourav to explain our third quarter operating performance. Beginning with demand. Although occupancy continues to be driven by leisure travelers, our hotels are also capturing short-term group, airline crew, and small but steady business transient volumes. We booked 127,000 group nights in the third quarter and delivered 88,000 more room nights than the second quarter. If you exclude New York, which accounted for the majority of group room nights in the second quarter due to medical and first responder business. Excluding New York, group rooms increased progressively throughout the quarter from 19,000 in July, to 40,000 in August, and 49,000 in September, primarily driven by corporate and Smurf events. Nine of our hotels booked sports-related group blocks for major league baseball and NFL teams to ESPN and other sports media, with a notable 800 rooms booked at Hyatt Regency San Francisco Burlingame for the PGA Championship in August. In addition, the Andaz Maui was personally bought out by a film production unit, which generated over 8,000 total room nights across September and October, two months when regular hotel operations were temporarily suspended. With robust safety protocols in place, including testing attendees upon arrival and employees on a daily basis, the Andaz generated a little over $1.7 million of incremental hotel-level EBITDA from this business. While our operators are striving to access all potential sources of hotel demand, they remain focused on working with meeting planners to restore confidence in traditional group meetings and events. In October, the Orlando World Center Marriott hosted this year's Connect 2020 Conference with more than 1,000 in-person attendees at our hotel, and 175 virtual attendees at home. Every detail was meticulously designed for safety as the Trade Show was spread across our 39,000 square foot Crystal ballroom with widely spaced booths and aisles, so the large groups of attendees were able to socially distance safely. Attendees complied with the hotel's map mandate, and plenty of maps were available on site. The property was able to complement the in-person events with virtual suppliers and a digital Trade Show that occurred simultaneously. We believe this hybrid meeting format will augment in-person demand and Marriott plans to host four global hybrid meeting events starting on November 9 at our Ritz-Carlton, Tysons Corner. While such events help publicize the fact that meetings can take place safely despite the complexities posed by the pandemic, restrictions on large group gatherings remain in place for most states and local jurisdictions, and nearly all conventions in city-wide had been cancelled through the first quarter of next year. We remain optimistic about group business on a medium to long-term basis due to encouraging group booking patterns. Rebookings as a percentage of cancellations continue to increase, with approximately 16% of group book business that was cancelled in 2020 now rebooked into future years, up from 11.6% in the second quarter. Moreover, group cancellations for 2021 remain concentrated through April, with groups that are scheduled for the second half of next year holding fairly steady. In the third quarter, we booked a net 81,000 group rooms for the second half of 2021 driven by San Francisco, San Jose, Orlando, New York, and the D.C. Metro region. We have 2.2 million definite rooms on the books for 2021 which are on a full-year basis is 31.5% lower than the same time last year, and on a second half basis is 7.7% lower. For context, we had approximately 3.2 million definite rooms on the books for full-year 2020 at the same time last year. Finally, our operators achieved a robust sequential increase in 2022 to 2024 group bookings. We booked nearly 100,000 more room nights for these out years in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter, with room night activity down only 13% to the same time last year. Importantly, for these out years, ADR is only 80 basis points lower than the same time last year, in contrast to the deep discounting that prevailed in the aftermath of 9/11 and the Great Financial Crisis. Moving on to business transient, demand remains minimal, but has improved from 11,000 room nights in July, to 13,000 in August, and 14,000 in September. A variety of industries are driving demand, including healthcare, consulting, technology, and financial and business services with no particular standouts. In general, both group and business transient demand is being driven by smaller organizations, rather than by the large corporate accounts. We continue to believe that business travel will recover in line with the broader economic recovery because of the ROI it generates for businesses. For every dollar spent on business travel, there is a $10 return in revenue and a $3 return in profit according to a 2013 analysis by U.S. Travel and Oxford Economics, which statistically modeled 14 industries over 18 years. Moreover, travel makes up only 1% of total U.S. corporate sales, and roughly 2% of operating expenses according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, making travel cuts less impactful to long-term profitability than is commonly perceived. Turning to contract revenues. Although TSA passenger volumes have slowed recently, they grew steadily during the third quarter as airlines continue to add more destinations. Our operators drove additional crew business to our hotels, resulting in 31,000 more contract rooms in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, a 71% sequential increase. And finally, leisure demand which relatively outperformed other types of demand through the summer has held up better than it historically does post-Labor Day. If lines between work, school and home remained blurred, our operators have created new offerings to appeal to consumers looking to escape but not via being at home. Hyatt introduced the Work From Hyatt package and Marriott launched the Work Anywhere with Marriott Bonvoy package. The packages facilitate working productively from a hotel for the day, a short stay, or an extended resort vacation, another example of our operators innovating to access all potential sources of demand. Moving on to cash burn, our hotel-level operating loss averaged $40 million a month in the third quarter, not including the Employee Retention Credit received under the CARES Act. That $10 million per month lower than the monthly cash burn scenario we outlined on our second quarter call, and approximately half the worst case scenario of $70 million to $80 million that we discussed in May. Our third quarter hotel-level cash expenses, less the Employee Retention Credit increased by 19% on a revenue increase of over 90% compared to the second quarter. Our operators have demonstrated their commitment to achieving hotel-level break-even as soon as possible by continuing to minimize costs and add back expenses only as necessary to service business levels as a current low occupancy rates. Assuming operational performance remains at third quarter levels, we would expect approximately $95 million to $105 million of total monthly cash outflows reflecting an average hotel level loss of approximately $40 million a month, as well as estimated CapEx, interest payments and general corporate overhead. Above property, corporate level monthly cash flows will be sequentially higher in the fourth quarter due to the timing of CapEx and interest payments. Sourav will provide greater details on our near-term cash burn trajectory in his prepared remarks. Moving to our final near-term objective of maximizing liquidity, we raised over $600 million of capital through opportunistic asset sales and debt refinancing since our last earnings call. We sold a 532 room Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa for $216 million, which exceeds our pre-COVID internal hold value for this asset. Moreover, we reduced our future CapEx commitments with the sale of this hotel, including $19 million of contractually required owner funded CapEx for the Marriott Transformational Capital Program and associated systems renovations. This was an opportunistic sale at pre-COVID pricing to a buyer who has strategic reasons to own the asset. We're pleased to have achieved a total CapEx adjusted valuation of 13.8 times 2019 EBITDA and a 6.8% cap rate based on 2019 NOI and to have further enhanced our liquidity and reduced our near-term capital spending requirements. Moreover, there will be no incremental redistribution requirements imposed by the tax gain generated by the sale to Newport Beach Marriott due to a combination of the first quarter common cash dividend was paid in April 2020, and the anticipated net operating tax loss to be incurred by Host, Inc. in 2020, 2020 also. We also completed the second closing on the sale of development land at The Phoenician bringing our total land sales at that asset to approximately $83 million this year. As we have discussed in the past, the sale of this land wasn't in our underwriting when we acquired the hotel in 2015. However, it was a part of our vision to unlock the tremendous value we saw on The Phoenician. We're pleased to have executed an incredibly complex rezoning entitlement process by solving multiple technical issues. In so doing, we have successfully monetized approximately 38 acres of non-income producing land and created value for our stockholders, while retaining an additional 21.5 acres of land to create further value through a combination of future sales or resort expansion. The buyer plans to build approximately 165 luxury condominium units, 85 single-family homes, and 30 villas on these parcels, and residents will have the option to purchase an amenity program with The Phoenician to access resort amenities and other services. We anticipate that this building demand will help drive food and beverage spa and golf revenues at the resort. To conclude on our near-term objectives, we further enhanced our liquidity position by issuing a total of $750 million of Series I Senior Notes in two substantially oversubscribed tranches resulting in an attractive coupon of 3.5% and a reoffer yield of 3.6% to 3.7%. In contraction our Series I issuance, we completed a tender offer of our 4.75% Series E senior notes due 2023, with an approximately 81% participation rate. As a result, we further augmented our cash position by $343 million, while extending our average debt maturity and maintaining our weighted average interest rate. Shifting to our longer-term objectives, we're working with our operators to redefine our operating model. Cross utilization of management functions, and a reduction in the fixed component of above property charges are two of the biggest contributors to our long-term cost savings target of $100 million to $150 million, which is based on 2019 revenues and represents approximately 3% to 4% of pro forma 2019 hotel-level expenses. To-date, our operators have made solid progress on both of these priorities, as they restructure their workforce and their above property shared services for sales, marketing, revenue management, and IT. We remain deeply committed to working with our operators to create long-term efficiencies that will allow us to generate greater profitability at lower levels of occupancy. A more profitable operating model would not only make for a faster recovery to 2019 EBITDA levels, but it will also improve the long-term value of our assets. Now turning to investments, let me begin with our capital investment plans for the portfolio. We believe our ability to continue to invest in our portfolio is a unique competitive advantage that will positively influence our relative performance and our growth trajectory throughout this lodging cycle. Although we have cut our 2020 maintenance CapEx budget by nearly 40%, we continue to invest in the Marriott Transformational Capital Program, as well as in other ROI projects. On a combined basis, these represent nearly 70% of our 2020 capital spend. Moreover, nearly 70% of our investment in the Marriott program will be complete by year-end 2020 and the entire program will be substantially completed by year-end 2022. As a result, we expect to gain RevPAR index share during the heart of the recovery. First, as we outperform the competition that is unable to invest this year and next : and, second, as we maintain our RevPAR index share gains when competitors disrupt their operations to renovate assets later in the cycle with 2022 likely being the first year that many to be able to meaningfully invest in their portfolios. The Coronado Island Marriott Resort & Spa for example, completed its Marriott transformational program renovations last year, and has improved its RevPAR index share by 9.8 points through August this year, compared with the same period in 2018. This is nearly three times the program's expectations of three to four points of index share gains. It has also outperformed the San Diego Downtown upper-upscale sub market by 16 points year-to-date, implying over $2 million in incremental room revenues. Moving on to acquisition opportunities and the transaction markets, a record 26% of CMBS Hotel loans were in special servicing in September 2020 compared with 1.9% in December 2019. And 70% of hotel loans are either in special servicing or on special servicing watchlist according to TREPP Research. Delinquency rates are expected to move higher as forbearance agreements start to roll-off. Additionally, some hotel owners who were hoping for a speedy recovery may not be able to sustain the cash outflows required to service their indebtedness and may decide to throw in the tile. So although we don't see high quality assets trading at this time, we continue to focus on opportunities where we can leverage our competitive advantages, such as deep owner, broker and operator relationships, and our ability to do large transactions. Our reputation for providing speed and certainty of closing and ability to offer tax advantaged structures to sellers are additional distinguishing factors. To conclude, our near-term objectives aim to lower our cash burn and maximize our liquidity while our longer-term objectives are designed to drive faster EBITDA recovery by structurally improving margins, gaining market share and acquiring assets. With $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion of expected total available liquidity at year-end, we believe, we have the ability to withstand prolonged business disruption and capitalize on opportunities for growth. We entered this crisis as one of the lodging REITs with the lowest leverage and greatest balance sheet capacity and believe these remain key attributes that are necessary to create meaningful long-term value in this new lodging cycle. With that, I will turn the call over to Sourav. Sourav Ghosh : Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. Building on Jim's comments, our third quarter top-line performance improved from the historic lows reported in the second quarter. RevPAR for the third quarter declined by 84.1% year-over-year compared with a 93% year-over-year decline in the second quarter. Year-over-year occupancy and ADR declines both improved on a sequential basis as we reopened 20 hotels in the third quarter and summer leisure travel bolstered overall hotel demand. Compared to STR Data for U.S. upper tier hotels in our top markets, our total portfolios ADR declines were 150 basis points better than the industry's. We outperformed on average occupancy in 11 of our top markets in the third quarter. However, our overall occupancy declines were 370 basis points greater than STR, primarily because our portfolio has more hotels in prime, downtown location than the industry does. Notably, our RevPAR was in line or better than the industry's in our resort oriented markets such as Jacksonville, Florida Gulf Coast, Miami, Phoenix, and Hawaii, as well as in Northern Virginia and New York, where we benefited from crew business and corporate room blocks. Our operators continue to be able to preserve and in some cases to even exceed rates versus the same time last year at properties that are high in demand, especially on strong compression dates such as national holidays. For example, our Florida Coastal Resorts delivered 22% year-over-year ADR growth in September. In general, rate doesn't appear to be driving occupancy to the extent it normally would in a downturn. Customers are more sensitive to cleanliness and sanitization standards than to room rates. We therefore remain hopeful that rate degradation will be less severe than in prior downturns and that branded hotels will benefit from having stringent cleanliness standards to help gain customer trust and strong loyalty programs to help drive demand. Shifting to non-rooms revenues. Third quarter food and beverage revenues on a pro forma basis declined by approximately 90% year-over-year due to a 96.5% reduction in banquet and AV revenue, and an 81% reduction in outlet revenue. At our open resort properties however, outlet revenues per occupied room were nearly 28% higher year-over-year, as leisure transient guests continued to dine on property during their stay. While other revenues included approximately $10 million of group and attrition and cancellation fees, we do not expect to recognize material cancellation and attrition revenues related to the pandemic going forward, as we continue to prioritize the rebooking of group business. So literally top-line numbers for October reflect a gradual but steady month-over-month improvement with October RevPAR at approximately $37 compared to September RevPAR of $34.64, driven by 20.7% occupancy and an approximately $179 ADR. Year-over-year RevPAR declined by approximately 82% and was almost the same as the year-over-year RevPAR decline reported in September. Looking at November, we expect top-line performance to be negatively impacted by the Election this week, but are hopeful that demand will gradually improve around the holidays. Although visibility remains limited, as the length of the booking window remains extremely short, our portfolio is generally well-positioned to capture short lead time demand, as we now have 75 of 79 hotels representing 94% of our total room count open. Speaking of reopenings, let me provide you with a brief update on Hawaii, which reopened to tourists on October 15. Travelers, who get a COVID-19 test, no more than 72 hours before departure, and show proof of a negative test upon arrival, are now exempt from the mandatory 14-day quarantine rule. Multiple airlines and airports are now offering rapid COVID-19 testing for Hawaii bound passengers thereby enabling a gradual return of tourists to the islands. For November, occupancy on the books is currently ranging between 20% to 35% across our four properties in Maui, and Oahu. Moreover November through January transient ADR pace for our hotels in Hawaii is up 3.8% year-over-year. Moving on to expenses, we worked with our operators to reduce third quarter hotel operating costs by over 65% year-over-year, excluding the $43 million of severance paid in the quarter. Although operators recorded a $23 million reduction in expenses related to the Employee Retention Credit received in the third quarter, this benefit was more than offset by $31 million of healthcare benefits paid to furloughed employees. As a reminder, we accrued $32 million for that expense in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we accrued an additional $26 million for similar payments that will be made in the fourth quarter. As previously disclosed, we expect to incur another $16 million to $26 million of severance expense in the fourth quarter, as our operators continue to reevaluate the workforce structure and implement changes that are expected to lead to a more efficient operating model in the long-term. We have worked closely with our operators to minimize expenses in the third quarter, despite reopening more hotels and achieving greater levels of occupancy. Fixed costs declined 46% year-over-year, excluding the employee retention credit, which is remarkable when you consider that a significant portion of the remaining fixed expenses consists of property, taxes and insurance. The quarter-over-quarter increase in the fixed costs was largely due to improving business levels and increased maintenance, utilities and contract service costs at the 20 hotels that were reopened during the third quarter. Variable costs were down 85.5% on a total revenue decline of 84% year-over-year. Since April, variable cost declines have broadly matched revenue declines, while ongoing wage and benefit costs have only slightly increased with improving volumes. Hotel management teams have implemented productivity saving protocols, restructured food and beverage platforms, and improved the cross utilization of associates. As an example, our operators have more than offset the cost increase associated with revised cleanliness protocols by driving productivity improvements in housekeeping. For the fourth quarter, we believe, we'll see continued cost containment for wages and benefits and variable expenses where cost reductions mirror reductions in overall volume. With regards to fixed costs, the brands have already communicated reductions in above property costs. Moreover, we would also expect the tax benefit we experienced at the corporate level in the third quarter to continue along the same trajectory. 15 hotels delivered a hotel-level operating profit for the entire third quarter with 18 hotels, recording a hotel-level operating profit in September, excluding the impact of the Employee Retention Credit. At the hotel EBITDA level, we're breaking even in the 35% to 45% occupancy range when ADR is down 15% to 30% in line with the estimates we provided in April. Assuming the inclusion of corporate level expenses for interest and corporate G&A of approximately $20 million per month on average, we would break-even at occupancy levels of approximately 45% and 60% at the same ADR decline levels of 15% to 30%. As you think of our past EBITDA break-even and subsequent growth, it is important to note that once we achieve hotel break-even for the consolidated portfolio, we would expect operating expenses to ramp commensurate with business volumes. Therefore, we would expect to remain at break-even within a range of occupancy before inflecting upward. Moving on to cash burn. As Jim noted, we expect fourth quarter above property corporate level monthly cash outflows to be higher than the third quarter, largely due to the timing of CapEx and interest payments. At the hotel-level, if operational performance remains at third quarter levels, we would expect an operating loss of approximately $40 million a month, excluding the benefit of the Employee Retention Credit. Based on this scenario, overall fourth quarter cash burn would be higher than the third quarter and in the range of approximately $95 million to $105 million a month. Of this amount, approximately $35 million a month is related to our CapEx program. I would like to note that we haven't provided a hotel-level cash burn breakdown for each month of the third quarter because the lumpiness of cash inflows and outflows may make monthly level disclosures misleading. For example, September includes the operating profit guarantee for the Marriott Transformational Capital Program, as well as the employee retention credit and would therefore not provide an accurate run rate for subsequent months. As Jim mentioned, we successfully refinanced debt in transactions that further strengthen our liquidity by $343 million, while extending our weighted average debt maturity, and maintaining our weighted average interest rate. This combined with approximately $265 million of net proceeds from the sale of the Newport Beach Marriott, and the land The Phoenician further maximizes our liquidity, which can be deployed in multiple ways to create value for our shareholders. To conclude, although limited visibility continues to make forecasting extremely challenging, we continue to focus on what we can influence, which includes minimizing our cash burn and maximize on the liquidity in the near-term, while working with our operators to redefine the hotel operating model, and investing in our assets, so they may outperform over the long-term. Similarly, the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity position allows us to endure an unprecedented crisis today, while enabling us to be opportunistic and grow shareholder value in the future. And with that, we'll now open it up to Q&A. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Rich Hightower : Hey, good morning, good afternoon, as the case may be you guys. Jim Risoleo : Good morning, Rich, good afternoon, as the case may be to you. Rich Hightower : Exactly. A lot of ground we could cover here, but I guess one question I want to talk about, maybe the impediments to stronger sort of group business bookings, as we think about the second half of next year and beyond. And if you had to sort of weight the different factors that might be holding that back, I mean, is it public health or is it sort of corporate profits, and companies thinking about their budgets, I mean between those two or maybe other factors, what do you think might be the biggest hindrance at this point? Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Yes, Rich, Sourav can jump in on the way here. I'll start. I think it's the whole backup routine, generally in bookings, both on the business transient side and the group side is related to a couple of things. Number one, government restrictions and that's being driven by public health concerns. So I think we -- as we've talked many times, we're not going to see business return to any sense of normalcy until we have an effective vaccine or vaccines or therapeutics combined with the vaccine. That said, we did talk about -- I think Sourav talked in his comments or maybe it was mine about what we're seeing happen next year with respect to group cancellations. It's clear to us with Connect 2020 being held at Orlando World Center, the meeting planners want to get groups back on the road and in hotels, it's very important for associations to meet and for corporate groups to come together as well. So our mix from 2017 into 2019 average mix, group business was roughly on a revenue basis, call it 35% Association, 47% corporate, and 18% other, which is really smurf. I would tell you that, we're seeing a strong desire on the part of association business to come back, and we're all praying that we have an effective vaccine. So we can talk about how group pace is looking into 2022 and beyond. And I'll let Sourav take that. Sourav Ghosh : Sure. So, Rich, I think more than pace, what we're focused on right now as we've talked about last quarter was really the tentative booking which was waiting in the sidelines because pace obviously as you would expect is down because of the uncertainty. But the tentative bookings have really pushed to the second half of next year. Right now, our tentative revenue on the books is up 32%. But clearly, people do want to meet, it's just a matter of like Jim said, when they're comfortable traveling again, and that's obviously a broader concern. The other stat obviously we did book, which is encouraging, we booked 300,000 rooms in the third quarter for 2022 to 2024, so for future years and compare that to same time last year, it's only down about 45,000 rooms. And from an ADR perspective, the other encouraging thing is ADRs for the rooms that we booked is less than a point down to same time last year, so again, encouraging trends when you look out into the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Powell : Hi, good afternoon. Question on transaction, do you still think that you'll see an increase in activity in the overall environment for transactions in let's say the first half of next year and a lot of your peers have talked about structures like JVs and club deals and other kind of alternative ways to start acquiring hotels? Would you consider those, as you start to ramp-up your activity? Jim Risoleo : Anthony, I think we would be very open to exploring club deals and JVs off-balance-sheet format if it made sense to us. We're in a unique position where under our existing credit facility waiver agreement, we can acquire up to $1.5 billion of hotels that have existing liquidity subject to maintaining $500 million of liquidity in the company. And as we discussed, we expect assuming that the fourth quarter trends mirror the third quarter trends and we're very pleased with how October has played out that will have $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion of available liquidity at the end of this year, taking us into next year. So I think that not only our club deals available. As you know, we were very successful in putting together a club deal in Europe with GIC and APG, the Euro JV where we acquired over 20 hotels as general partner and we would be very happy to do something like that again in the U.S. if the opportunity presented itself. One of the other distinguishing factors that we have available to us on the acquisition side is the ability to issue operating partnership units, that is truly distinguishing given the liquidity in our stock. And just the share of, I think we're trading on average now close to 14 million shares of stock a day. And it gives an owner the opportunity to provide some liquidity, but to provide the upside as well, going forward. So provide the upside in Host as our EBITDA continues to improve and our stock price continues to improve as well. So, to answer your question about what do we expect to see, every indication is and we're talking to a lot of people about this. Every indication is that come the first half of next year, as forbearance periods weigh, start to expire. And as owners who are in the unfortunate position where they don't have the liquidity, or they choose to not fund debt service payments and other expenses, we expect to see a significant number of properties come to market. So the answer is yes to both your questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Dori Kesten : Hi, thanks, guys. You detailed in your release your reasoning for drawing down your revolver in the quarter. And when would you expect to be out from under that bond covenant minimum? And are there any other similar constraints that we should be keeping an eye on at this point? Jim Risoleo : Dori, it's awfully difficult to speculate when we would be out from underneath debt incurrence test. I think a lot of it is going to depend on how quickly we have a vaccine and how quickly it's rolled out to the public. And when businesses are comfortable sending people on the road, which as I -- you know, in answering Rich's question, I mean we have a lot of government restrictions out there. We're going to have to see the restrictions loosen, and I don't think that various government authorities are going to be prepared to do that until we have a vaccine. So the short answer is, we don't know, whenever the debt incurrence test will -- we will come back in compliance with the debt incurrence test. We don't have any other issues that you should be aware of today. We're in very good shape. We've done a -- I think, a very good job, an amendable job of raising another $600 million of cash this quarter and a very opportunistic and low cost way. So, we're today focused on reducing expenses, putting the portfolio in a position where we can outperform when the markets do open up and maximizing our liquidity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks. This is Stefan [ph] for Smedes. You spoke a little bit in the opening remarks of the break-even rate. So in that scenario, would you be more focused on driving occupancy before stepping rate just given the cost savings you're targeting or and then just to that how are you also thinking about margin kind of with shift in the business mix? Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Yes, I'll take the first part and then Sourav can jump in. So clearly, our margins will perform better, if we can drive rate at the expense of occupancy, it will just provide for better flow through to the bottom line. And we won't have the incremental cost associated with housekeeping and other expenses associated with having more rooms occupied. That's not to say that we're not going to take every, every room night that we can. But as we think about margin performance, the better margin performance is driven by rate going forward. And, we're very, very pleased with the fact that we're not seeing the rate degradation that we've seen in other recovery periods. When we look at what happened after 9/11 and what happened after the Great Recession. So, fingers crossed that that continues to be the trend going forward. And I'll let Sourav talk a little bit about how we think about break-even occupancy and ADR. Sourav Ghosh : So from a mix perspective, that was your second part of the question and how we're managing margins. Despite changes in mix right now the situation we're in is most of our revenues is coming in, is really rooms only revenue. So reality is whether we look at leisure business or group any business coming in because it's primarily rooms only. Our focus is really on expenses that can really reduce and drive higher margins at the rooms' level. Food and beverage outlets in a lot of cases are running in limited operations and as we have said before, before we bring back on any food and beverage offerings, we're ensuring it's actually profitable and we drive profit to the bottom line. From a margin perspective, it's obviously is a lower margin business, but at the end of the day, we're looking at EBITDA dollars, not necessarily EBITDA margin. So once revenues do recover and -- and we're sort of in a position where we're getting back to pre-COVID levels of revenue, then the focus will be on margin expansion. And as we have messaged before, we're really focused on driving the $100 million to $150 million of incremental EBITDA compared to 2019 levels. And we have made quite a bit of progress on that. And a lot of it is tied to the food and beverage department, where there's been significant level of management of reduction. The severance that we had in the third quarter is directly tied to reduction of almost 30% of management headcount, which we believe is going to be a permanent reduction going forward. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks. And then just one more on transaction, can you just talk about competitive positioning versus private equity or other additional kind of capital, just given basically higher leverage. And then as you think about potential acquisitions or dispositions, whether there's market you'd like to add exposure to or exit? Jim Risoleo : Yes, I'll take the second part of the question, first. We're generally market agnostic, we do believe that maintaining broad geographic diversification is a way to run the business. That said, some markets are going to open up better and sooner than other markets. So we will take all that into consideration in our underwriting criteria as we evaluate opportunities going forward. With respect to competitive positioning, I just make an observation that today, the debt markets are generally closed for the level of debt that private equity firms typically need to drive their returns there -- there levered returns in the high teens to low 20s or call it, mid-teens to low 20s. So we're not seeing any really competition out there today. In fairness, there's just not a lot of products on the market right now. I mean, we're evaluating every deal that we would deem to be attractive. We haven't come across anything that that meets our underwriting criteria, given the facts and circumstances of where we're in the cycle and in the recovery phase. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. David Katz : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for all the detail and thanks for taking my questions. And Jim, I will admit, I've gone back and forth just a little bit. But I wanted to just get your updated thoughts about discussions with the largest brands, and the degree to which they can and are reevaluating the value that they deliver and what you frankly, what you pay for it, and what we can recently expect to sort of come out of all this, what your view of success really is? Jim Risoleo : Sure. Well, I think what the brands deliver to us is a testament to the way we have been able to grow the business in a very challenged environment. And, we love the fact that the brands are listening today, and I'll let Sourav jump in on this in a few minutes. They heard us loud and clear, they heard us with respect to brand standards. As you know, that there are roughly 300 brand standards at the major brands, and that would be Marriott, Hyatt, and Hilton, and we have worked closely with them to reevaluate each of those standards going forward. And it relates to the most basic David, food and beverage offerings, when the restaurants have to be open, how long do they have to be open, what you have to offer to your customers. The fact that we're talking about and seeing and I'm going to let Sourav give a little more detail on this, and seeing a true reduction in expenses of between $100 million to $150 million based on 2019 pro forma performance, I think is a strong testament to the fact that the brands get it today. They're one with us when it comes to understanding the challenges that owners face. And we interface with both brands, our two major operators, Marriott and Hyatt on a weekly basis. So Sourav you want to talk a little bit about how -- what sort of progress we're making on $100 million to $150 million? Sourav Ghosh : Sure, hey David. So I would start by saying that Marriott has actually restructured and reduced above property shared services, for sales and marketing, revenue management and IT and are right now working towards reductions of their program Shared Services fees for the following year. For this year, Hyatt has also reduced the fixed component of their above property IT costs by 15% and chain marketing fees by as much as 50%. And moving forward, they're really committed to making their fees more variable, so that the cost is actually tied to exactly what you were talking about the value proposition to the owner. In terms of the $100 million to $150 million the way we think about it is, we would expect that long-term, there'll be permanent reduction of the fixed portion of the above property cost by as much as 10% to 20%. So putting that into the context of dollars that would be somewhere between $20 million to $25 million of that $100 million to $150 million. Obviously, I would remind everybody that's tied to 2019 revenues. So assuming we get back to 2019 revenues, we'd be on the above property fees $20 million to $25 million of savings with a 10% to 20% reduction of the fixed piece of the above property costs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street. Please proceed with your question. Lukas Hartwich : Hey, good morning, Jim. So when looking at forward group bookings, I'm just curious, what the curve looks like? Is it a gradual rate of improvement in activity over time? Or is there kind of a point on the calendar where things really start to hockey stick? Sourav Ghosh : Hey Lukas, right now. Sorry go ahead. Jim Risoleo : Go ahead. Sourav Ghosh : I think right now, what's happening is even for future bookings, the encouraging thing like I was saying there is booking activity for future years; however their activity is definitely lower than what you would have expected, because there are folks waiting on the sidelines. That's why you have a lot of tentative bookings, but not necessarily definite on the books, looking at the future years. However, there isn't really cancellations that are taking place. And that's encouraging. It's just that the booking activity is somewhat sort of, I would say is slower than you would typically expect, because of all the uncertainty exists in the short-term. Lukas Hartwich : Right. In terms of that tentative demand that's kind of waiting on the sidelines, is there a sense of knowing their mind? Are they thinking, well, third quarter next year is really fumble strongly consider booking some business. Is there some point in mind that these meeting planners where they're thinking -- where they're going to get serious about booking? Or is it kind of more of a gradual increase in just latency? Jim Risoleo : I think your third quarter timeframe is the right timeframe, Lukas. I mean, everyone feels that the first half of next year is going to be -- continue to be challenging. And that when we do get a vaccine, it's going to take some time to get it rolled out among the population. So people are looking at the second half of next year and beyond. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Chris Woronka : Hey, good afternoon, guys. I was hoping to drill down maybe a little bit on the actual property costs. You guys cover a lot of ground on shared services and above property, but how much of an opportunity do you see on some of these labor initiatives like no stay over housekeeping and changing up some of the food and beverage operations, how much of that realistically do you think you can make permanent, are the brands willing to accept that or the customers willing to accept it? Jim Risoleo : I think on the housekeeping side Chris, it is really going to be opt-in to housekeeping services as opposed to opt-out going forward. And it's going to vary on, frankly, the type of property we have and the personal profile of the customer. There are going to be some customers, if they're staying at one of our luxury hotels, who are going to continue to demand housekeeping on a daily basis. And depending on different types of properties, customers may not very well, they may not want people in their rooms, to clean the rooms as long as they can get clean linens and towels and bathroom amenities that they need delivered to the front door. So, with respect to food and beverage, I think that we have seen a meaningful change on the F&B side going forward. I don't think you're going to see as one example, breakfast, buffets or likely hot breakfast buffets are likely to be a thing of the past. Hot offerings in the M Clubs and the highest concierge lounges are likely to be a thing of the past. So those are going to be permanent cost savings. I don't know Sourav; you have anything else you want to add, with respect to how we're thinking about the operating model? Sourav Ghosh : Yes, I think the only thing I would add is what this pandemic sort of has allowed us to do is really look at zero-based budgeting and ground-up budgeting, and tie that with what the value proposition is to the customer and not only to the customer, but also from a brand perspective what the value proposition is to the owner. So at the property level, it's really understanding what the customer wants, and what the customer needs, and how we would shift the operating model based on that. So the minimum sort of base labor standards are being completely redefined. So going forward, and it's complete, it's going to be tied to what Jim talked about earlier is how brand standards get reevaluated based on customer preferences. So this is an opportunity where we\u2019re able to actually do a zero-based budgeting roundup budgets to figure out what is the right labor model. And that's where we're pretty confident; we think we're going to get savings not only from a housekeeping perspective, but from food and beverage, particularly in the kitchen department, as well. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Jim Risoleo for closing remarks. Jim Risoleo : I'd like to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. As always, we appreciate the opportunity to discuss our results with you. I look forward to talking to you, we all look forward to talking to you next week or the week after at NAREIT and over the coming weeks and months. So please, everyone stay healthy and stay positive. We'll all get through this and I wish you all good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Tejal Engman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tejal Engman : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin please note that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we\u2019re not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today\u2019s call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre, cash burn and hotel-level results. You can find this information, together with the reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in yesterday\u2019s earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC and in the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. Participating in today\u2019s call with me will be Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Risoleo : Thank you, Tejal, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. I\u2019d like to start by expressing my heartfelt condolences to Ernie\u2019s family and to our friends at Marriott. I have known Ernie for 25 years and found him to be one of the most authentic, engaging and caring leaders in the lodging space. A visionary leader, a loving husband and father, and a respected colleague and friend, Ernie will be deeply missed and is leaving a lasting legacy within our industry and all the lives he has touched. Host has emerged from the most challenging year in lodging history as a stronger company with robots long-term growth prospects. Our hotels have streamlined their operating models and minimize operating expense growth from second quarter lows, while accelerating RevPAR from $9 in April to approximately $42 in January. As a result, we have cut our hotel level operating loss by more than half from $163 million in the second quarter to $75 million in the fourth. We have also achieved breakeven or positive hotel level operating profit at 20 hotels representing 24% of our rooms in the fourth quarter, a sharp increase from 14 hotels and 13% of our rooms in the third quarter. Additionally, we\u2019ve invested in our long-term growth and enhance our ability to gain and retain market share by continuing to upgrade several significant hotels and delivering the new AC Hotel Scottsdale North. Moreover, we\u2019ve entered 2021 with $2.5 dollars of total available liquidity. Our investment grade balance sheet has been further strengthened by opportunistic asset and land sales at pre-COVID-19 valuations and debt refinancing that has pushed our earliest maturity to late 2023. Last week, we announced a best-in-class second amendment to our credit agreement, which provides us greater flexibility to acquire hotels early in this new lodging cycle. With the highest quality portfolio in the company\u2019s history and a balance sheet that allows us to capitalize on external growth opportunities, we are very well-positioned to elevate our EBITDA growth profile through the vaccine driven recovery. My comments today will focus on topline trends, ROI projects and our latest views on transaction markets and acquisition opportunities. Sourav will detail our hotels operating expense control and the improvement in and outlook for cash burn and hotel EBITDA. He will also walk through the additional flexibility and optionality created by the second amendments to our credit agreement. Starting with group booking trends, we saw a marked increase in group booking activity for our Marriott managed hotels in January. Our hotels booked approximately 101,000 group room nights for 2021, a 32% increase over January of 2019, with January typically being a slow month for group booking activity. In addition, our hotels had an impressive lead to booking conversion rate of 22%, compared to approximately 16% interest January 2019. While there are several types of groups being booked, we are pleased to see bookings for incentive meetings, which have returned after a hiatus in 2020. We also saw improved future group booking activity in January, with approximately 73,000 future group room nights booked for beyond 2021, representing a 42% increase to January of 2019. Through this January, we had approximately 1.6 million definite room nights on the books for full year 2021. Approximately 1 million of these occur in the second half of the year and are fairly evenly split between the third and fourth quarters, where bookings are largely continuing to hold. Should the group\u2019s materialize, our second half 2021 group business will have recovered to almost 50% of second half 2019 levels, based on definite group room nights on the books. While group pace is less meaningful today, as most meeting planners remain on the sidelines. We are encouraged by our total group revenue pace for the latter half of 2021. Pace in the second half of 2021 is down only about 25% compared to the same time last year, versus the first half being 84% lower than last year. This could improve with additional in the year, for the year group booking activity, assuming state and local restrictions are relaxed and attendees become more comfortable with travel. Staying with group, we believe that the location and quality of our hotels, as well as our longstanding sales relationships with key travel managers favorably positions them to gain market share when group demand returns to urban markets. For example, the demand from government agency groups surge around inauguration, our D.C. hotels rent occupancies up 81% and 78% on the day prior and the day of inauguration, respectively, and we temporarily reopened the Hyatt Regency Capitol Hill to capitalize on this demand. For those days, our hotels occupancies were 13 percentage points and 11 percentage points higher than other luxury and upper upscale hotels in the D.C. metro region. Moreover, we achieved an ADR that on average was $26 higher each day for the three days of January 19th, 20th and 21st. Our hotels significantly outperformed other luxury and upper upscale hotels due to their coveted downtown locations, ability to accommodate large groups and their 30-year relationships with key government agencies. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately 118,000 definite room nights on the books for the fourth quarter, which would have represented a 7% sequential decline. However, our hotels will -- were able to drive 38,000 in the quarter for the quarter bookings for a total of 156,000 group room nights in the fourth quarter, representing a 23% sequential increase over the third quarter. Additionally, first fourth quarter group bookings delivered a 12.3% higher average rate than third quarter 2020, helped by this short-term group demand that was driven by small to mid-sized corporate accounts and smurf groups. Rebookings as a percentage of cancellations continue to increase, with approximately 24% of cancellations at our Marriott managed properties now rebooked and a funnel of tentative bookings that would take the total rebook to almost 37%. In the fourth quarter and full year 2020, we collected approximately $11.5 million and $52 million of group attrition and cancellation fees, respectively, and expect to collect an additional $12 million to $14 million in full year 2021. Moving on to leisure trends, leisure demand remains concentrated in Sunbelt markets and key leisure destinations such as Hawaii, as most city and metro destinations remain in various stages of restrictions. As with group over the inauguration in D.C., we find that the location and quality of our resorts, has enabled them to significantly gain market share. In the fourth quarter, our 16 resorts gained 17.8% RevPAR index share relative to their comp sets. This was driven by 8.1% better occupancy and 9% better rate compared to their RevPAR index scores in the fourth quarter of 2019. Moreover, we have gained 30% RevPAR index share in Phoenix, nearly 26% in the Florida Gulf Coast, 14.4% in Miami and nearly 12% in Maui/Oahu, as our hotels outperform their peers in capturing leisure demand. Our most recent acquisition, the 1 Hotel South Beach, continues to be an outstanding performer despite the pandemic. The hotel achieved 90% occupancy at a nearly $2,000 rate on New Year\u2019s Eve and has just finished Presidents Day weekend, with occupancy averaging nearly 90% from Friday through Sunday, with a blended ADR of approximately $1,430, which represents a nearly 4% year-over-year increase. Encouragingly, leisure RevPAR performance to con -- continues to improve over holiday weekends. For example, at our Marriott managed hotels, RevPAR improved by 60% three weeks out from Presidents Day, compared to where those hotels were three weeks away from Columbus Day. In addition, we have observed the lengthening of the booking window in the Florida Gulf Coast, Miami and in Hawaii, where travelers are getting more comfortable with the testing requirements and process. With upcoming leisure holidays over spring break and Easter, we expect leisure occupancy to continue to improve driven by our Sunbelt markets in Hawaii. For the second half of the year, transient revenues at our three Maui hotels are pacing 11% higher compared to 2018, while total revenues are pacing almost 20% higher. In the fourth quarter, we grew leisure roommates by 62,000 or by 13.6% over the third quarter. Our Sunbelt markets ran 31.6% occupancy in the first week of the quarter and progress to 33.5% throughout the quarter, which growth is driven by Miami, the Florida Gulf Coast, Phoenix and San Antonio. Moreover, our loyalty redemption in the fourth quarter was 25% higher than the third quarter and represented the highest rewards demand since the start of the pandemic. Resort properties accounted for 65% of the growth in loyalty redemption room nights driven by Phoenix, the Florida Gulf Coast, Hawaii and Orlando. Moving on to business transient, demand remains low but as improved by 13% sequentially in the fourth quarter, which was the strongest quarter since that pandemic impacted travels. Cities that drove most of the increase over the third quarter were San Antonio, Houston and Philadelphia. As with group, business trends -- business transient demand continues to be driven by smaller organizations rather than by large corporate accounts, whose decisions remain on the sidelines is partly due to liability risks that we expect will fade as vaccine deployment accelerates. Shifting to portfolio reinvestment, let me begin by saying that our ability to continue to invest in our portfolio is a competitive advantage that we expect will favorably position Host to gain market share and deliver superior revenue and EBITDA growth through this lodging recovery. 3 points to 5 points of weighted index growth at our renovated hotels in 2019 would have translated into roughly $38 million to $63 million of incremental revenues and $21 million to $34 million of incremental EBITDA on a stabilized annualized basis. In addition to this, we expect our ROI projects to materially enhance the underlying value of our real estate. Last year, we completed extensive resort renovations and repositioning at the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and The Don Cesar in St. Pete Beach. Within the Marriott Transformational Capital Program, we plan on completing The Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island in March this year, following several notable completions such as the JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead, among others in 2020 and the San Francisco Marriott Marquis, Santa Clara Marriott, New York Marriott Downtown and Coronado Island Marriott Resort & Spa in 2019. We continue to invest in the Marriott Transformational Capital Program, as well as another ROI projects, which on a combined basis represent nearly 71% of our 2021 capital spend. Moreover, nearly 85% of our investment in the Marriott program is expected to be complete by year end 2021 and the entire program should be substantially completed by year end 2022. Having completed seven of the Marriott program renovations through year end 2020, we expect to complete an additional four hotels in 2021, thereby transforming 11 of the 16 hotels that make up the program. We expect to benefit from $16 million of operating profit guarantees for Marriott in 2021, without experiencing commencement -- commensurate revenue disruption given the current low RevPAR environment. In addition, we expect to deliver 19 new two battery -- two bedroom luxury villas at the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort in April this year. The 11 existing villas achieved a RevPAR of approximately $1,7 00 in 2019 and while they exhibit strong demand throughout the year in normal years, recent demand for villas has more than tripled from pre-pandemic levels. ADRs for these villas ran at almost $3,700 a night in December and at $2,400 a night in January. We already have 300 room nights on the books for the new villas, with a transient rate of $1,990 a night and the hotel has only just begun marketing them. Although, the villa expansion wasn\u2019t part of our original underwriting when we acquired the hotel in 2018, we are currently exceeding our project underwriting assumptions for 2021 on both rate and occupancy. We are excited to announce the repositioning and expansion at one of our top performing hotels, The Ritz Carlton Naples, where we see an opportunity to create meaningful value, while also transforming the resort to meet today\u2019s luxury standards. A new tower and reconfiguration within the existing hotel will increase the suite count at The Ritz from less than 8% of total inventory to almost 20% or 92 keys, while adding 24 keys overall. In 2019, the resorts 35 suites achieved RevPAR of approximately $800, almost double the overall RevPAR of the resort and are highly sought after by the hotel\u2019s loyal customer base. Additionally, an expanded club lounge will eliminate the size constraints on upsells, which generated an annualized ADR premium in excess of $220 in 2019. Business interruption estimates continued to be low due to the impact of COVID-19 on our occupancy, which also makes this an opportune time to renovate the guest rooms and to make ROI generating upgrades to the resource pools, pool bar and restaurant. The project will commence in May 2021 and is expected to be complete in December 2022. As stabilization in 2023, we expect this project to generate nearly $10.5 million of incremental annualized EBITDA, which represents a 12% cash on cash return on incremental investment based on our underwriting. Finally, on acquisitions, in the first weeks of 2021, we have seen a marked increase in the number of attracted hotels coming to market. From looking at just a handful of deals in the fourth quarter of 2020, we now have a solid pipeline of interesting and actionable opportunities to evaluate. In many instances, the hotels we are looking at are owned by private owners who have been contemplating liquidity events for some time. While we expect to face strong competition for acquisitions, we are very well-positioned due to our deep relationships and our ability to move quickly from large equity investments with cash and provide tax advantaged alternatives to sellers. This management team has a strong capital allocation track record, having acquired $1.6 billion of assets and sold $3.3 billion of assets at favorable multiples in 2018 and 2019. The biggest shift in our acquisition strategy is our consideration of markets beyond the top 25. IBM Watson recently developed predictive analytics model minds over 1 million discrete structured variables and leverages natural language processing insights from over 3 million unstructured data sources to forecast RevPAR growth by market. We use this proprietary topline predictive model in our research based expectations for hotel operating expense growth by market to narrow down the markets that are likely to outperform the revenue and EBITDA growth profile of our existing footprint. While we believe this is an opportune time to deploy capital, as we are at the beginning of the lodging cycle and appear to be heading into a period of strong economic recovery, let me emphasize that we are not looking to acquire for acquisition sake. We are optimistic about finding opportunities that will truly elevate the EBITDA growth profile of our existing portfolio. To conclude, we are very encouraged that vaccine deployment in the United States has gained momentum, with over 55 million doses administered already and 1.7 million new doses being administered each day according to CDC data. As The Washington Post recently reported, the United States has purchased enough supplies to vaccinate all American adults, making the vaccine driven recovery more certain today than it has been since the pandemic began. McKinsey estimates that the U.S. may achieve herd immunity by the third quarter or fourth quarter and that a transition to normalcy if possible as early as the second quarter of 2021, aided by the spring weather and the vaccination of the highest risk population. Should this scenario materialize, we expect to be able to achieve positive hotel EBITDA at some point in the second half of the year and to continue to benefit from a rebound in travel as the pandemic resist. With that, I will turn the call over to Sourav. Sourav Ghosh : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Following the revenue related green shoots Jim details on group bookings and transient demand, I would like to give you a better sense of how we expect property level expenses to trend relative to revenues this year. Since the start of the pandemic, we have worked closely with our property managers to aggressively limit costs and evolve the operating model to adjust for the business environment. In the fourth quarter, excluding service, property level expenses were approximately 65% lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Including wages and benefits costs, variable expenses were roughly 82% lower year-over-year, broadly in line with RevPAR declines of 79.7%, while fixed expenses were approximately 47% lower. Variable expense reductions have consistently been in line with overall revenue declines through the downturn. Fixed expenses that are somewhat associated with business volume, such as maintenance, marketing and utility costs, saw a dramatic reduction in the second quarter and have slowly increased as business improved through the back half of the year. Brand programs to services, such as above property sales offices and IT has seen material reduction, as our operators have restructured their shared services organization. Finally, costs below the gross operating profit line which include taxes and insurance and are traditionally completely fixed saw modest reductions in the fourth quarter due to one-time credit, such as operating profit guarantees associated with the Marriott Transformational Capital Program. As a result of our property and brand management teams efforts to ensure that cost growth remains in line with slowly improving revenue, our quarterly expense reduction ratio, which measures the year-over-year decline in property level expenses divided by the year-over-year decline in total revenues was fairly stable at approximately 0.8 in the second, third and fourth quarters. This means that for every 1% decline in year-over-year total revenue, our hotels reduced year-over-year expenses by 0.8%. The question now is what does this ratio look like as revenues return in 2021. We have always expected to reach a plateau where the ratio deteriorates as services and standards return to the middle of the revenue recovery. Although, we still expect this to be the case, because 2021 is the transition year, our hotels are striving to achieve an expense reduction ratio of between 0.65 and 0.7 throughout the year, as measured by property level expense and total revenue declines relative to 2019. Moving on to hotel level operating losses, we improved our quarter-over-quarter results by 23%, mainly by increasing revenues, while keeping hotel expenses relatively stable. Most of the increase in expenses was associated with the five hotels that we reopened in the fourth quarter, as well as greater business volumes overall. Our hotel level operating loss averaged $25 million per month in the fourth quarter, down from approximately $32 million in the third quarter, including the $15 million and $23 million of employee retention credit our managers received in 2020 under the CARES Act and passed on to us in the fourth and third quarters, respectively. Excluding these one-time credits, our monthly hotel level operating losses in the fourth quarter averaged approximately $30 million and were better than the $40 million of hotel level operating losses we outline on our third quarter call, primarily due to revenues being approximately 35% higher on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter. We expect first quarter hotel operations to be broadly commensurate with the fourth quarter of 2020, as further improvement in fundamentals may be offset by leisure demand being seasonally weaker in the first quarter than the fourth quarter, which benefited from strong ADRs and occupancies in the days leading up to and including New Year\u2019s Eve. We therefore expect an average hotel level operating loss of approximately $30 million to $35 million a month, not including any one-time credit our hotels may receive in the first quarter. Adjusting for interest payments and corporate G&A, we expect monthly cash flow from operations to range between approximately $49 million to $54 million. With regard to our outlook, it remains challenging to forecast precisely when we will achieve hotel level EBITDA breakeven and profitability in the second half of 2021, as much depends on the success of vaccine administration and the continued easing of state and local restrictions. Following the first quarter, we expect a gradual sequential improvement in RevPAR. We anticipate this to be occupancy driven in the second and third quarters, when ADR may sequentially decline as suspended luxury and upper upscale hotels reopen. Our research indicates that operations at approximately 13.5% of luxury and upper upscale hotels in our top 25 markets are currently suspended and likely to reopen at low occupancies during the second and third quarters of this year. Turning to the 20 hotels that have achieved breakeven or positive hotel EBITDA in the fourth quarter, breakeven generally has been achieved in the 35% to 45% occupancy range, with ADR down in the approximately 15% to 30% range compared to 2019, which is in line with the estimates we first provided in April. Assuming the inclusion of corporate level expenses for interest and corporate G&A, we would breakeven at occupancy levels of approximately 45% and 60% at the same ADR decline levels of 15% to 30%. Moving on to the balance sheet, the second amendment to our credit agreement has increased our acquisition capacity to $2 billion using existing liquidity with a minimum liquidity requirement of $600 million. The capacity may include $500 million of proceeds from asset sales that would otherwise have been required to repay debt, as long as we use the proceeds to acquire assets that are unencumbered by debt. In addition, we have retained our ability to redeploy $750 million of assets sale proceeds into acquisition via the 1031 exchange process, while extending our leverage covenant relief period to the second quarter of 2022 and our leverage covenant easing period for the third quarter of \u201823. In doing so, we have created cushion for our internal recovery, as well as capacity to accommodate external growth opportunities. There are a couple of additional items I would like to bring to your attention. First, we recorded an income tax benefit of $220 million in 2020, due to the net operating loss incurred by our TRS. As a result of legislation enacted by the CARES Act, this net operating loss may be carried back up to five years in order to procure a refund of previously paid federal corporate income taxes. We anticipate that our TRS will incur a net operating loss in 2021 and then we will continue to record a corresponding tax benefit in the first quarter of 2021. Second, we have included scheduled with historical pro forma hotel metrics in our fourth quarter 2020 supplemental. The metrics include quarterly RevPAR, occupancy, ADR, revenue, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAre going back eight quarters to the first quarter of 2019 and we plan on updating this schedule quarterly. To conclude, our focus and three strategic objectives continue to be to redefine the operating model, gain market share and strategically allocate capital. Over time, we expect to recover to 2019 levels of RevPAR with costs that may be $100 million to $150 million lower than they were in 2019 on a nominal basis, with a portfolio that\u2019s gaining market share and outperforming its complex. We are positioned to have robust revenue and EBITDA growth that we expect will be further augmented by external growth opportunities. And with that, we will be happy to take any questions. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Smedes Rose : Hi. Good morning. Jim, I wanted to follow up on your commentary around a pipeline like of an interesting and actionable properties and that sounds like quite a bit of a change from your last call and I just kind of wondering if you could talk about what\u2019s causing more opportunities to come to light for you? And maybe you could just kind of touch on how you\u2019re thinking about underwriting those properties as we move forward? Jim Risoleo : Sure, Smedes. Happy to address your question. I think what has changed is the simple fact that a lot of owners of hotels who were holding off bringing their properties to market have now started as we have messaged today to see light at the end of the tunnel here. I think that you can tell from our commentary and from our release that we feel confident that assuming the vaccine continues to be rolled out and there isn\u2019t any disruption due to new variants being found, which it doesn\u2019t appear to be today anyway. It\u2019s a beginning of a new cycle and there are a lot of buyers who sat on the sides -- sidelines to wait for the time when there might be more buyer interest and we\u2019re starting to see that now. And the pipeline has truly meaningfully expanded between the fourth quarter and the early part of this year. So when I say there are actionable opportunities. These in many instances are private owners who have wanted to monetize their investment for one reason or another, modestly along the lines of distress, there\u2019s not that much distress out there. But we are seeing owners who say this is the time and this is the time to take these assets to market. I don\u2019t think that there is a lot of just price analysis occurring, based on the conversations we\u2019re having. These are people who really want to sell their hotels. Now, we are in a really unique position, given the fact that we have $2.5 billion of cash and we have the ability to acquire up to $2 billion of assets out of existing liquidity, subject to maintaining $600 million of liquidity inside the company. And that gives us the ability to go out and buy hotels on an all cash basis without the need to obtain debt financing, which is a distinguishing factor for us. And we have very strong deep relationships having been in this industry for over 30 years and a very solid reputation, the ability to move quickly and to get deals done. The other thing I think that is bringing people to market today is the fact that the debt markets are opening up. So, we expect that there\u2019s going to be competition from private equity firms. There\u2019s no question about it. But we\u2019re happy to have that competition. I think that the print for the fourth quarter on what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish on margins in a very challenging environment gives us a high degree of confidence that between our enterprise analytics group and our asset managers that we can find ways to create value even in the environment that we\u2019re in today. So we\u2019re confident. I don\u2019t know how many deals we\u2019re going to get done. But we do believe that we\u2019re at the beginning of the cycle. We came into 2020 in the best shape that the company\u2019s ever been in, because in large part we believed going into \u201819 that we were heading into the end of the lodging cycle and we were prudent in our capital allocation strategy and I think it\u2019s going to pay off for us. Because it\u2019s giving us the opportunity to acquire hotels as the economy reopens and as the lodging cycle begins to move. Smedes Rose : Great. Appreciate the detail. Thank you. Jim Risoleo : Sure, Operator : Our next question is from Robin Farley with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Robin Farley : Great. Thank you. Jim, I was interested in your comment about looking outside of the top 25 markets now, when you when you think about acquisition. Would that still be urban? Are you thinking more resort and if -- as kind of part of the same question, I\u2019m just wondering when you talk about IBM Watson, is there some risk with that the data points that are -- that AI would think these data points are going to continue that are really driven by temporary dynamics. And that we know will be temporary and the things that will change, but it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be obvious to a machine predicting based on data points from the last two years. I guess, just thinking about that with that market you\u2019re looking at? Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Yeah. Let me start by addressing IBM Watson, Robin. It\u2019s a powerful tool for us. It does give us an opportunity to evaluate markets through predictive analytics. As I mentioned, I will say that it\u2019s one tool that we use. We are still substituting. We will never substitute IBM Watson for our judgment on what we see happening in markets. And so it takes into account a lot of data. I mean, we have always looked at structured data and we continue to do that. IBM Watson looks at unstructured data. And yes, the world has changed, but I think that the unstructured data is out there and we\u2019re very fortunate to have a tool like IBM Watson to capture that data. Additionally, as we think about markets, we are looking at markets where we believe that we can acquire hotels that will allow us to grow EBITDA at a higher level than our existing portfolio of assets. So in addition to looking at topline, we will be studying in detail the expense profile of each hotel. Because it\u2019s critical that, yes, you have strong revenue management and you have the ability to sell your property, but it doesn\u2019t do you a lot of good if you don\u2019t have the flow-through. So controlling expenses is absolutely critical to how we look at properties going forward. I will tell you that one of the reasons we\u2019re looking at markets outside the top 25 today is because we think that expense growth at least for the near-term is likely to be higher in major urban markets, as we come out of this, just given cost pressures that the urban markets are facing today. So further to answer your question, resorts -- I think our resorts story is incredible. If you look at the statistics, the RevPAR index here is, we\u2019ve been able to achieve on the 16 resort properties we have and if you look at specific resort markets, like, Miami, The Gulf Coast of Florida and Phoenician, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with how our resorts have performed. So, yes, there\u2019ll be at the top of the list. But I would tell you, more importantly it\u2019s going to be assets where there are multiple demand drivers. So we are going to continue to look for properties where there\u2019s a mix of business transient, leisure transient and group. We are strong believers in having diversity of demand and giving us the ability to pivot from one type of demand to the other depending on market conditions. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your question. Neil Malkin : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Jim, I think, it\u2019s a good idea to generally avoid the markets where you have that ridiculous union pressure, making it unprofitable to operate. My question for you is on Hawaii, it\u2019s a big part of your portfolio. Maybe I think it\u2019s your either one or two largest market. I think that was actually one of the saving graces or at least relative to our expectations. ADR was very high, even though occupancy was around sort of a portfolio average. Can you give us an update on sort of how you see Hawaii playing out in terms of demands, sort of pent-up demand and then like maybe what the Asian travel kind of story or timeline looks like to that market as well? Jim Risoleo : Sure, Neil. We are -- our EBITDA in Hawaii is concentrated in three terrific hotels located on Maui. The visitation to Maui is driven by domestic U.S. travel. It\u2019s really not driven by Asian travel. Asian travel is heads to a Oahu and the Big Island of Hawaii, predominantly, not on Maui. So, the ability that we have had on Maui to hold rate and to see rate pacing, total revenue pace up 11% in the back half of 2021, I think speaks loudly to the desirability of Maui in our resorts in particular. So we actually figured out how to navigate the testing requirements and the other requirements the State of Hawaii had put in place and took a family vacation to Maui over Christmas. And even though occupancies were very low, ADRs were very high. So I think that we are going to continue to see Maui and Hawaii travel increase, particularly as the vaccine gets rolled out. What\u2019s apparent to us is that there is incredible pent-up demand out there, particularly on the leisure side and the amount of money that has been saved as a result of the various restrictions and lockdowns and the fact that people aren\u2019t going to the office and they\u2019re not commuting, they\u2019re not going out to lunch, people aren\u2019t going out to dinner is pretty incredible. So we will continue to see Hawaii grow over time. And the other data point that is just very, very encouraging is what we\u2019re seeing with respect to villa bookings at the Andaz, the fact that we had a $3,700 ADR during the month of December for the villas and how we\u2019re getting incredible demand on our 19 new villas that aren\u2019t even complete. So we\u2019re bullish on Hawaii and we think that leisure is going to really continue to carry today as we see business transient and group evolves. Neil Malkin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Michael Bellisario : Good morning, everyone. Jim, you give a lot of\u2026 Jim Risoleo : Hi, Mike. Michael Bellisario : \u2026 input -- hi. Just question for you on the leisure side, you gave a lot of detail specifically on leisure heavy markets and then doing so well. Maybe can go the other side of the coin, what\u2019s the update? What are you seeing in your coastal urban markets, both from a group and transient perspective? And then you mentioned the sequential BT uptick, is that occurring in any of these more impacted gateway markets? Jim Risoleo : Yeah. I\u2019ll take part of this. I\u2019m going to ask Sourav to also provide some commentary on it as well. So not surprisingly, the urban markets are still in very various stages of restrictions. As an example, in California, you still have, certainly, in Los Angeles County, I don\u2019t know about San Francisco, but in LA County, in indoor dining is still closed. So you have the ability to eat outside of the restaurant, gyms are closed, the other amenities like hair salons, nail salons are open, but with 25% capacity. New York, as an example, Broadway is closed. They\u2019ve opened up indoor dining. So until we see services returned to normal and we\u2019re hearing that Broadway could open up soon. But until we see services returned to normal, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see a lot of demand in the coastal markets. Sourav, you want to touch a little bit on BT trends? Sourav Ghosh : Yeah. Sure. On the BT front, not as much demand, as you would expect right now in the coastal urban markets. We are seeing some demand as relates to consultants. So that Deloitte PwC\u2019s of the world, as well as some project teams that are certainly going to these markets as well, obviously, some government and government contract business as well. So, at the end of the day, when you think about it, the offices really need to open up and the companies need to get comfortable with their folks traveling on business. And when that does happen, that\u2019s when travel -- BT travel will be coming back in a meaningful way. And as Jim mentioned, just given the cadence of the recovery that we\u2019re seeing with the vaccine administration across the U.S., that poses really well and we\u2019re optimistic that recovery is going to occur sooner rather than later. I would mention just one thing on the group front is we did do future bookings of about 73,000, room nights from 2022 and beyond. And the encouraging sign there is 30% of that 73,000 room nights was made up of Boston, New York and Seattle. So those are, again, obviously, urban markets and that\u2019s an encouraging sign for the future. Michael Bellisario : Okay. Jim Risoleo : So, Mike, the other thing I would add here and this will impact the urban markets. We\u2019ve had conversations with our managers, obviously, around a lot of matters. But in particular, when we\u2019re talking about BT, we are of the opinion that we might see 50% to 60% of corporate travel returning by quarter four this year. So that\u2019s an encouraging sign for us. The other encouraging sign is that most special corporate accounts have held rates flat in 2021 versus 2020, and if you recall, 2020 was flat to 2019. So that\u2019s a very encouraging sign that corporate accounts aren\u2019t pushing back on rate when they\u2019re negotiating. So there are a lot of green shoots out there, and again, not to keep talking about the vaccine, but it\u2019s all dependent on the country getting vaccinated and us achieving herd immunity and offices opening up and people getting back on the road. Michael Bellisario : Perfect. Thanks for the follow up. Operator : And our next question is from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Shaun Kelley : Hi. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to dig in for a moment on one of Sourav\u2019s comments, just talking about the flow-through kind of coming out of this crisis and thrive, appreciate you kind of trying to put that into terms that I think we\u2019ll understand as analysts. I just want to sort of reframe it a little bit, I think, what you said was, you could expect for this year something like $0.65 to $0.70 on the dollar of rev of like, let\u2019s call it, revenue, flowing through to the bottomline. So one is just to clarify, am I thinking about that correctly. And then two, if I am, if we go back and look, I believe the flow-through rates, let\u2019s go back to like 2009, 2010, at least as an industry they were decently lower than that and I believe what happened was occupancy hadn\u2019t fully recovered yet. And so it took a little longer to hit, there\u2019s really high flow-throughs, because first, you\u2019re filling up, yeah, there\u2019s more variable expense attached to that. And then it\u2019s really the rate portion of the equation that drives the higher flow-throughs. But is that going to be -- is that equation going to be a little different this go around and/or could you see higher flow-through as rate actually starts to come back as well? So just maybe help us break that down a little bit? Sourav Ghosh : Sure. Thanks. So let me just give it, I think, give an example, so let\u2019s puts the numbers into perspective. If you just take the Smith\u2019s Travel numbers for 2021, they\u2019re estimating RevPAR down to 56%. What we\u2019re saying with this expense ratio and let\u2019s take the midpoint of what we\u2019re saying between 2.65 and 2.7, that\u2019s 0.675. What we -- if you take 0.675 and multiply that by 56%. All we\u2019re saying is that expenses would reduce by 37.8%. That\u2019s what we were saying is the -- to the midpoint in 2021. We have not seen this from the last downturn where we went -- had a ratio of as high as 0.8. It got as high as 0.69 back in 2009 relative to the peak and that would every subsequent year, obviously, that ratio starts going down as expenses are coming back. So this time around, definitely more incremental expenses are being taken out. So you would expect better flow-through to your point as ADR starts coming back in a meaningful way. And the quicker the revenues come back, the better the flow-through will be, because you would also be having the benefit of expenses not growing at inflation over multiple years, so the sooner revenues come back, the better flow-throughs going to be, the quicker you would have margin expansion. Hope that makes sense? Shaun Kelley : It does. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question is from Lukas Hartwich with Green Street. Please proceed with your question. Lukas Hartwich : Thanks. Good morning. Jim Risoleo : Good morning, Lukas. Lukas Hartwich : One of the lines that -- hi, Jim. One of the lines of the AC hotel development in the Phoenician land sale, I\u2019m just curious if there are more opportunities in the portfolio to unlock hidden value that maybe aren\u2019t apparent to us in terms of the disclosure that we get? Jim Risoleo : Sure. There are, Lukas. And we are very thoughtful about having conversations with respect to value enhancement opportunities until our projects are permitted and are designed and are underwritten, and that is one of the reasons why we were really happy to share with you today, in my comments, what we\u2019re doing at our Ritz Carlton in Naples. So the ability to truly create what we believe based on our underwriting is a 12% cash on cash return on that value enhancement opportunity addition -- in addition to really truly increasing the underlying value of that hotel through the repositioning of it, the addition of suites and the refresh of the guest rooms and the bathrooms in a luxury resort is very attractive to us. And we are working on a number of additional opportunities to either add rooms at properties where we think it makes sense to take excess parcel of land where it makes sense and develop a select service hotel on it. So, the short answer is, you\u2019ll be hearing a lot more from us over the course of time as we move through the entitlement process and as we complete our design, costing and underwriting. And it\u2019s -- we have a whole team in designing construction who was on this. We are in the unique position as a company, because we have an integrated workforce, with designing construction, asset management, enterprise analytics investments and the like within the company to do this sort of work. So we\u2019re excited about it. It\u2019s a key focus for us. We think that many times it\u2019s -- you\u2019re in a better place to invest in your own assets than you are to make acquisitions. That\u2019s not saying that now is not the time to make acquisitions, it is, but we\u2019re going to continue to invest in our properties as well. Lukas Hartwich : Make sense. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Powell : Hi. Hello, everyone. Just a question on, I guess, competition for transit -- for transactions. It seems like the resort and Sunbelt opportunity seems to be very popular right now. Do you see more competition for those hotels versus maybe recovery plays in urban markets and how do you think cap rates are going to trend between kind of Sunbelt resort, urban group and urban guests visit transit hotels and how do you view cap rates going in as part of your underwriting as you look to buy hotels this cycle? Jim Risoleo : Anthony, I think that, it\u2019s -- cap rates are one metric of the underwriting, obviously, by and large, there aren\u2019t many hotels out there today that I would deem to be stabilized operating -- that have stabilized operating models, as we\u2019re looking at them. We obviously look back at 2019 and get a sense of how the asset would have traded at that point in time with the cap rate might have been back then and apply that to the pricing expectations that a seller has. And it\u2019s just -- it is -- it\u2019s all over the Board today. So we\u2019re seeing certain assets that are going to trade at a discount to pre-COVID pricing. We\u2019re seeing assets they\u2019re going to trade at pre-COVID pricing. So cap rate is one metric that we\u2019re looking at. But we\u2019re also looking at how quickly we think we can stabilize the asset with the EBITDA growth will be -- what that EBITDA multiple is going to look like with a discount to replacement classes, supply demand factors at any given market. It\u2019s just a number of different things today. I mean, there\u2019s not one way that you\u2019re going to underwrite a hotel in this environment. I will tell you that it\u2019s -- if you think about a bar, so it\u2019s multiple dates on the store, its cap rate is one, EBITDA multiple is another, replacement costs is yet another and demand trends in any given market. So there is not one way to do it. We\u2019re taking into account a lot of different things in our underwriting model. Anthony Powell : Got it. And what about competition, do you think it will be easier to maybe buy urban hotels this time around than the resort properties that are popular right now? Jim Risoleo : I think it\u2019s too soon to say that. Clearly, the urban markets are going to recover. It\u2019s just a question of when the restrictions are lifted, when people get back to work, when international travel starts coming back into the U.S. So I would not right off the urban markets. But they\u2019re going to recover a little slower than the resorts and in certain other markets just given the dynamic that I\u2019ve referred to. Anthony Powell : Yeah. Right. Thank you. Operator : And we have reached the end of your question-and-answer session. And I\u2019ll now turn the call over to CEO, Jim Risoleo, for closing remarks. Jim Risoleo : Well, thank you, all for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate the opportunity to discuss our fourth quarter results with you and we look forward to talking with you over the coming weeks and months, hopefully in person. Please stay healthy and positive and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Tejal Engman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tejal Engman : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, please note that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws.  As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre, cash burn and hotel-level results.  You can find this information, together with the reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in yesterday's earnings press release and our 8-K filed with the SEC and in the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com.  Participating in today's call with me will be Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. James Risoleo : Thank you, Tejal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Since our earnings call in February, we have made excellent progress on operations and investments and achieve key milestones that we believe will accelerate our EBITDA recovery.  To begin with, we significantly outperformed expectations for the first quarter, which recorded a GAAP net loss but delivered positive adjusted EBITDAre and hotel-level profitability for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. We grew first quarter total pro forma revenues by 50% sequentially. While holding hotel level operating expense growth to only 15% quarter-over-quarter as our operators successfully leveraged the existing resources to meet a stronger-than-expected demand surge in March.  As a result, we delivered $21 million of positive hotel EBITDA for the quarter, a significant improvement from the negative $62 million recorded in the fourth quarter on a pro forma basis. In addition, we acquired the Hyatt Regency Austin, The Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort and nearly 300 acres of irreplaceable land adjacent to our Hyatt Regency in Maui, strategically investing approximately $800 million of capital at prices that are meaningfully below 2019 levels. Following these transactions, we have a substantial $1.5 billion of total available liquidity, including $131 million of FF&E reserves.  Operations continued to improve, with April RevPAR expected to exceed March as the vaccine driven margin recovery gains momentum. Finally, in addition to executing substantial strategic investments, we continue to focus on redefining our hotel operating model and positioning our renovated properties to gain market share, key long-term strategic objectives that we believe will position us to achieve best-in-class EBITDA growth through the lodging cycle.  Beginning with our latest acquisition, the iconic in irreplaceable Four Seasons Resort, Orlando and Walt Disney World Resort. We completed this off-market acquisition on April 30 for approximately $610 million, $40 million less than the price quoted by real estate alert.  The 444 room resort is located on 289 acres within Disney World, which is one of the world's most visited destination resorts. For context, the Magic Kingdom at Disney World alone attracted nearly 21 million visitors in 2019 according to AECOM and Themed Entertainment Association data. The draw of this 1 theme park at Disney World is on par with the approximately 23 million visitors that Boston attracted in 2019 and close to the 24.2 million visitors Miami drew that year.  The Four Seasons Resort Orlando is the only fee simple luxury resort within Disney world that's not owned by Disney. It provides complementary transport to Disney World's theme parks and is the only AAA 5 diamond rated hotel in Central Florida.  Newly developed in 2014 and this iconic resort is a market leader with a 2019 RevPAR index of over 215. It is now hosts highest ranked property based on its 2019 RevPAR of $561 and total RevPAR of $923. Moreover, it ranks fifth highest in our portfolio based on its 2019 EBITDA per key of $81,500.  As with all our strategic objectives, our capital allocation decisions are designed to grow our long-term EBITDA, and we expect this acquisition to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the existing portfolio. The Four Seasons Resort Orlando achieved 90% EBITDA growth from 2016 to 2019. The hotel was profitable in March and the first quarter, and we expect it to be profitable this year, with the latest property forecast indicating that the resort is likely to outperform our underwriting expectations for 2021.  In general, the resort is well positioned to benefit from a surge in travel and leisure demand as the pandemic subsides and the 18-month celebration of Disney World's 50th anniversary begins in October. We believe these demand catalysts will help the Four Seasons Resort Orlando, surpassed its 2019 EBITDA performance sooner than the rest of our portfolio.  Shifting to the Hyatt Regency Austin, we opportunistically acquired this 448 room Sunbelt Market hotel on March 15 for $161 million. Acquired off-market at a 10% cap rate and an 8.8x multiple on 2019 EBITDA, the Hyatt Regency Austin's purchase price represents a 20% to 25% discount to estimated pre-COVID pricing and a 40% discount to replacement cost. The hotel was profitable in the first quarter of 2021 and is expected to outperform our underwriting expectations into the second quarter.  Longer term, we expect the Hyatt Regency Austin to exceed its 2019 EBITDA on a stabilized basis. With profitability to be enhanced by complexion synergies, incremental expense reductions, productivity improvements and ROI investment opportunities.  Turning to our strategic acquisition of nearly 300 acres of land adjacent to the Hyatt Regency Maui. We acquired the Royal Canapoly and Canapoly Kai Golf Courses for $28 million or approximately $95,000 an acre, which represented a discount to pre-COVID values.  We are evaluating numerous long-term value-enhancing opportunities for this land, which also provides the near-term potential to generate synergies with the Hyatt Regency Maui.  To conclude on acquisitions, we have successfully invested $800 million in the first 4 months of 2021 and at meaningful discounts to 2019 pricing levels. This is despite a highly competitive investments landscape with an abundance of capital seeking hotel deals.  Our success is a testament to the depth of our industry relationships and the strength of our reputation, which is based on decades of best-in-class execution.  We believe this is an opportune time to strategically grow our portfolio's exposure to markets with high expected growth into superior quality hotels. These early cycle investments have historically provided years of elevated EBITDA growth when time with a period of strong economic recovery.  Turning to operations. Business volumes grew in each month of the first quarter with March achieving a RevPAR of $84.10, which was 115% higher than our December RevPAR of $39. Moreover, we outperformed the industry's luxury and upper upscale hotel RevPAR performance in our markets by over 2 points in March.  Our leisure markets, such as Miami, Phoenix and Hawaii, as well as some urban markets, including Washington D.C., Northern Virginia, Atlanta and Philadelphia, outperformed the industry over the first quarter. Our hotel EBITDA turned positive in March. Allowing us to achieve $21 million of positive pro forma hotel EBITDA for the first quarter. First quarter revenues were primarily driven by strong leisure demand for our resorts and hotels in the Sunbelt markets and Hawaii as well as by special group business at several of our urban hotels.  As vaccine deployment accelerated through the first quarter, occupancy in our Sunbelt markets and Hawaii rose from an average of 20% in the first week of January, to 57.4% in the last week of March. Compared to 2019, rate declines improved from negative 12.4% for the month of January, a negative 6.5% for March on a portfolio-wide basis. Strong leisure demand over spring break resulted in the portfolio achieving a 12.2% increase in transient rate over spring break 2019. 8 resorts located in Miami, the Florida Gulf Coast, Jacksonville, Phoenix and Maui, delivered almost 24% ADR growth over 2019 for the first quarter, with average occupancies of approximately 50%. Overall, our luxury hotels have increased their RevPAR index by 23.1% over 2019, with the increase in market share driven by occupancy gains. The 1 hotel South Beach and the Ritz-Carlton Naples were notable outperformers in the quarter, with occupancies ranging between 60% and 70% and transient ADR above $1,000.  As mentioned last quarter, our hotels in Washington D.C. benefited from government agency group demand around inauguration, making D.C. one of our highest-performing markets based on sequential RevPAR growth, other urban hotels also benefited from special group business, which included film production crews and sports groups, that collectively drove urban weekday occupancy 8.5 percentage points higher quarter-over-quarter. In addition, an uptick in leisure transient, business transient and contract demand, supported sequential RevPAR growth in multiple urban markets, including Chicago, Seattle, New York, Boston and Philadelphia. In terms of business mix, leisure drove 90% of our first quarter transient room nights.  Our operators drove most of our leisure business through direct bookings with loyalty redemptions increasing 33% sequentially driven by our resort portfolio. The much talked about pent-up leisure demand is evidenced in current holiday travel trends, which reflect lengthening booking windows and progressively higher levels of demand.  For instance, at our Marriott managed leisure market hotels, occupancy on the books improved by 8 percentage points, 9 weeks out from Memorial Day, compared to where those hotels were 9 weeks out from President's Day. Similarly, holiday travel trends for July 4 weekend are expected to progressively strengthen relative to Memorial Day. After which many of our hotels are likely to revert to pre pandemic cancellation policies for leisure bookings.  We expect some of our Sunbelt markets, particularly in Florida and Phoenix, to hold occupancy while rates weaken over the summer. In Hawaii, our Maui resorts are demonstrating continued strength, with occupancy on the books ranging from the mid-80s to the low 90s for June and low to high 70s for July. Remarkably, June ADRs on the books in Maui are nearly 28% higher compared to June 2019, while July ADRs are approximately 50% higher than July 2019. Moreover, we have now completed the development of 19 new luxury 2-bedroom villas at the Andaz Maui. The villas already have 45% occupancy on the books at an ADR of $1,700 for the remainder of the year, and bookings continue to grow.  Moving on to group. We achieved 264,000 group room nights in the first quarter, with 1 highlight being a corporate group of over 4,500 room nights at the Orlando World Center Marriott. The lead for this group came from last October's Connect 2020 conference held at that hotel, which demonstrated how a group event of over 1,000 in person attendees could be held safely. We currently have 1.5 million definite room nights on the books for full year 2021, with approximately 1 million of those in the second half of the year. Cancellations remain above 2019 trends, but continue to decline week over week.  Encouragingly, our Marriott managed properties booked a total of approximately 144,000 new rooms across the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021, with strong lead conversion rates compared to 2019.  Group room nights currently on the books represent approximately 11% of total available rooms in the third quarter and 13% in the fourth quarter. Booking momentum was strong in the first quarter with nearly 165,000 and 154,000 new group room nights booked for 2022 and 2023, respectively. Importantly, our operators have continued to hold future group rates. Compared to 2019, ADR for definite rooms on the books is flat in 2022 and 1.5% higher in 2023.  Turning to business transient. Demand continues to make steady progress, and first quarter bookings were 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by a steady month-over-month progression.  Our hotels in San Francisco, San Jose accounted for approximately 30% of the sequential increase in room nights, while ADR rose 17% or $26 over last quarter due to increases from high-rated markets such as Miami, or the Gulf Coast and Phoenix. Most of the special corporate business in the quarter was driven by consulting, project business and government accounts.  To conclude on operations, there were 76 hotels opened for the first quarter. We reopened Hyatt Regency Capital Hill on May 1 and expect to reopen the Westin Chicago River North and the ibis Rio De Janeiro later this month. By the end of May, we expect only the Sheraton Boston to remain under suspended operations.  Reflecting on the last 12 months, which have been the most difficult in host history, I am proud of all that we have accomplished and excited by the clarity of our mission, which is to position the company to deliver best-in-class EBITDA growth through the new lodging cycle. To achieve that goal, our 3 strategic objectives remain.  To redefine our operating model with our managers to position our renovated hotels to gain market share and to allocate our capital strategically through acquisitions as well as through development projects. We have quantified the potential returns expected from these investments in the past. And I am going to put all the numbers together for you now.  From redefining our operating model with our managers, we expect to generate $100 million to $150 million of potential long-term cost savings based on 2019 revenues. From our goal of gaining 3 to 5 points of weighted index growth as the 16 Marriott transformational capital program hotels as well as 5 other hotels where major renovations have been recently completed or are underway. We expect to generate $21 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized annual basis. And finally, from recently completed and ongoing ROI development projects, we expect to generate $25 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA on a stabilized annual basis.  It typically takes renovation and development projects 2 to 3 years to stabilize. As these projects are at different stages of renovation and development, stabilization will occur over several years. As a reminder, our recently completed and ongoing development projects include : the ground-up development of the 165 key AC hotel Scottsdale North, 19 new luxury villas at the Andaz Maui, repositioning and expanding the Ritz-Carlton Naples and 60,000 square feet of additional meeting space as well as in Aquatics Park at the Orlando World Center Marriott, our acquisitions of the Four Seasons Resort Orlando and the Hyatt Regency Austin provide us a pro forma 2019 hotel EBITDA base of $1.547 billion.  While it makes sense to think of 2019 as the base year, the timing of a return to 2019 levels of hotel EBITDA remains highly uncertain, particularly given the unprecedented pandemic driven nature of the downturn. The recovery is may span several years, and our portfolio is likely to continue to evolve over that time.  However, our goal is for the initiatives and projects underlying our strategic objectives to add a potential $145 million to $220 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized basis.  With the lodging industry's supply-demand fundamentals continuing to improve, we remain focused on long-term growth and on building a business that is stronger than it was in 2019. We are pleased with our execution to date and feel optimistic about our future as the pandemic receipts and travel continues to rebound.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav. Sourav Ghosh : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I'll provide more color on how we achieved breakeven in the first quarter and how we expect the revenue expense trends to evolve through the course of the year. We achieved positive hotel EBITDA and positive adjusted EBITDAre for the quarter due to 3 main drivers : a stronger-than-expected increase in demand throughout the quarter, particularly in March, our manager's ability to sequentially increase average room rates by 18% and continued expense control at the property level. As Jim covered the first 2 drivers in his remarks, I will focus on the third.  First quarter hotel level operating costs rose by only 15% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, despite an approximately 50% increase in total revenues over the same period. As demand suddenly surged in March, our operators didn't have the time to adjust staffing and other controllable costs from contingency levels implemented since the onset of the pandemic.  As a result, March variable expenses declined by 70% on total revenue declines of only 62% compared to March 2019. Most of the resulting savings were due to cross utilizing hotel employees across various job functions. For the first quarter, variable expenses declined by 74% on total revenue declines of 70% compared to the first quarter of 2019. In future quarters, we expect staffing and other controllable costs to adjust to more normalized levels as demand continues to grow.  Fixed expenses were 41% lower than the first quarter of 2019. This is a remarkable achievement considering that nearly 20% of the remaining fixed costs are below GOP and consists mainly of expenses such as property taxes and insurance, which don't change with business volumes.  As part of our goal to redefine the operating model, both Hyatt and Marriott have restructured a number of above property shared service and allocated costs, which were historically completely fixed. Additionally, we have worked with the brands to achieve greater flexibility to opt-in to shared services on an as-needed basis, further reducing our fixed costs. Last quarter, we introduced the expense reduction ratio to measure the change in property level expenses against the change in total revenue over a comparable pro forma time period in 2019.  The expense reduction ratio in the second through fourth quarters of 2020 was fairly stable at 0.8. That is, for every 10% decline in hotel revenue, hotel expenses declined 8%. In the first quarter, our expense reduction ratio came in at 0.84, much higher than the 0.65 to 0.7 that we expected on our last call for full year 2021. And the highest achieved at any point during the recovery.  The outsized expense reduction ratio, combined with ADR being down only 9% to the first quarter of 2019, enabled our portfolio to achieve positive hotel level EBITDA at 26.6% occupancy, much better than our previously estimated breakeven range of 35% to 45% with ADRs down 15% to 30% compared to 2019.  Positive hotel EBITDA for the quarter resulted in positive adjusted EBITDAre for the quarter for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. 30 hotels representing 30% of total rooms within our portfolio, achieved breakeven or positive hotel EBITDA for the full first quarter. 38 hotels representing 42% of rooms, achieved positive hotel EBITDA in March. March saw additional hotels achieved positive EBITDA in Atlanta, our Texas markets San Diego and L.A. as well as Philadelphia and Hawaii.  In fact, all 4 of our Hawaii hotels achieved breakeven of positive hotel EBITDA in March. As I just mentioned in the first quarter, revenue came back quicker than expenses, which did grow commensurately, particularly in March. Going forward, our operators are expected to increase staffing and controllable spending more in line with higher levels of demand. In addition, other departmental and support expenses, such as sales and marketing as well as maintenance and other support costs will lead to ramp up relative to the first quarter, while remaining well below 2019 levels. Therefore, on a full year basis, we continue to expect the expense reduction ratio to be closer to 0.7.  Shifting to our top line outlook. While we are not providing guidance at this time, I would like to share how we are thinking about our top line trajectory for the rest of the year. We expect RevPAR to continue increasing sequentially throughout the year, but we expect growth to be driven by occupancy in the second and third quarters. We think rates could sequentially decline as we move out of peak season in some of our higher-rated leisure markets. Seasonality in tandem with a normal demand shift toward lower-rated markets could also lead to lower rates in the second and third quarters as we have seen historically. Additionally, rates could come under pressure as suspended hotels reopen in urban markets.  Moving to business mix. We think business transient will continue to make slow and steady progress during the year. With the anticipated return to office late in the third quarter, driving a ramp-up in business transient demand after Labor Day.  While we have benefited from nontraditional group demand during the pandemic, we expect traditional groups, corporate and associations to begin ramping up meaningfully in the fourth quarter following the expected return to office after Labor Day.  Finally, we believe leisure will continue driving total RevPAR at our properties particularly through the summer. We expect our urban hotels to increasingly benefit from leisure demand growth as restrictions in those markets continue to lift and key demand drivers we open.  As it relates to cash burn for the quarter, our cash burn, excluding capital expenditures, which deducts corporate level expenses and interest payments decreased to $45 million or $138 million, including CapEx. These amounts are down meaningfully from the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by the strong first quarter operating performance. We maintained a strong liquidity position with $1.5 billion of cash, including $131 million of FF&E reserves after adjusting for the Four Seasons Disney Acquisition announced today. And we have no debt maturities until 2023.  There is 1 accounting item I would like to bring to your attention. Neither we nor our operators expect any furlough accruals, employee retention credits or timing adjustments for these items moving forward as COBRA benefits provided in accordance with the American Rescue plan from April 1st to September 30, of 3 to the furlough associates of our operators and are fully reimbursable for our operators via a credit against their quarterly payroll tax liability. Therefore, there is ultimately no cost to the company for providing COBRA benefits and it will not have any P&L impact through the third quarter of this year.  To conclude, we are very encouraged by the momentum of the lodging recovery, which has driven better-than-expected sequential revenue growth and resulted in positive first quarter hotel EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAre. We are seeing increased demand across all parts of our business, alongside strong rate integrity. We view an expected increase in expenses favorably, too, as that indicates business volumes are ramping back up to normal levels. Combining that with a strong balance sheet and a focus on our 3 strategic objectives : redefining the operating model, gaining market share at our renovated hotels and strategically allocating capital. We believe we are well positioned to deliver best-in-class EBITDA growth that we expect will continue to be further augmented by external growth opportunities throughout this lodging cycle.  And with that, we will be happy to take any questions. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Bill Crow of Raymond James. William Crow : Jim, I hesitate to congratulate anybody given the state of the industry, but congratulations. It was much better-than-expected quarter. I wanted to ask you a question about acquisitions. It just -- it feels like 3 months ago, 4 months ago, the bid-ask spread on deals was fairly significant, and there wasn't a lot of movement.  And it seems like that bid-ask spread has narrowed dramatically. And it's not the seller that's moving down. Is that the right way to think about what's going on with the transaction market? Is it -- the buyers have gotten much more aggressive, maybe much more confident in the outlook? James Risoleo : Yes, Bill, well, thank you for the congratulations. Even though we have a ways to go to get back to 2019 levels of RevPAR and EBITDA and exceed those levels. We really like the trajectory that we're on at this point in time. So I will take the congratulations in a tough environment. With respect to acquisitions, I think we all agreed that, let's call it a year ago, we believe that there was going to be a lot of distress in the marketplace. And I would point to our Hyatt Regency Austin acquisition as an asset that was under distress.  The ownership, the borrower in that deal was staring down a UCC foreclosure action that was going to occur at the beginning of April, as you know, we bought the hotel in mid-March or thereabouts. And saved that borrower and paid off all of the debt associated with the hotel and acquired a really good asset at a significant discount to pre-COVID evaluations.  I think that a couple of things are happening now. There is a lot of equity in the marketplace, chasing deals. Good deals are going to price at close to where they would have priced in 2019. There's no question about it. Solid resorts like the Four Seasons Disney, which are truly iconic and irreplaceable assets. Are going to be fully fairly priced. I am not seeing generally a lot of distress in the marketplace today, particularly for the better quality assets. And we are not really seeing a lot of distress across the system right now. So I do think that there is a lot of capital out there.  I think as you compete more in auction processes, pricing is going to going to be aggressive. However, we're coming out of the worst downturn that we've ever experienced in the lodging industry and the pandemic induced recession in the United States as well, we're turning the corner, and we are firm believers that for the right assets at this stage of the cycle, it's the time to acquire. It's a time to continue to shape the quality of the portfolio that we have.  We were fortunate that coming into 2020 on a number of different metrics, the company had never been in better shape. We talk a lot about the balance sheet and the firepower that, that's given us to deploy $800 million of capital today.  What we don't talk about a lot, but I think it's really important that investors understand it is our RevPAR metrics as of January 1, 2020, and our EBITDA per key performance as well as the fact that over the last several years, over the last 5 years, we have consistently tightened up margins year-over-year.  We had margin improvement going forward. So we are just delighted with where we are. And we hope that we're going to have the opportunity to acquire additional assets early in this cycle so that we can ride the economic wave. Operator : Our next question is coming from Robin Farley of UBS. Robin Farley : A question on a similar; topic, which is just looking at how asset values have been, as you said, a lot of capital out there. Does that change your expectation about whether you would use? I think you said you have $1.5 billion still remaining for acquisitions, whether you would actually be able to use that budget here in the next 12 months? And then just a little sort of side question. I'm curious with the Four Seasons Orlando, you talked about a lot of the acreage there. Is there opportunity to add anything there given it's special location, kind of the only thing not Disney owned, where you can kind of monetize that acreage? Or are there limits on what else you might be able to add to that acreage? James Risoleo : Sure, Robin. With respect to deploying the remaining capital that we have, the cash that's on the balance sheet obviously, we have some restrictions in connection with our bank waiver agreement today.  We're looking forward to the time whenever we're going to come out of that the waiver amendment as operations improve, we're hoping that's going to be sooner rather than later. It's very difficult to hypothetically answer the question of whether or not we're going to be investing additional capital because it's really transaction specific, and we are evaluating a number of opportunities now, we've evaluated a number of opportunities over the course of this year that we've let out because we didn't think they were the right fit for host for 1 reason or another. So we have teams that are back on the road. I'm back on the road looking at assets. We have people on the road today as we speak, looking at assets, and we're hopeful that we're going to be able to get some additional capital smartly deployed.  With respect to the Four Seasons Orlando, the resort sits on roughly 289 acres. And the short answer is that on the acreage that we have today, we do not see a current opportunity to redevelop any of that property. It includes it's -- if you haven't seen this property, I encourage you to look on the website or better yet, go visit it because it is really a fantastic, truly iconic and irreplaceable asset. It has an 18 hole golf course, it has 444 rooms, 55,000 square feet of meeting space, a 13,000 square foot spa, it has a 5-acre water park and tennis courts and 6 food and beverage outlets.  So while the 289-acre sounds like a lot of acreage, it is being fully utilized today in a very, very efficient and a very useful manner. Operator : Our next question is coming from Neil Malkin of Capital One Securities. Neil Malkin : And great quarter. I'm slow clapping for you over here. My question is on the group side. I think that's sort of the big mystery here, the biggest unknown. I think everything else is well understood, and leisure is going to be fantastic for you guys.  Just, Jim, if you could -- sorry, if you could put some color or maybe what you're underwriting for this year, in terms of group, I think in the first quarter, you were at about, I don't know, 20% or 25% of '19 levels for group. How do you see that shaping up maybe over the -- through '22? And more specifically, what are you underwriting for the fourth quarter of this year? You said things are coming back or you're more bullish on that quarter. I mean, can you kind of just benchmark or couch what you see as the performance relative to '19 in the fourth quarter and more specifically into '22 as well? James Risoleo : Sure. I'll start, and maybe I can pass Sourav chime in as well. For the second half of 2021 we have 1 million room nights on the books. And we have, at our Marriott managed properties, we booked 144,000 new room nights this year for 2Q for the second quarter through the fourth quarter of the year. Of those 144,000 new room nights, about 70% of those were for the second half of the year. So that 1 million room nights that we have on the books for the second half of 2021 equates to 50% of the room nights we had in 2019, same time in 2019. So the split between the bookings is really leaning fourth quarter a little bit, not a lot, call it, 54% in the fourth quarter.  And the other thing I'd like to add is that we have a high degree of confidence that those groups are going to show up because our managers have just scrubbed all the bookings and to make certain that people aren't just hanging in there are going to cancel at some point in time. So it's not great, but it's good. The fact that 1 million room nights are still there and holding up is encouraging. As we look out to 2022, it is -- we have what about 2 million room nights on the books in 2022 Sourav, I think, something like that? And it is very dependent at this point in time on when restrictions are going to be lifted in key markets.  To just put some back around it, some of the markets in Chicago, I think, just announced yesterday, when they're going to reopen. California is expecting to fully reopen on June 15, Boston, August 1, New York, July 1.  And I think that as markets reopen, that's the first thing that has to happen. But more importantly, what has to happen for the business transient traveler to return. And the -- in groups to start booking into next year in a more meaningful way is we have to continue to get the pace of vaccines out there, get to herd immunity in the country and very importantly, get our children back-to-school. And I think that we're hopeful that, that's all going to happen comes to September. I don't know, Sourav, do you have anything you want to add on this point? Sourav Ghosh : The only thing I would add is in terms of booking activity. So our properties booked 440,000 room nights for the next 3 years. So that's '22 through '24 and to put that into perspective, that's 17% better than 2019 levels. So we're certainly encouraged by the booking activity that's taking place and hope that continues as we go into the second and third quarters for future years as well. Operator : Our next question is coming from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : On the Four Seasons Orlando acquisition, having stayed there, I'll agree that a really special property. Just can you talk a little bit more about where you see opportunities?  Like do you see the opportunity to make changes to that property to grow EBITDA longer term? And you bought it at a 4.7% 2019 cap rate or 16.8x EBITDA multiple. Do you have a view on where stabilized returns will be? James Risoleo : Sure, Thomas. We do have a view, obviously, in our underwriting. We put a lot of thought into it as we do in every acquisition. Let me start by saying that this is the type of hotel that we have a lot of experience with and that we have in the past, delivered a lot of value to our shareholders through our asset management and enterprise analytics capabilities.  As we look at this property out of the box is profitable as we speak. And we're optimistic that the performance of the asset is going to exceed our underwriting expectations for 2021, for sure, the way it's going. There are a lot of things Sourav and I will kind of tag team this a little bit in a moment. But as we look at what's happening in Disney and in the country, we're very optimistic that we're going to see strong performance of this hotel going forward.  We believe that this property is in a position to perform better from an EBITDA growth profile than the rest of our portfolio and to recover to 2019 levels of EBITDA and beyond sooner than the rest of our portfolio does.  Additionally, and I'll let Sourav put some color on this, we feel that the asset has multiple asset management opportunities to advance margin and operational improvement. One other point I'd like to make is that October 1 this year is the 50th anniversary of Disney World of the Magic Kingdom and Disney is planning an 18-month celebration, starting October 1. So we expect that we're going to see incredible demand flowing to this hotel.  One of the things that we looked at is the performance of ultra luxury assets. And if you look at ultra luxury assets over the last 20 years from 1990 to 2019. And those are defined as hotels with a RevPAR of $500 or greater. The CAGR was 6.2%. And if you look at the top 25 markets over that time frame, the CAGR was 3.2%.  So we think that there is incredible demand out there for this. The resort is becoming a destination onto itself, not only a destination for people who want to stay at Disney, but a vacation destination given the amenities that are on property. I've heard from some people that they take their family to stay at the Four Seasons and the kids only want to go to Magic Kingdom. So all good stuff as we see it going forward.  And I'll let Sourav talk a little bit about some of the things we're looking at. Sourav Ghosh : Yes. So we -- like with any acquisition, we have the best practice to pay book that we will share with the property and then work collaboratively with the management team to implement those best practices. For example, we have a best-in-class functional space management strategy to maximize revenue per available space. The meeting space that exists on property.  We've obviously done a lot with our existing luxury resorts in Florida as well as across our portfolio. Additionally, given that this is a resort and it has a ton of ancillary income as well, it's going to be all about maximizing total RevPAR, which we have again successfully done in implementing it, whether it's the 1 South Beach one of our recent acquisitions or it's Naples in Florida as well.  So a lot will be -- a lot of focus on total RevPAR and driving ancillary income. We will also work -- and the Four Seasons actually has a very experienced management team, work with them to identify any operating model opportunities as we have successfully again done across our luxury resorts and implement them as soon as possible. So we look forward to working with the team. The other piece is, obviously, we're evaluating multiple ROI opportunities, particularly as it relates to food and beverage. Which we are excited to move forward on as well. Operator : Our next question is coming from Smedes Rose of Citi. Smedes Rose : I just wanted to -- first, I just wanted to clarify something. Did you say you have 2 million group room nights on the books now for 2022? James Risoleo : Correct. Smedes. Yes. Smedes Rose : Okay. Is that running at about 1/3 of what you would have done in 2019? Or is it running at a higher pace? I'm just trying to get a sense of what potential upside be there. James Risoleo : Yes. Sourav Ghosh : Yes. Sure, Smedes. Relative to '19, when you think about it at this point in time, we would have about 60% on the books for the following year. We have approximately 45% on the books for 2022. Smedes Rose : Okay. Okay. And then I just wanted to ask you, you mentioned the $100 million to $150 million in cost savings. And you've talked a lot about just being more efficient at the property level in order to achieve some of those savings. But has there been any more thought, I guess, coming out of the brands around the way that housekeeping will be execute going forward? And is that another potential opportunity for significant savings? Or would you not expect to see any kind of meaningful changes in that cost item? Sourav Ghosh : It is certainly an ongoing dialogue, and it is going to be on a case-by-case basis, as you can imagine, at resort properties, it's going to be somewhat different than with urban hotels. And also business mix is also very dependent. So it's something that we are constantly -- we are having conversations with our managers to see how that brand standard will evolve as we get into more stabilized operations.  So it's a continuing dialogue, and it definitely is going to be on a market-by-market basis. But there certainly is opportunity to modify housekeeping relative to what it was pre-pandemic. Operator : Our next question is coming from Lukas Hartwich of Green Street. Lukas Hartwich : Can you talk a little bit more about the long-term optionality with the 300 acres acquired in Maui? James Risoleo : Sure, Lukas. Again, $95,000 an acre currently being utilized for 2 golf courses, and a couple of restaurants on that site. It's immediately adjacent to the Hyatt Regency Maui, an asset that we have just completely repositioned.  It was a -- one of the assets that was under a multiyear repositioning program and when COVID hit, we were able to go back to our general contractor and renegotiate the contract is to give you context and accelerate the renovation and repositioning of that asset. So it was completed in November of last year as opposed to a year later, plus or minus. We see opportunities going forward, subject to zoning and doing a additional development in Maui takes time. There's a long process, but that we have experience with that, given what we were able to do at the Andaz with the addition of our Villa units.  And there are opportunities on that land to add rooms to the existing hotel to build another hotel to build a select serve hotel. As we think about it, and use the petition as the Blue -- Play bulk and Blueprint, where we took 27 holes of golf and shrunk it to 18 holes those are things that we're going to think about going forward in Maui. Operator : Our next question is coming from Chris Woronka of Deutsche Bank. Chris Woronka : I think back in the prepared comments, you mentioned that as part of the long-term EBITDA improvement plan, you're looking at $21 million to $35 million coming from 3 to 5 points of index growth at some of your recently renovated Marriott Hotels.  Can you kind of give us a sense as for -- is that 3 to 5 points of index growth relative to 2019 or pre renovation? And just where do you think that lift comes from? Is it from other Marriott properties in the market? Or is it from other brands? Just any additional details that you can give us on that would be terrific. James Risoleo : Yes. It is 3 to 5 points of yield index growth relative to where the asset was performing pre renovation. And the assets that we're talking about are not only the 16 Marriott transformational capital program assets but other assets where we invested ROI money such as the doses are and what we're going to be doing at the Ritz and Naples and other hotels across the portfolio. Where does it come from? It's tough to say, Chris. We think that in the middle of the pandemic, the 1 asset that we can point to that has really captured a lot of incremental market share is the Coronado Island, Resort & Spa in San Diego.  I think the yield index gain for well over 9 points at that hotel. So it's going to be case by case, and I don't want to promise anything, but as we are putting money in our hotels and renovating our properties and repositioning them, we're going to have a distinct advantage as business gets back to normal.  And I personally believe that we should be able to achieved more than 3 to 5 points of yield index growth because we're going to be competing with hotels that haven't been renovated that are going to have to be renovated going forward. And there's going to be incremental disruption associated with those renovations.  When they do occur, and it's going to have to happen or we're just going to be competing with a tired property. So we are very fortunate to have had the ability to continue to invest in our assets over the course of 2020, and we're doing the same thing this year going forward. Operator : Our next question is coming from Aryeh Klein of BMO Capital Markets. Aryeh Klein : ADR resorts have been incredibly strong through pandemic. Do you view this as the new normal and a run rate maybe moving forward? I guess when you look ahead over next year or two, can this be sustainable and that we build-off of this year? James Risoleo : Yes. I don't know that it's going to be sustainable, Aryeh. I think that this year, was a unique point in time with businesses closed and people working from home and people being in a position where they can work from anywhere as children get back into schools and as offices open, I think we're going to see a return of business transient traveler and return of group business, and we are just very fortunate that our resort portfolio and our assets in the Sunbelt have carried us through in a material way.  We never thought that we would be profitable in the first quarter. We had 30 hotels that were profitable for the entire quarter. And I don't know that we talked about this before, but we had 38 hotels 42% of our rooms that were profitable for the month of March.  So do we think that we're going to continue to see this outsized performance? I think for a -- for the near term, the answer is yes. And when I say near term, we're talking about another year or so because there's so much pent-up demand out there is so much money in savings.  There is $6 trillion that individuals have in their bank accounts today, they want to spend it. For sure, they want experiences. They're happy to get on the airplane and go. One of the other interesting data points that we look at is air capacity.  And surprisingly, for Maui, our 3 resorts, I gave you some numbers on how they're trending for June and July, which I don't think anybody would have believed that sitting here a year ago, that we'd be seeing 80% to 90% occupancy at an ADR up 28% and our 3 resorts on Maui.  It's the only market in the country the only air mark in the country being Maui, that has more capacity right now than it did in 2019. Air capacity from Maui is up 4%. So for the near term, I think you're going to see incredible pent-up demand, replenished travel, we are seeing it. That's going to continue.  But is it sustainable over the next 3 to 5 years? It's hard to say, but I doubt it. At that point in time, we are really going to be able to compress rates as we have group business and business transient business back in the hotels. Operator : We're showing time for one last question. Our last question will be coming from Anthony Powell of Barclays. Anthony Powell : You talked a lot about the strength in ultra luxury properties over the past several years that cycle. So that shift -- that signal a shift for you to focus more on those properties and buying more of those over the cycle? Or would you prefer or even try to do more deals like the Austin property, which is more of a discounted group convention hotel in a kind of a growing market? James Risoleo : Anthony, I think that we are very open-minded to investing in both types of assets. We're comfortable with a hotel like Austin that puts the profile of assets that we own today that we know how to effectively asset manage as I've talked earlier on this call, we're very comfortable with an asset like the Four Seasons Orlando.  And it really comes down to what I said in my prepared remarks. Regarding improving the EBITDA growth profile of the company. So that's where you're going to see us putting capital into assets where we feel that we can improve the overall EBITDA growth profile. As I mentioned on our fourth quarter call, we're prepared to look beyond the top 25 markets. We did that with Austin.  We're continuing to do that today. The demographic trends are changing in this nation. And a lot of people and a lot of businesses are relocating to cities in Sunbelt states, and we're going to follow the demand.  So I think you can expect to see us invest in a Marriott array of properties so long as they're all going to approve the overall growth profile of host. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Risoleo for closing comments. James Risoleo : Well, everyone, thank you for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate the opportunity to discuss our first quarter results with you. I look forward to talking with many of you over the coming weeks and at NAREIT in June. And at REIT World in person at the Wind hotel in November. Just ask -- I'm going to ask you to just do a couple of things. If you haven't gotten vaccinated, please get vaccinated. Enjoy your summer travels and go out and visit some of our hotels. Lastly, be well and stay healthy. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your interest in Host Hotels & Resorts. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jaime Marcus, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Jamie, please go ahead. Jaime Marcus : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, please note that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today\u2019s call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and hotel-level results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in yesterday\u2019s earnings press release and our 8-K filed with the SEC and in the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. Participating in today\u2019s call with me will be Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Risoleo : Thank you, Jamie, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. As the saying goes, the trend is your friend, and that has certainly been the case for Host in the broader lodging sector since the first quarter. While we are paying close attention to the delta variant and the potential impacts to our business, we are very pleased with the performance of our portfolio. We are seeing increased demand across all business segments as market restrictions lift and the lodging recovery gains momentum. TSA passengers group trends have accelerated since Memorial Day and are currently about 80% of 2019 levels compared to 60% in April. Leisure demand remains resilient in group and business transient volumes continue to trend in the right direction. We significantly outperformed expectations and meaningfully beat consensus estimates on all metrics in the second quarter. Our RevPAR increased 55% over the first quarter. We delivered positive adjusted EBITDAre of $110 million, pro forma hotel EBITDA of $126 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.12. Each of these metrics saw meaningful sequential increases over the first quarter. For the second quarter, pro forma revenues increased 54% over the first quarter, while hotel-level operating expenses grew by only 32%. The increase in revenues was driven by stronger than anticipated demand, continued expense savings for redefining the operating model and slower than expected hiring in Sunbelt market. These factors led to a 400% increase in pro forma hotel EBITDA in the second quarter versus the first quarter. We are continuing to see green shoots across all aspects of our business as the lodging recovery gains momentum. As a result, we are pleased to announced that as of August 1, all of our properties are open and operating with the exception of our latest acquisition, the former Hotel Alessandra, which I\u2019ll discuss in more detail shortly. In tandem with the operational recovery, we are continuing to increase the expected EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio and improve the quality of our assets by executing on our three strategic objectives, which are to redefine the hotel operating model, gain market share at renovated hotels and strategically allocate capital. As it relates to our capital allocation strategy, we closed on two more off-market acquisitions since our last call in May, the Baker\u2019s Cay Resort in key Largo and a former Hotel Alessandra, a luxury downtown hotel in Houston central business district. Along with our previously announced acquisitions, these two hotels bring our 2021 year-to-date acquisitions to $1.1 billion at a 13.8x EBITDA multiple, which is based on 2019 EBITDA projected normalize operation in the case of Baker\u2019s Cay and the former Hotel Alessandra. After taking into account these two acquisitions, we have $1.3 billion of total available liquidity, including $139 million of FF&E reserves. As a reminder, we discuss the acquisition of two hotels in two Golf Courses on Maui on our first quarter earnings call. We purchased the 448 room Hyatt Regency Austin for $161 million for $359,000 per key at a 10% cap rate and 8.8x multiple on 2019 NOI and EBITDA, respectively. We also purchased the 444 key Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort for $610 million or $1.4 million per key at a 4.7% cap rate and 16.8x EBITDA multiple on 2019 NOI and EBITDA, respectively. We expect this iconic airy place for resort to stabilize between 12x and 14x EBITDA in the 2023 and 2025 timeframe. We also acquired the Royal Ka\u2019anapali and Ka\u2019anapali Kai Golf Courses in Maui for $28 million. All three of these acquisitions are performing meaningfully ahead of our underwriting expectations. As of June, the Hyatt Regency Austin is $4.1 million higher than our four year 2021 EBITDA forecast. And the Four Seasons Resort Orlando is $11.7 million higher. Additionally, the Golf Courses having expected cash on cash return of approximately 11% for the calendar year 2021. Turning to our most recent acquisitions. First, the Baker\u2019s Cay Resort Key Largo, a beach front property, and our first asset in the Florida Keys. We close on this off-market acquisition on July 1 for $200 million through a longstanding relationship with the seller. The resort was attractively priced at an estimated 6.2% cap rate and 14.5x EBITDA multiple on 2021 forecast. While the property was closed for much of 2019, as it went through an extended renovation, this 2021 forecast performance would rank eighth in our 2019 pro forma portfolio on both RevPAR and EBITDA per key. Through opportunities we have identified to organically grow EBITDA as a property, we expect it to stabilize at approximately 13x EBITDA between 2023 and 2025. The 200 room resort in Hilton\u2019s Curio Collection is located on 13 acres of your irreplaceable beachfront land on Key Largo\u2019s Golf Coast. The resort is in excellent condition after reopening in 2019, following a complete renovation totalling $63 million or $315,000 per room. We are thrilled to have a presence in Key Largo as it benefits from the favorable supply demand dynamics of the Keys, while still being close to mainland Florida. The resort is about an hour\u2019s drive from the Miami airport, and it is within a five-hour drive for over 22 million Florida residents. This proximity to the mainland also allows for greater access to labor relative to Keys that are further south. The Florida Keys are highly desirable from an owner\u2019s perspective, given the unique supply and demand dynamics in the market. The rate of growth ordinance ensures that new hotel rooms could only be added if they replaced existing entitled dwelling units, which has led to a 4% supply increase in the Keys from 2000 to 2019 versus 25% for the U.S. according to STR. That in turn has led to Keys consistently having leading upper upscale RevPAR in RevPAR growth as detailed in the Baker\u2019s Cay presentation on our website. Moving on to our most recent acquisition, the former Hotel Alessandra, a luxury downtown hotel in Houston central business district. We opportunistically acquired this 223 room hotel for $65 million or $291,000 per room on July 2, prior to a scheduled foreclosure auction. Our ability to source and close on this distress off-market acquisition is truly a testament to Host\u2019s deep industry relationship, strong balance sheet and ability to close reliably and quickly. Having recently opened in October 2017, this hotel is in excellent condition and we expect little to no capital to be invested in the near-term. At $65 million, we purchased the hotel for an approximate 30% discount to its $90 million development costs. The hotel is currently closed and is fully unencumbered by branded management. We have engaged ATI to operate this hotel with a nationally recognized brands, reservation system and loyalty program, thereby maximizing its attractiveness to business transient and leisure guests. While this hotel had not reached the stabilization in 2019, based on our forecast for normalize operations, which assumes a new manager, brand and operations in line with the 2019 operations of comparable Houston properties, the price would represent a 9.6% cap rate and 9.2x EBITDA multiple. Additionally, we have identified a number of opportunities to explore with our new operator, which we believe will increase the EBITDA growth profile of this hotel. We have the knowledge of the Houston market given our existing ownership of four hotels in the city. The former Hotel Alessandra is part of the green stream mixed use development in the center of downtown Houston, which has the second largest concentration of public companies in the U.S., including 24 Fortune 500 companies. In addition, Houston is the number two U.S. metropolitan area by job growth, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the CBD grew RevPAR by 10% from 2016 to 2019. In total, we have invested $1.1 billion in early cycle acquisitions thus far in 2021 at a 13.8x EBITDA multiple. This compares favorably to the $3.5 billion of assets we disposed of at a blended 17x EBITDA multiple between 2018 and 2020. We continue to believe this is an opportune time to improve the quality of our portfolio by investing in markets with high expected growth. Our early cycle investments have historically provided years of elevated EBITDA growth, alongside periods of strong economic recovery. Moving on to operations. We are excited to announce that we have reopened the three remaining hotels that have previously suspended operations. The ibis Rio De Janeiro opened on May 10 and the Western River North opened on May 19. The Sheraton Boston reopened on August 1, well ahead of our expectations due to an increase in group business demand. With the exception of our newly acquired hotel in Houston, which we expect to open later this year, our portfolio is now fully open and ready to take advantage of the next lodging cycle. Looking at second quarter operations. The recovery momentum continue to play out driven once again by robust rates in our resort market, as leisure demand was stronger than anticipated after the spring holidays. Portfolio wide pro forma RevPAR sequentially improved each month and we ended the second quarter with RevPAR just shy of $100. June RevPAR came in at over $111 representing a 25% increase over March and preliminary July RevPAR is expected to be in the mid $130 range. Portfolio hotel level EBITDA has remained positive each month since March with 52 hotels delivering positive EBITDA in the second quarter, representing 56% of rooms an increase from 31 hotels, representing 31% of rooms achieved in the first quarter of 2021. We were particularly encouraged that June was the first month that our non-resort portfolio also realized positive hotel EBITDA, driven by our properties in San Diego, San Antonio and New Orleans. As markets have lifted restrictions, demand has also improved at our urban hotels. Transient room nights in New York, New Orleans, San Francisco and Chicago grew significantly from the first quarter to the second quarter with New York up over 200%. Importantly, both room nights and rates have increased steadily each month since March. Leisure market weekly occupancy ended at 62% the last week in June, a 3 percentage point increase over the end of the first quarter. Urban and downtown market weekly occupancy recovery continues to be promising finishing the quarter at 43%, up 15 percentage points from the beginning of the quarter with ADR up over 10% quarter-over-quarter. Turning to business mix. Pent-up leisure demand at our resorts has spilled over into the summer months and continues to lead the operational recovery. In the second quarter, both rates and revenue in all of our resorts not only exceeded our first quarter results, but also surpassed 2019 revenues. Resort revenue increased approximately $50 million over 2019 driven by 35,000 more room nights sold with a remarkable $95 increase in rates. This is particularly noteworthy as substantial room night increases have historical resulted in rate erosion. In the second quarter, 11 of our resorts had rates more than 25% above the second quarter of 2019.  Transitioning to group demand, our hotel sold nearly 344,000 group room nights in the second quarter, up 29% since first quarter. As a result, group revenue was up 39% over the first quarter, which includes an 8% rate improvement. Group demand in the second quarter was mostly concentrated in Sunbelt markets, although Boston and Denver were also contributors. We were encouraged to see meaningful month-over-month growth in both corporate and associations group business. Looking forward, we currently have 1.2 million group rooms booked in the second half of the year, which is up approximately 20% since our last earnings call. Of the roughly 200,000 net group room nights booked in the second quarter for the second half of 2021, we are encouraged over two-thirds of them were booked in Houston, Boston, New York and Denver. Net booking activity for 2022, also improved each month in the second quarter resulting in 213,000 room nights booked. Our managers remained focused on holding future group rates, plus ADR on the books is slightly higher than the same period in 2019. We now have 2.4 million definite group room nights on the books, which represents 50% of 2019 actual group room nights. For comparison in the second quarter of 2019, definite group room nights on the books for 2020 were 60% of 2019 actuals. Our group bookings for 2023 are echoing a very similar story, as of the second quarter, our net booking activity for 2023 totals 109,000 rooms, which sequentially increased each month in the quarter. In addition, our average rate on the books is slightly about levels for the same time in 2019. Finishing with business transient, we remain encouraged by the sequential growth we are seeing in this segment. Special corporate rooms sold at the second quarter were up over 100% compared to the first quarter, driven by growth in Denver, Texas, California, New York and Atlanta. We are also seeing booking activity come back from traditional top accounts, which include a mix of financial, government and consulting companies. We continue to believe that business transient demand will evolve post Labor Day with school back in session and the return to office for many companies. We are pleased to have shown a monthly average growth rate of nearly 30% in business transient room nights and revenues since January of this year. As I wrap up my comments, I would like to reiterate the incremental EBITDA we expect to achieve, as we emerged from the pandemic into a new lodging cycle. Our acquisitions year-to-date provide us an estimated pro forma of 2019 hotel EBITDA base of $1.570 billion. While it makes sense to think of 2019 as the base year, the timing of a returned to 2019 levels of the hotel EBITDA remains highly uncertain, particularly, given the unprecedented pandemic driven nature of the downturn. The recovery may span several years and our portfolio is likely to continue to evolve over that time. In addition, we expect $145 million to $220 million of annual incremental EBITDA on a stabilized basis, over time coming from three strategic directives. First, redefining the operating model with our managers, which is expected to generate $100 million to $150 million, potential long-term expense savings based on 2019 revenue. We have taken initial steps towards 50% to 60% of these savings to date. Second, gaining an expected three to five points of weighted RevPAR index growth at the 16 Marriott transformational capital program hotels, as well as five other hotels where major renovations have recently been completed or are underway. As part of the Marriott program, during the second quarter, we completed The Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island and we will complete the multi-year transformation of the New York Marriott Marquis in two weeks. We expect to complete approximately 85% of the Marriott transformational capital program by year end. The five other major renovations have expected completion dates through 2023. We expect these re-positionings to generate $21 million to $35 million of annual incremental EBITDA on a stabilized basis over time. And finally, we expect to generate $25 million to $35 million of annual incremental EBITDA on a stabilized basis from recently completed and ongoing ROI development projects with expected completion dates by the end of 2022. Renovation and development projects typically take two to three years to stabilize after completion. And as these projects are at different stages of the process, stabilization will occur over several years. During the quarter, we completed the development of a new waterpark at The Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort, Naples and additional villas at the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort. The 19 two-bedroom luxury villas achieved occupancy of 73% in the first full month of operations at an average rate of $1,600. This compares favorably to our underwriting assumptions of mid 30% occupancy at an average rate of over $1,400 for the full year 2021. To conclude my remarks, we are very encouraged by the operational recovery we are seeing at our hotels and across the lodging industry as demand accelerates. While we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the Delta-variant, we remain optimistic and well-positioned to execute on our long-term goal of increasing the EBITDA growth profile and improving the quality of our portfolio. With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav. Sourav Ghosh Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on second quarter cash flow, operating expenses and our view on revenue and expense trends for the back half of 2020. During the second quarter, we generated positive cash flow from operations for the first time, since the onset of the pandemic. Starting with pro forma hotel EBITDA of $126 million and backing out $65 million. The majority of which is made up of interests and corporate overhead, we generated $61 million of cash during the quarter. If you take into account our ongoing capital expenditure program, which totaled $87 million for the second quarter and includes ROI projects, maintenance CapEx, and the Marriott transformational capital program. Our net cash outflow was only $26 million. In addition, we maintain a strong liquidity position with $1.3 billion of cash, including $139 million of FF&E reserve, after adjusting for our two hotel acquisitions in July. And we have no debt maturities until October 2023. Moving on to expenses, total operating costs in the second quarter rose by only 32% compared to the first quarter, despite a 54% increase in total revenue. Beginning in March, we proactively increased rates in our leisure markets, given a demand surge and benefited from outsized out of room spent. With that said the slow pace of hiring by our operators caused operating expenses to remain unsustainably low, which we did not expect to continue. Variable expenses were down 59% relative to a total revenue decline of 54% when compared to the second quarter of 2019, these figures had kept pace with each other through February, but since March revenues have come back faster than variable expenses, we expect that gap to narrow as we progress to 2021 and hiring increases to levels more in line with demand. Fixed expenses, including wages and benefits were 32% lower than the second quarter of 2019 and 18% higher than last quarter. Hotel operating costs such as contract services, maintenance and utility costs for the driver of this modest quarter-over-quarter increase. As some traditionally fixed expenses came back with increased business volumes. As it relates to above property shared service expenses, both Marriott and Hyatt continued to provide cost relief and flexibility for services. Areas of savings in the second quarter include above property, sales and marketing, revenue management and IT cost. As a reminder, we introduced the expense reduction ratio several quarters ago to measure the change in property level expenses against the change in total revenue over a comparable pro forma time period in 2019. During the second quarter, our expense reduction ratio came in at 0.84, which means that for every 10% decline in hotel revenue compared to pro forma second quarter 2019, there was an 8.4% reduction in expenses. For reference, in the second quarter of 2021, total operating expenses were down 46% versus 2019 on revenue down 54%. This is the second quarter in a row that our expense reduction ratio came in much higher than our anticipated range of 0.65 to $0.70. While this is positive for profitability, this level of expense reduction is not sustainable in the long run, and it reflects the hiring challenges our operators are facing in certain markets. Our ratio in the second quarter also reflects better than expected ADR as well as tied expense control by our operator. Had our rate been closer to our forecast and hiring ramp up as expected, we estimate that our second quarter expense reduction ratio would have been $0.72. As we think about the second half of 2021, we are anticipating an expense reduction ratio in the $0.75 to $0.80 range. This partly reflects a rate decline in the third quarter, driven by a shift in the mix of business as properties ramp up operations. In addition, expense levels are anticipated to be more normalized, as hiring continues to ramping up in the labor challenge market. Moving to our top line outlook, we are still unable to provide guidance at this time. That said, similar to the second quarter, we expect strong momentum in our top line growth trajectory in the second half of the year as business transient and group volumes increase. We continue to expect occupancy gains to drive RevPAR increases over the second half of the year. As a reminder, we expect that rate will decline in the third quarter before taking back up in the fourth quarter as the extended peak season, we have benefited from in our high rated leisure market shifts towards lower rated market. We are still expecting steady increases in business transient and group demand with more pronounced increases beginning after Labor Day in conjunction with the return to office for many companies. We expect this to primarily benefit corporate and association group business. Based on a global business travel association survey in July, 63% of companies plan to resume domestic business travel in the next one to three month, which is up 35 points from the March survey. We continue to expect leisure travel to drive total RevPAR at our properties, particularly as key demand drivers\u2019 return to normal operations in urban markets. Finally, during the quarter, we opportunistically issued 7.8 million shares of common stock through our at the market program at approximately $18 per share resulting in total net proceeds of $138 million. We have $460 million of remaining issuance capacity under our ATM program, but we want to emphasize that our $1.3 billion cash balance is sizable and the trajectory of cash from operations is expected to continue to increase. With that, in mind, we will continue to be opportunistic with respect to our future issuances. To conclude, we are very pleased with the progression of the lodging recovery and the milestones that we have achieved over the past few quarters. We continue to see increasing demand across all parts of our business at a faster pace than we expected. And we remain optimistic that this lodging recovery will continue to gain momentum through the course of 2021. Given our strong balance sheet, we remain very well positioned to execute on our goal of increasing the EBITDA growth profile and improving the quality of our portfolio, particularly given the strong recovery that is underway. We continue to make significant progress on redefining the operating model with our managers, increasing market share at renovated assets and strategically allocating capital. With that, we will be happy to take any questions. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Question-and-Answer Session Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Smedes Rose from Citi. Your line is now live. Q - Smedes Rose I think I guess my one question would just be, could you talk a little bit more about the decision to issue shares on your ATM relative, I think to your own guidance around net asset value and what looks like to be fairly strong of a strong liquidity position already going into this? A - Jim Risoleo Sure, Smedes. Happy to do that. We always are looking at opportunistic ways to raise capital to deploy capital into areas that are going to enhance the EBITDA growth profile of the portfolio going forward. As we think about valuation and NAV, which we don't talk about, we've never published it and we won't talk it today. Our NAV changes at a point in time. It moves based on facts and circumstances and conditions, and we're in a very volatile environment. We thought it was an opportune time to raise some cash, not a lot, given the acquisition pipeline that's out there. We were looking at Baker\u2019s Cay at the time and some other deals at the time. And so we just felt it was prudent to raise some equity around those acquisitions. And Sourav made it clear, it wasn't a lot of money. And we do have ample liquidity on the balance sheet today. And we'll see where, where the future takes us. Operator Thank you. Next question today is coming from Neil Malkin from Capital One Securities. Your line is now live. Q - Neil Malkin Thank you. Good morning guys. My question is about acquisitions kind of what you were talking about a second ago. Can you just talk about what the pipeline looks like in terms of \u2013 are you underwriting more deals than you were 30, 60 days ago? Do you have a specific focus of assets you prefer in the current environment and just kind of give us a sense for what your capacity is right now under the waivers? I know it changes given your cash flow position. So if you just talk about that'd be great. A - Jim Risoleo Sure, Neil. I will tell you, is a really very much a variable pipeline today. Deals come into the pipeline. We evaluate them and make a decision whether or not to pursue something. And it's hard to say really where we were 30, 60 days ago today going forward it can change in a matter of a day. As we think about the types of acquisitions that we're interested in the \u2013 I think if you look at what we've acquired to date in 2021, $1.1 billion through assets, where it would really fall into the opportunistic category. As we talked about in February on the call with an objective of moving beyond the typical markets that we were prepared to invest in we were really casting a wider net and a wider net allowed us to do two really great opportunistic distress deals one being the Hyatt Regency in Austin that we bought roughly a 25% discount to pre-pandemic use. And then the Hotel Alessandra, which was just recently close on at a 30% discount to through development costs. The hotel was just completed construction and opened the 2017. So of course, we will continue to look for more opportunities along those lines. I think that one of the big stories of the pandemic that has played out is that there hasn't been as much distress out there as everyone thought there was going to be. As you know, there were a lot of funds raised to go buy distressed hospitality assets, and there just hasn't been that much trading in the distress market. The other piece of it is, we'll continue to look at resorts, complex assets that we feel we can add a lot of value to that. I mean, if you look at the past performance of some of the properties that we have purchased, like the 1 Hotel South Beach performance of that assets been off the charts. From a supply perspective, resorts and big box hotels have a lower supply growth of any asset class in hospitality. So we'll continue to look at those fields as well. Lastly, I haven't seen it yet, but I expect that we may be seeing assets come to market in some of the urban markets as things continue to open up. And they \u2013 when we get back to a sense of more visibility with respect to underwriting, I think you'll see some of those assets trade and by no means are we writing off the major urban markets. So I would tell you that generally we don't have a red line through any market today. And the domestic United States that is, I mean, we're not interested in going offshore at this point in time. And it's a wide swap. We still continue to believe that, we are at the beginning of a lodging cycle. We feel that we're at the beginning of the economic cycle. We have some bumps in the road here. Today in particular with some of the earnings reports that were out there at the hiring report, the jobs report that was published this morning. But we feel we have a good run ahead of us. So we're interested in deploying capital smartly and accretively to benefit our shareholders. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bill Crow from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Q - Bill Crow Good morning. Jim, if there's tremendous bid for assets out there, and the pricing that we've seen on a per key basis has been off the charts. Is this just a good time for host to sit back and read, evaluate its portfolio and the breadth of quality up and down the portfolio? And I'm just curious about any current or proposed plans to sell maybe a large number of assets in order to narrow that quality focus? A - Jim Risoleo Bill, the old saying goes, if you can't buy it's time to sell, right. And we've been fortunate that we've been able to deploy $1.1 billion through roughly the first half of this year concurrently with that we are thinking about disposing of assets that maybe don't fit for long-term profile of our portfolio. Not that there's anything wrong with these assets, but there are certain hotels that that are a host fit going forward. So of course, we'll test the market. It would be follow up, if we didn't and we're going to do the prudent thing and we will see if there is a bit out there that we feel make sense for us. We would take the capital that we raised from asset dispositions and redeploy that either into our existing portfolios, through additional ROI projects or additional acquisitions that more fit our long-term growth profile and enhance the overall EBITDA growth profile of the portfolio. Operator The next question is coming from Anthony Powell from Barclays. Your line is now live. Q - Anthony Powell Hi, good morning. Just a question on the second half, you guys seem pretty confident that you're going to see, business transient group come back and though there isn't a worry in the market that say July, maybe kind of a peak RevPAR for the year, given a lot of leisure travel holiday, 4th of July, and that you could see some bumps in the road and October, November with Delta-variants or whatnot? Just maybe go into why you're confident that you can \u2013 that you could see continue to get sequential RevPAR increases through the rest of the year, given all the uncertainty. A - Jim Risoleo Yes. Let me \u2013 I'll start on this Anthony and I\u2019ll let Sourav jumping as well. On the group side let me talk about group, and Sourav can talk about [Audio Dip] we got a lot of feedback there. Okay. I'll talk about group \u2013 what we said on the call today is that we picked up 200,000 definite group room nights for the second half of the year in the second quarter. That's a 20% pop over where we were when we spoke with you after the first quarter earnings release. So we now have 1.2 million group room nights on the books for the second quarter, which is greater than 50% of where we were in 2019. So we continue to be encouraged because of the fact that it's a sequential increase in group room night bookings, over two-thirds of the group room nights that were booked in the second quarter, where split out among several markets. So there wasn't any one more to concentration just to give you a little color. Houston we picked up 53,000 room nights, Boston 23,000, Phoenix 19,000, New York and Denver also had pickups in the quarter. So that gave us a lot of encouragement that the groups definitely want to get back out and they want to meet there is no question about it. Convention centers are reopening in our key markets. And I think the trend on group is very healthy. Sourav? I will Sourav chat a little bit about what we're seeing on the business transient front, because that's another segment that obviously, this is played out exactly as we all thought it would when we entered the pandemic, leisure first, robust leisure travel, robust leisure demand, followed by BTMA group. So we can talk a little bit about BT as well. A - Sourav Ghosh Sure. Anthony, on the BT front, I mean, Jim has mentioned in his prepared remarks, so how we've seen sequential improvement since the beginning of this year, every single month. And that's actually through the third week of July, it's effectively a 30% increase in BT room nights every month. So when you look at Q2 versus Q1 was effectively over 100% increase in BT, and what's actually encouraging on the BT that's on the total portfolio. A one-third of that increase is being driven by urban markets. So when we see sort of our Q2 numbers. So I'll put some numbers around this, our total portfolio, we're at about 150,000 room nights. And off that, 43,000 room nights is from our urban hotels. As we think about how we progress to from Q3 to Q4 second half of the year obviously, it's still lower than 2019 levels, but we would expect by the time we get to the fourth quarter to get to about 50% to 55% of BT levels relative to 2019, when I think BT, this is a specifically special corporate just to clarify. But to the point on rate, I do want to say that we have \u2013 as we did say earlier, that we would see sequential decline in rate, even though you would see sequential improvement in RevPAR, and that holds true. I mean, you saw that happen. In the second quarter, we were down quarter-over-quarter in rates. We would expect that to continue into Q3 and then Q4, we would expect that rate to be more similar to Q2 based on the information we have available today. So while we will see RevPAR improvement sequentially, we will see a rate decline \u2013 we expect the rate decline in the third quarter. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Chris Darling from Green Street. Your line is now live. Chris Darling : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Piggyback \u2013 piggybacking off Bill\u2019s earlier question, is it safe to say that the international portfolio doesn\u2019t fit the longer-term strategy of the company? And if so, could you maybe discuss the level of investor appetite there might be for those hotels? Jim Risoleo : Chris, if you look at the international exposure, I don\u2019t have the exact EBITDA percentage contribution coming out of Brazil in 2018. I don\u2019t know, Sourav or anyone else other team can dig that up. We have three hotels in Brazil, the biggest one being the JW Marriott in Rio and Copacabana beach, and then two small core properties, which would consider \u201cinternational assets\u201d. Those are the only two international assets we have. The other two are based in Canada. One is a Marriott in Calgary and the other is the Marriott in Toronto at Eaton Centre. So I don\u2019t paint one all those assets with one brush. I think at some point in time, we will sell the assets in Brazil. Brazil has faced a lot of challenges today, but if you look at it in the context of EBITDA contribution and investment relative to the Host enterprise value, it\u2019s really quite frankly, diminimous. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Ari Klein from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Ari Klein : Thank you. Just following up on the business trend in question. As far that recovery is concerned, you\u2019re obviously seeing momentum. But how dependent is that recovery on a business travel on the return to office? We\u2019ll obviously see some companies push out a little bit. Can they be independent of one another? And has your thinking changed in any way just that pace of recovery in September, October? Sourav Ghosh : Yes, absolutely. I think they certainly can be independent of one another. And frankly, we\u2019re seeing that right now where a lot of the offices they haven\u2019t opened yet, but the folks are actually traveling on business already, whether it\u2019s BT or attending conferences. So we\u2019re certainly seeing that. We are no exception at Host as well. Our offices are opening post Labor Day officially, but we have all been already on the road and going out to conferences. And that\u2019s true of a lot of the financial services companies out there. So I do think there are sort of, not tied to each other and then certainly, we expect that BT momentum to continue. The other thing I\u2019ll point out is a lot of companies out on \u2013 a lot of this large accounts, they don\u2019t need the high level approval anymore from their department head or their CEO in some to travel that has been lifted. So travel has become much easier for a lot of these are the top accounts and we are certainly seeing that in the numbers as well. And a lot of these have not actually opened up their offices. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Rich Hightower from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Rich Hightower : Good morning, guys. Thanks for that question. We\u2019ve covered a lot of ground already, but I want to circle back to the ATM issuance question and the question around NAV. And I\u2019m not obviously looking for Host\u2019s estimate of its NAV, but more of a question on methodology and how you think about cost of equity in an environment where stock prices are volatile, EBITDA and NOI are obviously not anywhere near back to a stabilized level. So how should we think about it? I mean, is it a function of Street NAVs? Is it a function of a longer-term IRR analysis internally? Is it a private market assessment of what every asset in the portfolio would trade for? How do we think about methodology given the moving parts right now? Sourav Ghosh : We\u2019ll look at multiple metrics, frankly, when we are looking at NAV, it\u2019s not just isolated, whether it\u2019s the cap end model or an ILR, it\u2019s multiple metrics. And as you can appreciate right now, Jim pointed out, when you\u2019re in a volatile environment frankly, it\u2019s really a day-to-day exercise depending on what we think the forecast looks like not only for the balance of the year, but really from a long-term perspective. We always try to take a long-term view to see what makes the most sense to determine what our cost of equity would be. But especially in a volatile environment, it\u2019s very difficult to pinpoint any of the \u2013 at any given point in time. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is now live. David Katz : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the labor issue, which I know you commented a little bit. And make sure that what I\u2019m hearing is, the notion that labor does become increasingly expensive and it is the strategy to match wrapping up labor with demand or is there some mechanisms for trying to mitigate some of the higher costs that I think have been kind of broadly discussed and recognized. What are the strategies around that? Jim Risoleo : Yes. The issue around labor is really \u2013 it really varies market by market. We have seen the greatest level of staffing challenges in the markets were demand quickly returned such as South Florida, Atlanta, Texas and Phoenix. And we are in constant dialogue with our operators on the hiring process, and they are really keen on dedicating the resources that are necessary to ramp up hiring. We\u2019re seeing a slight increase in applicant flow over the last four weeks or so, four or five weeks. And we pinpoint that to, we believe that that is due to the fact that the supplemental unemployment benefits are have run out or we\u2019ll be running out and about 25 states. And come September 6 as the supplemental unemployment benefit expires across the nation. So hourly labor is tougher to find in the Sunbelt, but the management labor is the challenge in the more Northern markets right now. So as we think about it, we\u2019re not really overly concerned about wage inflation. Sourav can share some numbers on where we are with respect to the $15 wage across our portfolio. This is something we\u2019ve looked at. This is something we think about. And as you can see from what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish to date, we have a keen focus on expense control and cost control. So I\u2019ll turn it over to Sourav to talk a little bit about the wage scale in our hotels. Sourav Ghosh : Yes. For our entire portfolio, as it stands right now over 80% of our portfolio is paying its hourly employees $15 or greater. And I would say it\u2019s about with less than 9% of our portfolio that\u2019s paying $14 or less, so very small portion of our portfolio is actually below $14. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Your line is now live. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks. I know you\u2019ve talked a bit already about how you think about asset values, but just kind of circling back to that kind of $2 billion budget for acquisitions, you\u2019ve done some capital market activity to negotiate that. And you are, I guess, $1.1 billion into that. Do you anticipate needing to make changes or do some other capital markets activity to be able to go above that $2 billion? Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Yes. I think there are a couple pieces to your question, Robin. Number one is, we have the ability under our existing credit waiver agreement to acquire $2 billion of assets subject to our maintaining $600 million of liquidity in the company. That\u2019s point number one. The second piece of it is that we do have some flexibility on asset sales to take that capital and redeploy it into other acquisitions going forward. I think Sourav can correct me here because it\u2019s been a while since we talked about the waiver. But if it\u2019s like kind exchanges, we have a lot of flexibility to do that going forward. And then we have another bucket that just allows us to recycle capital. So we have a lot of flexibility under the existing credit waiver agreement to continue to acquire assets. And if we saw ourselves in a position where there were really truly attractive acquisition opportunities out there, and we needed to get more flexibility, given our longstanding relationship with our bank group, we would have no problem with going back and having a chat with them and getting an amendment to the existing waiver that\u2019s in place today. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Michael Bellisario from Baird. Your line is now live. Michael Bellisario : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. This is kind of a follow-up on that last question for Sourav. Maybe kind of along those same lines, what\u2019s your latest thought on opting out of the covenant relief period early, and then maybe when you think you might be in compliance with your bond covenant, so that you would be able to take on incremental debt at some point? Sourav Ghosh : Yes. I mean, if you recall, we were first expecting that we wouldn\u2019t breakeven until the second half of this year. We\u2019ve obviously broken even much earlier than that. So the expectation assuming the trajectory of the recovery remains same and we see that the positive trends that we have seen thus far for the first half of the year, we will certainly be able to get out of the waiver soon or rather than later. That\u2019s only the expectation. Obviously, we\u2019re not providing guidance, there\u2019s still uncertainty, but if the trajectory goes away, we should be able to get out of it sooner. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Jim for any further closing comments. Jim Risoleo : I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us on our call today. We always appreciate opportunity to discuss our quarterly results with you. I look forward to seeing everybody at that NAREIT in November. And as we get back on the road, I look forward to getting some non-deal road shows on the books, in-person meetings, as the economy and the lodging industry continues to open up. So enjoy the rest of the summer, be well and stay healthy. And thank you for your continued support. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jaime Marcus, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Jaime Marcus : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, please note that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws, as described in our filings with the SEC. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed. And we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA RE, and hotel - level results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in yesterday's earnings press release in our 8-K filed with the SEC and in the supplemental financial information on our website at HostHotels.com. On today's call with me will be Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. A - Jim Risoleo : Thank you, Jamie. And thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. Despite the Delta variant, we continued to significantly outperform expectations and meaningfully be consensus metrics during the third quarter. We delivered Adjusted EBITDA RE of $177 million, which exceeded our interest in capital expenditures by $21 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.20 during the quarter. In addition to delivering positive metrics each quarter this year, these metrics continued to see meaningful sequential increases over the prior quarter. Proforma total revenues in the third quarter increased 25% sequentially over the second quarter, while proforma hotel-level operating expenses grew only 21%. The increase in revenues was driven by strong leisure demand at resorts and hotels in Sunbelt markets and Hawaii, which led to a $67 million increase in adjusted EBITDA RE in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. RevPAR for the third quarter was strong as volume improvements extended across the portfolio and rates held up in Sunbelt markets. While we saw softer demand at September due to Delta variant concerns, RevPAR for the quarter still improved by 26% compared to the second quarter. Our hotels saw a 49% increase in business transient room nights, and a 72% increase in group volume over the second quarter. Our recent acquisitions all contributed to the out-performance during the third quarter and are exceeding our underwriting expectations. Preliminary October RevPAR is expected to be approximately $143, a $15 increase over September, and the highest RevPAR we have seen this year. We believe RevPAR will dip slightly in November due to seasonality, before coming back in December. While much of the recovery was concentrated at resorts in Sunbelt markets during the first half of the year, our urban markets saw significant RevPAR improvements during the third quarter. At the start of the quarter, our urban and downtown markets had a weekly occupancy of 50%. And by the end of the quarter, these markets we're running at nearly 56% occupancy. Quarter-over-quarter RevPAR in our urban and downtown markets grew by 89% to almost $96 driven by both ADR and occupancy improvements. In addition to the sequential improvements in operations, we continue to execute on our three strategic objectives, all of which are aimed at elevating the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio. Our objectives include redefining the hotel operating model, gaining market share at renovated hotels, and strategically allocating capital. As it relates to the last strategic objective, we made another off-market acquisition during the third quarter, Alila Ventana Big Sur in California. This brings our 2021 year-to-date acquisitions total to $1.2 billion at a blended 13.1 times EBITDA multiple. This is a continuation of our strategy to deploy capital into assets that will elevate the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio. On the dispositions front subsequent to quarter-end, we sold 5 hotels, totaling 2,323 keys for $551 million, including FF&E reserves at a 14.2 times EBITDA multiple, including forgone CapEx, based on 2018 results. Following this acquisition in our recent dispositions, which I will discuss in a moment, we have $1.7 billion of total available liquidity, including $138 million of FF&E reserves. As a reminder, we have completed 5 off-market hotel acquisitions this year, including the Hyatt Regency Austin, the Four Seasons Orlando at Walt Disney World, Bacers K Resorts in Key Largo, The Laura Hotel, which was formerly known as the Hotel Alessandra in Houston, and Elida events on a big serve. We also acquired the Royal Kanapali and Kanapali golf courses in Maui. All our recent acquisitions are performing substantially ahead of our underwriting expectations. As of September the updated 2021 forecasted EBITDA at Hyatt Regency Austin is $3.4 million higher than the full-year 2021. EBITDA that was estimated at underwriting. The Four Seasons Resort Orlando is $17.4 million higher, Baker's Cay Resort is $2.9 million higher, and the golf courses are $3 million higher. In addition, we acquired the former Hotel Alessandra, a luxury downtown hotel in Houston 's central business district. At the time of acquisition, the hotel was closed and fully unencumbered by brand and management. The property has been rebranded as The Laura Hotel, and it will be operated by HEI Hotels and Resorts as part of the Autograph Collection by Marriott. We have identified a number of opportunities that we believe will increase the EBITDA growth profile of this hotel, including affiliating the property with a major brand reservation system, expanding the FMB outdoor seating capacity, activating the rooftop pool experience, and leasing the ground for retail. The hotel is expected to open in the fourth quarter of 2021. Turning to our most recent transaction. In September, we closed on the off-market acquisition of a Alila Ventana Big Sur for $150 million. This ultra-luxury resort is one of the most uniquely located hotels in the United States, and benefits from extremely limited supply and high barriers to entry due to strict land-use regulations by the California Coastal Commission. We purchased the property at a 9.3 times EBITDA multiple on 2021 forecast. The RevPAR is expected to be $1,320, the TRevPAR is $1,870 and the EBITDA per key is $273,000, based on 2021 forecast. Their performance ranks first in our 2019 proforma portfolio, RevPAR, and EBITDA per key by a very wide margin. Alila Ventana Big Sur is located on 160 acres of irreplaceable [indiscernible] on the California coast. It benefits from use of both the ocean and the redwood forest, and is a drive-to destination for some of the country's most affluent areas.  The hotel has 59 keys consisting of both rooms and suites and is operated under an all-inclusive model. It offers a luxury spa, 3 pools, a high-end fitness center, 12,000 square feet of event space, and 2 restaurants with locally sourced foods and a variety of private dining experience. In addition, the hotel has a number of unique outdoor amenities, including 63 camp sites with 15 luxury tubs located within the big serve Redwood's, as well as numerous tailored experiences and ventures. I cannot emphasize enough the unique nature of this asset and we are delighted to add it to our portfolio as the 12 Hyatt branded property, continuing our position as the largest third-party owner of Hyatt Hotels.  The hotel is Hyatt managed under the Lila brand. And since Hyatt acquisition of two rows hospitality in 2018, the properties have enjoyed increasing market share and a record year of profitability in 2021. The hotels significantly benefit from its high affiliation and World of Hyatt redemption bookings, which contributed a substantial amount of total room nights sold in 2020 and 2021. This demonstrates the growing desire for high-end leisure experiences among World of Hyatt loyalty members.  In conjunction with the Operator, we have identified additional opportunities to grow EBITDA at the property, and we have conservatively modeled this asset to stabilize between 8- and 10-times EBITDA in the 2025 to 2027 timeframe. The hotel recently completed a $23 million renovation and repositioning, investing $390,000 per key and the guestrooms, public spaces, pools, camping facilities, and back-of-house areas. We are excited to have an ownership presence in Big Sur. And we believe the iconic and irreplaceable nature of Alila Ventana Big Sur will further strengthen the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio.  As I mentioned, we disposed of 5 hotels totaling 2,323 keys for $551 million, which includes $11 million of that Bethany reserves, subsequent to quarter end. We sold the hotels at 14.2 times EBITDA multiple, including forgone CapEx based on 2019 Results. These 5 assets were sold as a portfolio and included the Westfields Marriott Washington Dullies, the Westin Buckhead Atlanta, The Whitley, the San Ramon Marriott, and The Westin LAX, both on ground leases. The avoided capital expenditures associated with these 5 properties is approximately $122 million over the next 5 years. We are pleased to have this capital to further bolster our EBITDA growth profile as we deploy it into high-growth assets in our existing portfolio or into new acquisitions.  In total, we have invested $1.2 billion in early cycle acquisitions year-to-date. The blended EBITDA multiple on our 5 hotel acquisitions this year now stands at 13 times, which compares favorably to the $551 million we disposed up at a 14.2 times EBITDA multiple. Between 2018 and 2021, we acquired $2.8 billion of assets at a 14 times EBITDA multiple and disposed a $4 billion of assets at 17 times EBITDA multiple, including forgone CapEx. Since 2017, we have dramatically improved the quality of our portfolio, increasing the RevPAR of our assets by 10%, the EBITDA per key by 20%, and the EBITDA margins by 110 basis points based on 2019 pro forma results. As we evaluate capital allocation opportunities going forward, we will continue to focus our efforts on assets with higher expected growth with the objective of elevating our EBITDA growth profile. Moving onto third quarter operations, we saw significant improvements in transient room nights, which were up 18.5% compared to the second quarter. Our hotels in urban and downtown markets saw strong improvements in transient demand compared to last quarter as municipalities relax COVID restrictions. Occupancy in these markets increased by 17.4 percentage points to approximately 50% in the third quarter, along 24% ADR growth. In our Sunbelt and Hawaii markets, transient rates remained resilient up 26% in the third quarter compared to 2019, despite a modest softening of transient demand over the prior quarter due to seasonality. Our hotels saw continued strength in leisure demand during the quarter. Encouragingly, we saw a solid pickup in leisure demand in our urban and downtown hotels. For comparison, over Columbus Day weekend, our urban and downtown hotels achieved approximately 70% occupancy with an ADR of $231 versus 55% occupancy with an ADR of $180 over the July 4th holiday.  Special events such as the Boston and Chicago marathons, and the return of Broadway shows in New York, helped to drive this demand. Weekend occupancy at our entire portfolio reached 75% in early October with an ADR of $259 compared to a historical level of 87% and $259 in 2019. Resort revenue increased $43 million over 2019, driven by 39% ADR growth with rates in most of our resorts seeing double-digit percentage increases. We expect strong demand at our resorts to continue through year-end, particularly at our Hawaii hotels after the recent news that the state welcome non-essential travel back on November 1st.  Sourav will get into more detail on our business mix during the third quarter shortly. In addition to our successful capital allocation efforts this year, we remain focused on our three strategic objectives. As a reminder, we are targeting a potential $240 million to $315 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized annual basis as we execute the initiatives and projects underlying our strategic objectives. This range includes hotel EBITDA of approximately $93 million from our acquisitions year-to-date. First, we expect to generate $100 million to $150 million of potential long-term cost savings over time based on 2019 revenues from redefining our operating model with our managers. We have taken steps toward 50% to 60% of these savings to-date.  Second, we expect to generate $21 to $35 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized annual basis from our goal of gaining 3 to 5 points of weighted index growth at the 16 Marriott transformational capital program hotels, and 5 other hotels where major renovations have been recently completed or are underway. Keep in mind that our expectation of a 3-to-5-point gain in market share was a pre -pandemic estimate. As we have been in the unique position of deploying significantly greater capital in 2020 and 2021 than our competitors, we are optimistic that our market share gains could be greater as the property competitive set is either an inferior product due to lack of renovation or there will be meaningful business disruption as hotels are renovated.  We expect to complete approximately 85% of the Marriott transformational capital program by year-end, and substantially complete the program by the end of 2022. We expect to invest $1.2 billion in these 21 assets, or approximately $73,000 per key. As of the third quarter, we have invested $834 million in renovations at these hotels. And we do not expect to spend significant capital on these assets in future years. During the third quarter, we completed renovations at the New York Marriott Marquis, which included a complete upgrade of the guestrooms, renovations of over 140,000 square feet of meeting space, the expansion of a Skybridge line with 2 high-definition LED screens, and a re-imagined lobby with new bars and upgraded restaurants.  Subsequent to quarter end, we completed transformational renovations at the Orlando World Center Marriott in Florida, which included the guestrooms, and an updated lobby, restaurants, and bar. These multiyear comprehensive renovations at the 2 largest hotels in our portfolio were part of the Marriott transformational capital program and bring the total number of completed projects in this program to 10 of 16 properties. We avoided significant business disruption by completing these projects during the pandemic. And as a result, they are very well-positioned to capture market share in the recovery. In addition to the Marriott transformational capital program assets, we recently completed the extensive guestroom renovations at the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point in Florida. Lastly, we expect to generate $25 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized annual basis from recently completed and ongoing ROI development projects. These projects are at different stages of renovation and development, and stabilization is expected to occur 2 years to 3 years after completion. Some recent examples of our ROI development projects include the Andaz Maui villas, which are targeting 49% occupancy with an ADR over $1,600 for 2021 versus our underwriting at 34% occupancy with an ADR of $1,400.  And the 1 Hotel beach club enhancements, which have led to over $2.5 million in incremental revenues with returns exceeding the underwriting. To conclude my remarks, we continue to be very encouraged by the operational recovery we are seeing across the lodging industry. As we move further into the recovery, our capital allocation efforts over the past few years, the improved quality of our assets, and the elevated EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio, should accrue to the benefit of our stockholders. These factors combined with our strong balance sheet geographic diversity in size, scale, and reputation, leave us very well positioned to capitalize on accelerating demand. With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav Sourav Ghosh : Thank you, Jim and good morning, everyone. Following Jim's comments, I will go into detail on our third quarter cash flow, operations, expenses and our top-line outlook for the remainder of the year. As Jim mentioned, we delivered positive adjusted EBITDA, ROE and FFO during the third quarter. In addition, we achieved an important milestone this quarter with positive cash flow for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. We delivered adjusted EBITDA ROE of $177 million, which exceeded our interest and capital expenditures by $21 million. We continued to benefit from quarterly sequential improvements with 65 hotels achieving positive hotel level operating profit compared to 53 hotels last quarter.  Subsequent to quarter end, these operational improvements led us to another important milestone of exiting our credit facility covenant waiver period, 3 quarters ahead of its exploration, and coming into compliance with our bond indenture debt incurrence covenants. This reduces our $2.5 billion credit facility interest rate by 40 basis points and gives us greater balance sheet flexibility. Moving on to top-line performance. While our Sunbelt hotels and our resorts continue to drive results, the third quarter represented the best quarter of the recovery for non - Sunbelt and large group hotels. Multiple hotels achieved positive EBITDA in the Chicago, DC, Boston, and San Francisco.  And all hotels in Philadelphia and Denver maintained positive RevPAR for the second quarter in a row. Our large group hotels in San Diego, San Antonio, and New Orleans also maintained positive EBITDA in the third quarter. Expanding on Jim 's business mix comments, our hotels saw business transient room nights increase 49% over the prior quarter, with a 5% increase in ADR to more than $172. even more encouraging is that 40% of those room nights came from our urban and downtown hotel, where business transient rooms sold increased 112% over the second quarter. Additionally, we saw increasing activity from traditional. top 10 accounts, including a mix of Fortune 500 financial, government and consulting companies. A positive given the challenges the Delta variant presented during the quarter. On the group front, group revenue showed steady sequential improvement over the prior quarter with a 72% increase in room nights combined with a 11% increase in rate driven by our hotels in San Diego, New York, Boston, San Antonio, Austin, and Chicago. Overall, group room nights in the third quarter were 52% of 2019 levels despite the Delta variant headwinds. We were pleased to see corporate group performed better than expected in the quarter. This segment contributed 43% of total group room nights in the third quarter, which is on par with our pre -pandemic mix. Corporate group rate also spends in to $196 in the third quarter, which is the highest it has been since the first quarter of 2020 and indicates that more traditional groups are coming back. Corporate group also drove significant improvements in Banker\u2019s revenue, which was up 100% quarter-over-quarter. Association group room nights of 150,000 was more than triple that of the second quarter, which we view as another positive sign for the return of large traditional groups. Affinity groups, which includes social, military, education, religious, and fraternal organizations have been driving group demand during the pandemic. These groups continue to show sequential quarterly improvement, up 27% over the prior quarter. Looking forward, we currently have over 570,000 definite group room nights on the books for the rest of 2021. And we maintained 1.2 million group room nights on the books for the third and fourth quarters despite concern over the Delta variant. Of those group room nights on the books for the fourth quarter, over 42% of them are booked in San Diego, Boston, Orlando, and Phoenix. Net booking activity in the third quarter for 2022 totaled 180,000 room nights. Our managers remain focused on holding future group rates, thus ADR on the books is slightly higher than the same period in 2019. We now have roughly 2.6 million group room nights on the books in 2022, an 8% increase over the second quarter.  For comparison, this represents about 54% of 2019 actual group room nights compared to 50% last quarter. Moving onto expenses, proforma total operating costs rose by 21% during the third quarter, compared to the second quarter, despite a 25% increase in total revenues. Variable expenses were down 40% relative to a total revenue decline of 32% when compared to the third quarter of 2019. Most of this gap is due to the hiring pace, lagging demand growth, and we expect this gap to moderate through the fourth quarter as our operators continue to ramp up staffing levels. The number of open positions at our major operators indicate they are at roughly 94% of targeted staffing based on current business volumes.  For comparison, our managers have historically operated at 97% of targeted staffing based on historical business volumes. Fixed expenses, including wages and benefits, were 19% lower than the third quarter of 2019, and 16% higher than last quarter. Similar to last quarter, some traditionally fixed expenses like sales and marketing came back as business volumes continued to increase. Combining revenues and expenses this quarter, our expense reduction ratio came in at 0.93, which means that for every 10% decline in hotel revenue compared to proforma third quarter 2019, there was a 9.3% reduction in expenses. As Jim mentioned in the third quarter, proforma total operating expenses were down 30% to the third quarter of 2019 on revenues down 32%.  On our last call, we indicated that we were expecting an expense reduction ratio of 0.75 to 0.80 for the second half of this year. The difference between our third quarter results and our forecasts can be attributed fairly evenly to 3 factors : average daily rate came in better than expected, wages and benefits did not ramp up as expected due to hiring challenges in certain markets, and we had unanticipated favorable onetime items on the quarter, including business interruption, insurance proceeds, and property tax savings totaling approximately $10 million. We are expecting an expense reduction ratio of approximately 0.85 for the year, which reflects our expectation of great driven RevPAR growth. and a continued lag in expense growth driven by labor costs. As you may recall, we introduced the expense reduction ratio during the pandemic to measure the change in property level expenses against the change in total revenue. As our revenue declines compared to 2019 decrease in size, onetime expenses have a much bigger impact on the ratio, thus making it less relevant. We therefore expect to revert to pre -pandemic metrics in the coming quarters as operations continue to normalize. Turning to our top-line outlook for the remainder of the year, we're still unable to provide guidance given the continued uncertainties surrounding COVID. That said, we continue to expect sequential quarterly RevPAR improvements driven by rate growth from Visa travelers at our resorts, and we are encouraged by the performance of our urban hotels as demand drivers in those markets continue to recover. We also expect group and business transient to continue improving in our urban and downtown markets as impacts from the Delta variant moderate Company's return to the office, and traditional groups get back to meeting in person. To conclude, we are very pleased with our achievements during the third quarter, including generating positive adjusted EBITDA RE, FFO, and exiting our credit facility covering the waiver period, 3 quarters ahead of its expiration. We remain very well-positioned to execute on our goal of increasing the EBITDA growth profile and improving the quality of our portfolio, particularly given our strong Balance Sheet, accretive capital recycling, and the strong recovery that is underway.  We continue to make significant progress on redefining the operating model with our managers, increasing market share at our renovated asset, and strategically allocating capital. With that, we would be happy to take any questions. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Rich Hightower. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question. Rich Hightower : Good morning, guys. I'm still with Evercore ISI. So a lot of statistics thrown out in the prepared comments, so thanks for the detail there. Maybe give us a sense -- there's a lot of time spent on the improvement in the urban and downtown segments of the portfolio and maybe give us a sense there of where you stand in October. And I guess, even November so far in terms of rate and occupancy versus the same period in 2019. And do you expect those hotels to bridge that gap in the same way that the leisure and resort segments have already done? Do you think that that gap could be fully bridged sometime next year? Is that a 2023 event? How do we think about that? Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Yeah, Rich, I will -- I'll start here and then Sourav, feel free to jump in as well. The number that we provided for our October RevPAR is a preliminary portfolio number. And we do not have granular data at this point time on performance at the urban hotels versus Sunbelt leisure hotels. We did a rollout and we saw that $143 is a good number and that's the number we provided. So we're confident given the trajectory of the business return that we saw in the third quarter, in particular, that the business is going to continue to ramp. And the encouraging -- a lot of encouraging data points, as you said, in our prepared comments.  But one of the most encouraging, with respect to the urban hotels, is the level of leisure business we saw come back to those properties as amenities started to open up, such as Broadway in New York, we saw the Boston Marathon, we've had really strong performance on the leisure side. We're seeing a lot of solid business transient come back to the urban properties as well. And that's business transient from our traditional -- more traditional accounts. The top 10 accounts that are household names, financial services, consulting defense-related businesses, government accounts. So we are very encouraged with the ramp that we're seeing occur to give -- go from 50% at the beginning of the quarter to 56% in occupancy at the end of the quarter, and see a nice uptick in rate is very encouraging to us. So as vaccines continue to be rolled out, we had good news. I guess was just yesterday, that adolescents are now approved for vaccines. So down to children now to 5 years older are eligible to get a vaccine. We think that's very encouraging. We feel that businesses are going to get back to work.  They're going to open their offices. And there is clearly a pent-up demand on the part of businesses to get out on the road and meet people. We're experiencing it ourselves in our offices. The number of folks who want to come by and say hello face-to-face, really is testament to the fact that there's no substitute for in-person communication and in-person collaboration. Sourav, I don't know if you have anything else that we can add at this point in time. Sourav Ghosh : Yeah. Hey, Rich, I can give us some color at least on the BT front as it relates to October, specifically. We do expect October to be the strongest [indiscernible] month for 2021, approximately 6000 room nights was all we have on the books for BT, and that's a 17% increase over September. If you recall, from the beginning of the year from January through July, we had about on average a 30% sequential improvement in BT room nights every single month. We saw a slight increase from July to August, and then a slight dip from August to September. But now we have picked up and back on the trajectory that we had seen early on in the year.  So very encouraged. And as Jim talked about our overall BT rate is actually up 5% quarter-over-quarter, and that's holding strong. As it relates to 2019, we're about call it around 50% of 19 levels as we stand right now and we expect that to continue to improve with every single quarter going forward. Rich Hightower : Perfect. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question is coming from Smedes Rose. Please announce your affiliation then pose your questions. Smedes Rose : Hi, it's Smedes with Citi. Sourav, you gave a lot of specifics around labor and cost ratios, which we'll probably going to look through in more detail. But I guess in general, I just wanted to ask you about the pace of labor costs, particularly for hourly workers, and tying that back to your initial cost savings [Indiscernible] you tell me if this is fair, but it seems that labor, it definitely moves higher than maybe what those -- some of those initial goals were provided. And I'm just wondering if it takes you longer to get said cost-savings target or have you just been able to offset and replaced the cost with other savings? Sourav Ghosh : I'm sure Smith you are breaking up there a little bit, but I think I got your question. On the labor front. What I'll start off with sort of end with $100 million to $150 million that we may have messaged is when we were going into 2020, we were expecting higher than inflationary growth in a few of the Sunbelt markets, and that's obviously pre -pandemic. So as we went through the pandemic there were obviously the rate of acceleration in terms of wage growth in those markets went up. For the portfolios, I can give you some specific numbers here. For the portfolio, I would say, we expect a CAGR from 19% to 22 of about five to 7%. Now I would break that down between urban and Sunbelt markets.  For urban, just given a lot of those are covered under the CBA, that would be around 3% to 4% CAGR from 2019 to 2022. In the Sunbelt, that CAGR would be about 6% to 8%. So again, the overall portfolio we expect that CAGR of 2019 to 2022 to be about 5 to 7. Now, as it relates to the 100 million and 115 million that we messaged, remember that was in relation to 2019 revenues and expenses. So reality is, depending on how quickly we get back to 19 levels of revenue, you can see all that benefit come through to the bottom line, obviously, depending on how much inflationary -- above inflationary growth we see in wages and benefits, it will be shaved off, and that will impact margin going forward. So hopefully that answers your question. Smedes Rose : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Neil Malkin. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question. Neil Malkin : Good morning, everyone. Neil Malkin, Capital One Securities, good to be with you all. Great quarter, great announcements. Jim or Sourav, I thought it was pretty impressive that you were able to keep your occupancy fairly steady through the third quarter despite the vicissitudes of the Delta variant impact on particularly the corporate side of demand. Can you just talk about how you were able to do that? And what things -- leverage you were able to pull or what came in better than expected, that allowed you to maintain those occupancies again, despite the dip in the middle of the quarter from a national level? Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Neil [indiscernible] we're very encouraged with the trend line that we're seeing going forward. And I think one of the most encouraging data points with respect to the second half of the year and the third quarter and the fourth quarter, was the fact that we were able to maintain 1.2 million group room nights on the books, notwithstanding Delta. So it just points out that there's a lot of pent-up demand in the economy, in general, people want to get back out, they want to meet, they want to travel, we have seen a little bit of a pullback as a result of Delta as everyone else did. But as the Delta trend line started to diminish and we got over the peak and new cases, and people saw that we were going in the same direction as countries in other parts of the world were, they got back on the road.  So there's no magic to it. I think one of the -- and we've talked about this a lot. The quality of our assets is really second to none. And the fact that we have continued to invest capital in our portfolio, we think is going to be a true competitive advantage as business really starts to open up. I mean, I said it in my prepared remarks with respect to market share gains as we embarked upon the Marriott transformational Capital Program back in '17 and '18, we underwrote 3 to 5 points, pick up in RevPAR yield index. That was pre -pandemic. Now that we're going to have a portfolio that is largely refreshed, I mean, we have spent $75000 a key on the 21 properties that we referenced, 16 Marriotts and five other assets.  We would expect that we'll continue to see strong performance going forward. And I'm optimistic quite frankly, that we'll pick up more than 3 to 5 points in yield index. So I think it's a combination of the quality of our assets to location of our assets. Our asset managers and enterprise analytics team working very closely with the best in the business. Whether it's Marriott, Hyatt, our independent managers that are out there Just really being very thoughtful about revenue management strategies and yield management strategies in getting business in the hotels while maintaining rate integrity. And I think that's a big -- it's another big story as we open up for business again. This pandemic and post-pandemic has been marked by material yield and ADR integrity as opposed to what happened coming out of the Great Recession. So we're able to truly asset-manage these hotels and revenue -manage them to maximize RevPAR. And I expect we'll continue to do that going forward. Neil Malkin : Thank you and congrats on the quarter. Jim Risoleo : Thanks, Neil. Operator : Your next question is coming from Bill Crow. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question. Bill Crow : Hey, good morning. Jim, Just curious on the group side, I think yesterday Marriott suggested their group revenues on the books for next year are down roughly 20%, and I think you said your pace is down 46%, rate up just a little bit. Is it a locational issue, is it just the big city-wide, or what creates such a big gap between what Marriott was suggesting for their portfolio and you who own a lot of the Marriott group houses? Jim Risoleo : Bill, I don't know if anybody on Host team, I don't know if Sourav listened to the Marriott call. I did not hear what they had to say. But we are at -- for 2022, as we sit here today, we had 54% of our group room nights on the books for next year that we had relative to the same time in 2019 for 2020. So we're encouraged that that number actually ticked up from 50% at the end of our second quarter call to 54% now. So I don't know what Marriott said with respect to pace, but we're actually encouraged.  I mean We have roughly 2.6 million group room nights on the books. And if we looked at the same period of time, quarter three 2019, for quarter three 2020, just to give you some context. And this is what we talked about last quarter. We had 68% of our actuals on the books at that point in time I think the real number to look at is 68 to 54. And That's the gap that we're working really hard to close. Does that answer your question, Bill? Bill Crow : Yeah, thank you. If I could just put a little bit finer point on it. How our New York and San Francisco, in particular, stacking up next year, on a group basis? And then maybe, Sourav, if you could just tell us how much cancellation and attrition fee income was included in the third quarter results that'd be great. Appreciate it. Jim Risoleo : Well, San Francisco is going to have a challenging 2022. There's no question about it. As we look at convention calendars for next year, San Francisco is very challenged. They're down at the bottom of the pack quite candidly. I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that they were the last major city to open their convention center. I mean, they didn't open their Moscone until September of this year. So San Francisco will recover. It's going to take time for San Francisco to recover. With respect to New York, New York is a tough market if you want to talk about city-wise, because they don't have a lot of city-wise in New York City.  And what we're seeing in New York is the return of a lot of affinity groups, a lot of our corporate groups are coming back. And we're very encouraged with what we're seeing in New York, particularly as International Inbound comes back into that market. International Inbound in New York City accounts for about 12% of our business. So again, as the borders open up and it's early, but we are encouraged with what we're seeing in New York. Sourav Ghosh : Hey, before I give you an attrition cancellation number, Bill on the group front, one thing I'll say is we obviously are expecting more in the year for the year bookings in 2022. While yes, pace is lower than what we had in '19 for '20, it's somewhat expected it just to given the skittishness in terms of booking, particularly with the blip that we had with Delta, we do believe a lot of those accounts are going to come out in the sidelines and then book in the year for the year. So we expect in the year for the year activity to be much greater than what we had seen back in 2019.  And also sort of since the start of 2021, just to put in perspective, we booked 600,000 room nights for 23 to 25 and that's like a 20% increase since the start of the year. And if you compare that same time period, the 3 years from 19, that was a 23% for future years. So that we're doing really well. It's a matter of 2022, which we feel will do well in the year for the year. [Indiscernible] Jim Risoleo : Let me add one more data point, Bill, for your benefit. As we look -- because we spent some time looking at citywide for 2022. And if we look at all citywide markets, we have about 89% of -- the citywide calendar equates to about 89% of 2019 citywide. And we have obviously a number of markets that are going to outperform like Minneapolis, San Antonio, Atlanta, Houston, Chicago and Boston. And on down the line with, quite frankly San Francisco being at the bottom of that list. But there's a lot of good news out there as well. And sitting here today at 89%, again, makes us feel pretty good about how things are going to evolve. Sourav, you want to answer the question about attrition cancellation? Sourav Ghosh : Yeah. We recognize $16 million of attrition cancellations for the quarter. Bill Crow : Sixteen, is that what you said? Sourav Ghosh : Yeah, one six, correct? Bill Crow : Yes. Thank you. Thank you both for the time. Operator : Your next question is coming from Thomas Allen, please announce your affiliation then pose your question. Thomas Allen : Morgan Stanley. Sir just thinking about the fourth quarter of the RevPAR trends. You talked about November RevPAR dipping business seasonality than back in December. Can you just help us think about the outlook on versus 2019 level and how you see trends going forward? Sourav Ghosh : So October number is down about 34% to 2019. I'll put this in perspective. I think November, sitting here right now, would get somewhere in the neighborhood of down $5 to $7 from October, and then December, close to October RevPAR. That's what we're thinking, as we said as of today, just based on the data that's available. Thomas Allen : Okay. And then, I mean, typically you haven't given monthly. So is that implying on a versus 2019 level, things are improving as we got through the year, or do you [Indiscernible] and then my follow-up question that I'm going to ask is, the borders are opening next week for more international visitors, are you seeing a material benefit from that and bookings yet or is it too early to tell or too difficult to tell. Thank you. Sourav Ghosh : We have gotten anecdotal commentary on that, speaking with some of our hotels in New York, as well as our San Francisco, I mean, international flight bookings are certainly up 15% since the announcement has taken place. So 6 weeks out from the time of the announcement, the bookings are up 15%. And specifically for San Francisco, that's up 34%, and that compares to what it was 6 weeks before that announcement. So it's encouraging from a hotel's perspective in New York, we've definitely seen a transient pickup and we can attribute pretty meaningful percentage to pick up from Europe specifically. But I don't have any hard numbers yet that I can share. Thomas Allen : All right. Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Dory Keston. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question. Dori Kesten : Thanks. Good morning. Wells Fargo. Now, that you've exited the covenant waiver period for your credit facility, what barriers exists for returning to paying the common dividend? Jim Risoleo : Hi Dori. The barrier than exist is our belief that we will see a sustained recovery and put us in a position when we start paying a dividend again, that we can maintain the dividend and increase the dividend on a regular basis. So we view paying dividend as one of the arrows in the equivalent of capital allocation. Jim Risoleo : and we realized that dividends are important to a lot of our shareholders. Our policy prior to the pandemic was to pay out 100% of our taxable income. As agreed, we have to pay out 90%. And as we see how business returns, and as we can wrap our arms around the pace of the recovery, we will take that into consideration as we think about reinstating the dividend. Dori Kesten : Correct. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Anthony Powell. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question. Anthony Powell : A transaction questions. We haven't got one yet. Just -- the pipeline has been very strong this year, the Big Sur acquisition is attractive. What's the pipeline look like going forward? And as you look at acquisitions going forward, given you exited the covenant waiver, how do you rank incremental debt equity offerings and using your cash balance as sources of funds for those deals? Jim Risoleo : Hey Anthony. The pipeline continues to be vibrant, I would say. As you know, the deals that we've been able to get done this year have been off-market transactions, and that's where we continue to stay focused right now. Because there is a fair amount of competition out there, given that the debt markets are flushed with cash, the CMBS market in particular, flushed with cash and a lot of the private equity firms were sitting on the sideline waiting for the CMBS markets to come back.  So we are starting to see more competition. As we think about sources of capital, we're very, very delighted that we could exit the credit waiver amendment, 3 quarters before exploration. And one of the other data points that we didn't discuss is the fact that we had a debt incurrence test under our bond indenture. As you know, our portfolio is completely unencumbered, so it's all Balance Sheet that and we had a debt incurrence test under our bond indenture that precluded us from getting -- from issuing new debt. Hard to stop until we got back above 1.5 times interest coverage. So we have -- we met that threshold as well. I think it's going to on the margin give us a little more flexibility on the acquisition front. There were several transactions in the market that we worked on last year that had existing debt in place and that debt was prohibitively expensive to break and pay off, so we had to take a pass. But now with the fact that we can acquire assets with that, that gives us another opportunity to look at a few hotels out there that are encumbered with existing financing.  So we're very happy with our cash position. We're happy with the fact that we have come out of the credit waiver amendments 3 quarters early. And between cash on hand and the ability to issue new debt, I think that is the direction you would see us going if we continue to deploy capital into new acquisitions. Anthony Powell : Got it. So the bar is higher for ATM now; is that fair? Jim Risoleo : I think that's very fair. Yes. Anthony Powell : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Chris Woronka. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question. Chris Woronka : Tapes Deutsche Bank. Thanks for all day points, guys, very helpful. Question is, Jim, you guys scheme out a bunch of data on your acquisition date and how much they're beating initial underwriting. And I think that was a comment probably on 2021. Could you just talk about -- if that's correct, could you talk about whether the expectations for future years have also changed? Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Well, Chris, we are in the middle of the budgeting process. So it's a little early to give you specific numbers, but I would venture that give -- coming off the strong base in 2021 that we're seeing it really every deal that we've acquired this year, that 2022 is likely to outperform our underwriting expectations as well. When we -- when we underwrote the acquisitions throughout the course of this year, we were in a very -- period of great uncertainty. We didn't really have a sense on how Delta COVID was going to behave. And when we, when the country was going to be able to get COVID under control. So, long way of saying that we were conservative in our underwriting. And conservative in our underwriting. But as we looked out to, say '23, '24 and beyond, and the financial performance that we baked into these properties, it penciled on an IRR basis and allowed us to pull the trigger and deploy capital. I think that it's going to be meaningfully better across the board. I mean, if you just look at where we put capital and what's happening in these markets, some of the best highest growing -- highest growth markets in the country with meaningful barriers to new supply. If you think about Alila, truly iconic and irreplaceable asset, to be able to buy that at 9.3 times on this year's EBITDA, an asset that is generating $275,000 a key in EBITDA and we're not seeing any slowdown there. The Four Seasons Resort Walt Disney World, we're just starting to see, the benefits of the celebration the 50th anniversary celebration of Walt Disney World that just kicked off in October.  So I expect that we're going to see our performance going forward. And I think that you'll see it across all of the assets we bought that and we're going to continue to see it in our resort portfolio, which is comprised of 16 properties now. And we will see business return to the major urban markets. We've been encouraged there as well this last quarter. Chris Woronka : Okay. Very good. Thanks, Jim. Jim Risoleo : Sure. Operator : Your next question is coming from Chris Darling. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question. Chris Darling : Hi. Good morning. I'm with Green Street. Just going back to the Ventana acquisition for a second. You mentioned 8 times to 10 times stabilized EBITDA multiple by about 2025. But given you're acquiring it at just over 9 times multiple, does that imply that this is really the high watermark for the near-term and you might be expecting a dip in performance over the next couple of years? And then also curious if you could comment on the Terniums of the Hyatt management agreement there? Jim Risoleo : Well, with respect to the terms of Hyatt's management agreement, that's not something that we're in a position to talk about. Chris, I will tell you that the World of Hyatt is doing an incredible job filling that -- filling Alila Ventana and they were getting between 65% and 75% of our room nights through World of Hyatt redemptions. And as a high redemption hotel, we're getting a -- the premium rate. The highest rate that the property is selling rooms for. So at 59 rooms, that gives us the opportunity to really yield manage, to revenue manage the rooms that are not being sold through the World of Hyatt redemption program.  With respect to our stabilized EBITDA multiple, we gave a range of 8 to 10 times. Is 8 doable? I think it is doable. But are we being conservative and throwing a range of 8 to 10 out there? I think that's the way you should think about it. Chris Darling : All right. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is coming from Ari Klein. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question. Ari Klein : Thank you. BMO. Maybe on the disposition, you sold a few post a quarter and, I guess, or importantly, some others that might be on the market. How should we think about asset sales from here? Have you done most of the heavy lifting? Is there anything else that you'd look to sell? Jim Risoleo : Yeah, Ari. I mean, it's -- real estate alert is always good with publishing a rumored acquisition or a rumor disposition. And I'm very glad that on the?5-pack that? they indicated we were going to sell for $500 million and we ended up selling for $551 million. With respect to future dispositions, I think that you should think about our capital allocation strategy, really with one bottom-line goal in mind. Everything that we do is meant to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the portfolio. And if we were to sell other assets, it would be because we believe that we are getting fair value for the assets relative to our whole value, and that by making those dispositions, we can redeploy that Capital either into new acquisitions or into assets that we currently own that are going to grow faster than the rest of the portfolio on average. So as you're thinking about [indiscernible] going forward, I think that's the way -- that's the bottom line. It's all to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio. Ari Klein : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions. I would now like to turn the floor over to Jim for any closing remarks. Jim Risoleo : Well, thank you, everyone. I'd like to thank you all for joining us on our third quarter call. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our quarterly results with you, And I look forward to meeting with many of you, unfortunately, virtually in Nareit next week. We really wanted to have the Nareit meeting in person at the Wind Hotel in Las Vegas, but there wasn't universal support among all the -- REIT teams to meet in an environment where masks are required and they're still required. So for those of you that I don't meet virtually, enjoy the upcoming holiday season. Be well and stay healthy and we, at Host, thank you for your continued support. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. 00:14 At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jaime Marcus, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Jaime Marcus : 00:22 Thank you, and good morning everyone. Before we begin, please note that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. 00:49 In addition, on today's call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and hotel-level results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in yesterday's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and in the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. 01:19 With me on today's call will be Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 01:29 With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Risoleo : 01:34 Thank you, Jaime and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. Despite the uncertainty of COVID-19 variant, we significantly outperformed expectations during the fourth quarter and substantially beat consensus metrics for the year. We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $242 million, which exceeded our interest in capital expenditures by $68 million and achieved adjusted FFO per share of $0.29 during the quarter. 02:06 In addition to delivering positive metrics each quarter, we achieved meaningful sequential increases each quarter throughout 2021. Pro forma total revenues in the fourth quarter grew 20% compared to the third quarter, while pro forma hotel-level operating expenses increased only 15%. RevPAR for the fourth quarter was $148, as volume and rates continued to hold up at our hotels in Sunbelt markets. This is the highest quarterly RevPAR we have seen since the onset of the pandemic, and closes out a year of strong sequential improvements. 02:48 RevPAR improved 13%, compared to the third quarter, despite some softening of demand in late December due to the Omicron variant. Our recent acquisitions, which I will touch on shortly, all contributed to our outperformance during the fourth quarter and are exceeding our underwriting expectations. Preliminary January RevPAR is expected to be approximately $105, a 130% increase over January 2021. Our preliminary February RevPAR forecast is expected to be $150 to $155 and we expect a significant pickup across business segments in March, which is consistent with the recovery we experienced following the Delta variant. 03:38 In addition to delivering significant operational improvements, we continue to be recognized as a global leader in corporate responsibility. Our 2025 emissions target is verified by the Science Based Targets Initiative at the 1.5 degree Celsius ambition level, making Host the first hospitality company and among the first three real estate companies in North America to set emissions reduction targets in line with the Paris agreement's highest level of ambition. 04:11 To complement our environmental targets, we were the first lodging REIT to issue social targets, including two diversity-related targets and one employee engagement target. We also continue to execute on our three strategic objectives, all of which are aimed at elevating the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio. 04:34 As a reminder, our objectives include redefining the hotel operating model with our operators, gaining market share at renovated hotels and strategically allocating capital. As it relates to the last strategic objective, during the fourth quarter we acquired two hotels and sold six hotels. Subsequent to quarter end, we sold one additional hotel. This brings our total early cycle acquisitions to $1.6 billion at a blended 13 times EBITDA multiple, and our dispositions to approximately $1 billion at a 15.4 times EBITDA multiple, including estimated foregone capital expenditures of $290 million. This is a continuation of our strategy to deploy capital into assets that we believe will elevate the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio. 05:31 As a refresher, our 2021 acquisitions included the Hyatt Regency Austin, Four Seasons Orlando at Walt Disney World, Baker's Cay Resort in Key Largo, The Laura Hotel in Houston, Alila Ventana Big Sur, The Alida, Savannah, and Hotel Van Zandt in Austin. We also acquired the Royal Ka'anapali and Ka'anapali Golf Courses in Maui. 06:01 All of our recent acquisitions are performing substantially ahead of our underwriting expectations. For the full-year 2021, EBITDA at our new acquisitions was $37 million higher than the full-year 2021 EBITDA that was estimated at underwriting, which represents a 73% increase, and the golf courses were $4 million higher. 06:29 Turning to our fourth quarter acquisitions. In December, we closed on The Alida, Savannah, a 173-key boutique hotel for approximately $103 million. This newly constructed hotel opened in October 2018 and benefits from soft branding in Marriott's Tribute Portfolio. With no expected near-term CapEx, favorable operating costs and multiple demand drivers, stabilization for The Alida is expected in the 2024 to 2025 timeframe at approximately 11 times to 12 times EBITDA. In addition, in December, we acquired our second hotel in Austin, the Hotel Van Zandt, a 319-key luxury lifestyle hotel for approximately $246 million, including its $4 million FF&E reserve. The acquisition price represents a 13.2 times multiple on 2019 EBITDA. We funded the acquisition with approximately $140 million in proceeds from recent dispositions and assumed approximately $102 million of existing secured debt. 07:49 Located adjacent to Austin's popular Rainey Street entertainment district, this recently constructed hotel opened in 2015 and is poised to benefit from continued large-scale development. We expect the hotel to stabilize at approximately 10 times to 12 times EBITDA in the 2025 to 2027 timeframe. 08:12 On the dispositions front, we sold the 305-key W Hollywood in December for $197 million or 25 times 2019 EBITDA. When calculating the EBITDA multiple, we included $33 million of estimated forgone CapEx over the next five years. This is the third ground lease asset we sold in 2021. In addition, subsequent to quarter end, we sold the 1220-key Sheraton Boston for $233 million or 14.2 times 2019 EBITDA. When calculating the EBITDA multiple, we included $135 million of estimated forgone CapEx over the next five years. In connection with the sale, we are providing a $163 million bridge loan to the purchaser, which we expect will be repaid within its first six month term. 09:11 Looking back on our transaction activity since 2018, we have acquired $3.2 billion of assets at a 14 times EBITDA multiple, and disposed of $4.5 billion of assets at a 17 times EBITDA multiple, including $793 million of foregone CapEx over the next five years. With these transactions, we have dramatically improved the quality of our portfolio. 09:40 Comparing pro forma 2019 results for our current portfolio to 2017, we have increased the RevPAR of our assets by 11%, the EBITDA per key by 20%, and the EBITDA margins by 120 basis points. As we continue to evaluate capital allocation opportunities going forward, our efforts will remain focused on assets that further bolster our EBITDA growth profile. 10:10 As part of our capital allocation efforts, in January we acquired a 49% interest in the asset management platform of Noble Investment Group to cultivate innovative hospitality opportunities within Noble's private fund platform. We invested $90.7 million in its fee-based asset management business, comprising $35 million of cash and $55.7 million of equity, or 3 million operating partnership units which are subject to a one-year lockup period. In the future, we also have the ability to acquire an additional 26% to 51% in Noble, which would bring our aggregate interest to between 75% and 100%. 10:58 In addition, we have made a $150 million LP commitment to the next Noble fund. Based on our current ownership interests, we are targeting average net expected earnings of $7 million to $10 million annually over the next three years. Over the past three decades, Noble has invested nearly $5 billion in acquiring and developing approximately 150 assets in the branded upscale select service and extended stay segments across 84 markets in the U.S. Founded in 1993 by Mit Shah, who remains the CEO, the Noble team has a multi-cycle track record and extensive experience sourcing investment opportunities in real estate and capital markets. 11:48 Our investment represents yet another opportunity to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio by creating a new income source from recurring management and development fees, and allowing for investment and select service hotels, extended stay hotels, and new development opportunities. The partnership will combine Noble's strong track record, development acumen in the select service and extended stay categories, and fund management experience with our scale, market insights, and data analytics to source differentiated investment opportunities. 12:27 By capitalizing on Noble's deep expertise, we will have the ability to incubate and invest in future lodging-adjacent strategies, thereby creating additional paths for long-term strategic value creation. Those strategies include property technology solutions, development, and alternative lodging. We believe a fund vehicle is one of the best ways to gain chain-scale diversification. As Noble's expertise with select service and extended stay hotels will preserve our focus on investing in upper upscale and luxury hotels and resorts. 13:06 Moving on to fourth quarter operations, we continued to close the gap to 2019. Transient demand in the fourth quarter was 82% of 2019 levels, compared to 77% in the third quarter and 58% in the first half of 2021. And we are encouraged that transient rate in each of the four quarters in 2021 exceeded rates in 2019. Our hotels also saw continued improvement in Group during the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, driven by demand growth of 15% and a 17% rate improvement. 13:48 Also bolstering our Group results was the continued meaningful improvement in banquets. Banquet and AV revenue was $150 million in the fourth quarter, up 84% over the third quarter after having doubled from the second quarter to the third quarter. Sourav will get into more detail on business mix in the fourth quarter shortly. 14:14 In addition to successfully deploying capital this year, we continue to focus on our 3 strategic objectives. As a reminder, we are targeting a potential $267 million to $342 million of incremental stabilized EBITDA on an annual basis from the initiatives and projects underlying our strategic objectives. Approximately $120 million is expected to come from the seven acquisitions we completed in 2021. $100 million to $150 million is expected to come from potential long-term cost savings over time, based on 2019 revenues from redefining our operating model with our managers. We have taken steps toward 50% to 60% of these savings to-date. 15:08 Another $22 million to $37 million of incremental stabilized EBITDA is related to our goal of gaining 3 to 5 points of weighted index growth at the 16 Marriott Transformational Capital Program hotels, and eight other hotels where major renovations have been recently completed or are underway. In 2021, we completed three Marriott Transformational Capital Program properties, and subsequent to quarter end we completed two more, bringing the number of completed properties in this program to 12 out of 16. 15:45 In August, we completed the final phase of construction at the New York Marriott Marquis, and in October, we completed the final phase at the Orlando World Center Marriott, closing out both of these three year transformational renovation programs. Other properties completed over the past year includes the Houston Marriott Medical Center, the Marina del Rey Marriott and the Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island. We completed approximately 85% of the program as of year-end, and we expect to substantially complete it by the end of 2022. 16:24 The remaining Marriott Transformational Capital Program properties include Boston Copley, the San Diego Marriott Marquis, Marriott Metro Center, and the JW Marriott in Houston. We expect to receive approximately $11 million in operating profit guarantees under the Marriott Transformational Capital Program in 2022. 16:49 Additionally, this year we added 3 hotels to our list of major renovations. The Western Denver Downtown, Miami Marriott Biscayne Bay, and The Westin Georgetown in Washington DC. Finally, the remaining $25 million to $35 million of incremental stabilized EBITDA over time on an annual basis is expected to come from recently completed and ongoing ROI development projects. These projects are at different stages of renovation and development, and stabilization is expected to occur two to three years after completion. 17:28 To-date, our ROI development projects at the Andaz Maui Villas and the 1 Hotel Beach Club have reduced returns significantly greater than our original underwriting. Our 2022 capital expenditure guidance range is $500 million to $600 million, which reflects our continued focus on reinvesting in our properties during the early phase of the recovery to position our portfolio for future demand. The plan includes $245 million for redevelopment and repositioning projects such as the completion of the Ritz-Carlton Naples beach transformation and tower expansion, a transformational renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani, and completion of the Orlando World Center water park and meeting space expansion. 18:20 It is worth noting that our capital expenditure range at the midpoint is $125 million higher than last year, which is driven by increased investment in ROI development projects, as well as more normalized maintenance CapEx spend. 18:38 To conclude my remarks, we made significant strides towards improving the quality of our portfolio in 2021. Despite the recent volatility, we remain encouraged by the recovery we are seeing across the lodging industry. Our capital allocation efforts over the past few years combined with the geographic diversity of our portfolio and our strong balance sheet leave us very well-positioned to create significant long-term value for our stockholders. 19:09 With that I will now turn the call over to Sourav. Sourav Ghosh : 19:16 Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Following Jim's comments, I will go into detail on our fourth quarter top-line performance, margins, our thoughts for 2022 and provide an update on our balance sheet and dividend. Despite headwinds from two COVID variants, we continued to benefit from quarterly sequential improvements with 70 hotels achieving positive hotel EBITDA for the entire quarter, compared to 61 hotels last quarter. Notably, our three New York City hotels, two downtown Boston Hotels, and the San Francisco Marriott Marquis, all achieved positive EBITDA in the fourth quarter. 19:57 Moving on to top-line performance. Fourth quarter RevPAR was the highest it has been since the onset of the pandemic. In addition, December had its highest monthly ADR in Host history, which is indicative of the quality of our assets and the pricing power of this recovery. While these improvements have been driven by leisure, travel in Sunbelt markets and Hawaii, which saw fourth quarter RevPAR up 16% to $198 over the third quarter, our urban markets continued to deliver sequential operational improvements. During the fourth quarter, our urban markets grew by 13% to a RevPAR of $108, once again representing the best quarter of the recovery for these hotels. 20:46 Turning to business segments. During the fourth quarter, transient revenue improved 7% over the third quarter, driven by a 9% rate increase. Transient revenue at Sunbelt and Hawaii hotels was up 8% sequentially, driven by a 12% improvement in rate and once again exceeded prior peak levels. Drilling down to resorts, our properties grew transient revenue 30% over the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by a 35% increase in rate. 21:20 Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, Alila Ventana Big Sur, one of our recent acquisitions, grew revenue by over 130%, which was driven by a rate increase of 98%. For context, that rate equates to more than a $1,000 increase. All 16 of our resorts had rates 20% higher than the fourth quarter of 2019. Transient rate in our urban and downtown markets was up 7% over the third quarter, with demand also up 1%, which was driven by our hotels in New York and DC. 21:58 Even with Omicron concerns dominating headlines, business transient demand improved by 5% over the third quarter, with rate up 20%. This was driven by significant growth in October, which had the highest amount of business travel room nights of any month since the onset of the pandemic. Nearly half of our business transient rooms sold in the fourth quarter were in urban and downtown markets where demand was up 16% and rate was up 10% over the third quarter. 22:31 Wrapping up on business transient with more encouraging news, we continued to see a return to traditional business travel. In the fourth quarter, our operators' traditional top 10 accounts made up 70% of business transient rooms, which is up from 40% in the third quarter. These accounts are all household names representing a mix of financial services, government contracting, and consulting companies. 22:59 Turning to Group, this segment continued its upward trajectory. We were encouraged by net booking activity in the quarter for the quarter, resulting in 660,000 group rooms sold for the fourth quarter. This level of demand represents 60% of 2019 levels and is up from 52% in the third quarter, putting us at 1.2 million group room nights in the second half of 2021. Group revenue increased 35% over the third quarter, driven by 15% demand growth, combined with a 17% improvement in rate. Most of the room night increase came from Boston, Phoenix, San Diego and San Francisco. 23:45 Corporate group room nights increased 11% over the third quarter with a 23% increase in rate. San Antonio and Phoenix drove most of the demand growth in this sub-segment. In the fourth quarter, corporate group room nights were 55% of 2019, compared to 29% for the first half of 2021. Association groups also showed steady sequential improvements. Fourth quarter association group room nights increased 19% over the third quarter, with a 15% increase in rate, largely driven by our hotels in San Diego. Association group room nights were 45% of 2019 in the fourth quarter, compared to only 11% for the first half of 2021. 24:33 Looking forward to our expectations for Group in 2022, we currently have 2.8 million definite group room nights on the books, which compares favorably to the 2.5 million group room night we would have had on the books as of the third quarter, after adjusting for recent acquisitions and dispositions. Group rates in 2022 remains up 1% to 2019 and group demand is currently front-loaded with roughly 60% of definite group rooms booked in the first half of the year. 25:10 Last quarter, we provided a comparison to 2019 group room nights. At that time, our definite group room nights on the books represented 54% of 2019 actuals. Adjusted for our transactions and including bookings from the fourth quarter, 2022 definite group room nights now stand at 60% of 2019 actuals. And total group revenue pace is down just 20% to 2019, which is an additional testament to the quality of our portfolio and the strength of the lodging recovery. 25:46 Moving onto expenses. Proforma total hotel operating costs rose by 15% during the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, despite a 20% increase in total revenues. Variable expenses were down 30% relative to a total revenue decline of 25% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Through February of last year, variable expense declines were roughly in line with revenue expense decline, but this trend diverged as hotels struggled to staff up at the pace of demand growth. Our managers' hiring efforts were successful in the fourth quarter, and the differential between our variable expense decline and the revenue decline narrowed compared to the third quarter. Fixed expenses including wages and benefits were 19% lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 and 9% higher than last quarter. We continue to see savings from reductions in Above Property services, which were still down substantially to 2019. 26:51 As expected, on-property sales efforts are ramping up, which offset some of the expense savings in the quarter. Our hotel EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter was 26.9%, which is just about 80 basis points below that of the fourth quarter 2019. When you consider that our revenue is still 25% below its fourth quarter 2019 level, our margins are quite impressive. Given increased levels of staffing and fixed costs that were re-introduced in the second half of 2021, fourth quarter margin strength was primarily a result of higher resort rates, better than anticipated food and beverage revenue, and elevated cancellation revenues. 27:39 Turning to our outlook for 2022, we are still unable to provide operational guidance given the continued volatility surrounding COVID. That said, we expect sequential quarterly RevPAR improvements driven by demand growth across our portfolio and continued rate strength at our resorts. We also expect group and business transient to continue improving in our urban and downtown markets, as impacts from future COVID variants lessen, company's return to the office, and traditional groups get back to meeting in person. 28:12 As a reminder, Easter is much later this year, so some of the pickup we would normally get at the end of the first quarter could bleed into the second quarter. Although we are not able to provide operational guidance, we would like to provide expected ranges for our corporate G&A and interest expense. For the full year, we anticipate corporate G&A to be in the $103 million to $106 million range and we anticipate our interest expense to be in the $146 million to $149 million range. From a timing perspective, we expect these expenses to be relatively evenly spread over each quarter in 2022. 28:56 Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity position. As we discussed last quarter, we were able to exit our credit facility covenant waiver period three quarters ahead of its expiration. And we achieved compliance with our bond indenture debt incurrence covenant. As a result, we were able to refinance a portion of our existing bonds with $450 million of new Series J green bonds at a 2.9% coupon, the lowest in the company's history. We also extended our weighted average maturity from 4.2 years to 5.1 years, lowered our weighted average interest rate to 3.1% and pushed our next maturity out to early 2024. 29:41 In addition, during the fourth quarter and subsequent to quarter end, we paid down our outstanding revolver in full. Together, these actions will save us an estimated $5 million per quarter in interest expense. Pro forma for the revolver paydowns and the sale of the Sheraton Boston earlier this month, we now have $1.8 billion in total available liquidity comprised of approximately $200 million of cash, $144 million of FF&E reserves, and full availability of our $1.5 billion credit facility. 30:21 Wrapping up, I am pleased to share that the Board of Directors authorized a first quarter dividend of $0.03 per share on Host common stock. All future dividends are subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors, but as the operational recovery continues, we expect to be able to grow our dividends to a sustainable level. To conclude, we are extremely proud of our achievements over the past year. 2021 showed that a sustained recovery is underway and we are optimistic that 2022 will continue to build on the strong momentum of the past few quarters. We remain very well-positioned to execute on our goal of increasing the EBITDA growth profile and improving the quality of our portfolio. 31:09 With that we would be happy to take your questions. To ensure we have time to address as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : 31:22 Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Smedes Rose. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question. Smedes Rose : 31:54 Hi, it's Smedes with Citi. I was just wondering, Jim and Sourav, if you could just talk a little bit about the staffing levels you have achieved in your hotels. It sounds like demand is coming back faster than expected, and kind of where are you on being able to re-staff and maybe throw out your thoughts on just kind of what the pace of kind of wage and benefit increases should be over the course of '22? Jim Risoleo : 32:19 Sure, Smedes, I'll take the first part of it, Sourav can take the second part of it. We added about 1,000 positions in the fourth quarter. And as you may recall, on the Q3 call we stated that the staffing levels were 94% of our managers is our goal. Typically, they run to about 97%, they never get to parity, they're never at 100%. With the increase in business volume in the fourth quarter, even though we added a 1,000 positions, we still remain at about 94%. But I can tell you based on conversations we have had with our managers, there is a degree of confidence that the open positions are going to be able to be filled as things open up, as the variant gets behind us, as children get back to school in person across the country, and as the various forms of stimulus burn off, which many of them already have. 33:29 So with that, I'll let Sourav talk about our point of view around wage -- wage increases and inflation. Sourav Ghosh : 33:38 Hey, Smedes. For 2022, we were expecting year-over-year increase wage rates of somewhere around 4% to 4.5%. And this is in line with sort of what we had spoken about in terms of the 19 to 22 CAGR you might recall, which we said would be somewhere around 5% to 7% in aggregate for our portfolio. Smedes Rose : 34:01 Okay, thank you. Operator : 34:06 Your next question is coming from Bill Crow. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question. Bill Crow : 34:13 Hey, good morning guys. Raymond James. I do have a follow-up for you, Jim, but let me start with Sourav. In just thinking about the transition from '21 to '22 on a couple of line items, if you could just quantify the total support that you got from Marriott, whether it's the transformational capital program or other performance guarantees in 2021? And what your expectations are for that in 2022? And I think Jim you mentioned $11 million on the transformational side. 34:47 And then the second part of that Sourav is the -- I think you have talked about $40 million of cancellation and attrition fees in the second half of 2021. How much of a drag is that on margins as you try and replace that with actual business? Sourav Ghosh : 35:08 Sure. So, to answer the first part of your question, yes, for 2022 the amount that we are getting from Marriott in terms of the operational profit guarantee, that is $11 million. That compares to about $14 million that we got for -- in 2021. As it relates to the attrition and cancellation revenue, to put into perspective, we did approximately $20 million of attrition and cancellations revenue. We collected that in the fourth quarter. And when we compare that to 2019, it's only $5 million above that. Actually, when you look at the full-year in terms of attrition and cancellations revenue, it is very similar to what we collected in '19, which is about sort of $55 million or so. 36:02 What's different is the way we got there. The mix of the attrition, cancellation revenue that we collected is different. As business starts coming back, we expect obviously the group cancellation revenues to reduce. However, there should be a pickup in transient cancellation revenue. So, from an overall cancellation revenue mix perspective, that we expect to change as we normalize throughout this year, but when you look at sort of just comparing '19 to '21, total cancellation revenues, they are actually pretty similar in terms of total that was collected. Bill Crow : 36:37 All right, that is helpful. And Jim, I said I was going to have a follow-up. I am going to play devil's advocate for a second. You suggested that the Noble investment was an efficient way to gain diversification across more chain scale. So I think it was -- I am paraphrasing obviously, but is that something that investors have asked for from Host, because you have done a really good job of just kind of concentrating on these wonderful top 40 or maybe it is top 50 assets now. And I am just wondering what drove you to think about that diversification? Jim Risoleo : 37:13 Sure, Bill. I\u2019m happy to answer the question. It is not something we have heard of -- heard from investors quite frankly. But as we think from a strategy perspective, and playing the long game here, how can we transform the income stream of the company to make it more sustainable going forward. And one of the things that has always been of interest to us is the fund management business. So we talked a lot about strategy among the senior team and with our Board, about really three things that Noble checks the box for us on. Fund management, how do we play in select service without it becoming a distraction and without it really, if you will, muddying up our story. And we have a lot of expertise on the development side as well. We have a really solid design and construction group, I think they are best in class, far and away with some of the projects that you have seen in some of the projects that we have completed. 38:30 So as we sat back and thought about those three objectives, the best way to accomplish that is through an off-balance sheet vehicle, and Noble we think is also best in class. So investing in the Noble platform gives us the ability over time to grow a sustainable fee stream that is not subject to the cyclicality of the lodging industry. It is commitment fees, it is asset management fees, it is development fees. 39:04 It gives us an opportunity to further deploy capital into the select service space without, again, it becoming a distraction for the management team at Host. Mit Shah and his team have been in business since 1993. They have invested over $5 billion and they have a very strong track record. 39:28 So again, select serve, the way they have done it is a very attractive investment from our perspective and we've made $150 million commitment to his next fund. And lastly, having the ability to participate in development projects in an off-balance sheet structure is also something that is very attractive to us. That is not something we ever wanted to do on our balance sheet, it is not conducive to the REIT model. So it is just another opportunity to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the company in a way that it is not going to be a distraction, but is going to bring two very, very successful best-in-class organizations together. Bill Crow : 40:19 Great. I appreciate the answers. Operator : 40:24 Your next question is coming from Floris Van Dijkum. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question. Floris Van Dycom : Hi, it is Floris at Compass Point. A question, Jim, and maybe if you can touch on this, and I guess I'll -- it is more regarding to the valuation of hotels. And I saw, number one, you have sold 3 ground leases, you have got some more ground leases. I don't think you are going to sell any of the San Diego ground-leased hotels, but maybe if you can -- which other hotels might be on the block? And also talk about -- maybe if you can touch on, I noticed the 1 Hotel had $68 million of hotel EBITDA this past year. How does that compare to pre-COVID levels? And how sustainable -- the one fear that we hear from some investors is, well, gee, these resort hotels are -- have really strong EBITDA today, but could that fall off? How sustainable is the EBITDA from your top resort hotels and maybe talk about -- a little about the growth prospects for those assets? Jim Risoleo : 41:39 Floris, there is an awful lot in that one question, so let me see if I can take it apart for you a little bit. I will start with the -- your question regarding what other hotels might be on the block and how are we thinking about ground leases. We sold three ground lease hotels, probably not -- we are not going to sell the Manchester Grand Hyatt or the San Diego Marina Marriott. I will just say that, any time we think about an acquisition or a disposition, overshadowing that conversation is, will it elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the portfolio? And that really is our baseline as we sit down and look at, okay, is this asset going to grow below, at average, or above the rest of the portfolio at Host. 42:36 So that is the gating issue for us. And there are some -- not all ground leases are created equal. The ground leases associated with the San Diego properties or with the Port of San Diego, they have I think a 65-year maximum term, but every time you invest capital in your assets, you are able to extend the ground lease up to that 65-year term limit. So, not so with others that are in private hands. And if it makes sense for us to dispose of assets that have ground leases, that we will certainly do that and replace those -- recycle that capital either into additional acquisitions or into additional ROI projects as we are undertaking this year and as we have been undertaking. Again, just to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the company. 43:37 With respect to the 1 Hotel in particular, I actually went through the supplemental myself yesterday and when I saw that $68 million number, I had to do the math, is that 8.8 times EBITDA on our purchase price. And when we underwrote that deal, we were at 13 times EBITDA. And in the first year, I think we came in at around 12.5 times. So yes, the asset has performed extremely well. We could not be happier. We believe that the strong leisure demand that we have seen during COVID is certainly sustainable for all of 2022. There may be some moderating and tempering of the rate that we can charge at some of our resort properties in '23 and '24 as international markets open and as American citizens want to travel abroad again. But don't forget, when that happens, international citizens are going to be coming to the U.S. at a market like Miami in particular, is a gateway leisure market for international travel. 44:54 So we are optimistic going forward. The other interesting data point with respect to our 16 resorts is that, they are up more than 20% in ADR over 2019. So we have had extremely strong performance, we have had no pushback from consumers, the properties are all in terrific shape. If they need to have capital invested in them, we will certainly invest the capital, so that we can continue to drive outsized rates. Floris Van Dycom : 45:27 Thanks, Jim. Operator : 45:32 Your next question is coming from Neil Malkin. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question. Neil Malkin : 45:39 Hey, everyone. It's Neil Malkin, Capital One Securities. I was hoping you could talk about the kind of operating model that was one of the things that you said are -- is one of the three facets that you are working on to improve the company and grow EBITDA, et cetera. I believe, yesterday Hilton talked about I think 400 basis points and 600 basis points in terms of the model or the margins. I was just hoping maybe you could give some insight as we begin a little bit further past COVID and you have kind of hammered out more of the brand-standard enhancements. Does that 100 to 150 number or whatever that equates to in basis points, does that seem low now? And do you think given the things you have seen with staffing and efficiencies and ADRs and things like that, that may wind up being low and that sort of the previously disseminated margin improvements are going to wind up being light of what is actually going to happen? Sourav Ghosh : 46:53 Hey, Neil, it is Sourav. So, I think the way to think about it in terms of the margin expansion, it really will be driven by how quickly we get back to 2019 levels of revenue, right? So the $100 million to $150 million, we are still very, very confident we can deliver that in incremental EBITDA based on 2019 numbers. But all depends on when we get back to the revenue. And frankly, if we get back via rate first, which it looks like we will, obviously you benefit more on the margin front as a result of that. So yes, there is definitely possibility that you end up getting more of a margin expansion as a result of coming back to '19 levels via rate. 47:33 As it relates to where we stand on our initiatives, we talked about it in sort of three big buckets. One is the reduction of management staffing at all our hotels, and it was very hotel specific. We went through every single hotel on sort of zero-based budget and figured out what the ideal staffing level is on -- at a normalized level. And I am happy to report that we had said about 25% to 30% of management staffing would be reduced permanently and that it has been the case, and that is baked into our 2022 budgets. 48:05 The second big bucket was reduction in Above Property charges, which if you listened to the Marriott call, that has also resulted in savings and can -- will continue to result in savings. That is also baked in. The last bucket was sort of twofold. One, as you said, is the modification or elimination of certain brand standards, and then also leveraging technology to drive improved productivity. I will say, of the $100 million to $150 million, 60% we have already initiated, and we are well underway to initiate the balance 40%, which is really the third bucket of brand standards and technology implementation. 48:46 On the brand standards piece, there are a lot of changes that have already taken place, whether that is removal of compendiums or it is making the long stocks optional or relaxation of robes and slipper standards at the premium brands, and including flexibility of operating hours for the club lounge. Minimum hours that are not only for the club lounge but also premium restaurant, as well as relaxation of whether you need premium restaurants at non-resort hotels. So we have made significant progress on the brand standard front. I think the piece which we are still testing right now is housekeeping, and we will have an answer on that sometime middle of this year, but certainly not going back to where we were in 2019. It is really about providing more optionality and flexibility to the guest, but still making sure there is that guest satisfaction level that is needed for the respective brands. So hopefully that gives you some color. Neil Malkin : 49:47 Yeah. Appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : 49:53 Your next question is coming from Jay Kornreich. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question. Jay Kornbrekke : 50:01 Hey, it is Jay Kornreich with SMBC Nikko. Great to be on the call. With the return of office inflection point likely now underway, which we expect to lead to a strong recovery in BT demand, and you indicated seeing settlement in February, do you consider getting I guess more aggressive in shifting your acquisition pipeline to focus more on dense urban markets to get ahead of that instead of the resort and Sunbelt strategy over the past year? Jim Risoleo : So, Jay, your question is, are we going to move to where the puck's going or where the puck has already been. Right? In the words of Wayne Jay Kornbrekke : 50:43 Correct. Jim Risoleo : 50:46 As we think about acquisition opportunities, I will say a couple of things. We don't have a red line through any market in the United States today. And nor do we have a red line to any property type. However, we have not seen a lot of opportunities in the major urban markets to date. And we did have a keen focus last year on Sunbelt and resort markets. Even if we were to deploy capital into the major urban markets, assuming we could find the right asset at the right pricing and it worked for us, I think the demographics of the nation are such that we will continue to deploy capital in Sunbelt markets for a lot of reasons. Just the inflows of business, the inflows of people, the favorable operating environment, the low cost structure, it makes those markets attractive to us. 51:55 In resorts today, we own 16 resorts. If the -- if you look at supply statistics, the lowest level of new supply in the nation is in the resort market. And the second-lowest level of new supply is in the big box hotels, many of which we own. So we are very comfortable in both of those areas. And as opportunities become available, we will certainly evaluate them. There just hasn't been anything in the market that has been of interest to-date. Jay Kornbrekke : 52:33 Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks so much. Operator : 52:39 Your next question for today is coming from Stephen Grambling. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question. Stephen Grambling : 52:46 Hi, it's Stephen with Goldman Sachs. Maybe a follow-up on the urban market question, are you seeing any change in the supply backdrop in these markets given how long some of these assets have effectively stated in a negative EBITDA? And would that potentially be a catalyst for you may be shifting back into those markets -- shifting back but maybe refocusing there? Jim Risoleo : 53:12 Yes, Stephen, I -- supply has taken a material hit in a lot of the markets around the country. I think that CBRE and SGR are projecting supply growth at just over 1% through at least 2023. The total pipeline is down something like 8% of pre-pandemic levels, and there are a lot of projects out there but they are just languishing right now. The most comforting statistic around supply is the in-construction pipeline is now about 25% to pre-pandemic levels. So the supply situation is -- we can't paint a broad brush with it. The lowest supply markets are Hawaii, San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle. 54:07 Unfortunately, there is still a lot of supply coming online in New York. And I think we are going to see that happen over the course of '22 and even '23 and there is a lot of supply coming online in Los Angeles. So there are some hotels that are not going to reopen in San Francisco and in New York, but it is nothing like the talk early in the pandemic about a massive shift of hotel inventory coming out of the market. So, again, market-specific, asset-specific, pricing-specific, but we will continue to explore opportunities again with the sole objective in mind being elevating the EBITDA growth profile of the company. Stephen Grambling : 55:04 Helpful. Thanks. I will jump back in the queue. Operator : 55:10 Your next question is coming from Robin Farley. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question. Robin Farley : 55:17 Thanks. Yes, it is Robin Farley with UBS. A lot of my questions have been answered. I guess, just maybe one more follow-up on the transaction environment. Just given you had a great track record of transactions last year, just with kind of a more recovered market out there, interest rates moving up, I guess it's -- how much opportunity -- how would you compare the environment generally in terms of opportunity for transactions compared to where it was in the second half of last year? 55:47 And if you can remind us if there is a certain dollar amount that you have to spend on acquisitions this year, like as a result of 1031 exchanges or anything like that we should keep in mind too? Thanks. Jim Risoleo : 56:00 Yes, Robin, that the second part of your question regarding certain dollar amount, there is not. We have been able to like trying to exchange our sales proceeds really reverse like kind of exchange or so, sales proceeds into the acquisitions that we did last year. Most recently, the sale of the Sheraton Boston into the Hotel Van Zandt, so we are in a very good place with respect to no pressure to buy assets to protect the 1031 exchange issue. 56:39 I think what happened with the Omicron variant coming to light in December, typically, we would see a strong pipeline of assets at the ALIS Conference, which was held third week in January this year. I did not -- we as a company, that my team did not hear of a lot of acquisitions in the market today. We think people have pulled back as a result of Omicron and just wanted to wait and see what the impact was on hotel performance. And as we have said, $105 RevPAR in January, $150 to $155 RevPAR in February, a strong bounce back. So I would expect that we will see more properties come to market in the second half of the year. 57:37 But at this point in time, there just aren't that many assets out there we are interested in. And I might remind you that of the seven assets we bought last year, five of them we purchased off market. So we are going to continue to have conversations with owners of hotels that are of interest to us. Robin Farley : 58:02 Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks very much. Operator : 58:08 Your next question is coming from Anthony Powell. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question. Anthony Powell : 58:14 Hi, it is Anthony Powell from Barclays. Just a question on the dividend which was a nice surprise. How did you get to the $0.03 quarterly number? You didn't have to pay dividend given your NOL, so I am curious, how should we expect the dividend to trend over the next several quarters? Do you look at percentage of FFO, cash flow? Just more detail would be super helpful. Sourav Ghosh : 58:35 Sure, Anthony. No magic number that we sense. It really is what we are comfortable paying based on the recovery trajectory that we are seeing. It will all depend frankly on how that operational recovery pans out. And obviously our goal is to grow that dividend and get it to a sustainable level. But $0.03 is what we are comfortable with for the first quarter, we will see how operations shape up and what happens in subsequent quarters. We will obviously be authorized by our Board of Directors. Anthony Powell : 59:10 So it could go up here even in the short-term if things continue to improve. Is that a fair assumption? Sourav Ghosh : 59:16 That is fair. Anthony Powell : 59:19 Okay. All right, great. Thank you. Great quarter. Sourav Ghosh : 59:21 Thanks. Operator : 59:24 Your next question for today is coming from Ari Klein. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question. Ari Klein : 59:31 Thanks. Ari Klein with BMO. Maybe on the CapEx front, the Marriott Transformation Program wraps up this year and some CapEx may be assets that have been sold, is the $400 million to $500 million ex-Marriott kind of the right way to think about CapEx beyond 2022? And what are some of the major ROI projects that are being contemplated beyond this year? Jim Risoleo : 59:56 Sure. Let me start with a couple of the major ROI projects that are in that number. And I do want to emphasize that of the CapEx guidance we have given, $200 million is related to two major ROI projects that we believe will develop very -- deliver very attractive returns, double-digit cash on cash returns on the money we are putting into them. And the first is the Ritz-Carlton in Naples, it is a complete transformation of that asset. Every part of the resort, which is just a terrific hotel on the beach in Naples, Florida, is being touched. We are increasing the room count from 450 rooms to 474 rooms and we are combining 100 keys at that property, just to give you some color, to allow us to enhance the suite count from 35 suites to 92 suites. We are building a 74-key new tower and we are building a new club lounge that is frankly 6 times the size of the existing club. 61:15 Why is that important? For context, club rooms get an average annualized ADR premium in excess of $220, and we just didn't have the space at that property to sell the number of club rooms that the demand would warrant, so we are very excited about the things we are doing at Naples. Additionally, we are building a new swimming pool, a new pool bar, and completely redoing the lobby. This is anticipation in part -- a couple of things, that number one, focus groups' work that we did indicated that it was time to really update this property. It had been built in 1985, and really the bathrooms in particular needed to be updated and we went from 3-fixture bathrooms to either 4 or 5 fixture bathrooms throughout the entire hotel. We wanted to get ahead of the opening of the new Four Seasons down the road, which is about three years out, so we will be in very good shape. 62:20 Another asset that we are investing in in a meaningful way, a transformational way is the Fairmont Kea Lani on the island of Maui, Wailea. Again, another terrific resort that we think is going to develop -- going to deliver double-digit returns, double-digit cash on cash returns on our repositioning, and that is roughly $120 million, and allow us to better compete with the Four Seasons which is adjacent to the property. 62:51 So that is how we think about CapEx. We have I think this year, as I mentioned in my -- in my remarks, that we are going to, in addition to finishing up the Marriott Transformational Capital Program, we are going to complete and reposition three other properties, the Westin in Denver, the Westin in Georgetown, and the Miami Biscayne Bay Marriott. All expected to meaningfully increase yield index as a result of the capital that we are investing. So we are well on the way, we are excited about a 3 to 5 point gain in the yield index. We think actually that we are going to do better than that because that 3 to 5 point gain that we have messaged, a 3-point index is $22 million. Those numbers were developed pre-pandemic, and over the course of the pandemic, we had been investing in our assets. 63:58 Again, it is one of our 3 strategic objectives to gain market share. And we feel very confident that as business returns, that our assets are going to meaningfully outperform the competition because those assets, A, either haven't been invested in, or they are going to have to be taken out of service, and there is going to be attendant disruption. So stay tuned on that front. Ari Klein : 64:26 Thanks for the color. Operator : 64:31 Your next question is coming from Chris Woronka. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question. Chris Woronka : 64:40 Hey, it is Chris from Deutsche Bank. Thanks for taking the question. Jim, as you guys think about the new cost structure that you have put in place and I understand still trying to hire some employees to fill it out, but we don't know exactly yet where all the brand standards are going to fall, right, on housekeeping and things like that by brand and price point. So the question is, is this going to be an evolving situation or do you think -- you think the brands get to a point where they say, this is the standard, we are going with it, and hire employees as needed? Just trying to get a sense for whether there is any kind of latent risk that we are going to end up with more labor than we thought we might need a year from now. Jim Risoleo : 65:31 So, let me start the answer, Chris, and then I would like Sourav to jump in as well, because he has been having the conversations at the brand level. We started having conversations on brand standards pre-COVID. So it is not something that the initiative wasn't undertaken just as a result of the pandemic, but it was something that we had conversations with our major managers on -- in 2018 actually, and 2019. It is very clear now that there is no one brand standard, that it's all hotels. Both of our major managers have seen significant reductions in headcount at their headquarters, which really impacts Above Property cost and expenses. So I think we feel very confident that we are not going to see creep coming back in. 66:46 With that said, I will let Sourav jump in and maybe even talk about some of the more recent conversations we have had. Sourav Ghosh : 66:55 Yes, I would echo what Jim said, I don't think there is any risk in terms of the creep coming back, and we have confidence in that. And when you look at sort of our success in expanding margin pre-COVID, which was pretty meaningful, we really did separated ourselves from our peers on the margin front, it was because we didn't let cost creep come back. And this time around, like I was saying earlier, we have zero-based everything for every single hotel. It is the first time we have the opportunity, because a lot of hotels just spend on their operations, for management team to really take a step back, work very closely with our asset management and enterprise analytics teams to come up with what the ideal -- really operating model should be and staffing levels should be at once things get back to normalized levels. 67:46 So for anything that gets added back, there is an approval process it needs to go through, and unless there is truly an ROI associated with that position being added back, we certainly do not approve it. So we are pretty confident that if there is any position added back, there is going to be a return associated with it. Otherwise, it is not going to be added back. Chris Woronka : 68:09 Okay, very helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : 68:16 Your final question for today is coming from Rich Hightower. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question. Rich Hightower : 68:23 Hey, good morning, guys. Evercore ISI. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess just to maybe play devil's advocate for one second here on the dividend, at least over the long-term. I mean, certainly in the short-term I totally understand a nominal dividend for sort of technical factors in terms of who can own the stock and so forth, but given that we are as early into the new cycle as we are, there is a lot of investment opportunities probably coming down the pike. You have got significant NOLs that will probably shield you from having to pay a significant dividend for several years. 69:00 So what is the thought about paying more than a penny than you have to pay once cash flows sort of stabilize? Why focus on the dividend? Do you think investors really care about it at the end of the day? Sourav Ghosh : 69:16 Hey, Rich. One thing I want to make sure is clear is, we did not have a significant amount of NOLs at the REIT level. Majority of our NOLs is at the TRS level. So therefore, the question doesn't arise of shielding sort of our taxable income with NOLs at the REIT level. The REIT-level NOLs that we did have, we effectively plan to use if there is any gain on sale, and to offset that. So it is -- I just want to make sure that is clear, so whenever taxable income is going to be generated, we will be paying that off -- paying that out as dividend. So I just want to make sure that is clear, Rich. Rich Hightower : 69:56 Yes, that is helpful. Yes, thanks for that. And then just more broadly then, just in terms of the opportunity landscape relative to the dividend, not that they have to be mutually exclusive by any means. Jim Risoleo : 70:09 Yeah, Rich. I don't think they are mutually exclusive. If you look at the quantum of cash that goes out with the $0.03 dividend, it is $21 million order of magnitude. Annualize that times four, it is $80 million, so there is a subset of investors that aren't unable to -- we are not able to own our stock. And we have the balance sheet, we have confidence in the recovery and we want to give everyone an opportunity to participate in that recovery, which is one of the reasons why we reinstated the dividend at $0.03. Rich Hightower : 70:57 All right. Got it, guys. Thanks for the color. Operator : 71:04 That is all the time we had for questions today. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Jim for any closing comments. Jim Risoleo : 71:12 Well, I would like to thank everyone for joining us on our fourth quarter call today, we appreciate the opportunity to discuss our quarterly results with you. I look forward to meeting with many of you at in-person conferences in the coming weeks and months. Be well and stay healthy, and thank you for your continued support. Operator *: 71:36 Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jaime Marcus, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Jaime Marcus : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, please note that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and hotel-level results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in yesterday's earnings press release and our 8-K filed with the SEC and in the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. With me on today's call will be Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Risoleo : Thank you, Jaime, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. We kicked off the first quarter of 2022 with meaningful outperformance and once again substantially beat all consensus metrics for the quarter. We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $306 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.39 during the quarter. All owned hotel pro forma EBITDA of $330 million in the first quarter, was just 18% below 2019, and March pro forma hotel EBITDA came in 8% above 2019 driven by significant rate growth at our resorts. Pro forma total revenues in the first quarter increased 10% sequentially over the fourth quarter, while pro forma hotel level operating expenses grew 5%. The increase in revenues was driven by improvements across rooms, F&B and other departments. Pro forma RevPAR for the first quarter was $167 an 11% improvement from the fourth quarter as rates continue to increase in our Sunbelt markets and hold up at our urban hotels. This is the highest quarterly RevPAR we have seen since the onset of the pandemic, bringing our RevPAR to approximately 18% below first quarter 2019 levels. Our recent acquisitions, dispositions and renovated properties continued to contribute to our performance during the first quarter and notably, we had five hotels with ADRs of over $1,000. Preliminary April RevPAR is expected to be approximately $225 to $230 which is up slightly to our March RevPAR. It is worth pointing out that our preliminary April monthly RevPAR represents the first time that our monthly RevPAR is expected to exceed 2019 levels since the onset of the pandemic. However, consistent with historical monthly trends, we expect to see a pullback in May and June relative to 2019 levels. In addition to Maui and San Diego, we are pleased to see urban markets such as New York, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco, driving the outperformance to our forecast. In short, all business segments and markets are trending in a positive direction, and we are very pleased with our performance. Subsequent to quarter end, we sold the 1,780 Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel for $373 million or 28 times 2019 EBITDA. When calculating the EBITDA multiple, we included $136 million of estimated foregone CapEx over the next five years. In connection with the sale, we are providing a $250 million bridge loan to the purchaser. In addition, we sold a 243 key hotel Eve Miami for $50 million, including $1 million for the FF& E replacement funds or 23.2 times 2019 EBITDA. When calculating the EBITDA multiple, we included $9.5 million of estimated foregone CapEx over the next five years. This brings our 2021 to 2022 year-to-date total dispositions to approximately $1.4 billion at a blended 17.8 times EBITDA multiple including estimated foregone capital expenditures of $435 million, which compares favorably to our $1.6 billion of acquisitions at a blended 13 times EBITDA multiple. Our 2021 acquisitions continued to perform substantially ahead of our underwriting expectations. Based on first quarter performance, EBITDA from our seven new hotel acquisitions in two golf courses, is on track to meaningfully outperform our underwriting expectations. Looking back on our transaction activity since 2018, we have acquired $3.2 billion of assets at a 14 times EBITDA multiple and disposed of $4.9 billion of assets at a 17 times EBITDA multiple, including $938 million of foregone capital expenditures over the next five years. Comparing pro forma 2019 results for our current portfolio to 2017, we have increased the RevPAR of our assets by 11%, EBITDA per key by 25%, EBITDA margins by 190 basis points and avoided considerable business disruption associated with capital projects over the past two years. As we continue to evaluate capital allocation opportunities, our efforts will remain focused on assets that have the potential to bolster our EBITDA growth profile. Turning to first quarter operations. Our total portfolio pro forma revenue was up 10% sequentially to the fourth quarter, driven by 16% rate growth. Transient revenue was up over 1% compared to the fourth quarter and rate was up 18%. Putting this into perspective, first quarter transient room revenue was 97% of first quarter 2019. Transient was again driven by our Sunbelt and Hawaiian hotels, where revenue was up 17% sequentially with a 21% improvement in rate. And once again exceeded prior peak levels for the fourth quarter in a row. Drilling down to resorts, outperformance continued as ADR grew by 48%, leading to a transient revenue increase of 42% compared to 2019. Our 1 Hotel South Beach and Four Seasons, Orlando grew transient revenue over $10 million each with ADR up 60% to 2019. Group business continued to improve at our hotels during the first quarter. Group revenue was up 33% and driven fairly equally by rate and demand growth compared to the fourth quarter. Despite a weak January, we were encouraged by net booking activity in the quarter for the quarter which resulted in 682,000 group rooms sold for the quarter. We saw meaningful improvement in banquet and AV revenue as group business continued to return. In the first quarter, banquet and AV revenue increased by $24 million, up 17% over the fourth quarter. As groups get back to in-person meetings, we expect the trend of higher out-of-room spend to continue. Looking forward to our expectations for group in 2022, we currently have 3 million definite group room nights on the books, which compares favorably to the 2.7 million group room nights we had on the books for 2022 as of the fourth quarter after adjusting for our recent dispositions. Group rate in 2022 is up 4% to the first quarter of 2019, a 300 basis point increase over the last quarter, with 1 million definite group room nights on the books in the second quarter. This represents 82% of second quarter 2019 actual group room nights. Last quarter, our 2022 definite group room nights on the books represented 60% of 2019 actuals. Adjusted for our transactions and including bookings from the first quarter, 2022 definite group room nights now stand at approximately 70% of 2019 full year actuals. For the remainder of the year, 2022 definite group room night pace is down 14% to 2019, while total group revenue pace is down just 8% to 2019. So Rob will get into more detail on business mix and markets in a few minutes. In addition to delivering significant operational improvements, we continue to execute on our three strategic objectives, all of which are aimed at elevating the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio. As a reminder, our objectives include redefining the hotel operating model with our operators, gaining market share at hotels through comprehensive renovations and strategically allocating capital to development ROI projects. As a reminder, we are targeting a range of $147 million to $222 million of incremental stabilized EBITDA on an annual basis from the initiatives and projects underlying our three strategic objectives. $100 million to $150 million is expected to come from potential long-term cost savings over time based on 2019 revenues from redefining the operating model with our managers. We have achieved approximately 60% to 70% of these savings to date. Another $22 million to $37 million of incremental stabilized EBITDA is related to our goal of gaining 3 points to 5 points of index growth at the 16 Marriott transformational capital program hotels and eight other hotels were comprehensive transformational renovations have been recently completed or are underway. Starting with the Marriott transformational capital program portion of our renovations. During the first quarter, we completed the Marina del Ray Marriott and the Houston Marriott Medical Center. This brings the number of completed properties to 12 out of 16 in this program with 89% of the work complete, and we expect to be substantially complete by the end of 2022. The remaining Marriott transformational capital program properties include the Boston Copley Marriott, the San Diego Marriott Marquis, the JW Marriott in Houston, which will be substantially completed by year-end and the Marriott Metro Center in Washington, D.C., which we expect to complete in the first half of 2023. We expect to receive over $11 million in operating profit guarantees from Marriott this year related to these renovations. In total, we expect to invest approximately $750 million on the Marriott transformational capital program assets. As a reminder, we were planning to invest approximately 70% of the $750 million as part of our routine cycle-based renovations. The remaining 30% is ROI-focused CapEx and includes renovation scopes brought forward from future years to create comprehensive transformational renovations. We believe these renovations allow us to capture incremental market share as is the case at the Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island, where we have seen a RevPAR index share gain of 8 points since May 2021. The Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island is now the number one hotel in its competitive set, up from 3 or 4 historically. In addition to the 16 Marriott transformational capital program assets, we have eight hotels where we have completed or are in the process of completing major renovations. The completed hotels include the Dons CeSar, Hyatt Regency Maui and Hyatt Regency Coconut Point. The Ritz-Carlton Naples Beach Resort and Miami Marriott Biscayne Bay, are both expected to be completed by year-end and the Westin Denver downtown, the Westin Georgetown in Washington, D.C. and the Fairmont Kea Lani in Maui are scheduled to be finished by mid-2023. In total, we expect to invest approximately $420 million on these eight assets over four years. $157 million of which we expect to spend in 2022. And finally, we are targeting another $25 million to $35 million of incremental stabilized EBITDA from four major development ROI projects. During the first quarter, we completed and opened the two-acre River Falls Aquatics Park and substantially completed the 60,000 square foot meeting space expansion at our Orlando World Center Marriott. Both of these projects came in ahead of schedule and under budget. As mentioned by year-end, we expect to complete the expansion at the Ritz-Carlton Naples Beach Resort, which adds to the Andaz Maui Villas and AC Scottsville North, both of which are complete. These four assets make up the current development ROI projects and our third strategic objective and we continue to identify new development projects that will unlock value within our portfolio. In total, we expect to invest $216 million on these four assets. Stabilization of these projects is expected to occur within two to three years of completion, but we are seeing early signs of out performance. In addition to the incremental stabilized EBITDA from our three strategic objectives, we expect approximately $120 million to come from the seven hotel and two Golf Course acquisitions we completed in 2021, all of which are meaningfully outperforming our underwriting for 2022. In closing, we continue to improve the quality of our portfolio with our recent dispositions, and we are very pleased with the $1.6 billion of acquisitions we closed on in 2021. As the lodging recovery continues to accelerate, we believe Host is very well positioned to capture a greater share of demand given the investments we have made in our hotels, our improved portfolio quality and our balance sheet strength. With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav. Sourav Ghosh : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on our first quarter top line performance, margins and balance sheet before wrapping up with an update on our dividend. Starting with top line performance. First quarter pro forma RevPAR of $167 was the highest it has been since the onset of the pandemic. The quarter was a table of two months, with March RevPAR of $221 more than double that of January. Improvements in the quarter were driven by leisure travel in Sunbelt markets and Hawaii. These markets achieved a first quarter RevPAR of $251, a 26% increase over the fourth quarter. Our urban markets experienced the brunt of the Omicron impact in the first half of the quarter, but swiftly recovered ending March on a high note. For comparison, March RevPAR at our urban hotels was $132, up nearly 25% to the fourth quarter of 2021. Turning to transient mix. Holidays in the first quarter drove steady sequential growth in both occupancy and transient ADR with President's Day achieving the highest holiday occupancy since 2019, which was driven by are Sunbelt market. Our urban hotel achieved 76% occupancy over Easter, which is nearly double that of the MLK holiday weekend. Holiday occupancy in our urban markets outperformed our Sunbelt markets for the second time since the onset of the pandemic with a rate improvement of 26% over the MLK holiday weekend. Business transient revenue was up 2% in the first quarter with a 4% increase in rate. Despite the impact from Omicron and winter storms in January, business transient room night set a recovery record in March, breaking the 100,000 level, and encouragingly, half of those room nights sold were in urban markets. For comparison, that represents a 28% increase over October 2021, which had 78,000 business transient room nights and was the previous high watermark. Providing a little color on a few of our urban markets. In San Francisco, we saw leisure demand starting to pick up in March. Business transient volume was slow for the first two months of the quarter, our hotels saw a significant spike in March from consulting firms and tech clients. In New York, traditionally strong leisure periods have rebounded to levels approaching 2019. While transient demand remains short term in nature, we are starting to see the booking window stretch beyond 30 days. In March, business transient rooms in New York reached a post-COVID high, and as offices continue to reopen, we expect business transient demand to continue to ramp. Early in the first quarter, Washington, D.C. experienced declines related to cancellations, but all of our hotels saw a meaningful improvement in demand in March due to Cherry Blossoms and Spring Break. As government offices reopen, we expect business ranging volume to continue to improve. Turning to group. Revenue increased 33% over the fourth quarter driven by 14% demand growth, combined with a 17% improvement in rate. Most of the room night increase came from our hotels in Orlando, Maui and San Diego, where we saw incentive business from corporate groups come back into the mix. As it relates to overall group business, banquet and catering revenue was up 17% over the fourth quarter and clearly show that groups are willing to spend when they meet in person. Banquet revenue per group room night exceeded 2019 levels in the first quarter for the first time in the recovery, ending 7% higher, with March absolute banquet and catering revenue down just 10% to 2019. Corporate group revenue increased 41% over the fourth quarter driven by 17% demand growth and a 21% increase in rate. Corporate group room nights picked up meaningfully each month in the quarter and ended at 70% of 2019 levels in March. Orlando and San Diego hotels drove most of the demand growth in this subsegment. Association groups also showed steady sequential improvements. First quarter association group room nights increased 26% over the fourth quarter with a 13% increase in rate. Shifting gears to expenses. Total pro forma expenses were down 17% to first quarter 2019, in line with the total revenue decline. Staffing at our hotels remains at 94% of desired levels based on business volumes versus 97% historically. Hotels had paused on hiring during Omicron and were unable to keep up as demand surged back in February and March. While our hotels continue to fill open roles, a lag between demand and staffing levels still exist. This has acted as an offset to wages and benefits expense quarter-over-quarter. Briefly touching on our efforts to redefine the operating model, we have made meaningful progress on evolving brand standards with our operators. Marriott recently announced over 200 brand standard divisions that aim to reduce costs, align standards across brands and segments enable greater operational flexibility and eliminate outdated standards. Some examples include removing alarm clocks, printed compendiums and premium channels from gas rooms. Our operators have also moved to residential style amenities in luxury hotel rooms and revamped the food and beverage options and hours of operation in many hotels to align with customer preferences. We expect brand centers to continue to evolve as we work with our operators to enhance efficiencies. Taken together, a strong top line and expense controls have allowed our margin to continue to meaningfully improve. Our pro forma hotel EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 31.4%, which is just 10 basis points below that of the first quarter 2019. For comparison, this represents a 350 basis point increase to our fourth quarter hotel EBITDA margin, which was 27.9%. First quarter margin improvement was primarily a result of strong ADR and cancellation revenue. As demand and rate quickly recovered from a decline in January, March had the highest monthly hotel EBITDA margin in Host\u2019s history for today's pro forma portfolio at 41%. Turning to our outlook for 2022. We are still unable to provide full year operational guidance given the continued volatility surrounding COVID. That said, we believe sequential quarterly RevPAR improvements will continue as declines to 2019 diminished throughout the year. We expect second quarter RevPAR to be between $195 and $205 or down 8% to down 3% relative to 2019. This RevPAR range implies an adjusted EBITDAre range of $375 million to $410 million for the second quarter. We expect sustained strength in leisure as well as business transient and group demand to continue accelerating in our urban markets as companies get back on the road and groups get back to meeting in person. We have seen a recovery in international travel, particularly from Canada, Germany and the U.K. New York remains the top destination market followed by San Francisco and Seattle, and we expect sequential improvements in international demand over the course of this year. Given the cadence of the lodging recovery, it is difficult to provide an accurate forecast for the year. While we expect sequential RevPAR improvements relative to 2019, seasonality and changing market and business mix are expected to lead to lower RevPAR and margins for the second half of the year relative to the second quarter. For reference, the third quarter has typically been our weakest quarter of the year. And as is historically the case, we would expect third quarter RevPAR and margins to be below that of the second quarter. Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our weighted average maturity is 5.3 years at a weighted average interest rate of 3.4%, and we have no significant maturities until 2024. After accounting for our two hotel dispositions in April, we now have $2 billion in total available liquidity, comprised of approximately $439 million of cash, $162 million of FF&E reserves and a full availability of our $1.5 billion credit facility. Wrapping up, I am pleased to share that the Board of Directors authorized a second quarter dividend of $0.06 per share on Host\u2019s common stock, a 100% increase over the prior quarter. All future dividends are subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors, but as the operational recovery continues, we expect to be able to grow our dividend to a sustainable level. To conclude, we are optimistic that 2022 will continue to build on the strong momentum of the past few quarters. We remain very well positioned to execute on our goal of increasing the EBITDA growth profile and improving the performance of our portfolio. With that, we would be happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Chris Woronka from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. Chris Woronka : Thanks for all data points. I guess I'll ask the obvious one, which is the 2Q guidance with what you said about April. And I understand there's normally seasonally a drop in May and June. But I think the basic math is suggesting a bigger-than-normal drop, like a double-digit drop versus '19. Can you just give us a little bit of color on how you're thinking about that? Jim Risoleo : Sure. Chris, we have talked a lot about the Q1 performance and April performance internally at Host. And we just don't think we're going to be able to sustain the level of rate that we achieved in Q1 and in the month of April at our resort properties. The spring break that occurred this year was off the charts. It really was very, very, very strong. And we expect to see some moderation back to the mean. As we see a rotation from spring breakers back into the urban markets group and business transient coming back. So that's the reason why we brought the guidance down for Q2. Strong April, but we expect May and June to moderate. May is definitely going to be lower than April, June may be slightly above May at this point in time. Operator : Your next question is coming from Neil Malkin from Capital One Securities. Your line is live. Neil Malkin : Jim, a question for you kind of on the same line. But in terms of maybe just leisure resorts or probably more so the other urban or group hotels. Can you just talk about what out of room total spending looks like? I mean, at least from our expectations, it's continued to just be really strong. And I know that people you've, I think, alluded to, even though rates may not be sustainable at some of these resorts, the other side of the revenue equation should pick up as group and various other core travel segments come back. So can you just talk about what you're seeing there the total out of room? And how to think about that maybe as we go forward in terms of out-of-room spending on a per occupied level? Jim Risoleo : Sure. At our 16 resorts in the first quarter, Neil, we had outlet revenue per available room of $180 which is clearly a high watermark for our portfolio. And I would say probably industry-wide, it's a high watermark. As we look at how that revenue in the aggregate, it was just 7% below quarter one of 2019. And that's all driven by resorts at this point in time. I think our resort performance was plus 40% on a pro forma basis to quarter one of 2019. The same -- and Sourav touched on this in his prepared remarks, the same with respect to banquets at our hotels that are driven by group. I mean that bank was for plus $24 million to quarter four, the per group room night, the bank with dollars exceeded 2019 by 7%. So what we're seeing on corporate, and it's mostly driven by corporate group at this point in time. And what we're seeing is the groups that are signing up are being cautious regarding what commitments they're making on a spend basis, both from a rooms perspective and out of room spend. Given what happened with Omicron in January and February and the attendant attrition and cancellation fees. But when they arrive at the hotels, they're spending a lot more money than they contracted for, which makes it a little bit difficult to forecast going forward. That's one of the reasons why we're not comfortable talking about the second half of the year by talking about the second quarter at this point in time. Does that answer your question? Neil Malkin : Yes. I think so. I mean I'm just curious -- again, I understand like the decline in RevPAR, but I mean you do expect just to be clear, especially given your guidance in terms of bookings or room nights for -- on the group side. The out of room or the non-room related revenue were trend to continue its upward tax, correct? Jim Risoleo : Absolutely. So I only touched on outlet revenue and banquet revenues. I mean we have seen a very strong upward trajectory on golf revenues and on small revenues, parking is relatively flat and we expect that to pick up as people get back on the road and start traveling again. We see no downturn whatsoever in golf or small revenues. The one area that -- it did have an impact on our first quarter performance were attrition and cancellation fees of $26 million, and that's relative to $13 million that we collected in Q1 of 2019. So I wouldn't expect to see that level of cancellation and attrition fees going forward. But the other out-of-room spend should continue to grow. Operator : Your next question is coming from Smedes Rose from Citi. Your line is live. Smedes Rose : I just wanted to ask, Sourav, as you think about, I guess, margin going forward, you noted that margins came very close to pre-pandemic levels and RevPAR is still quite a bit below. As RevPAR continues to improve, even if it's somewhat seasonal and more choppy going forward. How do you think about the flow-through of incremental RevPAR gains. And would it be fair to assume that they might be more occupancy driven at this point versus rate driven? Or how are you thinking about that? Jim Risoleo : I would say take a look at sort of how we performed in 2019 on a quarterly basis. And given that we have come back much quicker than expected in terms of just getting back to normal seasonality. And that's obviously what's impacting our Q2 guidance. When you look at margin performance, it would be very similar to what we saw in back in 2019. The only thing I would say is, obviously, when you are growing revenues, rooms revenue is more driven by a rate that will flow through better. So in other words, you can expect sort of Q2 margins, no different from -- sort of fourth quarter of '19, where it's slightly better than the first quarter. But then if you look at the third quarter of 2019, there is a marked difference in what happens in margins just because rate drops. Back in '19, if I remember correctly, rate dropped close to like 10%, and there was a margin drop of about 600 basis points. So similar in terms of seasonality is what we would expect. So you would still expect sequential top line growth relative to '19, but you will see the apps tribute, revenue numbers sort of follow the same patterns as we saw back in 2019. Smedes Rose : And can I just ask you one quick question. You mentioned 3 million group life on the books for '23 that looks like somewhere between maybe 18 points to 19 points of occupancy at this point. Where would you be now a pre-pandemic going into the following year in terms of sort of points of occupancy on the books. Jim Risoleo : No. What I would say is where we were pre-pandemic is about 3.9 million group room nights at the same time. Smedes Rose : Okay. Jim Risoleo : But what's important to keep in mind here is it's -- we are talking about the full year, right? So Q1 obviously was impacted because of Omicron. The way to think about it is more the remainder of the year. The remainder of the year, we have 2.3 million group room nights. So that's Q2 through Q4. At the same time back in 2019 for the remainder of the year, we had 2.7 million group room nights. Does that make sense? So obviously, the [Indiscernible] Smedes Rose : You were talking about for '23. You're talking about for the [Indiscernible] for room nights. Jim Risoleo : No. I am talking about '22. Operator : Your next question is coming from Bill Crow from Raymond James. Your line is live. Bill Crow : Jim, just to put a little finer point on the whole sequential discussion. How much of this change in RevPAR is mix driven more group on the books for June, for example, than there was in the first quarter, so more mix, more business transient group? Or how much of it is just travel demand in some of those Sunbelt markets that caused all the compression and the pricing is just being more dispersed to New York and Boston and Chicago. Jim Risoleo : I think it's a combination of all of the above, though. Clearly, I don't want to give the impression that our 16 resorts in those five properties that had over $1,000 in ADR for the quarter are going to fall off the face of the earth, they're not. I mean the demand is still there. We're still seeing it. But I think as we get past -- we got past April, we're going to get -- as we get into June, we have some seasonality issues associated with the resorts. As an example, the 1 Hotel South Beach in Miami, the Ritz-Carlton in Naples, Four Seasons, Orlando, just natural seasonality, we think, will may temper some of the demand at those properties. And then we are seeing group and business transient come back, which is going to clearly result in a RevPAR that in the aggregate is lower than what we saw in the first quarter and in the month of April. So we're delighted to have the business, make no mistake about it. We're very excited to see group in BT come back as strong as they have been coming brack and having the resort portfolio that we do and having put $1.6 billion to work last year with assets that have really meaningfully outperformed our expectations. In our minds, served as a good bridge to get us to the point where business transient and group recovers. So it's a combination of all of the above. Bill Crow : If I could just ask a follow-up on kind of the health of the consumer. I'm curious whether you're seeing points redemptions picking up? And if so, is that -- does that represent some pushback on these rates at the resorts or maybe a concession that the inflation is starting to eat away at the consumers' wallet? Jim Risoleo : Now I'll let Sourav get into it, but the short answer is no. We have looked at redemption numbers, and we don't think that, that is having an impact at all at this point in time. In fact, or as an example, for Alila Ventana, we're delighted that, that hotel is part of the world of Hyatt because that's the redemption numbers at that property really go a long way to allowing us to drive outsized RevPAR just given the small number of rooms that are there. And when we can really revenue managed the last -- down to the last room. That is how our redemption rate is set. So it's been very positive for us. And Sourav, I don't know you want to add a little bit of color on what we're seeing. Sourav Ghosh : Sure. Net-net, it's actually incremental for us because if you think about sort of where we are getting those redemption room nights. They're primarily in the resort destinations, which has very high occupancy and majority of our hotels in our portfolio are high redemption hotels, and we actually get a higher reimbursement rate at those hotels. And obviously, at a higher occupancy thresholds, it ends up being incremental in terms of revenue that's being driven by those redemption of room nights. Operator : Your next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is live. David Katz : I wanted to you've talked quite a bit about the strength of the balance sheet. And I think the presumption is that there would be other properties out there that would be viable targets in the next 12 months. And I'm just wondering if we can expand that view a little bit whether there are portfolios or even whether corporate M&A would even be within or outside the boundaries Jim Risoleo : We are constantly evaluating investment opportunities, David. And I think what has happened, at least through our lens, as we view the world today. As other hotel owners have seen the cadence of the recovery, we're seeing one of two things happening. Pricing expectations for a number of the properties that have been in the market early in this year have been beyond our reach. We just have not been able to pencil the underwriting to make sense. Other assets that we would like to buy, and that's because everyone is expecting a strong recovery, which, obviously, our first quarter results and our April numbers are validating as we move into 2022 and beyond. Other assets that are that we might want to acquire just aren't available for sale right now as owners sit and wait until cash flow recovers. So we are very well positioned. There's no question about it. We have $2 billion of available liquidity today as the year progresses that liquidity position will grow. And it puts us in a very strong position as we get later into this year and opportunities become available to really pivot and again be the buyer of choice as we were last year and take deals on all cash and not have to worry about the state of the debt capital markets today, which have gotten a little bit choppy, less loan to proceed -- less loan-to-value proceeds, higher interest rates, given the commentary and actions that the Fed has taken. And I think that patients is warranted at this point in time. We clearly are going to use the balance sheet -- beyond the light is that we were able to do what we did last year and get ahead of the curve and put $1.6 million of work early in the cycle. So I think everything is on the table, but it's very difficult to speculate on what might become available that meets our underwriting criteria. David Katz : And if I can follow up briefly. Just with respect to the kinds of markets where you would or wouldn't be, there's an argument, right, we've that we see where companies are buying more Sunbelt oriented. I wonder if there isn't a contrarian view where some markets that may be under some pressure or duress today or underperforming today might be some places to hunt for value. I just wonder what your thoughts are on that. Jim Risoleo : Let me start by saying that we don't have a red line through any market. And it really is dependent upon our view of value and likely performance going forward. So I agree with you that I think the puck is still going to the Sunbelt markets. I don't think that's going to change. And resorts, in particular, for a number of reasons. Number one is most -- very, very low levels of supply in those markets -- in the resort markets in general. But if opportunities present themselves in some of the markets that are at the bottom of the recovery list, and we thought that they were priced fairly and that we could add value and that the investment would serve to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the portfolio, which is what we're really focused on doing. We would certainly be prepared to transact. Operator : Your next question is coming from Aryeh Klein from BMO. Your line is live. Aryeh Klein : Just following up on the resort rates. Clearly, it seems like there's some seasonality at play over the next few months. But as you look further ahead and comps begin to get much tougher kind of in the second half of the year and I guess, the beginning of next year. Are you expecting rates to actually decline a bit? Sourav Ghosh : It's Sourav. So I think while rates will temper and a lot will be just natural business mix and market mix of shifting of demand to different markets as opposed to the strength of the leisure rate in those specific markets. So we will -- we still expect and just based on the demand that we are seeing into the next quarter and even the second half of the year, we are of the belief that the leisure rates are still going to hold pretty strong. And probably, frankly, well into next year, there's still a lot of pent-up demand. And once international borders really open up to the U.S., we think there is a meaningful amount of demand that's going to help sort of sustain those rates. Obviously, very difficult to tell to what magnitude it will be tempered as sort of the market mix takes place, but we still feel pretty strong about the leisure rates going through the rest of this year and into next year. Operator : [Indiscernible] from Anthony Powell from Barclays. Your line is live. Anthony Powell : Sorry to keep focusing on this leisure performance in May and June, but I kind of wanted to ask another question on that. So we've seen strong pricing and demand on holiday weekends there. Your two weekends coming up at Memorial Day and also June 1, just checking some of your properties on both of those weekends. They seem to be asking for very high pricing. So what are you seeing in the booking window for those two specific weekends? And are you seeing any, I guess, incremental weakness or softness or price resistance as you approach those time periods? Jim Risoleo : Specifically for Memorial Day, and this is, again, going back to sort of still the short-term lead time, we are seeing a key pace of 12% above 2019 levels. So still holding very strong for holidays. Sunbelt markets are pushing rates really nicely with rates on the books, up 44% versus the same time in 2019. But overall, still very strong performance for the upcoming holidays. Anthony Powell : And what about June themes? Jim Risoleo : I don't specifically have June themes numbers Andy, but we can certainly get back to you. Anthony Powell : So I guess you're not really seeing, I guess, an upcoming week holiday weekends, any kind of, I guess, relative price softening versus what you saw in April or even presence today, is that fair? Jim Risoleo : That's fair. We're not seeing any softening. Operator : Your next question is coming from J.J. Kornreich from SMBC. Your line is live. Jay Kornreich : It's Jay. But I am a follow-up to a previous question. With the strong recovery in business transient urban demand, it was interesting to see your Boston and New York as dispositions. So kind of just curious how you think about your asset allocation plan and we may shift back to preserving your urban footprint, which is recovering versus maybe disposing in those markets and focusing more on the outperforming Sunbelt and resort assets. Jim Risoleo : Sure, Jay. Those two assets were -- they each had a unique set of circumstances surrounding them that drove us to dispose of the properties in Boston. And let me say before I get into the specifics about each of these two assets, we still have a healthy presence in both markets. In Boston, we have the Boston Copley Marriott, which is part of the Marriott transformational capital program. We're in the midst of a complete renovation of that asset. So clearly, we are committed to the Boston market. But the Sheraton, given its location in the Back Bay and the size of the hotel and the plans on the part of the State of Massachusetts to sell the Hein Center, which the hotel was very dependent upon for groups. It doesn't have an adequate meeting space platform to service groups. And the group business in Boston now has moved to the main convention center, the hotel needed a lot of capital significant amount of deferred CapEx at that property. It just made a lot more sense for us to dispose of that asset and similarly with the Sheraton in New York. We have the time -- the New York Marry Marquis in Times Square and the Financial Center Marriott in Downtown New York. Both are in incredible shape. They were both part of the Marriott transformational capital program. The assets are well primed to really outperform as the recovery continues at pace, whereas the Sheraton, again, an older hotel and need a substantial CapEx. So in that -- the Sheraton was forecasted to lose $15 million at the EBITDA line in 2022. So I think those two dispositions will go a long way to allowing us to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the company. Taking the capital from those sales and investing that capital either in our existing portfolio through ROI projects or making additional acquisitions going forward as part of our capital allocation strategy. Jay Kornreich : And if I could just ask 1 follow-up. As we seen a nice recovery in the business trends in all the urban markets, can you just give us a little perspective on how San Francisco is shaping up? And how you expect that market to perform in the second half of the year? Jim Risoleo : Yes. Sure. San Francisco is actually shaping up better than we were expecting. The San Francisco -- I'll give you an example. San Francisco Marriott Marquis actually had 1,000 rooms per night midweek last three weeks of March. BT on the books for the last week of April is almost flat to 2019. So overall, pretty good through for San Francisco in terms of BT pickup. Operator : Your next question is coming from Floris Van Dijkum from Compass Point. Your line is live. Floris Van Dijkum : If I look at your EBITDA numbers, particularly if I look at your resort markets relative to '19, obviously, the resorts have been really strong. San Francisco has been lagging. DC has been lagging New York is not really that big, but that has also been a troubled market. As you think about the recovery that we're seeing in the urban markets, I mean, in your view, I know the people are talking a little bit about sequential growth here, but you're pretty 83% of your EBITDA -- hotel EBITDA already in the U.S. in the first quarter. Some of your competitors think they can achieve that by the fourth quarter of this year. Are you -- is that your house view of potential? I know you're not giving guidance, but certainly, is that how comfortable are you being able to achieve those kinds of levels by the fourth quarter of this year? Jim Risoleo : I don't think we're really comfortable talking about the second half of the year. It's very difficult at this point in time to forecast how this recovery is going to continue to unfold. So much of the business is being booked short term, although we are starting to see the booking window extend. As I mentioned, a very valid point, we think is on the corporate group business that we're seeing. The contracts that are being signed are for lower levels of food and beverage spend and smaller numbers of attendees that are then that are showing up. Because they just don't want to be dealing with attrition and cancellation fees if they have to cancel or if they -- if there is another event that as we saw in January and February. So at this point in time, I think we're confident and we feel really good about what we're seeing in terms of group bookings for the balance of this year. We had a nice pickup over Q4, where we had 2.7 million definite on the books at the end of Q1. We had 3 million definite room nights on the books. That compares, I think, to $3.9 million in Q1 of 2019 for 2020. So we continue to close the gap going forward and the same with business transient. It's coming back. We think it's going to continue to evolve as offices open. And we feel good about it, but we're just not in a position to give any guidance for the balance of the year. Sourav Ghosh : I would add, I mean, if there is any indication in terms of what we did in March as presentation of where we see the trends heading. I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks how March was over 100,000 room nights, which is now the high watermark. So if you remember back in 2021, we had -- the last high watermark was at 78,000 room nights in October of '21. So that's a 28% increase. What we can say is we see that trend continuing into April. And as Jim said, since the lead times are short, it's difficult to have visibility on BT well into the second half, but the trends are at least positive. And March ADR for BT was $223, and that's down only 1.6% to 2019. Operator : Your next question is coming from Chris Darling from Green Street. Your line is live. Chris Darling : Just to put a finer point on what you're seeing on BT and group demand. I'm hoping you could just walk through how weekday occupancy specifically is trending relative to '19 and some of your major urban markets. Sourav Ghosh : So for the major urban markets, the weak day occupancy is still lower than what -- where we would like it to be, but it's trending in the right direction. I think that's the important point. From the last time we spoke on the fourth quarter call, there has been like a 4 point to 5 point improvement in midweek occupancies. So that's where sort of we have been focused. Weekend occupancy has obviously improved meaningfully in those urban markets, but that trend continues. Chris Woronka : And I don't know if you have the numbers in front of you, but just curious how that might compare to kind of precoded levels. Jim Risoleo : We are still down, I would say, about sort of high double digits of 18, 20 percentage points in occupancy in those markets. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to Jim Rosolio, Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Jim Risoleo : Thank you, and I would like to thank everyone for joining us on our call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our quarterly results with you. And we all look forward to meeting with many of you in person in the coming weeks and months. We really appreciate your continued support. Have a great day Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jaime Marcus, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Jaime Marcus : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, please note that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and hotel-level results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in yesterday's earnings press release, and our 8-K filed with the SEC, and in the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. With me on today's call will be Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Risoleo : Thank you, Jaime, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. Once again, we delivered significant outperformance during the second quarter, and substantially beat all consensus metrics. During the second quarter, our adjusted EBITDAre was $500 million, and our adjusted FFO per share was $0.58. Our all owned hotel EBITDA of $510 million in the second quarter was 19% above 2019, driven by an accelerating recovery in our urban and downtown markets and continued strength in Sunbelt markets. In addition to exceeding 2019 levels, our second quarter adjusted EBITDAre was also the highest in Host's history. All owned hotel revenues in the second quarter increased 3.7% over the second quarter of 2019, while all owned hotel operating expenses were down 3.8%. The increase in revenues was driven by strong rates across the portfolio, coupled with stronger-than-usual other revenues. All owned hotel RevPAR for the second quarter was $219, a 31% improvement over the first quarter. This represents the first time our quarterly RevPAR has exceeded 2019 levels, since the onset of the pandemic. Our recent acquisitions, dispositions and renovated properties, continue to contribute to our performance, which I will discuss in a few minutes. Preliminary, all owned hotel RevPAR for July is expected to be approximately $195, which is slightly above July of 2019. Consistent with historical seasonal trends and shifting business and market mix, we expect third quarter nominal RevPAR to be below that of the second quarter. While macroeconomic concerns have been dominating the headlines, we are not seeing any signs of a weakening consumer in our business. As we look to history, it is worth discussing why we think today's macroeconomic environment, with respect to lodging is different. First, certain segments of the lodging industry are still recovering, and we believe there is meaningful room for growth, particularly in the business transient and group segments. Even more encouraging, hotels benefit from the ability to reprice rooms on a nightly basis ahead of rising costs, even during periods of high inflation, as was the case in the 1970s. Second, consumers and businesses have significantly more cash on hand with leverage and debt service ratios better than they were prior to the great financial crisis in 2008. The labor market is also exceptionally strong, with over three million more jobs opened than we had at the height of the last expansion and an unemployment rate hovering near a five-decade low. In addition, we have continued to benefit from a consumer spending rotation away from goods and into services, including travel and we expect this trend to continue. Lastly, we expect to benefit from exceptionally low supply growth for the next several years. The total pipeline has fallen by 11% since the start of the pandemic and the number of rooms in construction is down 30%. As a result, industry projections suggest annual supply growth of just over 1% through 2023, well below the long-term average of 1.8%. In contrast, supply growth at the start of the last three downturns was running at over 2.5%. The market way to supply growth for Host's portfolio is projected to be approximately 1%, as we will benefit from exceptionally low growth in places like San Diego, Hawaii, and San Francisco. Despite these tailwinds, many are concerned about the potential impact to our business which is still in a demand recovery mode. In the second quarter, group demand was 9% below 2019, while business transient demand was 25% below 2019. These factors could mean that any softening demand simply prolongs the trajectory of the lodging recovery instead of leading to an absolute decline in occupancy and rate. Irrespective of potential future macroeconomic challenges, we believe that Host is well positioned to outperform the broader industry. We have dramatically improved the quality of our portfolio through our capital allocation efforts. We have invested in our assets and we have an investment-grade balance sheet. Further, we believe the current rising interest rate environment could create opportunities for Host, as other buyers may step to the sidelines. Our 2021 acquisitions continued to perform substantially ahead of our underwriting expectations. Based on updated performance for full year 2022, EBITDA from our seven new hotel acquisitions is expected to be 77% above our underwriting expectations, already putting us within our disclosed stabilization range of 10 times to 12 times EBITDA. Looking back on our transaction activity since 2018, we have acquired $3.2 billion of assets at a 14 times EBITDA multiple and disposed of $4.9 billion of assets at a 17 times EBITDA multiple, including $938 million of estimated foregone capital expenditures. Impairing all owned hotel 2019 results for our portfolio to 2017, we have increased the RevPAR of our assets by 11%, EBITDA per key by 25%, EBITDA margins by 190 basis points and avoided considerable business disruption associated with capital projects. Turning to second quarter operations, our all owned hotel revenue was up nearly 4% to second quarter 2019, driven by 15% rate growth. Transient revenue was up 10% compared to second quarter 2019 and rate was up 22% with growth driven by significant demand across our urban and downtown markets. Our resort properties continue to outperform with transient revenue up more than 50% to second quarter 2019, driven by 70% transient rate growth. We had five resorts with transient rates above $1,000 for the quarter and of those five, the two highest rates were at hotels we acquired in 2021. The Four Seasons Resort, Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort had a second quarter transient average rate that exceeded $1,500 and the Alila Ventana Big Sur had a transient average rate of over $2,000. Providing some detail on a few of our urban markets. San Francisco saw continued positive momentum throughout the second quarter with many groups performing at pre-pandemic levels on peak nights. Some of these are picking up on weekends and business transient picking up with the return of big tech and consulting companies. In addition San Francisco citywide throughout the quarter created a compression on peak nights for our downtown hotels. In New York, second quarter RevPAR was flat to 2019 and business transient rooms sold increased more than 75% compared to the first quarter. 2022 group pace for our New York hotels is up over 5% to 2019 and our New York Marriott Marquis is on track to exceed 2019 group room nights, driven by two significant bookings within the past 60 days. In total, these two groups booked 17,000 room nights and are expected to contribute approximately $5 million in the second half of 2022. Turning to group. Business surged back at our hotels during the second quarter. Group revenue was down just 3% to second quarter 2019, driven by 6% rate growth. In the second quarter, our hotels sold 1.1 million group room nights, a 64% increase over the first quarter and we continue to be encouraged by net booking activity in the quarter for the quarter. Looking forward to our expectations for group in 2022, we currently have 3.5 million definite group nights on the books with 1.7 million coming in the second half. This is a meaningful increase to the 3 million group room nights we had on the books for 2022 as of the first quarter and it represents approximately 80% of 2019 actual group room nights, up from 70% last quarter. For comparison, at the end of the second quarter of 2019, we had 94% of 2019 actual group room nights on the books. Group rate on the books for 2022 is up 5% to the same time 2019, a 30 basis point increase over last quarter. For the remainder of the year, total group revenue pace is down just 30 basis points to the same time in 2019. As we look forward to 2023, we currently have 2.2 million definite group room nights on the books, which is down 16% to the second quarter of 2019. Our operators saw an acceleration in group bookings during the second quarter for 2023, that meeting planners are not hitting pause on future bookings. That said, we do expect the short-term nature of group bookings, to continue over the near term. In addition, to delivering significant operational improvements, we continue to execute on our three strategic objectives, all of which are aimed at elevating the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio. As a reminder, our objectives include redefining the hotel operating model with our managers, gaining market share at hotels through comprehensive renovations, and strategically allocating capital to development ROI projects. We are targeting a range of $147 million to $222 million of incremental stabilized EBITDA, on an annual basis from the initiatives and projects underlying, our three strategic objectives. Sourav, will get into more detail on business mix, markets and redefining our operating model in a few minutes. We have completed 12 out of 16 properties in the Marriott Transformational Capital Program, and we expect to substantially complete three additional properties, by the end of this year. We believe these renovations, allow us to capture incremental market share, as is the case at the New York Marriott Marquis. It is evident that the renovated hotel is attracting new groups. Booking activity in the year, for the year, is 2.5 times the three-year pre-COVID average, and year-to-date group room revenue is 24% higher than 2019. In addition to the positive momentum, we are seeing at the New York Marriott Marquis, we have seen a RevPAR index share gain of 8.8 points, at the Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island, on a trailing 12-month basis compared to its pre-renovation index, a 12.7-point gain at the New York Marriott Downtown, and an 11.9-point gain at the JW Marriott, Buckhead all far exceeding our targeted range of three to five points of RevPAR index gains at renovated assets. In addition, to the 16 Marriott Transformational Capital Program assets, we have eight hotels where we have completed or are in the process of completing major renovations. One of these is the Hyatt Regency, Maui where we have seen a RevPAR index share gain of 8.5 points, since completed the transformational renovation in December of 2020. This hotel is expected to contribute $80 million in EBITDA in 2022, and is expected to be the largest EBITDA contributor to our portfolio this year. In total, the 16 Marriott Transformational Capital Program assets, the eight hotels where we have completed or are completing comprehensive renovations, and the seven hotels we recently acquired are expected to comprise over 50% of our 2022 all owned hotel EBITDA. From 2020 through the end of this year, we will have invested approximately $1.5 billion in our hotels, which equates to $35,000 per key. This compares favorably to our lodging, REIT peer average of just $19,000 per key. We believe our meaningful investments throughout the pandemic, and the recovery position our portfolio to outperform. When the 24 comprehensive renovations are complete, the average age of our guest rooms will have decreased by over 25%. As it stands today over the next five years, we estimate that less than 1/4 of our portfolio will require disruptive guestroom renovations. In closing, we believe we are very well positioned to outperform as the lodging recovery continues. We have significantly improved the quality of our portfolio through our capital allocation efforts, meaningfully reinvested in our assets and maintained a strong investment-grade balance sheet. As macroeconomic concerns play out, we will continue to be opportunistic and position our portfolio for outperformance. With that I will now turn the call over to Sourav. Sourav Ghosh : Thank you, Jim and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments I will go into detail on our second quarter operations and full year guidance before wrapping up on our balance sheet our stock repurchase program and our dividend. Starting with top line performance, second quarter all owned hotel RevPAR of $219 exceeded 2019 for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. Even more encouraging is that all three months in the quarter exceeded 2019 levels. Rate continues to drive the RevPAR upside especially at our Sunbelt and Hawaii hotels where rate was up more than 27% to the second quarter of 2019. Our urban and downtown hotels are showing a rapid improvement as well with rates just 2% below the second quarter of 2019. For context this is a 30% improvement over the first quarter paired with a 73% sequential increase in rooms sold in these markets. Turning to transient mix. Overall transient revenue was up 10% over the second quarter of 2019 driven by 22% rate growth. Holidays in the second quarter had steady growth in both transient occupancy and rate over the second quarter of 2019. Memorial Day weekend achieved 76% occupancy the highest holiday occupancy since the start of the pandemic. Our Sunbelt hotels and resorts achieved strong occupancy and rates with six markets exceeding 85% occupancy. Our urban and downtown hotels achieved the highest occupancies within our portfolio over the 4th of July weekend driven by hotels in Chicago, New York and Philadelphia.  Business transient revenue was down 24% to the second quarter of 2019, but increased 66% over the first quarter, driven by a 48% increase in rooms sold. Business transient rooms sold grew progressively throughout the quarter and June set a new high watermark with more than 112,000 rooms sold beating the prior record set in May.  The mix of business transient has now shifted to urban and downtown markets where rates exceeded Sunbelt markets and rooms sold grew 75% over the first quarter. In the second quarter, top 10 traditional accounts represented 56% of all business transient room nights compared to 60% in 2019. In addition, for the first time since onset of the pandemic weekday occupancy for our total portfolio surpassed weekend occupancy yet another sign of a return to normalcy. Turning to Group. Revenue in the quarter was just 3% below the second quarter of 2019 driven by a 6% increase in rate. More than half of the 64% increase in Group rooms sold over the first quarter came from our urban markets including Washington DC, San Francisco, New York and Chicago.  Further illustrating the surge in group demand group revenue in June was up approximately 3% over 2019. Net, in the quarter for the quarter group rooms booked were 77% higher than the second quarter of 2019. This is evidenced of the continued short-term booking nature of group business and the basis for optimistic outlook on group for the remainder of the year. Corporate group revenue was down just 5% compared to the second quarter of 2019, driven by a 10% improvement in rate. Corporate group rooms sold were up 56% over the first quarter and both rate and room nights were driven by growth in New York and San Francisco. Association Group revenue was down 13% for the second quarter of 2019 aided by a 2% improvement in rate. However, association group rooms sold were up 74% to the first quarter of 2022 with most of the growth in Washington D.C., San Francisco and Chicago. Short-term association business is becoming more active as attendance increases and we expect bookings in this segment to overtime. Wrapping up on group with Social, Military, Educational, Religious and Fraternal or SMERF groups revenue was up 25% compared to the second quarter of 2019, driven fairly evenly by rooms sold and rates. Most of the increase in rooms sold over the first quarter occurred in our urban and downtown markets. Shifting gears to expenses, all owned hotel expenses were down 3.8% to second quarter 2019 while all owned hotel revenues were up 3.7%. Expense declines were driven by wages and benefit savings, down 7% to the second quarter of 2019. Our properties have worked to insulate operations from rising costs. And thus far we are not seeing a discernible impact on overall controllable operating costs. At this time any expense growth is concentrated at our resorts where strong demand is driving increased rates and higher out-of-room spend. Turning to staffing and wages staffing at our hotels remains at approximately 94% of desired levels based on business volume compared to 97% historically. While our operators fill several thousand open positions during the quarter, a lag between demand and staffing levels still exists at certain hotels. We expect this lag to gradually diminish through continued hiring and normal seasonal market and mix shift in the second half of the year. Wrapping up on expenses, we continue to expect our annual wage and benefit rate inflation for 2021 to 2022 to be in the 4% to 5% range. Taking our strong top line and expense controls together, our second quarter all owned hotel EBITDA margin came in at 37.1% which is 480 basis points better than the second quarter of 2019 and the highest all owned hotel EBITDA margin in Host's history. Margins improved in both Sunbelt and urban markets across all operating departments driven by strong rates and increased other revenue on the top line, combined with expense efficiencies and hiring challenges in certain markets. To-date, our operators have achieved approximately 70% of the $100 million to $150 million that is expected to come from potential long-term cost savings based on 2019 all owned hotel revenues. As other revenues normalize and hiring continues, we expect margins will moderate while remaining above 2019 levels. Moving on to our outlook for 2022. We are pleased to be able to reinstate full year guidance, as we are now seeing more normal seasonal trends in our portfolio. We expect full year 2022 all owned hotel RevPAR for our portfolio to be between $191 to $195, or down 4.5% to down 2.5% to full year 2019. As you think about the quarterly RevPAR cadence, we expect third and fourth quarter operations to be slightly above 2019. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2022 was severely impacted by Omicron, which drives our full year RevPAR range slightly below 2019. This range implies an adjusted EBITDAre of $1.445 billion to $1.510 billion and all owned hotel EBITDA margin of 31.5% to 32.1%. For reference, the midpoint of these ranges is slightly above our 2019 all owned hotel results as presented on pages 22 and 23 of our supplemental financial information. These estimated ranges are driven by normal seasonality at our Sunbelt hotels and resorts, alongside continued growth at our urban and downtown hotels, as group and business change in demand continues to pick up at a meaningful pace. Additional guidance details can be found in the reconciliations of our second quarter 2022 earnings release. Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our weighted average maturity is five years at a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and we have no significant maturities until 2024. As of quarter end, we had $2.4 billion in total available liquidity, comprised of approximately $699 million of cash $179 million of FF&E reserves and full availability of our $1.5 billion credit facility. Subsequent to quarter end, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our share repurchase program, increasing our total authorization back to $1 billion, which is consistent with our previous authorization. As is the case with our ATM Program, we view our share repurchase program as another capital allocation tool to help us maximize financial flexibility. Wrapping up, I am pleased to share that our Board of Directors authorized a third quarter dividend of $0.12 per share on Host's common stock, a 100% increase over the prior quarter and the second time we have doubled our dividend this year. All future dividends are subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors, but we expect to be able to maintain our quarterly dividend at a sustainable level, taking into consideration potential macroeconomic factors. To conclude, we believe the operating improvements we have seen this year signal a robust lodging cycle ahead. As we have seen quarter-after-quarter during this recovery, our portfolio, our balance sheet and our team are differentiated and well positioned to continue outperforming in any macroeconomic environment. With that, we would be happy to take your questions. To ensure we have time to address as many questions as possible, please limit yourselves to one question. Operator : The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities. Please pose your question. Your line is live. Neil Malkin : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Fantastic quarter across the board. Well done. A question on MTCP, I mean I think it's clear that it's well ahead of schedule meaningfully outperforming. Can you just talk about kind of what you're seeing as far as the group impact? You mentioned briefly you're getting some new groups. But can you just talk about how you see the strategic renovations at those sort of bigger more complex hotels is going to -- you expect it to drive group seemingly to new levels, given your comments about how far below associations are and being down, just what 8% or 9% from 2019? And if you can help us at all quantify that in terms of run rate or anything like that that obviously be helpful. Thank you. Jim Risoleo : Yes, Neil. Look, we couldn't be happier with the performance we're seeing out of our MTCP hotels as well as other hotels that we embarked on transformational comprehensive renovations. We think that it was a very good time to be renovating our properties. By the end of this year, we will have invested $1.5 billion in our assets that equates to roughly $35,000 a key. And relative to the REIT peer group, where they spend $19,000 a key, we believe that that puts our portfolio in the full position to outperform going forward. So, in addition to the few properties that we referenced on the call today, with respect to RevPAR index, let me remind you that we have talked about gaining three to five points of market share. That's how we underwrote our investments in the MTCP assets. We are blowing through those numbers. We have, in addition to the New York Marriott Downtown, which is up 12.7 points and the JW Buckhead, which is up 11.9, Coronado Island is up over seven points now, the Don CeSar is up over five points, it's close to six points, and the others that are coming back online, it\u2019s a little too soon to really look back to the baseline because we don't have enough run room yet. But I think the New York Marriott Marquis is an excellent example of what a fully refreshed and renovated hotel will do for you, because the booking activity and the level of group room nights that we've seen at that property are off the charge. So, we expect as we get back to a sense of normalcy, which is clearly a direction we're heading in the business in general that our properties are going to continue to take more market share. There are just a lot of hotels out there that haven't had any capital invested in them. And regardless of whether or not properties are renovated and they suffer the attendant disruption, we'll pick that up. And if they're not renovated, well, the Marquis, the flagship that we can point to. Neil Malkin : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Aryeh Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Please pose your question. Your line is live. Aryeh Klein : Thanks and good morning. On the group side, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on rates for new bookings? And then in-quarter group bookings have been well above 2019 for you and the industry. Can you talk a little bit about why that might be sustainable? And is that something that could be disproportionately impacted if the macro were to worsen? Sourav Ghosh : Sure, Aryeh. On the group side I mean the rate story has been really strong. And what I'll say is for the second half of the year, we actually picked up 30 basis points in rate relative to what we had at the end of Q1. So our rate for the balance of the year is around 4.7%. And that holds true not only for the second half of the year but also looking out into 2023, where our rates are up close to 5% as well. What's super encouraging on the group side, I think a good stat to really look at is most recently, so despite all the macro noise, if you look at what we picked up in June for Q2, so we picked up 121,000 group room nights in the quarter for the quarter, which is 77% above 2019. In the second quarter for Q3 and Q4, we picked up about 319,000 room nights and that's 40% above 2019. And when you look at just June again for the second half, we picked up 126,000 room nights, which is 61% over 2019. So these are obviously meaningful pickup, most recently not only for Q2 but at the end of Q2 in June, which really indicates sort of strength in the group business, particularly I would say corporate group and the association is falling right behind it as well and picking up for the second half. And the rates thus far is super encouraging again for June relative to 2019 group rate was actually up 44%. Aryeh Klein : Thanks. And then just on the sustainability of in quarter for the quarter bookings. Is that something you'd expect to continue? Sourav Ghosh : We do it. I mean it probably temper a little bit. I mean it's very difficult to say because it's such short-term business how much in the quarter for the quarter business will get or how much in the month for the month. But based on the trends we saw in Q2 in April, May, June, we would expect again a meaningful amount. I don't know if it's going to be exactly what we saw in Q2, but certainly a meaningful amount of short-term business pick up in the third and fourth quarters. Jim Risoleo : Aryeh, one comment on 2023. One of the very encouraging facts that we can point to is that meeting planners have not hit pause. We're still seeing strong booking activity into 2023 with $2.2 million definites on the books for 2023 and the total group revenue pace continues to improve. It's down 9% now to 2019, with strong ADR growth. So hotels booked I think 253,000 group room nights in the quarter for 2023. That activity was about 83% of 2019 levels, which is about on par with where it was in quarter one. So very encouraging as we look out beyond even 2022. Aryeh Klein : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is coming from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Please pose your question. Your line is live. Chris Woronka : Hey. Good morning, guys. Jim, realizing that you don't solve for occupancy and understanding your data points about how much corporate and group occupancy is still possibly to be captured going forward. But do you think we're headed for structurally lower occupancy given the rates that you're able to get on the business you have? And the fact that the labor market might be tight for a while and you might not be able to get as much labor as you need at the price you want. So do you think we're going to end up 300 basis points or something lower on when we peak this cycle? Jim Risoleo : Yes. A lot in that question Chris. With respect to labor, let me touch on that first. And we talked about it's been quarter-over-quarter that we're running at roughly 94% of optimal levels compared to 97% pre-pandemic. I think the 97% number in and of itself is a little inflated because we took the opportunity early in the pandemic to really zero-based budget every hotel. And we've taken a number of positions out of the properties allowing the properties to become more efficient and increase productivity and you're seeing that come through in our margin performance as well. So I think the labor situation is going to stabilize. As we've said before and we look at this on a regular basis, we anticipate wage growth this year 4% to 5% -- probably 4.5% to 5% to be a lower tight in the range. So it's not off the charts. With respect to occupancy the trends are going solidly in the right direction on the group segment and the business transient segment. So we continue to pick up business transient room nights and not seeing any softness there whatsoever. So I think it's just a matter of time, it's going to evolve and it's not going to evolve evenly across the country. Are there going to be some markets that are going to take longer to get back to 2019 levels and others that are going back right now. So the short answer is we fully anticipate that we're going to see a recovery to prior peak occupancy levels both on the BT side and on the group side. Chris Woronka : Great. Thanks, Jim. Operator : Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth at Evercore ISI. Please pose your question. Your line is live. Duane Pfennigwerth : A little bit about holiday bookings. How do those bookings look relative to what you normally have on the books at this time and any new patterns emerging? Jim Risoleo : Duane, I think, you were asking about holiday bookings. Looking out into Thanksgiving and Christmas? Duane Pfennigwerth : Exactly. How does that look relative to what you normally have on the books at this time? I realize it's a long way out. But clearly the trend on 3Q is a rotation from leisure to more corporate and group dependent. But as we look to kind of fourth quarter and beyond how do your holiday bookings look? Jim Risoleo : Very strong. Very, very strong. If you look at total Host, I would tell you that we're up into the double digits in terms of total revenue for Thanksgiving. And actually for Christmas, we are seeing a solid pickup as well, obviously, being driven by the Sunbelt markets and Maui. But that stat in and of itself gives us comfort that there's not going to be the pullback in consumer spending at our resort properties that some folks have talked about. Duane Pfennigwerth : I appreciate that. And then maybe just one quick one on -- one quick follow-up on group. I know you alluded to some very large events that came close in, in New York. But how is the average group size trending as that book builds? Sourav Ghosh : The average group size is actually very similar to what we saw back in 2019. It's not necessarily lower. There certainly what's happening is certainly certain groups are contracting for less, but then ending up increasing the minimum and actually spending more. Therefore, you'll see sort of a banquet and catering business pick up meaningfully well as well. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Sourav Ghosh : And that's not just for Host that's across the board. And just a quick stat on Labor Day and Jim's touched upon Thanksgiving and Christmas, our transient occupancy pace is ahead by 20% and our rate is a -- pace is ahead by 17% relative to 2019 for transient -- rate. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you for the thoughts. Operator : Your next question is coming from Bill Crow at Raymond James. Please post your question. Your line is live. Bill Crow : Hey good morning. Just a couple of questions. I apologize for that more than one here. But what are you seeing on shorter nights on Thursdays and Sundays that may or may not be indicative of any changes to the consumers' appetite? Sourav Ghosh : We are actually seeing in the second quarter particularly as you saw in May and June things are returning to very similar patterns of what we saw in 2019 in terms of weekday and weekend. And now the weekday occupancy as we talked about has exceeded weekend occupancy for the portfolio it's about a six-point difference when you look at the second quarters', weekday occupancy is at 76% versus weekend at 70%. And when you look at Sunbelt and Hawaii, it's about a five-point difference; and then the urban it's about an eight-point difference. So urban is right now at 76% and weekend at 69%. So as we get back to a more normalized mix of business and as the urban downtown hotels pick up occupancy, we are seeing very, very similar weekday and weekend patterns relative to 2019. Bill Crow : Okay. So maybe fewer long weekends than what we had seen before. Is that fair? Sourav Ghosh : That's fair. Bill Crow : Yeah. Okay. A two-part around 2023 and then I'll be done. The first part is on your Sunbelt resorts if we kind of limited that to Florida and Arizona and as you think about 2021 in the comps, do you think it's the RevPAR is going to be up at those properties versus 2021 certainly versus 2019? But -- and the second part of the question is Jim I'm going to take the other side of your argument on group for next year. I'm just curious, how we should -- should we really celebrate being down? I think you said 16 points -- or 16% of demand versus this time in 2019 if we haven't had meetings for two years and there's all this pent-up demand? Jim Risoleo : You're talking about 2023 Bill? Bill Crow : Yeah, I'm talking about 2023, but in both cases the Sunbelt leisure comp to 2021 -- or excuse me to 2022 and where the group pace is? Jim Risoleo : Again, the trends are moving in the right direction on the group pace. Let me talk about that first. The fact that we were able to book 253,000 group room nights in the quarter for 2023 and the activity was about 83% of 2019 levels. I think that we're not seeing anything that would lead us to believe that group is not going to continue to come back. I mean there is a lot of pent-up demand there. And based on conversations that our asset managers and revenue managers are having with our property managers and media planners everyone intends to get back to normal. I mean keep in mind what happened this year in the first quarter with Omicron. It really put a damper on things and we're seeing the business recover and feel pretty good about how 2023 is going to play out. So we're down 9% on the group revenue pace I think we'll see that gap continuing to close. So group revenue is pacing ahead of same time in 2019 for markets like the Florida Gulf Coast, Hawaii, New Orleans and San Antonio. So we are seeing some positives in individual markets and we expect that that will continue going forward. With respect to resort ADRs, we talked about this on the last call. And we do have some seasonality involved here with respect to our properties, but the fact that we drove $1,000 transient ADRs at five resorts in Q2 is very positive. We're not seeing the consumer pullback whatsoever and we intend to continue to ask for rate going forward. We're optimistic that we're going to be able to continue to drive rate maybe not at the same levels as we did in 2021 in this year, but we'll continue to ask for rate going forward as long as the demand is there. Bill Crow : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please post your question. Your line is live. Floris Van Dijkum : Hey, guys. A question on capital allocation. With the increased authority to buy back stock, maybe if you can talk about sort of how you weigh all the options of buybacks versus refurbishments versus new acquisitions? And maybe touch upon what you're seeing right now in the acquisitions market and we haven't seen a whole lot of hotels trade? What your view is and whether that provides a competitive advantage to Host? And could we expect something activity there, or will you look at your own stock trading at a pretty substantial discount to consensus NAV and look to invest in? What's going to be the trigger for those decisions? Jim Risoleo : We are -- Floris, we are uniquely positioned as a buyer of assets in this marketplace given where the debt capital markets are today, the fact that it is virtually impossible to get meaningful levels of debt on the acquisition front. So we're tracking a lot of transactions and we will balance whether or not the right decision is to invest in an asset, given where our cost of capital is today. And with the underwriting requirements will have to be, versus buying back our stock over the course of the balance of this year and into next year. So there hasn't been a broad repricing of buyer asks or seller asks out there on hotels that are actively in the market. You're right, that a lot haven't traded for. I think that's one reason why. The second reason why this is just very challenging for buyers to access to debt markets today. So with the liquidity we have today, the availability of a $1.5 billion revolver and the incremental cash that we're going to generate over the balance of this year, as business continues to churn along, we will be in the poll position. We will always invest in our assets. We can quantify the ROI. We're seeing it play out. And transformational comprehensive renovations, or ROI projects, we think that's a good place to put our capital and then there'll be a balance between share buybacks and investing in hotels. Floris Van Dijkum : Thanks, Jim. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is coming from Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please pose your question. Your line is live. Michael Bilerman : Yes. Great. Thanks. Jim, just sticking with the share buyback for a moment. I guess, how did you think about sizing the $1 billion relative to the prior authorization? And I guess, what triggered the company sort of re-up that and increase it to the size it was? And maybe just a little bit about your consideration during the quarter when those discussions were going on about taking advantage of the volatility that occurred? And just how -- if you didn't do it then how are you thinking about doing it in the future in terms of buybacks? Jim Risoleo : Well, we took the buyback authorization to where it was pre-pandemic, Michael. We had a $1 billion authorization. We had $371 million remaining on it. So we took it back to $1 billion. And we will continue to watch where our stock trades relative to our view of the business environment and how 2022 is going to play out how we're feeling about 2023, as we get in a little further into this year and start thinking about budgets next year. And if there is a disconnect between the value of our stock price and how we think the company is going to perform, then we'll take advantage of that dislocation and enter the capital markets. We view the share buyback activity as another capital allocation tool. Michael Bilerman : And Jim, how did you think about -- obviously, in the quarter there was a fair amount of volatility. Your stock has performed exceptionally well, January through early June, but obviously then went from $21 to below $6. Were you blacked out at that point? Or was your view of like, I don't know where this market is going. And despite knowing how well your assets were performing based on all the investments you've made in the assets and your operating platforms and the assets you own relative to the ones you sold, I guess, why wouldn't you have acted? I know hindsight is 2020. I'm just trying to understand sort of in the Board's mentality during that time when you've re-upped and the price was off significantly from its recent highs. Jim Risoleo : Well, we certainly hope that the price doesn't go down from here. But at times Michael it just pays to be patient. And as things were playing out with geopolitical events, the price of oil was going quantitative tightening we just felt that it was more prudent at this point in time to preserve cash to sit back and to see what other opportunities might present themselves. So as I said, it's real time. It's -- there's a famous saying out there, when the facts change your opinion changes. So we'll keep it on how things are playing out. Michael Bilerman : I'll remind myself of that on our ratings too. You got to stay active when the facts change. I appreciate that Jim. Thanks for the time. Jim Risoleo : Sure. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is coming from David Katz with Jefferies. Please pose your question. Your line is live. David Katz : Hi. Good morning everyone, and thanks for taking my question. Just looking at Host as a platform and an enterprise, I know that you've historically been somewhat of a leader in putting forth analytics resources and so forth. You've covered an awful lot of operating ground, but I'd love to hear you talk about some of those and what you've added and how you're utilizing those in the current environment? Sourav Ghosh : Sure, David. We are really we could go on for an hour in terms of answering that question, because our analytics platform as you well know is extremely comprehensive and it's really ingrained in any capital allocation decision to be made, whether it's right from identifying markets that are going to grow greater than our portfolio as well as looking at all the data that we have for our existing assets and trying to understand where we have opportunity to really drive incremental value at those assets upon acquisition. And we've actually identified that even prior to acquisition to see where we can unlock value. That's not only from an operation standpoint, but also ROI opportunities. And as you know, we have a very, very robust CapEx team as well. So when we are identifying those opportunities we -- it's not only from the revenue opportunity side, but also analyzing the cost metrics of what an ROI opportunity looks like and feeling confident about the returns that we'll get on any ROI opportunity that we invest in. And the same goes for when we are looking at doing asset management. Our enterprise analytics team particularly our revenue management and BI team work very closely with our managers to identify opportunities do a lot of proof of concepts at our properties. And we're always first-to-market, whether that's related to technology leveraging, new technology to drive productivity improvements or if it's just coming up with new ways to really sell the hotels. So there is sort of at every touch point. I think from our perspective, it's not just at the asset-by-asset level, but also figuring out what meaningful drivers we can pull at a portfolio level. So we do a lot of comprehensive portfolio-related analytics which can really move the meter for our portfolio. So if we see a trend that's occurring at one or two hotels, and we know we can apply that across our portfolio, we will work with our brand partners, and our major managers to really drive that change. So I can get more granular, certainly on this topic, as you know I'm passionate about this, but I want to make sure we keep track of time here. David Katz : I appreciate that. The point being, are you able to prove to yourselves that this is an advantageous asset in the current environment? Sourav Ghosh : 100%. Because we have data down to every account level detail and I would say, it's not just quantitative data, frankly, we have done a lot of qualitative analysis. And what I mean by that is our revenue management teams or our BI teams, actually go out to the properties, every single property that we have in our portfolio, and understand the actual organizational structure, and the various processes that, they have in place. And it really is a partnership with our managers to drive improvements at our assets. And so we have a lot of best practices that, we are aware of, which we can certainly apply the time to make an acquisition. David Katz : Thank you. Operator : We have a final question from Anthony Powell at Barclays. Please post your question, your line is live. Anthony Powell : Thank you for fitting me in here. A question on development overall. I mean, can you give us an update on the prospects for the golf course development in Maui, maybe more broadly, I know hotel room specifically don't develop, but you guys have a lot of data you have a lot of expertise in construction. You may be one of the better positions to develop and we've seen the premium for newer assets in the market in terms of rate. So this cycle would have made more sense to explore development opportunities as the cycle continues and we recover? Jim Risoleo : Anthony, we're not typically a developer per se. We have developed a few properties over the course of time, most recently on an excess parking lot at our Westin Kierland and Phoenix, we build an AC Hotel, and we will work through the entitlement process and look to add value at the golf courses in Maui, and continue to really drive ROI projects, like we did with the 19 villas at the Andaz Wailea, and other properties like that. But I don't think you should expect us to be a greenfield developer, where we're out doing big ground-up deals. We just don't think that that is a good use of our capital. And I might add that as part of the Noble Investment, we do have the ability to participate in a development fund with Noble, and bring out our expertise to bear, and not tie up all of our capital on our balance sheet. So that's one of the reasons we made the strategic investment in Noble. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. The Q&A session has concluded. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Jim Risoleo for any closing remarks. Jim Risoleo : Well, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on our call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our quarterly results with you. We hope you enjoy the rest of your summer, and look forward to seeing many of you in-person this fall. Thank you for your continued support. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

With me on today's call will be Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Risoleo : Thank you, Jaime, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. We delivered strong performance during the third quarter turning a number of milestones in the recovery. Total food and beverage in group revenues exceeded 2019 for the first time since the onset of the pandemic and our EBITDA margin was 250 basis points better than 2019. During the third quarter, our adjusted EBITDAre was $328 million and our adjusted FFO per share was $0.38. Our all owned hotel EBITDA of $341 million in the third quarter was 15% above 2019, driven by continued rate strength, elevated out of room revenues and tight expense controls. All owned hotel revenues in the third quarter increased 4.9% over the third quarter of 2019 while all owned hotel operating expenses were up only 1.2%. All owned hotel RevPAR for the third quarter was $192, a 1.4% improvement over the third quarter of 2019. As a reminder, this is now the second consecutive quarter RevPAR has exceeded 2019 levels since the onset of the pandemic. While macroeconomic concerns continued to dominate the headlines, we are not seeing any signs of weakness in our business. When digress to 2008, the banking system is in good shape, levers levels are reasonable and consumers still have $1.7 trillion in excess savings with the majority concentrated in the top income brackets which gives us confidence to recovery in the lodging industry is sustainable. In a poll released by the Global Business Travel Association last month, the majority of companies indicated that they are not limiting travel specifically due to economic concerns and 78% of the participants expect volumes to increase in 2023. Consistent with normal seasonality in shifting business and market mix, we expect fourth quarter nominal RevPAR to be slightly above that over the third quarter as well as above the fourth quarter of 2019. Our recent acquisitions continue to contribute to our outperformance and are substantially ahead of our underwriting expectations. Based on updated expectations for full-year 2022, EBITDA from our seven 2021 hotel acquisition is expected to be approximately 100% above our underwriting expectations, already putting us better than our targeted stabilization range of 10 to 12 times EBITDA. Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired the Four Seasons Resort and Residences Jackson Hole, a 125 room luxury's or in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for approximately $315 million. The acquisition price represents a 13.6 times EBITDA multiple whereas 6.6% CAP rate on 2022 estimated results, is expected to be one of our top three assets based on full-year 2022 results with an estimate of RevPAR of $855, RevPAR of $1430 and an EBITDA per key of $185,000, further improving the quality of our portfolio. The resort is one of only a handful of luxury ski-in/ski-out resource in the United States. It sits on 6.3 acres in Teton Village, just steps from the gondola at the base of the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, one of the top-rated ski destinations in the country. The resort is located 20 minutes from downtown Jackson within close proximity to Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, a unique feature making it a year-round destination where future supply is expected to be severely restricted. Resort has 125 oversized rooms and suite with average approximately 650 square feet with Geyser places, balconies and dramatic use of the surrounding mountains and valleys. The property also features an additional 44 private residences which are not part of our ownership, ranging in size from 1700 square feet to 3700 square feet. Off the 44 residences, 30 currently participate in a rental program through the resort. From 2014 through 2019, the resort had a RevPAR CAGR of 5.8%, significantly outperforming the ultra-luxury set which had a RevPAR CAGR of 4.3% over the same time period. The resort which opened in 2003, underwent a comprehensive guest room renovation in 2022 and no disrupted capital expenditures are expected in the near term. In 2015, $15 million or $120,000 per key has been invested in the property. In addition, the Jackson Hole airport is undergoing a $65 million renovation and expansion which is it's scheduled to be complete at the end of this year. In 2021, non-stock price from six cities have been added to better accommodate year-round demand, shrinking shoulder seasons and increasing visitor growth. As it's typically the case, we took a conservative approach when underwriting this asset and we believe there is performance upside beyond 2022. As I just mentioned, earlier this year the resort underwent a comprehensive guest room renovation, the Jackson Hole airport was closed for approximately three months. By continuing to grow year-round occupancy to historical levels and repositioning the food and beverage outlets in the public spaces, we expect the resort to stabilize at approximately an 11 to 13 times EBITDA in the 2026 to 2028 timeframe. With built-in winter and summer demand generators, a lack of competition and no new supply on the horizon, we believe the Four Seasons Jackson Hole is positioned to outperform over the long-term. On the distributions front, during the third quarter we sold the 254 key Chicago Marriott Suites Downers Grove for $16 million. The hotel is expected to need $15 million of investment over the next five years. Looking back on our transaction activities since 2018, we had acquired $3.5 billion of assets and a 13.7 times EBITDA multiple a dispose of $4.9 billion of assets and a 17 times EBITDA multiple including $954 million of an estimated foregone capital expenditures. Impairing all owned hotel 2019 results for our current portfolio to 2017, we have increased the RevPAR of our assets by 12%, EBITDA per key by 26%, EBITDA margins by 190 basis points and avoided considerable business disruptio0n associated with capital projects. Turning to third quarter operations, our all owned hotel revenue was up nearly 5% to third quarter of 2019, driven by 16% rate growth. We estimate that Hurricane Ian impacted our third quarter RevPAR growth by 40 basis points and all owned hotel EBITDA by $3 million when comparing to the third quarter of 2019. The majority of the impact came from Hyatt Regency Coconut Point and the Ritz-Carlton, Naples. We expect fourth quarter RevPAR growth to be negatively impacted by 250 basis points while adjusted EBITDAre to be impacted $17 million. Despite a brief loss of commercial power and damage to the properties grounds, pools and amenities, the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point remained open to first responders. The hotel is expected to reopen to guests in mid-November and we expect the water park to reopen in the second quarter of 2023. The Ritz-Carlton, Naples beach is expected to remain closed for the remainder of the year and into 2023. A phased reopening strategy is being evaluated and we will provide additional information when it is available. From an insurance perspective, our deductible is limited to $15 million and we expect to collect business interruption insurance over a still too early estimate when we will receive those payments. And turning back to the third quarter results. Transient revenue was up 2% compared to third quarter of 2019, and rate was up 25%. Growth continues to be driven by our Sunbelt and Hawaiian properties which achieved double digit rate growth over 2019 at its six consecutive quarter. Our resort properties continue to outperform with transient revenue up more than 30% to third quarter 2019 driven by 64% transient rate growth at our 16 resorts. We have four resorts with transient rate above $1000 for the quarter and this marks the second consecutive quarter where our newly acquired Alila Ventana Big Sur achieved transient rate above $2000. Our urban and downtown hotels saw continued progress with 2% transient demand growth over the second quarter and makes more than 8% above the third quarter of 2019. Turning to group, business continue to surge back at our hotels during the third quarter. Group revenue was up over 3% in the third quarter of 2019 for the first time driven by 6% rate growth. In the third quarter, our hotel sold 991,000 group rooms, just 2.6% behind the third quarter of 2019 and we continue to be encouraged by net booking activity in the quarter for the quarter. For the full-year 2022, we currently have 3.7 million definite group room nights on the books with an increase of 200,000 room nights on the second quarter. This represents approximately 82% of 2019 actual group room nights up from 80% last quarter. Group rate on the books for 2022 is up 6% to third quarter of 2019, a 90 basis point increase over last quarter. Total group revenue pace for the remainder of 2022 is down just 70 basis points for the same time 2019. As we look forward to 2023, we currently have 2.6 million definite group room nights on the books, an increase of 400,000 room nights since last quarter. Total group revenue pace is not only 5.8% driven by rate on the books being up over 6% to 2019. We expect the short-term nature of group bookings to continue over the near term and are encouraged by the large base we have on the books already. Sourav will get into more detail on business mix, markets, and our balance sheet in a few minutes. In addition to delivering operational improvements, we continue to execute on our three strategic objectives, all of which are aimed at elevating the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio. As a reminder, our objectives include redefining the hotel operating model with our managers, gaining market share at hotels through comprehensive renovations, and strategically allocating capital to development ROI projects. We are targeting a range of $147 million to $222 million of incremental stabilized EBITDA, on an annual basis from the initiatives and projects underlying, our three strategic objectives. We continue to make progress on the Marriott Transformational Capital Program, as we believe these renovations allow us to capture incremental market share. At the JW Marriott, Buckhead, which has a RevPAR index your gain of 13.2 points over trailing 12-month basis compared to its pre-renovation index. Trailing 12-month transient rates are up an 11% over 2019 and banquet revenue per group room night has increased by over 6%. In addition to the positive momentum we are seeing at the JW Marriott, Buckhead, we have seen a RevPAR index share gain of a 11.7 points at our New York Marriott Downtown on a trailing 12-month basis compared to its pre-renovation index a 7.6 point gain at the Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island, all far exceeding our targeted range of three to five points of RevPAR index gains at renovated assets. In addition to the 16 Marriott Transformational Capital Program assets, we have eight hotels where we have completed or in the process of completing comprehensive renovations. This includes the Don CeSar located in the St. Pete Beach, Florida. The renovated resort is a phenomenal performer for us with a RevPAR index share gain of 12.8 points over its pre-renovation average. In closing, as macroeconomic concerns continue to play out, we believe our capital allocation efforts over the past few years and our quarter's balance sheet leave us very well-positioned to navigate any challenges that might lie ahead. We have worked with our managers to redefine the operating model, manipulated reinvested in our assets and maintained a strong investment great balance sheet. We will continue to be patient and opportunistic as we position our portfolio for outperformance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav. Sourav Ghosh : Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on our third quarter operations, full year guidance, and our balance sheet. Starting with topline performance, rate continues to drive the RevPAR upside, especially at our Sunbelt and Hawaii hotels where rate was up more than 25% to the third quarter of 2019. Rates at our urban and downtown hotels surpassed 2019 levels for the first time since the onset of the pandemic with rates 4% above the third quarter of 2019. Turning to business mix. Overall transient revenue was up 2% over the third quarter of 2019, driven by 25% rate growth. Holiday's throughout the quarter and into October continue to recover from an occupancy perspective with Columbus Day achieving the highest holiday occupancy post-pandemic. Urban and downtown holiday occupancy growth outpaced Sunbelt and Hawaiian market with especially strong demand growth in Chicago, New York, and Washington D.C. Business transient revenue was down 22% to the third quarter of 2019 but volume improved 300 basis points over last quarter, driven by our hotels in New York, Washington D.C., Boston, and Seattle. Business transient rooms sold reached a new quarterly high in the recovery and August set the new monthly high water mark with more than a 120,000 rooms sold beating the prior record set in June. In September, the overall business transient rooms sold was slightly ahead of August when comparing to 2019, driven by our urban and downtown hotels and encouragingly business transient rates were up 3.1% to the third quarter of 2019. Looking specifically at recent business transient trends in urban and downtown markets, rooms sold were just 10% below 2019 in September, driven by San Francisco and Denver which exceeded 2019 level while New York was just 3% below 2019. Turning to Group. This quarter marks the first time that revenue had surpassed 2019 levels for group business overall. In addition, corporate and association group revenue surpassed 2019 levels marking 3000 milestones for our portfolio in the recovery. In the quarter, group total revenues including out of rooms spent was 5% above the third quarter of 2019, driven by a 6% increase in rate. In the quarter for the quarter, group room sold were up 20% over the third quarter of 2019. Group room revenue in Sunbelt and Hawaiian markets was up 13% driven by rates and room nights sold were above 2019 levels for the first time post-pandemic. At our newly renovated New York Marriott Marquis, group room nights were up 36% to the third quarter of 2019 as group demand returned and the transform property is being very well received. From New Year's Eve weekend, our hotels in New York already have 62% occupancy on the book at an average rate of $610, an improvement of 219% compared to 2019. Corporate group revenue exceeded the third quarter of 2019 by 70 basis points driven by a 9% improvement in rate. Our hotels and resorts in New York, Maui, Orlando, Phoenix, and Washington D.C. contributed to the revenue outperformance. The Southeastern group revenue was up 20 basis points to the third quarter of 2019, driven by 4% rates growth. San Diego hotels drove most of the improvement benefitting from eleven citywide conferences. The Chicago hotels also benefitted from multiple cities wide group during the third quarter. Wrapping up on group with Social, Military, Educational, Religious, and Fraternal or SMERF groups revenue was up 14% compared to the third quarter of 2019, driven by a 20% increase in rooms sold at our urban and downtown hotels. Shifting gears to expenses, all owned hotel expenses were up 1.2% to the third quarter of 2019. The slight increase to expenses was driven by higher utilities and property insurance despite region and benefit savings which were down 1.4% to the third quarter of 2019. As expected, the starting lag we faced early in the recover began to ease in the third quarter and our managers believe they are near desired staffing level for current business volumes. Wrapping up on expenses, we continue to expect our annual wage and benefit rate inflation for 2021 to 2022 to be in the 4% to 5% range. Taking our strong topline and expense controls together, our fourth quarter all owned hotel EBITDA margin came in at 28.7%, which is 250 basis points better than the third quarter of 2019. But it's important to note that we received the business interruption proceeds from the Falls Pool Project at the Orlando World Center Marriott in the third quarter which benefitted our margin by approximately 60 basis points. For the second quarter in a row, margins were higher than 2019 across all operating departments driven by strong rates and increase out of room revenues on the topline combined with expand sufficiency's. As it relates to our efforts to redefine the operating mode, both wages and benefit expenses and above property cost remained below 2019 levels. To-date, our operators have achieved approximately 70% of the $100 million to $150 million that is expected to come from potential long-term cost savings based on 2019 all owned hotel revenues. Moving on to our outlook for 2022. We have updated our full-year guidance ranges. Taking into account the impacts of Hurricane Ian, we expect full-year 2022 all owned RevPAR for our portfolio to be between $193 to $195 or down 3.75% to down 2.75% to full-year 2019, which implied that our fourth quarter RevPAR will be slightly above the fourth quarter of 2019. Just so the RevPAR implies an adjusted EBITDA ROE of $1,470,000,000 to $1,500,000,000 at an all owned hotel EBITDA margin of 31.6% to 31.9%. It is worth noting that our all owned hotel metrics do not include the Four Seasons Jackson Hole. For reference, we estimate that Hurricane Ian negatively impacted our full-year RevPAR range by 70 basis points, our TrevPAR range by an 80 basis points, our adjusted EBITDA by $20 million and our all owned hotel EBITDA margin by 10 basis points. Despite the impacts of the hurricane, the midpoint of our updated full-year guidance ranges are still slightly above our 2019 all owned hotel results as presented on pages 28 and 29 of our supplemental financial information. These estimated ranges are driven by continued rate strength across our portfolio, a strong success season and a continued recovery in demand. Additional guidance details can be found in the reconciliations of our third quarter 2022 earnings release. Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity position, our weighted average maturity is 4.8 years at a weighted average interest rate of 4.1% and we have no significant maturities until 2024. As of today's call, we have $2.2 billion in total available liquidity which includes $187 million of FF&E reserves and full availability of our $1.5 billion credit facility. Adjusting for the Four Seasons Jackson Hole acquisition and using the midpoint of our full-year 2022 EBITDAre guidance of $1,480,000,000, we would expect our year-end 2022 net leverage to be at 2.4 times looking unchanged from the third quarter. Wrapping up, in October we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share. All future dividends are subject to approval by the Company's Board of Directors, though we expect to be able to maintain a quarterly dividend at a sustainable level taking into consideration potential macroeconomic factors. As we consider future dividends, we intend to revert to a pre-pandemic announcement cadence. As a reminder, our fourth quarter dividend announcement would typically come in mid-December. To conclude, we believe our portfolio, our balance sheet, and our team are well-positioned to continue outperforming and we will continue to be strategic in the current macroeconomic environment. With that, we would be happy to take your questions. To ensure we have time to address as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Neil Malkin from Capital One Securities. Your line is live. Neil Malkin : Hi, thank you. Thanks, everyone. Good morning. Jim, my question is related to potential opportunities to put your balance sheet to work over 2023 I guess or the next 12-to-18 months. You cited elevated time-based maturities. Obviously the brands are reinstating PIPs and lot of the debt market dislocation, unattractive terms as well. So, it seems like someone in your position with the balance sheet and you guys having the liquidity would be prime to take advantage of potential distress. Can you just talk about how you see that shaping up, what opportunities could look like next year? Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Sure Neil, happy to share a little bit of color with you on how we think the market might evolve going forward. You correctly point out that we are in a unique position given the strength of our balance sheet. Being the only investment-grade lodging REIT and finishing this year, based on our guidance to the midpoint, a 2.4 times leverage puts us in a very unique position. I really believe that the fact that we were an all cash buyer gave us a competitive advantage in the Four Season Jackson Hole our acquisition. So, and we're able to move fast, we're able to continue to more talk of our relationships with owners and others in the industry and take that deal down with the closing period of less than 30 days from the time that we find the ROI. So, it puts us in a unique position as we look out into 2023 and '24, there's really a couple of different areas that I think acquisition opportunities may present themselves. And the CMBS market for full service hotel maturities in 2023, there's more than $7 billion. Our CMBS market for hotel maturity, full service hotel maturities in 2024 is over $10 billion. What we're seeing already to our inbound calls from all the hotels who have loans coming due over the next year to two years reaching out on a direct basis to see if we might have any interest in buying their property. Because it's going to be very difficult to refinance your loan apart plus the capital win for the assets that have been started from a PIP perspective. And you're correct in saying that the brands are now starting to reinstate PIPs, I think they were very lenient as well a lot of lenders during the pandemic but and now we're clearly through that period of time and we're seeing a lot of pressure not only in the CMBS market but from the brand company and also from the banks. The banks I think they are going to be taking a bit more of a firmer position and not kick the can down the road as we get into '23 and '24. So, we are delighted to be positioned where we are. We certainly intend to use the balance sheet, we will continue to be very disciplined in our capital allocation decisions and when we underwrite a deal, we underwrite it in a very conservative manner. And I think I mentioned in my remarks that our seven hotel acquisitions that we completed last year had beat our pro forma underwriting by a 100%. And we're excited to carry that all forward and look forward to the opportunities that may present themselves. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Smedes Rose from Citi. Your line is live. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. Jim, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about this Four Season's acquisition in Jackson Hole on the pricing side. And do you feel like that kind of the level at 13.6 times EBITDA is at a discount where it might have been a couple of years ago or do these kinds of assets just not really see that much fluctuation in pricing in your view. And then, maybe I don\u2019t know if you can comment but and there are another 12 or so hotels that were in the strategic portfolio presumably Daijain [ph] continued some of DeSalvo. And then what's kind of your interest level there? Jim Risoleo : Sure, Smedes. Let me talk about the process a little bit that brought us the Four Season. They brought three hotels to market. There has been a public announcement regarding the Four Season strain. I don\u2019t believe I'm in a position to really talk about the other asset given that we signed a confidentiality agreement. But suffices to say that we underwrote all three of the properties that were brought to market and we just couldn\u2019t get our arms around pricing for the other two assets. And that\u2019s why we pursue the Four Season Jackson Hole. And with respect to Jackson Hole in particular, this asset typically would trade at a multiple that's 15 times EBITDA or north a bit. And EBITDA is elevated, it's had a really terrific run during the pandemic. It's been discovered by a lot of people and it's a really unique iconic greenery place for hotel, right at the steps away from the gondola at Jackson Hole. Then the metrics that we purchased then onward, 13.6 times and at 6.6 CAP rate on 2022 results. And a couple of things that I think are really relevant when you talk about pricing on this asset are the following. I mentioned that the Jackson Hole airport is undergoing a renovation and expansion, was actually closed for three months this past summer. So, that crimped demand into the resort. Secondly, the property underwent a complete guest room and bathroom renovation which caused significant business disruption. So, as we look at it, we believe that 2022 performance was actually muted. And as that, the hotel renovation and expansion wraps up by the end of this year, we feel that the hotel the resort can get back to historical levels of occupancy. Which is the property is really unique because it is a Four Season resort. It's a Four Seasons property but it's a Four Season's resort that happens to be a ski resort as well with proximity to Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, that's really a unique asset. So, we're delighted to own it. We see some asset management opportunities to create additional value as we typically do when we underwrite a deal. And we'll see where it goes moving forward for us. With respect to the other 12 properties, TBD whether or not or when they bring those assets to market. But again, given our balance sheet and given our relationship and given our performance on this transaction, we think we are really in a strong position to be a buyer of choice to some of these other assets. They got some terrific properties left like the Ritz-Carlton Laguna, Ritz-Carlton Half Moon Bay, they have a number of other Four Season's properties including the Four Season's in Austin, the Four Season's in Palo Alto. And so, I think they're sellers and I think we are given our balance sheet, our strength, our relationship, I think we are the buyer of choice. Smedes Rose : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sean Kelly from Bank of America. Your line is live. Sean Kelly : Hi, good morning everyone. Jim as well just trying to kind of gauge the sequential pattern in the recovery here. We're seeing a little bit more bifurcation across the space a little bit just as we get into the more mature phase of the recovery and the bounce back incorporating group. So, and you're going to go boil down your outlook for the fourth quarter, are just overall trends we think about leisure in a group and BT. Are they a little bit better for you sequentially in 4Q relative to 3Q and if so what's kind of driving that give us a little bit of color on what you're able to see out over the next couple of months? Jim Risoleo : I'll start off by saying like when you look at our fourth quarter guidance, even once you take out the negative impact of Ian, we actually raised the guidance RevPAR by 25 bips and this was to the midpoint, obviously and adjusted EBITDA by $7.5 million. So obviously, when you look at sort of our expectations for fourth quarter, we continue to be optimistic in terms of all segments of demand. From a BT perspective, there has been sequential improvement month-over-month and when you look at specifically September, for urban downtown hotels, BT was down just 10%, which is really encouraging in San Francisco and Denver, as we've been showing on the prepared remarks was actually above \u201819 levels in New York was just shy of 3% to \u201819. So these are rates are holding strong. The holiday season is looking really good. Thanksgiving is pacing really well with total revenue is actually up 5% with rates up close to 40%. The same holds true for Christmas rates are up 40%. The only thing on the group side for Q4 to keep in mind when you think about absolute room nights is a couple of things. A) Is the Jewish holidays, both Jewish holidays, fell in September in '19 whereas that was split for 2022 one fell in September one in October? So that's going to obviously have a negative impact for Q4. And so as the midterm elections, which is also going to have somewhat of a negative impact in terms of absolute room nights, but rate is pacing ahead. We've picked up meaningful amount of group room nights for not only in the quarter for the quarter for Q3 but booked about 129,000 room nights for Q4 which is 10%, above 2019. So all in all, still very positive trajectory, have confidence and hence we raised our overall guidance, despite the impact of Ian. Sean Kelly : Thank you very much for that. And then just as a follow up sort of just going layer deeper, you talked about the sort of the BT magnitude improving and getting close in a number of markets. Any thoughts or any color you can provide on sort of large corporate activity relative to small we are getting into negotiated rate season. And I believe that that's going to be, I think Marriott talked about it earlier today, being up double digits but just can you give us a little bit of color on just how they're behaving? Are you seeing small and medium and some of your channel partners delivering more demand in small and medium channels? And then large corporates are just how people are acting on the ground a little bit. Jim Risoleo : Sure. Through the course of the year, actually we have been seeing more uptake off large corporate groups coming in started off with more small medium size, and we saw a decent pickup of large. What we are overall AI in terms of just tailwind for next year. The big piece, which is still remaining is sort of the large associations, and citywide business. And frankly, with the large associations, they all have a governing board, which needs to determine which city they'll hold their events at which hotels they will pick. Though a lot of the decisions are going to be made effectively over the next two months. So we expect booking activity on those large associations do need to pick up in the first quarter of '23. But overall, through the course of the year, we've actually seen an uptick in more larger groups as to what we saw in the beginning of the year, which was more small, medium sized groups. And frankly, the rate is holding, rates for next year. That's up over 6% what we have on the books for our definite group of nights that we have in the box. And on special corporate negotiations, that really is still in progress. And we had said earlier and so at the management companies we expect to end up in sort of the high single digits once it's all said and done. Sean Kelly : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore. Your  line is live. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thank you. I'm wondering if you could just provide some perspective on how you evaluate capital allocation. What is the process or the metrics you use to balance? How do we think about incremental share repurchase for versus investing in your own existing properties versus opportunistic asset purchases? Jim Risoleo : Sure, Duane. We are in a unique position to have the balance sheet that allows us to allocate capital in a number of different areas. If we look at the potential acquisition of an asset, like the Four Seasons, Jackson Hole, property of that nature is not going to come to market on a regular basis. I really feel that if we hadn't acquired that asset, it was likely to be acquired by somebody who would likely never sell that hotel. So capital allocation decisions are made based on elevating the EBITDA gross profile of portfolio, returning capital to shareholders when we think that's appropriate. And at a moment in time. This asset was available now and that's why we elected to make the acquisition. So we are going to continue to be prudent in our capital allocation decisions. We're going to look at what we think is the best use of our funds. As you know, we have been very forthright in investing in our portfolio from 2020 through 2022 we have deployed $1.5 billion of capital in our existing assets. We will have fully reposition 24 properties, 16 in the Marriott transformational capital program plus an additional eight that are really outperforming our expectations and creating long term shareholder value, which is really our overriding objective. As we think about capital allocation, the RevPAR gains that we are seeing are generally approaching double digit if not higher, and that puts us in a position to outperform the competition. And we think that is a really smart use of capital going forward. That's not to say if we don't see opportunities down the road to continue to use our balance sheet that we won't be in the market buying back shares. So as I said, on the second quarter call, we think this is a time to be patient to see what comes down the road. And as we can see today, there's a lot of dislocation occurring, given the Fed meeting yesterday, and what's happening with the Pound versus the U.S. dollar. So we're all in a very good position going forward. We like even a multiple on the Four Seasons, Jackson Hole as well at 13.6 times for a luxury resort that we feel is going to outperform going forward. And we'll bring that into a stabilized EBITDA multiple of 11 to 13 times over the next several years. So that's how we think about it. And there's, it's not, we don't put peanut butter in a piece of toast when we're thinking about how we're going to deploy capital. But we look at all the opportunities that are available for us. Duane Pfennigwerth : I appreciate those thoughts, Jim. And if I could just ask a follow up on Florida. Not the first time we've seen storm activity or hurricane activity. Can you talk about maybe holiday bookings or the strength of peak leisure bookings in Florida ex the Gulf Coast and are you seeing perhaps any benefit in properties ex-southwest Florida, from this disruption? Jim Risoleo : Well, we actually were in a position to move some business from the Ritz Carlton, Naples, to our Four Seasons Resort Orlando, right after the hurricane hit, we moved a very sizable wedding group to that property. The Ritz Carlton Golf Lodge, which was not affected by Ian, has been running full out. Groups that we had at the beach resort that we moved over there. So that property is really picked up business. Maybe Sourav can perhaps get into a little bit of detail around what we're seeing for the holidays because it's very strong across the board. And the Naples property is going to remain closed through the balance of this year to 2023 and we're looking at various stage reopening options. When we have more information we will certainly share that with everyone. Coconut Point is going to be back in business in the next week or so. And the only part of that property that is still in a state of disrepair is the Waterpark, really, which we hope to have back on by April. So it's very unfortunate that this happens. But it's the business that we're in, and we're very well prepared to manage through the process, and to move business to our other resorts that didn't suffer any damage. With that I will let Sourav talk a little bit about holiday bookings. Sourav Ghosh : Yes. There is definitely compression that's happening in the overall Florida market, not specifically in any specific market within Florida. But just overall, we're seeing that compression offer. What I will say is the business equal, what we're seeing is room nights certainly have picked up in the last couple of weeks. But what's so interesting is the rates have really gone through the roof, relative to '19. Like I mentioned, our overall portfolio, that rate is north of 40%. We are seeing similar trends upload as well. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Jim Risoleo : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Chris Woronka from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. Chris Woronka : Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for all the details so far. We talked a lot about the impressive run rate growth rate that we're continuing to see. Haven't heard as much about kind of the ancillary pricing on some of the group business, like the catering and things like that. And where I'm going with it is I'm trying to kind of triangulate looking ahead. You've made a lot of progress on margins, across the hotels, but next year, as we get a heavier group mix, versus this year, do you think you have moved margins and prices up enough on the some of the ancillary group stuff to kind of offset the impact of cleaning more rooms as occupancy presumably goes higher next year? Sourav Ghosh : Absolutely. I think let me start off by saying that banquet and catering business has been very strong for the third quarter, we were up 6% in 2019 on absolute basis and when you look at it on a per room night basis, we were up 8.7%. So clearly, the folks that are coming into our hotels, the groups that are coming in are spending significantly more. And what's been great is when you look at the food cost and the beverage costs across our portfolio, it is actually better than what it was in 2019. So certainly our managers along closely work with asset managers as well are adjusting menu pricing on a real time basis to really adjust for any inflationary pressures. So overall, that's how we've been able to, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, how we've been able to really drive margin performance across all departments. And we feel very confident that the measures that we have in place and the long term initiatives that we have worked through over the past 12 to 18 months are sustainable. And we definitely are looking at margin expansion going into next year relative to '19. Chris Woronka : Yes, thanks Sourav. Just a quick, quick follow up on that if I can, when you talk about some of the group revenues, are you talking more on pricing increases? Or is there a way to kind of look at is the take rate or attachment similar or higher than it was on 2019 as well? Sourav Ghosh : It's both. Take rate definitely is higher. Groups are definitely spending more than they did. And pricing has adjusted as well. But I would say it's not just a function of pricing. Certainly we are seeing groups asking for more. And frankly, buying more premium shelf menu items as well as premium sort of shell bar options as well. That's what they're what they're picking. So it's both. Chris Woronka : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Aryeh Klein from BMO. Your line is live. Aryeh Klein : Thanks. You've made ultra-high end properties a clear focus, and there are certainly plenty of concerns around the macro and luxury hasn't historically done well in a recession. Is there any nuance within high end luxury resorts that suggested behaves differently than the rest of luxury? Jim Risoleo : Luxury resorts have consistently outperformed. Our ultra-luxury resorts already have consistently outperformed, luxury and every other property type over time. So as an example, as we looked at the Four Seasons Resort Jackson Hole, looking at the performance of that property from 2014 to 2019, it had a 5.8% RevPAR CAGR. The ultra-luxury resort generally had a RevPAR CAGR during that same timeframe of 4.3%. So clearly, ultra-luxury outperforms and this asset in particular outperforms the ultra-luxury set. So as we evaluated back in 2018, the one hotel [indiscernible] when we first really dug into how ultra-luxury performs and how it\u2019s performed over time and we look back as far as 1992 today at different timeframes to see how these assets hold up during downturns, during recessions. The other thing I would point out, as we sit today is the $1.7 trillion of excess savings that's still in the system, 80% of that are in that savings amount, it's in the upper income brackets. So we're certainly not seeing any pullback on ultra-luxury performance and I expect that going forward, it's going to hold up very well if we were to suffer any sort of slowdown. One of the assets that we acquired last year, which is the Four Seasons Resort Orlando, at Walt Disney World, we bought that asset I think it was a 16.8 times EBITDA multiple on 2019 performance. It's going to finish this year, eight times EBITDA multiple on our purchase price. So I think as this further testament to how ultra-luxury is performing, the same thing has happened with the Alila Ventana that's going to finish the year at eight times EBITDA and not seeing any slowdown in booking trends, zero resistance to ADR growth. Aryeh Klein : Thanks. And then just Sourav can you just talk to the remaining 30% of redefining the operating model and maybe the timing around that? Sourav Ghosh : Sure. That's sort of still evolving like I'd mentioned on previous calls, a part of it is just evolving brand standards. And we continue to work with our managers to identify brand standards that we can completely eliminate or modify. Some of it just frankly, just takes a little more time. And especially as business comes back to normalcy and you have more of the frequent guests coming back to the hotels, you just have a better sample set to make those determinations as to what brand standards make sense on a stabilized perspective. The other piece, which will take a little more time, we are have a lot of proof of concepts and pilots going on our hotels is just looking at various technology that can drive productivity improvements, just overall efficiencies of the hotel, whether it's incremental revenue or whether it's just reducing expenses, all kinds of different sort of technologies that we can leverage. Frankly, that's sort of your test hardware, there are things to it, and you do multiple pilots and see what works best, and then you sort of roll it up across the portfolio. So I would say you're looking at probably next 12 to 18 months for some of this and in some cases, some technologies are probably 20 months out before we can really roll it out across a portfolio. Aryeh Klein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jay Kornreich from SMBC. Your line is live. Jay Kornreich : Thank you. Good morning. I just taking the flip side of the acquisition conversation as many companies are looking at the balance sheet and going on the defensive ahead of the possible recession. Given the uncertainty of the microphone, what would you need to see to take a more defensive stance and hold that position in the [indiscernible] more capital to the balance sheet? Jim Risoleo : Let me start by saying, Jay that at this point in time, we're not seeing any signs of weakness in any of our segments, Leisure group and business transients and that is not only for the balance of this year, but that's as we look out into 2023. Now, of course, we don't have budgets yet for 2023 and we're not giving guidance for 2023 at this point in time, but we feel that we're really set up quite well to continue to perform, outperform as we move into 2023. If we started to see business transit follow up, if we started to see a real impact in the job market, we started to see corporate groups not booking or canceling. We would become more defensive. Now, that said, I think we're in a terrific position sitting here today, at 2.4 times leverage. We truly have a fortress balance sheet. We don't have any maturity in 2024. And the maturity that we have is a $400 million bond issue in 2024 that being investment grade, we're always going to have access to the debt markets granted, it might be a little more expensive than the current pricing, but we're going to be able to do what we need to do. Our entire portfolio with the exception, I think of two assets is fully unencumbered. So having been through slowdowns and downturns in the past, we keep a keen eye on this demand generators. And if we see things starting to turn us out, then we'll get a little more conservative and defensive. Jay Kornreich : Okay, thanks for the color. And then just as a follow up tangentially, on the topic of raising capital. Are there any other assets you've highlighted that you'd like to either dispose of or markets you'd like to have less exposure to? Jim Risoleo : Well, we continually look at what actions we can take to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of hosts. And in the context of the Jackson Hole deal that does give us an opportunity to effectuate a reverse like kind exchange, if we can put a portfolio together and get fair value. To do that in this market, it's likely we would have to provide seller financing. And we'd be prepared to do that with the right sponsor, and on the right terms. The assets that we've disposed off, have really gone a long way toward helping us to elevate the EBITDA gross profile of the company, even last year. Just to summarize, between 2018 and 2022, we bought $3.5 billion of assets at a $13.7 times EBITDA multiple. We dispose of $4.9 billion at a 17 times EBITDA multiple and that takes into account close to a billion dollars that avoided CapEx. And it also allowed us to not suffer the attendant business disruption that would occur with that. So that is where we would go -- going forward. If we can get the right pricing, and we have the right sponsor, we are prepared to transact additional asset sales over the next six months to a year and a half or so. Jay Kornreich : Thanks. That's very helpful. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is live. David Katz : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Covered a lot of ground but I wondered if you could just circle back and comment on appetite views, perspectives on urban assets and various sort of ranges of cities versus leisure/resort type assets and how you're thinking about those categories? Jim Risoleo : David, it really comes down to pricing and growth. And if we feel that we can buy an urban asset at the right price and that it's going to perform in a manner that's going to EBITDA gross profile of the company, taking into account capital considerations and renovations and all other items associated with owning a hotel, with buying the hotel, then I would say it in a broad sense, there's really no market that has a red line drawn through it today. We are going to continue to be really thoughtful about geographic diversification and outside of Maui or Oahu and where we have 12% of our EBITDA coming out of both of those markets. There is no one single market in the country where we have more than 10% or even a coming out today in 2022. The two I believe that at 10% are Orlando and San Diego two terrific markets. So as we think about allocating capital, we think it's important that we maintain a very geographically diverse portfolio and that we put capital in places where we're going to be able to generate outsized returns. David Katz : Just that simple. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. To be respectful of other calls that's all the time we have for today. I will now hand the conference back to Jim Risoleo for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Jim Risoleo : Well, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on our call today. We truly appreciate the opportunity to discuss our quarterly results with you. I hope you enjoy the holiday season and I look forward to seeing many of you in Nareit in a few weeks. Thank you for your continued support. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jamie Marcus, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Jamie Marcus : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, please note that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre, and hotel-level results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in yesterday's earnings press release and our 8-K filed with the SEC, and in the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. With me on today's call are Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Risoleo : Thank you, Jamie. And thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. We ended the year with strong operating improvements across our portfolio driven by continued rate strength. For the full year 2022, we delivered adjusted EBITDAre of 1.498 billion, all owned hotel EBITDA of $1.573 billion in all owned hotel RevPAR of $196, which helped us achieve the high-end of our full year 2022 guidance range. During the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $364 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.44. Our all owned hotel EBITDA of $373 million in the fourth quarter was 5% above 2019, driven by rate strength out of room revenues, and expense efficiencies resulting from operating improvements. All owned hotel RevPAR for the fourth quarter was approximately $197, a 60-basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2019. As a reminder, fourth quarter operations were impacted by Hurricane Ian, yet RevPAR all owned hotel EBITDA and EBITDA margins, though exceeded 2019 levels for the third consecutive quarter since the onset of the pandemic. All owned hotel revenues in the fourth quarter were up 1.1% over the fourth quarter of 2019. While all owned hotel operating expenses were down 40 basis points. In addition to delivering strong operating improvements over the course of 2022, we continued to be recognized as a global leader in corporate responsibility. While we work toward achieving our 2025 environmental and social targets, we introduced our 2050 vision of becoming a net positive company, which is detailed in our 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report. We now have a total of 10 LEED certified properties, including three LEED Gold hotels, plus our corporate headquarters. In addition, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index World which recognizes global sustainability leaders across all industries for the fourth consecutive year, and we were included in the DJSI North America for the sixth consecutive year. Additionally, we were once again included among the world's most sustainable companies in S&P's Global Sustainability Yearbook and named one of America's most responsible companies by Newsweek. Subsequent to quarter-end, we amended and restated our existing $2.5 billion credit facility to further enhance the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet. The agreement reflects no increase in pricing and incorporates our industry leading commitment to ESG by adding incentives linked to portfolio sustainability initiatives, including Green Building Certifications and Renewable Energy Consumption. On the capital allocation front, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.7 billion shares at an average price of $15.93 per share through our common share repurchase program, bringing our total repurchases for the quarter to $27 million. We have approximately $973 million remaining capacity under the repurchase program. While macroeconomic headwinds continue to dominate the headlines, we remain optimistic about the state of travel for several reasons. First, although leisure rates are moderating, they remain well above 2019 levels. For context, transient rates at our resorts were 52% above 2019 in the fourth quarter, compared to 64% in the third quarter. Second, in the fourth quarter, we booked 400,000 group rooms for 2023. In total group revenue pace is down only 70 basis points to the same time 2019. Third, while business transient demand has been uneven, revenue driven by this segment improved 440 basis points compared to 2019 on a quarterly sequential basis. Small and medium-sized businesses are driving the business transient recovery, and they represent a larger share of our corporate demand today. According to American Express Global Business Travel, transactions by this segment reached 80% of pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter. Our recent acquisitions continued to contribute to our outperformance and are substantially ahead of our underwriting expectations. Based on full year 2022 results, even up from the seven hotels we acquired in 2021 put us at the bottom-end of our targeted range of 10x to 12x EBITDA, well ahead of our plan stabilization period. Looking back on our transaction activity since 2018, we have acquired $3.5 billion of assets at a 13.7x EBITDA multiple and dispose of $4.9 billion of assets at 17x EBITDA multiple, including $954 million of estimated foregone capital expenditures. It is worth noting that this quarter, we moved the 2017 comparison of our all owned hotel results from 2019 to 2022, as our 2022 results reflect more normalized operations. Comparing all owned hotel 2022 results for our current portfolio to 2017. We have increased the RevPAR of our assets by 9%, [indiscernible] by 15%, the EBITDA per key by 31% and avoided considerable business disruption associated with capital projects. Moving back to fourth quarter operations and starting with the hurricane update, we estimate that Hurricane Ian impacted our fourth quarter RevPAR growth by 220 basis points, our adjusted EBITDAre by $15 million and our all owned hotel EBITDA margin by 40 basis points. On a full year basis that translates to an all owned hotel RevPAR impact of 60 basis points and all owned hotel EBITDA impact of $18 million and an all owned hotel EBITDA margin impact of 10 basis points. As a reminder, the Hyatt Regency coconut point opened in November, and we expect to reopen the remaining pool facilities in Water Park in June. The Ritz-Carlton, Naples remains closed, and we are targeting a phased reopening strategy beginning this summer. Reconstruction at the Ritz-Carlton will enhance the resilience of the property by elevating critical equipment, introducing dry flood-proofing measures and replacing major equipment with more efficient machinery. In addition, while the hotel is closed, we are avoiding future disruption by executing planned capital projects that would have otherwise impacted operations. While we are still evaluating the total financial impacts of the storm, we currently estimate the total property damage and remediation costs for all impacted properties in Florida to be between $200 million and $220 million. We are insured for $325 million per name windstorm with a $15 million deductible resulting in potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs. Based on our current reopening plans for Ritz-Carlton, Naples, we believe our insurance coverage is sufficient to cover substantially all the property damage as well as the near-term loss of business. Thus far this year, we have received approximately $50 million of insurance proceeds related to our plans. Continuing with fourth quarter results. Transient revenue was up 60 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 with strong rate increases making up for the volume shortfall resulting from lower business transient demand, light cancellations during the holidays, colder weather in Florida and hurricane displacement at Hyatt Coconut Point and Ritz-Carlton, Naples. Revenue growth was driven by Orlando, Phoenix and Hawaii, which offset declines in San Francisco and the Florida Gulf Coast. Our resort properties continue to outperform with 13% transient rate growth over 2021. In the fourth quarter, we had 6 resorts with transient rates above $1,000 led by the Four Seasons Jackson Hole at over $2,200 and the Four Seasons Orlando at close to $2,000. Turning to Group. This is the second consecutive quarter group revenue exceeded 2019 driven by 10% rate growth. In the fourth quarter, our hotels sold 954,000 group rooms, bringing our total group room nights sold for 2022 to $3.8 million, which represents approximately 84% of 2019 actual group room nights. Total group revenue for 2022 was down just 11% to 2019 as 6% rate growth and [indiscernible] contribution helped to offset lower demand. In 2023, we currently have 2.9 million definite group room nights on the books which represents 80% of full year 2022 group room nights. This compares to 71% on the books at the same time last year for 2022, representing a 9-point improvement. Group rate on the books for 2023 is up nearly 6% to the same time last year, a 140-basis point increase since the third quarter. In addition, group revenue pace is up approximately 17% to the same time last year. We are very encouraged by the large group base we have on the books, particularly given short-term booking trends. Sourav will discuss more operational detail in our 2023 outlook in a few minutes. In addition to delivering operational improvements, we continue to execute on our three strategic objectives all of which are aimed at elevating the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio. As a reminder, our objectives include redefining the hotel operating model with our managers, gaining market share at hotels through comprehensive innovations, and strategically allocating capital to development ROI projects. As it relates to our first strategic objective, it is important to note that we have achieved the bulk of the $100 million to $150 million of expense savings associated with redefining the operating model. In order to achieve the high-end of the range, we will need to get back to 2019 business volumes and as of the fourth quarter, occupancy was still 10 points below the fourth quarter of 2019. Turning to portfolio reinvestment. Our 2023 capital expenditure guidance range is $600 million to $725 million, which reflects approximately $275 million of investment for redevelopment, repositioning in ROI projects. The projects include a transformational renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani. The Phoenician Canyon Suites filler expansion and completing construction of the tower expansion, guestroom renovation and lobby transformation at Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which was delayed by Hurricane Ian. To-date, we have completed 14 out of 16 assets in our Marriott transformational capital program, and we will complete the San Diego Marriott Marquis by the end of this month. The final property, the Washington Marriott and Metro Center is underway, and we expect it to be completed in May. It is worth noting that actual 2022 capital expenditures came in at the low-end of our guidance range. As such, the midpoint of our 2023 range is $160 million higher than last year, which is driven by carryover capital and an estimated $100 million to $125 million of capital expenditures related to hurricane restoration work, which we expect to be reimbursed by insurance claims. To conclude my remarks, we are extremely proud of the results we achieved in 2022, and we are confident that the quality of our portfolio, our ability to reinvest in our assets and our fortress balance sheet will allow us to continue our strong performance in 2023. With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav. Sourav Ghosh : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on our fourth quarter operations full year 2023 guidance and our balance sheet. Starting with business mix, overall transient revenue was up 60 basis points to the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by a 22% rate growth. Thanksgiving and the festive season saw RevPAR growth of 5% and 6% over 2019, respectively, driven by rate growth of over 30% for both periods. Despite impacts from flight cancellations and cold weather in Florida during the festive season, occupancy continued to increase sequentially this holiday. Looking ahead, holidays in the first quarter of 2023 are shaping up well. Martin Luther King Junior weekend achieved a revenue that was 22% above last year, driven by occupancy. Peasants' Day and Spring Break both have revenue pace ahead of 2022. Business transient revenue was down 18% to the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by 2% rate growth. This is a meaningful improvement from the start of 2022 when business transient revenue was down 48% to the first quarter of 2019. As we have discussed previously, properties are targeting high single-digit business transient rate growth in 2023. During the fourth quarter, business transient demand was in line with pre-pandemic monthly seasonality and was driven by San Francisco, Washington D.C. and New York, with New York just 5% behind 2019. Turning to group. This marks the second quarter the revenue has surpassed 2019 levels. Group room revenues were 2% above the fourth quarter of 2019 driven by 10% rate growth. While overall group room demand was down 8% to 2019, properties in New York and Phoenix achieved group demand above 2019 levels. The short-term booking trend continued with in the quarter, for the quarter group rooms sold up 21% over the fourth quarter of 2019. The majority of the rooms booked were in Washington D.C., San Diego, San Francisco and New York. Corporate Group revenue was up 6% in the quarter, surpassing 2019 for the second quarter in a row, driven by a 14% rate increase. Our performance was driven by hotels in Orlando, Phoenix, Maui, New York and New Orleans. All 3 months in the quarter had corporate group revenue ahead of 2019 driven by rate and revenue was up substantially at both convention and resort properties. Association Group revenue was down 16% in the fourth quarter compared to 2019 despite rate growth of over 7%. The revenue decline was driven by volume losses in San Francisco, Boston and New Orleans. However, San Diego, New York and Phoenix had association group demand ahead of 2019 levels. While association revenue was down in the fourth quarter, we saw meaningful pickup in booking activity for future years in the month of December. Additionally, rates compared to 2019 improved sequentially each month in the quarter from up 3% in October to up 15% in December. Wrapping up on groups with social, military, educational, religious and fraternal or SMERF groups, revenue was up 29% over 2019 driven equally by a 14% increase in rooms sold and a 13% increase in rate. Sports teams and weddings drove increases in Washington D.C., Los Angeles and New Orleans. Shifting gears to margins and expenses, our fourth quarter all owned hotel EBITDA margin came in at 29.5%, which is 110 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2019. We attribute the margin expansion to strong rates and increased out-of-room revenues, combined with operating model expense efficiencies despite the fact that Hurricane Ian negatively impacted margins by 40 basis points in the fourth quarter. As expected, the margin gap to 2019 narrowed relative to prior quarters due to continued inflationary pressures and more normalized staffing levels at our hotels. Our efforts to redefine the operating model continue to yield positive results even with occupancy still meaningfully below 2019 levels and elevated pressure on wage rates which ended the year up 5% on a year-over-year basis. As detailed in our earnings release, moving forward, we will cease presentation of all owned hotel results and return to a comparable presentation for our hotel level results. We believe this will provide investors with better understanding of underlying growth trends for our current portfolio without impacts from properties that experienced closures lasting one-month or longer due to renovations or property damage. We have removed Hyatt Regency Coconut Point and the Ritz-Carlton, Naples from our comparable operations in our full year 2023 forecast due to closures caused by Hurricane Ian. Turning to our outlook for 2023. Current macroeconomic headwinds and the potential for an economic slowdown are competing with the margin recovery. That said, we continue to be optimistic about the future of travel. Our performance this year will depend on our ability to maintain high rated business at our resorts and the continued improvement of group, business transient and international inbound travel. Given the significant macroeconomic uncertainty in the second half of 2023, we have provided a wider guidance range than normal, which assumes a slowdown in the second half of the year. The low-end contemplates a severe slowdown, while the high-end assumes a mild one. For the first quarter, we expect RevPAR growth to be between 24% and 27% as a result of easier comparisons due to Omicron, which is expected to bolster full year growth. For the remaining three quarters, we expect year-over-year RevPAR changes to be down low-single digits at the low-end of our guidance range to up low-single digits at the high-end of our range. Looking ahead to recent trends, preliminary January comparable hotel RevPAR is expected to be approximately $184, a 67% increase over January 2022 and a 3.5% increase over January 2019. Taken together, for the full year, we anticipate comparable RevPAR growth of between 2% and 8% over 2022. Additionally, staffing levels are closer to stable and hotel operating costs are expected to increase in comparison to 2022. As a result, we expect comparable EBITDA margins to be down 360 basis points year-over-year at the low-end of our guidance to down 210 basis points at the high-end. Though, we expect comparable hotel EBITDA margins to be down year-over-year, we expect margins in 2023 to be only slightly down to 2019 despite lagging occupancy and four years of inflationary pressures. This reflects our efforts to transform the portfolio and evolve the hotel operating model. It is particularly impressive when you consider that our total expense CAGR since 2019 is only 1.1% versus the core CPI CAGR of 4.1%. The margin decline year-over-year is driven by closer to stable, staffing levels at our hotels, higher utility and insurance expenses, lower attrition and cancellation fees, which totaled approximately $100 million in 2022 and occupancy below 2019 levels. As we noted throughout last year, 2022 margins were not sustainable, particularly when you consider the limited services provided at many of our hotels in the first half of the year, the staffing lag and the elevated inflationary pressures. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we anticipate comparable RevPAR growth of 5% compared to 2022, a comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 29% and full year adjusted EBITDAre of $1.460 billion. Our 2023 full year adjusted EBITDAre includes an expected $11 million contribution from Hyatt Coconut Point and the Ritz-Carlton, Naples which are excluded from our comparable hotel set. The pre-hurricane estimated contribution from these two hotels, including the New Tower at Naples was expected to be an additional $71 million in 2023. It is important to note that we have not included the business interruption proceeds from Hurricane Ian in our 2023 guidance. In 2023, we expect wage rates to increase 5%. In the aggregate, from 2019 through 2023, we expect wage rates and utilities to increase 20% and insurance to increase approximately 100%. In 2023, we also expect attrition and cancellation fees to revert to historical levels. For context, in 2019, region and benefits comprise approximately 50% of our total comparable expenses, utilities and insurance comprised approximately 5%, attrition and cancellation fees were $50 million, and occupancy is still 10 points below 2019 as of the fourth quarter of 2022. Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our weighted average maturity is 5.2 years at a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%, and we have no significant maturities until April 2024. As of today's call, we have $2.4 billion in total available liquidity, which includes $200 million of FF&E reserves and full availability of our $1.5 billion credit facility. We ended 2022 at 2.4x net leverage. And since our last call, both S&P and Fitch have revised our issuer outlooks to positive from stable. Wrapping up, in January, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share, which included a $0.20 special dividend. The Board of Directors authorized a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 on our common stock to be paid on April 17, 2023, to stockholders of record as of March 31, 2023. All future dividends are subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors though we expect to be able to maintain our quarterly dividend at a sustainable level, taking into consideration potential macroeconomic factors. To conclude, we believe our portfolio, our balance sheet and our team are well positioned to continue outperforming, and we will continue to be strategic in the current macroeconomic environment. With that, we would be happy to take your questions. To ensure we have time to address as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Please go ahead. SmedesRose: I appreciate you guys are providing a range for the year that incorporates a wide range of macroeconomic outlook. And I'm just curious, what are you specifically seeing in your business, if anything, that would suggest a slowdown in the back half of the year, either on the group side or what sort of visibility you have? Jim Risoleo : At this point in time, we're not seeing any signs of weakness in any business segment. Our group pace is performing exceptionally well. I mean, 2022, we ended up, I think with 3.8 million group room nights at the end of the year which was 84% of 2019 actual. Rate was up 6% in 2019. 2023, we're very encouraged about how group is set up. We have 2.9 million definite room nights on the books that's a 400,000-room night increase since quarter three. That equates to 80% of 2022 actual room nights. At the same time last year, we were at 71%. So we picked up 9 points and the other really encouraging thing is that total group revenue pace is up, I think, 17% to the same time last year. So group is really set up well. And if you go back and look at how we're set up relative to 2019, we're only down 70 basis points in total revenue pace. So the short-term nature of the bookings is expected to continue. And as a result of the solid base that we have on the books, we're encouraged with how group will likely perform this year. So no indication of any slowdown there. I think your other question was related to business transient. We continue to see improvements in BT. I think BT is going to evolve over time. BT room nights were down in quarter 4, I think, about 20% to quarter 4 of 2019, but we saw a pickup in bookings from Q3 about 500 basis points. So business transient revenue was down 18% due to an improvement in rate. Again, bought up from where we were in Q3, so special corporate, the encouraging piece on the business transient side is we expect to see high single-digit rate increases that is going to hold. In January, very strong months for business transient demand. It was the best in the month for-the-month pickup by our top accounts. So no signs of weakness in the business transient front at all. And one thing I would point out, I think Sourav mentioned it in his comments, very encouraging that New York City is only 5% below where it was in 2019. So no signs of weakness. We felt it was prudent to give a range, given the uncertainty on the macroeconomic front that exists today. Operator : Our next question is coming from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Anthony Powell : Just a follow-up to that prior question. I mean, if you were to build a bottoms-up guidance range for 2Q through 4Q, I guess how many percentage points would you be adding to that midpoint? And what does that imply rather for a theoretical margin decline this year given what potential higher RevPAR. Sourav Ghosh : Anthony, so let me start off by saying sort of what I said in my prepared remarks is, the second half of the year for us in our guidance assumes some sort of a slowdown, whether it's at the low-end, which would be a severe slowdown over the high-end, which is a mild slowdown. And our midpoint is effectively a moderate slowdown. The way we are thinking about it when you look at our guidance is the second half. I'll sort of go through each segment. From a group perspective, we are assuming that the second half will only see about half the group room nights pick up in the year, for the year compared to 2022. And as you may recall, 2022 had meaningful in the year for the year pickup. And as I said in my prepared remarks, in the fourth quarter alone, we had 21% more pickup in the quarter for the quarter. So in other words, the anticipation is if there is a slowdown, you would have less in the year for the year pickup. That's on the group side. The rates, obviously, in the group sides are locked in, so that's a positive. On the transient side, we expect that second half to be somewhat flattish. So with leisure rates being slightly up driven by our downturn in convention hotels, but our resorts somewhat flat to maybe slightly down depending on the market. So overall, transient rates and occupancy to be about flattish for the second half. And so when you really think about our guidance for the full year, our occupancy ends up being up a couple of points and rate effectively flattish again, all this is tied to the midpoint. When you think about sort of our margin performance quarter-by-quarter, reality is the distribution of EBITDA that we saw in 2019 is going to be very -- but we are expecting very similar in 2023. So in '19, we had, I think, it was about 27% or so of our EBITDA came from Q1, about $29 million from Q2, 20% in Q3 and 24% from Q4. Very similar sort of cadence is what we are expecting from 2023. Operator : Our next question is coming from David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : Jim, I wanted to go back to something you touched on in your comment and just to make sure we're clear about it. You talked about some of the hotels you bought that are, I think you said currently run rate in about 10x or 12x EBITDA based on sort of what you paid. Could you just go back to those circumstances and talk about if we found ourselves at a 2019 normalized environment were those multiples or cap rates would be. Jim Risoleo : Well, we don't expect to get back to 2019 levels of rate or performance at these properties, David. We are very confident that the rate set the hotels are able to charge today for the most part, sustainable. There might be a little bit of a pullback. But we did message when we bought each property what the EBITDA multiple was based on 2019 numbers and what the cap rate was. And I can't tell you how pleased we are with the performance of these properties over the last several years. So we feel very confident that we're going to be able to close to maintain the current rates that we're getting today subject to there being a very severe downturn that's affecting the consumer. We're just not seeing it today. Operator : Our next question is coming from Chris Darling with Green Street. Chris Darling : Can you provide an update on '23 group pace across some of your larger group focused markets. So thinking specifically about San Francisco, New York, Orlando and then maybe any other data points that might be helpful as well. Sourav Ghosh : Sure. So in terms of group pace some of our larger markets, what's trending really well. And I would say, like effectively what we have on the books for 2023, over 50% are from markets which are San Diego, Orlando, D.C., San Antonio and San Francisco. So whatever we have on the book for 2023, over 50% are from those markets. And when we're looking at sort of citywide data, we are at about 80% of 2019 levels that it relates to citywide and the markets that are above that threshold are Boston, San Antonio, San Diego, Atlanta, Chicago and the ones which are sort of below that threshold are Philadelphia, Seattle and certainly San Francisco and I would say New Orleans. Operator : Our next question is coming from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Chris Woronka : Jim, it's a bit of a hypothetical question, but obviously, there's a lot of talk about getting back to prior or maybe not peak occupancy levels, but still having a lot of occupancy to recover with group and a little bit of corporate. But that with the mix effect that may come at the expensive rate. So the question would be, I know you don't solve for any one metric is it reasonable to think that some of the more price-sensitive business and opaque business, things like that, you have your operators essentially intentionally keep that out of the business as we go forward and that we are structurally lower arc but higher rate. Is that a decent way to think about it? Jim Risoleo : Chris, I'd say it a little differently. It's easy to buy occupancy in certain markets at certain hotels. We don't think that's the right revenue management strategy. We believe that given the flow-through you get to EBITDA from rate increases relative to occupancy increases, which is about 80% -- 60% for rate, 40% for occupancy that every dollar in rate is worth more money. We continue to see occupancy evolve, but we're going to continue to hold rate at high levels and continue to increase rates. I think we're encouraged, in particular, by group rate that we've been able to achieve that's locked in with definites on the books, up sequentially quarter-over-quarter and for 2023 looking pretty positive for us as well as the growth in business transient rate as well. So the total group revenue pace for 2023 is up 17% at the same time last year and down only 70 basis points to 2019. That's very encouraging to us. So that's the strategy that we intend to employ going forward. And we are in favor as a general statement of cutting rate to buy occupancy. Operator : Our next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : If we go back in time to the structural margin improvement commentary, your view of the world may be back in Q3 of last year, what has been the biggest change or biggest surprise since that time? Obviously, Naples has some lingering impact. But for example, has the fill rate on open position surprised you since the fall. And then maybe just as a follow-up, while I have you, has your forward visibility into 2Q changed year-over-year? Maybe you could contrast where you stand today on 2Q versus this time last year and what the rates on those forward bookings look like? Sourav Ghosh : Sure. So I'll start with the second half of your question first. In terms of rates, we feel very good about the rates into Q2 and the rest of the year, what we have on the books. And as Jim mentioned, our group rate is up 6%. We expect business transient rates to be up in the high single digits. In terms of actual demand, it is still very short-term booking. And that goes to my remarks of sort of the short-term pickup that we are expecting. We saw in the fourth quarter, meaningful in the quarter for the quarter pickup that seems to continue. So while we do have a meaningful amount of group on the books, we are still expecting a significant amount of pickup in the first quarter for the first quarter and the same thing in the second quarter. So from a visibility standpoint, I wouldn't say it's incremental, maybe slightly more incremental relative to the fourth quarter. As it relates to our operating model changes, what I do want to point out is we have said the $100 million to $150 million of savings relative to 2019. Those expense savings, we have achieved a bulk of those savings. And frankly, the balance of it is really going to be driven by occupancy coming back. We are still, as Jim mentioned, 10 points off of 2019 from an occupancy perspective. And I would say with every point of occupancy gain, that would equate to roughly 30 to 40 bps of margin gain. So that is pretty meaningful when you think about it. So if we get back to sort of '19 occupancy levels, you're looking at anywhere from 300 to 400 basis points of margin improvement. And one of the things I would like to highlight is when you look at our expenses, specifically to $100 million to $150 million and you compare that really to 2019, our F&B revenues are down for 2023 to the midpoint relative to '19, 1.5%, but our expenses are actually down 2%. So it shows that all the operating model changes and a big piece of it was in food and beverage has made a huge difference. Sales and marketing expense relative to '19 for 2023, again, to the midpoint, we'll be down less than 1%. So again, when you're comparing sort of the margin performance to '19, it really tells the story. And like I said, we'll be only slightly down at the midpoint. And of course, at the higher end of the guidance, we'd actually be above 2019. Operator : Our next question is coming from Ari Klein with BMO. Ari Klein : Maybe following up on the margin question. What's the wherewithal to cut expenses if the macro is a little bit more difficult than you anticipate given some of the labor challenges that we've had over the last couple of years. Sourav Ghosh : Sorry, I was on mute. Apologies. So I'm assuming you're talking about what if any sort of a pullback we can have if there is a slowdown in the second half. And the reality is, I think we now have a playbook going through COVID as to what would need to happen if there is slow down, and that is really a payoff department by department. So we feel very confident that if there is a slowdown, the changes that we would actually have to make if we are in that situation? And whether that's modifying hours of operations or driving efficiencies in any single department. So we are going to be well prepared for that. Ari Klein : Got it. And then just on the balance sheet. Can you update us on your priority and how you're thinking about acquisitions, dispositions and underwriting and admittedly more uncertain macro? Jim Risoleo : Sure. As we sit here today, we are in a very strong position. And given the balance sheet that we have, people be well positioned regardless of what happens over the course of the year. As you see from our CapEx guidance this year, we're going to continue to invest in our portfolio. Just a point of reference over the course of 2020 through 2022, we invested $1.5 billion in our assets, which is really a distinguishing factor that sets us apart from other lodging REITs. We're well positioned to outperform going forward, and we will continue to pursue ROI projects such as a complete transformation Fairmont Kea Lani and expansion at the Canyon Suites as the Phoenician and the completion of our repositioning a new tower at the Ritz-Carlton in Naples. So we will continue to look for opportunities to deploy capital in our assets. Those underwrite generally to low to mid cash-on-cash returns, unlevered cash-on-cash returns. So we think that's a very good place to free capital. On the acquisition front, there are a number of properties in the market right now that we are evaluating. I would just say that the bid-ask spread hasn't come to the middle yet. So for the near-term, we're not anticipating, when I say near-term talking about the next 60 to 90 days. I'm not anticipating acquiring any assets that could change. I'll just point out that the Four Seasons Jackson Hole was roughly a 30-day process for us which puts us in a really strong position because we are the only player out there that can really do a meaningful transaction of our cash. As we sit back and look at how the year might evolve a tracking all the CMBS loan maturities for 2023, 2024. We will see if certain owners are in a position where they're going to have to sell the asset, just given the current interest rate environment relative to where the environment was when they put their current debt financing in place and the fact that their asset is likely to need a significant CapEx because they haven't been able to invest over the course of the pandemic. And I think you could see us as the year evolves assuming distress presents itself, investing across markets that are different than markets that we invested in 2021 and 2022. Operator : Our next question is coming from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : I was actually going to ask you about your acquisition plans. And I think you answered most of that question already. But I'm kind of intrigued by your last comment about investing in different markets than you did in the last two years. And just wondering if that means more sort of rather than resort markets or kind of what that might mean? And then, if I could just ask a clarification. When you were talking about your revenue pace, group revenue pace being down about 70 bps in 2018, I guess rate, it sounds like it's up high single digits. So a number of group nights -- are you anticipating being down around that sort of high single-digit rate relative to '19? In other words, just curious what you're factoring into guidance in terms of when group you think might make a full recovery in terms of room nights and transient nights as well. Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Sure, Robin. I'll take the part of your question related to the investment market. I think as you think about how we have been deploying capital over the last six years or so, everything we've done has been to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the company. And when I say that we're going to be open-minded and look at other markets, it's really transaction dependent and whether or not we think we can create value and what we can do with the underlying EBITDA growth of that asset going forward. So I said differently, I don't think there's a market in the country that has a red line through it, subject to all of the underwriting criteria that we employ when we evaluate a particular hotel. Sourav, do you want to touch base on the group? Sourav Ghosh : Sure. Robin, on the group side, yes, you're right. It's effectively on the group room nights. We are pacing in sort of the high single digits below 2019. The expectation right now at the midpoint, again, we would get to about around 90% of our group room night levels relative to '19. But of course, remember, like I said, that assumes that we only pick up effectively half the amount of group room nights in the year for the year for the second half. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from Jay Kornreich with SMBC. Jay Kornreich : As it looks like the 2023 outlook you provided excludes any contribution from the Hurricane Ian impacted hotels. I believe you mentioned a $71 million EBITDA shortfall I'm curious, as we see those assets coming back online throughout 2023, if that provides an upside opportunity to the guidance range. And if there's anything else you have your eye on besides the possible recession that get surprised to the upside or I guess the downside. Jim Risoleo : Well, Jay, I think it's important to really highlight that the assets affected by Hurricane Ian were anticipated to generate $82 million in EBITDA in 2023. We have $11 million in our guidance to the midpoint. So there's a $71 million gap that is purely related to hurricane disruption. We have not assumed any business interruption proceeds hitting our guidance. So if we were to get business interruption proceeds over the course of 2023, that is upside going forward. So we think that is likely to occur later in 2023 and into 2024. But I do want to point out that the $71 million is a significant amount of EBITDA that is going to impact one year. It's just this year because we're very excited about the performance of the Ritz-Carlton for full year 2024. The property will be completely transformed. The new tower will be open. We've added 24 rooms [indiscernible] increased the suite count of that asset and made a number of other enhancements. So one year of disruption from Hurricane Ian has cost us a significant amount for 2023. Jay Kornreich : Thanks. Maybe just to clarify that the $11 million that you expect in 2023, could that be looked at as a conservative estimate? Or is that what you expect even as both hotels open up during the year? Jim Risoleo : I think it's what we expect at this point in time. Operator : Our next question is coming from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Floris van Dijkum : A little bit of a mixed message here. Obviously, you've got group pace ahead, very strong results the last quarter. If I look RevPAR expectations in the first quarter are up, call it, 24% to 27%, call it, 25%, pretty strong yet. If we were to include your business interruption insurance, which, again, you have that insurance presumably, you're going to get that $71 million of missing EBITDA from Naples. You're looking at flat EBITDA growth based on your consensus. Can you maybe provide any sort of historical context where occupancy in your portfolio is trending higher on a longer-term basis and your rate, and your margins are down, or your EBITDA is going down. Sourav Ghosh : Sorry, are you asking historically? If you've seen occupancy go up and margins go down, I think the way to think about it, Floris, as sort of I have said, relative to '19, right? Actually, if we see occupancy go up, we would actually expect margin performance to improve from where the occupancy stands as of today. I think that's where the upside is. The reality is, we don't have visibility into the second half of the year. Therefore, our assumptions are I think, reasonable at this time with the data that we have available right now. And when you look at the top-end of the guidance, actually, the margins are up relative to '19. So it really depends on where things shape up for the second half and what kind of in the year for the year pickup we see in group. And then, you have to remember, business investment sort of non-residential fixed investment, you're looking at only a 70-basis points growth for the year. So what we can expect, it's very difficult to predict at this point for the second half. It's our guidance range is based on the best available data we have today. Jim Risoleo : Yes, Floris. The one thing I would add is, over the course of 2022, for the second and third quarter call, we were very clear that the margin performance we were seeing was not sustainable. And it wasn't sustainable for a lot of reasons. We were not at optimal staffing levels. We had a number of hotels where full services were not being offered to customers. Restaurants were closed, club lounges were closed, and we feel that the proper comparison for margins is 2019. And in 2019 levels, even down 10 basis points we're only down 57 basis points in margin. And just to reiterate, we have seen a 4.1% inflation in CAGR, a CPI CAGR, and our expenses have only gone up 1.1%. So we actually feel that we're positioned very well. And as Sourav pointed out, every point of occupancy that we get is going to equate to 30 to 40 basis points of margin improvement. Operator : At this time, I will hand it back to Mr. Risoleo for any closing comments you wish to make. Jim Risoleo : Thank you very much. I would like to thank everyone for joining us on our fourth quarter call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our quarterly results with you, and we look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming weeks and months. Thank you for your continued support and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. And we thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jaime Marcus, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Jaime Marcus : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, please note that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today\u2019s call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel level results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in yesterday\u2019s earnings press release and our 8-K filed with the SEC and in the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. With me on today\u2019s call are Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Risoleo : Thank you, Jaime, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. We kicked off the first quarter of 2023 with meaningful outperformance, delivering a RevPAR improvement of 31% compared to the first quarter of 2022, exceeding the top end of our first quarter RevPAR guidance by 4 percentage points. During the first quarter, we delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $444 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.55. Our comparable hotel EBITDA of $439 million in the first quarter was 18% above 2019 and 44% above 2022, driven by both occupancy increases and continued rate strength, particularly in the group business segment at our downtown hotels. First quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 32.5% was meaningfully ahead of 2022 and exceeded 2019 for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our strong performance in the first quarter, coupled with our improved outlook for the year, allowed us to substantially raise and tighten our full year RevPAR growth guidance range to 7.5% to 10.5%, nearly doubling the midpoint of our full year expected RevPAR growth to 9% from 5% last quarter. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter since the onset of the pandemic that we have achieved RevPAR, adjusted EBITDAre and EBITDA margins ahead of 2019. And at the midpoint, our full year 2023 RevPAR guidance is 7% above 2019. Our outperformance is a result of the capital allocation decisions made over the last 6 years and our unwavering focus on expense control and margin improvement. It is worth noting that at the 9% midpoint, we raised our adjusted EBITDA guidance by $125 million, which is significantly above our first quarter outperformance of over $40 million relative to consensus. Lastly, at the midpoint of our range, our full year 2023 EBITDA is forecasted to be 3% above 2019. We are also providing second quarter comparable hotel RevPAR growth guidance of 4% to 6%. Sourav will discuss our updated guidance assumptions in a few minutes. On the capital allocation front, during the first quarter, we sold the 277-key Camby Autograph Collection Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona, for $110 million or 14.3x trailing 12-month EBITDA. When calculating the EBITDA multiple, we included approximately $23 million of estimated foregone near-term CapEx. In connection with the sale, we provided a $72 million loan to the purchaser with up to an additional $12 million available for a property improvement plan not to exceed a 65% loan-to-cost ratio. During the quarter, we also repurchased 3.2 million shares at an average price of $15.65 per share through our common share repurchase program, bringing our total repurchases for the quarter to $50 million. Over the past 2 quarters, we have repurchased $77 million of stock at an average repurchase price of $15.75 per share. We have approximately $923 million of remaining capacity under the repurchase program. We continue to be optimistic about the state of travel today despite the underlying uncertainty in the economy and lack of clear visibility in the second half of the year. We are not seeing any signs of a slowdown and our outlook for the rest of the year has improved since our last earnings call. Leisure rates remain well above 2019 levels and the moderation we saw in the second half of last year plateaued in the first quarter. For context, transient rates at our resorts were 54% above 2019 in the first quarter, which was in line with the fourth quarter. On the group front, in the first quarter, we booked over 500,000 group rooms for 2023 and total group revenue pace is now 2.5% ahead of the same time in 2019. The group booking window is extending as most of our top markets picked up more group rooms for 2024 in the first quarter than the same time 2019. While business transient demand is continuing to evolve, rates in the first quarter were up 10% to 2019, with demand holding steady compared to the fourth quarter. Turning to first quarter results, comparable hotel RevPAR for the first quarter was approximately $218, a 31% improvement over the first quarter of 2022 and a 7.4% improvement over the first quarter of 2019. Comparable hotel revenues in the first quarter were up 11% over 2019 and 34% over 2022, respectively, while comparable hotel operating expenses were up only 9% over 2019 and 30% over 2022. Transient revenue was 13% above the first quarter of 2022 as a result of increased occupancy and easier comparisons due to Omicron, which allowed our managers to push rate higher. Revenue growth was primarily driven by our downtown hotels. Our resort properties continue to outperform with 1% transient rate growth over 2022. In the first quarter, we had 6 resorts with transient rates above $1,000, led by the Four Seasons Resort in Residence, Jackson Hole at nearly $3,000 and the Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort at over $2,000. As a reminder, Hyatt Coconut Point and the Ritz-Carlton, Naples are both excluded from our comparable hotel results due to impacts from Hurricane Ian. Hyatt Coconut Point has been opened since November, and the final phase of restoration is expected to complete in mid-June with the reopening of its water park complex. The Ritz-Carlton Naples remains closed. However, we are nearing the end of our reconstruction efforts, which will enhance the resiliency of the property by elevating critical equipment, improving dry flood proofing measures and replacing major equipment with more efficient machinery. We have targeted reopening the resort, including the new 74-key tower expansion in July. We are excited to showcase the transformational repositioning of the Ritz-Carlton Naples. As of today, we have received $98 million of insurance proceeds of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs. The proceeds received to date have all been classified as property damage. As a reminder, these two properties were expected to contribute an additional $71 million of EBITDA this year, which is not included in our full year guidance. Turning to group. This is the third consecutive quarter group revenue exceeded 2019, driven by 14% rate growth over the same time in 2019 with over 1 million group room nights sold. Definite group room nights on the books for 2023 increased to $3.4 million in the first quarter. Which represents approximately 94% of comparable full year 2022 actual group room nights, up from 80% as of the fourth quarter of 2022. Total group revenue for the first quarter was 7% ahead of 2019, driven by continued elevated banquet and AV spend. For full year 2023, Group rate on the books is up over 6% to the same time last year, a 90 basis point increase since the fourth quarter. In addition, total group revenue pace is up approximately 25% to the same time last year. We continue to be very encouraged by the large group base we have on the books, particularly when you consider that our \u2013 in the quarter for the quarter bookings, remain elevated at 28% above the same time 2019. Sourav will touch on additional operational details and our updated 2023 outlook in a few minutes. Our recent acquisitions continue to contribute to our outperformance and are meaningfully ahead of our underwriting expectations. Based on full year 2023 forecast, EBITDA from the 8 hotels we acquired in 2021 and \u201822 is comfortably within our targeted range of 10 to 12x and well ahead of our underwritten stabilization period. Looking back on our transaction activity since 2018, we have acquired $3.5 billion of assets at a 14x EBITDA multiple and disposed of $5 billion of assets at a 17x EBITDA multiple, including $976 million of estimated foregone capital expenditures. Comparing all owned hotel 2022 results for our current portfolio to 2017, we have increased the RevPAR of our assets by 9%, the TRevPAR by 15% and the EBITDA per key by 31%. Moving on to portfolio reinvestment, during the first quarter, we completed comprehensive renovations at the Marriott Marquis San Diego Marina, bringing the number of completed properties in the Marriott Transformational Capital Program to 15 out of 16 assets. The final property in that program, the Washington Marriott and Metro Center, is underway, and we expect it to be completed in May. We also completed our comprehensive renovation of the Westin Georgetown, Washington, D.C. during the quarter. In addition to these completed renovations, we are excited to announce our plans to develop and sell 40 fee-simple condominiums on a 5-acre development parcel at Golden Oak in Orlando, adjacent to our Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort. The development will feature a 31-unit mid-rise condominium building and 9 detached condominium villas. We signed a contract to purchase the 5-acre development parcel for an additional $30 million at the time the resort was acquired. We are targeting a mid- to high teens cash-on-cash return for this ROI development project. Construction is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2023 and complete in the fourth quarter of 2025 with sales tentatively scheduled to commence in the first half of 2024. For the full year, our 2023 capital expenditure guidance range remains at $600 million to $725 million which reflects approximately $275 million of investment for redevelopment, repositioning and ROI projects and $100 million to $125 million for hurricane restoration work. The projects include a transformational renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani, the Phoenician Canyon Suites Villa expansion, the Four Seasons Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort luxury condominium development and completing construction of the tower expansion, guestroom renovation and lobby transformation, a Ritz-Carlton Naples Beach, which was delayed by Hurricane Ian. In closing, we are very pleased with our strong first quarter performance and our improved outlook for the rest of the year. We believe Host is well positioned to outperform in the current macroeconomic environment. We have a best-in-class balance sheet. We are diversified across geographies and business mix. We have redefined the operating model and we have transformed our portfolio through reinvestments in transactions, which taken together have dramatically improved the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio. With that, I will turn the call over to Sourav. Sourav Ghosh : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim\u2019s comments, I will go into detail on our first quarter operations, our updated 2023 guidance and our balance sheet and dividend. Starting with business mix, overall transient revenue was up 13% to the first quarter of 2022 driven by over 9 points of occupancy growth and continued strength in leisure rates. Our downtown hotels led revenue growth as strong demand fueled significant rate increases. Holiday performance in the first quarter was strong, particularly at our downtown hotels. Downtown hotels saw increased leisure demand over last year, gaining more than 10 points of occupancy for both Martin Luther King Jr. and President\u2019s Day weekends. Downtown properties also drove overall portfolio spring break RevPAR growth of 7%, which is quite impressive when you consider the elevated resort comparisons from the \"mother of all spring breaks\" last year. Quickly looking forward to holidays in the second quarter, room revenue pace is up low single digits over last year for Memorial Day, Juneteenth and the fourth of July. Resorts in the first quarter saw an overall RevPAR increase of approximately 5% compared to 2022. As expected, the return of Caribbean tourism let consumer hesitancy to travel to downtown markets and lower repeat travel to Florida markets impacted performance at our resorts. However, the impact was not as significant as we expected. And it is notable that Miami, Jacksonville and the Florida Gulf Coast are still significantly outpacing 2019 RevPAR levels by an average of over 30%. Our resorts in Hawaii achieved 11% RevPAR growth over last year, entirely driven by rate. Business transient revenue was down 14% to the first quarter of 2019, which represents a 400 basis point sequential improvement to the fourth quarter. Downtown properties accounted for over 60% of the portfolio\u2019s business travel demand and small and medium-sized businesses continue to drive the recovery, representing approximately 75% of our business transient demand today compared to approximately 60% at the same time in 2019. It is also worth noting that business transient revenue was only down 7% to 2019 in the month of March. Turning to group. This marks the third quarter that group revenue has surpassed 2019 levels. Group room revenues were 4% above the first quarter of 2019, driven by a 14% rate growth. Phoenix, San Diego and Miami, drove group room revenue growth compared to 2019. The short-term booking trend continued with a pickup of 102,000 room nights or 28% of rooms booked in the quarter for the quarter. Near half of the in the quarter for the quarter rooms booked were in San Francisco, Washington, D.C. and New York. Corporate group room revenue was above 2019 for the third consecutive quarter, up 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by 26% rate growth. Association Group revenue has nearly recovered down just 2% in the first quarter compared to 2019, driven by 1% rate growth. Wrapping up on group with social, military, educational, religious and fraternal or SMERF groups, revenue was 12% above 2019, driven by 8% rate growth. Shifting gears to margin performance. Our first quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin came in at 32.5% which is 175 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2019 and 220 basis points better than the first quarter of 2022. All departments had margin improvements compared to 2019. Compared to 2022, all departments, except for other revenues had margin improvement as attrition and cancellation revenue was below 2022. Margin expansion can be attributed primarily to rate growth, banquet and AV growth and our efforts to redefine the operating model, and we are encouraged that we were able to maintain last quarter\u2019s margin expansion compared to 2019 in the first quarter. Turning to our updated 2023 guidance. We significantly raised and tightened our full year comparable hotel RevPAR growth range to 7.5% to 10.5%. Our improved outlook is driven by outperformance in the first quarter, better visibility into the second quarter and continued strong group booking activity in the second half of the year. As it relates to the business transient recovery, it is worth noting that we may not see a decrease in demand if a slowdown occurs in other parts of our business as business transient demand is still not fully recovered to 2019 levels. Given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty, our guidance range contemplates a varying degree of a slowdown in the second half of the year, particularly for the Group segment. Further improvement will continue to depend on the broader macroeconomic environment, our ability to maintain high rated business in resort markets and the continued improvement of group, business transient and international inbound travel. In this context, we would expect year-over-year comparable hotel RevPAR percentage changes in the second half of the year to be up low single digits at the midpoint of our guidance. As Jim mentioned, at the midpoint of our guidance, we anticipate comparable hotel RevPAR growth of 9% compared to 2022, comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 30.2% and with a 65 basis points ahead of 2019 and full year adjusted EBITDAre of $1.585 billion. We expect our operational results to roughly follow 2019 quarterly seasonal trends as provided on Page 13 of our supplemental financial information. As a reminder, our 2023 full year adjusted EBITDAre guidance includes an expected $17 million contribution from Hyatt Coconut Point and the Ritz-Carlton, Naples, both of which are excluded from our comparable hotel results due to impacts from Hurricane Ian. The $17 million expected contribution from these two hotels is up from $11 million as of our year-end guidance as a result of better performance at the Hyatt Coconut Point. The pre-hurricane estimated contribution from these two hotels, including the new tower at the Ritz-Carlton, Naples, was expected to be an additional $71 million in 2023. It is also important to note that we have not included any expected business interruption proceeds from Hurricane Ian in our 2023 guidance. In addition, we removed approximately $5 million of adjusted EBITDAre associated with the sale of The Camby from our full year guidance range. As we discussed last quarter, and noted throughout 2022, year-over-year, we expect comparable hotel EBITDA margins to be down 200 basis points at the low end of our guidance to down 130 basis points at the high end due to closer to stable staffing levels at our hotels, higher utility and insurance expenses and lower attrition and cancelation fees. It is important to note that we expect margins in 2023 relative to 2019 to be up 25 basis points at the low end of our guidance to up 95 basis points at the high end. Despite lagging occupancy and 4 years of inflationary pressures, this reflects our efforts to transform the portfolio and evolve the hotel operating model. As we have discussed in the past, it is particularly impressive when you consider that our forecasted total hotel expense CAGR from 2019 to 2023 is only 1.8% versus the forecasted core CPI CAGR of 4% over the same period. Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our weighted average maturity is 5 years at a weighted average interest rate of 4.5% and we have no significant maturities until April 2024. We ended the fourth quarter at 2.2x net leverage, and we have $2.3 billion of total available liquidity, which includes $203 million of FF&E reserves and full availability of our $1.5 billion credit facility. Wrapping up, in April, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share. All future dividends are subject to approval by the company\u2019s Board of Directors though we expect to be able to maintain our quarterly dividend at a sustainable level, taking into consideration potential macroeconomic factors. To conclude, we are very pleased with our recent operational performance, particularly relative to 2019 and our outlook for the remainder of the year is cautiously optimistic. In any scenario, we believe our portfolio, our balance sheet and our team are well positioned to continue outperforming, and we will continue to be strategic in the current macroeconomic environment. With that, we would be happy to take your questions. To ensure we have time to address as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Aryeh Klein at BMO Capital Markets. Aryeh, your line is live. Aryeh Klein : Hi, thanks and good morning. Sorry about that. Just maybe relative to the prior outlook what\u2019s been the biggest surprise to the upside that\u2019s giving you the confidence to increase the outlook particularly in the second half of the year? Jim Risoleo : Yes, Aryeh, I think the fact that all three segments, it\u2019s not isolated to any one of our business segments, but all three segments are really firing on all cylinders. We haven\u2019t seen any slowdown in the leisure segment, as Sourav mentioned, we\u2019re up 5% in RevPAR growth in Q1 in the leisure segment of our business, and we had six resorts that had transient revenues of $1,000 or greater. So it\u2019s apparent to us that the well-heeled leisure consumer continues to want experiences. They want experiential experiences. The shift from goods to travel and other experiences has occurred and it\u2019s real and it\u2019s very sticky. And that\u2019s notwithstanding the fact that we anticipated that there was going to be a natural migration out of the resorts as people got more comfortable traveling internationally to the Caribbean, to Europe and to other places and going back to our downtown hotels. Which leads me to the next piece of the business. Our downtown hotels have really seen business return in a material way. And not only business transient but leisure business. So we feel really good about the way the recovery is unfolding and the way things are pacing for the leisure consumer. Group is really firing on all cylinders. Total group revenue pace is now up 2.5% to the same time in 2019. Group rate on the books for 2023 is up nearly 6.4% to the same time last year, and that\u2019s a 90 basis point increase since the fourth quarter. We\u2019re still seeing, as Sourav mentioned, a significant amount of bookings occurring in the quarter for the quarter. I think last quarter it was 28% compared to 2019. We\u2019re up 3.4 million room nights definite on the books now. That\u2019s 94% of 2022 actual relative to where we were in last quarter, I think it was about 80%, somewhere in that range. So we saw a significant pickup and business transient continues to evolve as well. We\u2019re seeing the recovery in BT led by small and medium-sized businesses. As well as increased rate being driven by special corporate. So I think it\u2019s all of the segments are really firing on all cylinders. And I\u2019ll let Sourav add a little more color on BT. Sourav Ghosh : Hey, Aryeh, I think specifically, when you look at the second half, what really gives us confidence is the group booking activity for the second half, we picked up 237,000 room nights. Just to put that into perspective, that\u2019s 35% more than what we picked up in Q1 of \u201819 for the second half of \u201819. So real apart from just in the quarter for the quarter group pickup, it was really encouraging to see meaningful activity not only for Q2. Q2, we picked up about 180,000 room nights, that\u2019s 13% above \u201819 but also for the second half of the year. Aryeh Klein : Thanks. Jim Risoleo : The last thing I would add is that as we thought about Q2 in connection with our fourth quarter call, we were looking at a scenario where we were anticipating flat RevPAR growth for Q2. Now we have given you RevPAR growth of 4% to 6%. Aryeh Klein : Thanks for that color. And if I could just ask on Orlando and the condo development there, if you could just give a little additional context on that decision, maybe what you expect the total cost to be and whether or not there are similar types of opportunities that you could potentially pursue? Jim Risoleo : Yes. The thought behind the condo development adjacent to our Four Seasons Resort was an ROI project that we anticipate is going to generate cash-on-cash returns in the mid- to high teens on the development and sell-out as a stand-alone venture, they are going to be Four Seasons branded units, which is a very, very attractive branding to have whenever you\u2019re building and selling something of this nature. Additionally, what we have been taken into consideration is the uplift that the hotel is going to received from having these 40 additional units adjacent to it in terms of food and beverage spend, spa spend, golf spend, all the ancillary revenues that are going to be driven, which we believe are real and sustainable at the hotel property. So the total cost is going to be somewhere in the area in $150 million to $170 million. And with respect to whether or not we have other opportunities, as you know, we have an ongoing pipeline of ROI projects that Host. And we are constantly working on additional ways to enhance shareholder value through deploying capital in ROI projects. To remind you of some of the ones that we\u2019ve done in the past, we built 19 villas at the Andaz Wailea on Maui. We built the AC Kierland on a parking lot at Westin Kierland Resort in Phoenix. We\u2019re doing the expansion of the Phoenix of the Canyon Suites at the Phoenician. So we have other projects in the pipeline, but we have always been very thoughtful, I think, with respect to our messaging, and we do not message these projects until we\u2019re confident that we have the entitlements and we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re going to move forward with them. Aryeh Klein : Thank you. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Anthony Powell at Barclays. Anthony Powell : Hi, good morning. Question about, I guess, you\u2019re growing a bridge loan book. I think you have two loans expiring later this year. Have you started to talk with the borrowers about extending those loans? And just generally, how much capital are you willing to have tied up in these loans going forward? Jim Risoleo : Well, I think, Anthony, that we expect both of the loans on the share \u2013 both Sheratons to be repaid in the second half of the year. The loans are in compliance with the loan documents, payments are current. Both of the borrowers fully anticipate that they are going to be in a position to pay us back. So we have no concerns with respect to getting repaid on those loans. With respect to the Camby, it was a unique situation. We had acquired the Four Season Jackson Hole in 2022. And we made a decision that Camby wasn\u2019t an asset that we needed to own or wanted to own for the long-term, given the amount of CapEx that needed to go into the property and our terrific exposure in the Phoenix metropolitan area with the Phoenician and the Westin Kierland we\u2019ve got, I think the two best resorts in the market. There is some new supply coming into the Phoenix area. And we made a decision that at $110 million, it made sense to sell that hotel. We wanted to make certain that we could take advantage of the reverse like-kind exchange opportunity by investing by designating the proceeds from that asset as a reverse like-kind exchange into the Four Season Jackson Hole property because we had a very low basis in the asset. So that was one of the reasons that drove us to provide solid financing. I\u2019ll just \u2013 I\u2019ll make a broader comment. First of all, I don\u2019t see us doing this on any broad scale. And it\u2019s for a number of reasons. Number one, we don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re \u2013 the portfolio is in a really terrific position right now. Given the capital allocation decisions that we\u2019ve made over the last 6 years, from 2018 forward, we have sold $5 billion plus of assets and really have called the assets that we dumped, but we didn\u2019t want to own for the long-term out of the portfolio. So I don\u2019t see us doing many more bridge loans, if any more bridge loans today. But the assets that we have sold, not greater than I think 65% to 70% loan to value. So we\u2019ve gotten a nice slug of equity in connection with the sale. And if something were to go south, what we do for a living is on hotels. So I wouldn\u2019t bother us at all if we had to take a property back. Anthony Powell : Thank you for the detail Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Smedes Rose at Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask you just a little bit more on the group side as kind of what you\u2019re seeing in terms of kind of the composition of demand? Is it mainly coming from smaller groups? Or are you seeing a return of kind of Fortune 500 bookings and kind of maybe you could talk about that a little bit? And then just with that, could you just touch on what you\u2019re seeing in some of the larger relatively recently renovated marquee properties in San Diego, San Francisco and maybe New York. Sourav Ghosh : Hi, Smedes. On the group front, it is certainly more so being driven by smaller corporate groups. One thing which came back meaningfully and I talked about this in my prepared remarks, was Association is now down only 2% in terms of group revenue to 2019. Corporate group revenue up 6% to 19% and 26% was driven by rate in the first quarter. So a meaningful pickup in corporate group revenue \u2013 the gap right now, I would say, is really on citywides. We are, for 2023, about 83% of where citywide room nights were back in on 2019. So there is still a long way to go in terms of citywide pickup. But overall, what really is picking up, we saw corporate group continuing in last year and multiple quarters, and we saw the same thing happen in Q1, but the big comeback has really been association, which we are seeing meaningful activity not only into Q2, but as well as the second half. Smedes Rose : Okay, thanks. And then just quickly on your Four Seasons, the condo development, would you expect any disruption to the hotel? Or is it far enough away that it won\u2019t impact your guests? Jim Risoleo : Not anticipating any disruption, Smedes. Smedes Rose : Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from David Katz at Jefferies. David Katz : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow on to that commentary, which, Sourav, I know you repeated in terms of the makeup of the group business strength. Is there any commentary or any color with respect to large corporate groups and the citywides, meaning, have they just not gotten around to booking yet? Is there is some expectation or is there some trepidation to it? How should we look into that? Sourav Ghosh : David, if you think about sort of where the big citywide come from? And just to put into perspective for Host for our portfolio, we have about 20% to 25% of our overall group room nights that really come from citywide. We have done a really good job across the board, bringing in in-house groups which are self-contained. And with a lot of our hotels where we\u2019ve expanded meeting space, we now have the ability to actually house the groups completely in-house and are less dependent on city-wides. But in general, if you think about a lot of the convention centers that were actually closed during the pandemic just in terms of sales staff gearing up and selling those cities, there is more of a ramp-up time, and we were talking about this last year, how you were expecting that citywides would be sort of the last ones to come back in a meaningful way. It certainly is very, very market specific. As you well know, like when you look at San Francisco, that\u2019s pretty meaningfully relative to pre-pandemic levels. But other places where we are seeing actually group bookings, which are being driven by citywide and have a good citywide pickup into future years are cities like Boston, like San Antonio, like Chicago. So, it is coming back, but it\u2019s just a matter of the entire sales staff getting all geared up and selling those cities. But so we do expect that to further ramp up with time. David Katz : I see. So, we should take it as further upside. And if I can sort of follow-up to the strong results and the guidance that you have already given us, by the way. If I can just follow-on with respect to San Francisco, because it is a city is a matter of debate. My sense is that you have done reasonably well there. Can you just talk about what\u2019s going on there for you and sort of how you are differentiated than what we have seen in other areas? Jim Risoleo : Sure. I will share our broader thoughts, and then Sourav can get into a little more detail on what happened in San Fran in the first quarter and how we are thinking about it for the balance of the year. So, the city clearly has its challenges. There is no question about it. I will tell you, we are not writing San Francisco off. I think we have a Mayor in that city that is committed to fixing the actual problems and then dealing with the perception as well. From our perspective, we feel very good about the assets we own there. Given their location and many of you on the call have recently visited our Moscone, Marriott Marquis in connection with NAREIT. So, you know what type of asset it is. It\u2019s in great shape. It\u2019s been fully renovated and repositioned and it is Main in Main for any business that is going to book through the Moscone Convention Center. And it is an asset that is extremely well set up to go after and bring in in-house group. So, we have that hotel and then we have the Grand Hyatt on Union Square another terrific property. So, as we think about the assets we own in that market generally and then the third material asset is the Marriott Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, which is a leisure hotel as opposed to group and citywide property. We like the assets we have. We like the condition that they are in. So, we are in a pull position to really take market share and be the first to fill as business returns. And we have seen some good results, and I will let Sourav get into that with you in a moment. Now, I don\u2019t want you to think that we don\u2019t have concerns about San Francisco because we do absolutely have concern about how the market is performing relative to 2019 and what happened with the layoffs in the world of tech and the like, and return to office in that market is really lagging the rest of the country. But it is the center of tech and it\u2019s going to be the center of artificial intelligence as the world returns. So with that, I will let Sourav give you some specifics on how our hotels performed in the market. Sourav Ghosh : For the San Francisco market, we were around 61% occupancy or so at about $291. While RevPAR overall relative to \u201819 is down 27.5%, we did actually exceed our expectations by about 1.5% or so. And that was driven by strength of group, but in particular, with the return of the JPMorgan Group. Food and beverage did really well. We were actually up almost 10% compared to our forecast. And this is due to just the increase in contracted banquet minimums, which frankly, we have been seeing across the board, but really did help San Francisco quite a bit. We do see a lot of in the quarter for the quarter pickup in San Francisco, a lot of the rooms that were actually booked a big piece of it was San Francisco that we picked up in the quarter. Overall, when we are looking out for the rest of the year, there are a few citywides that are there. I think for 2023, the total number of citywides is about 34. And then another 20 citywides confirmed for 2024. So, there is certainly \u2013 I would be cautious and say somewhat of a positive trend. And while it\u2019s a lot of it is short-term and not necessarily long-term pickup. There is certainly some green shoots in San Francisco. David Katz : Really appreciate it. Good quarter. Well done. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is coming from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Michael Bellisario : Thanks. Good morning. Probably for Sourav here on the expense side of the P&L, are you seeing any easing of the cost pressures or the hiring challenges that you have mentioned previously? And then do you have any updated forecast where you see wages and benefits tracking for the remainder of the year? Thanks. Sourav Ghosh : Yes. Our outlook in terms of wage and benefit for the year, year-over-year increase is still at the 5%-ish. Don\u2019t expect that to change for the year. We are tracking well on that. In terms of just overall staffing, given where our business volumes are right now, we feel pretty good. I would say we are fully staffed across the portfolio and are not seeing any major challenges. I mean it still is in certain markets, difficult to hire a line cook. But apart from that, we are lucky where we are predisposed to primarily Marriott managed and Hyatt managed hotels, brand-managed hotels, which they do a really good job of acquiring talent and retaining talent and really are pushing for hospitality as a career, which has made it much easier to staff-up, not only staff-up, but really get quality talent into our hotels. Michael Bellisario : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Bill Crow at Raymond James. Bill Crow : Hey. Good morning everybody. Jim, or maybe this is more of a Sourav question. When you look at BT travel specifically, and you take out the higher rates that we have seen. Where is occupancy or demand depending on how you want to look at it relative to \u201819? How big is that gap? Sourav Ghosh : Yes. That gap from a volume perspective, depending on the market, Bill, is still down anywhere from 15% to 20%. We obviously had a meaningful rate pick up, which \u2013 so if you look at sort of March, I said in my prepared remarks, our overall BT revenue is now down only 7% to 2019. But it is really market dependent. Certain markets are ahead. New York, for example, is meaningfully ahead almost close to where we were back in 2019. But I would say, in general somewhere between down 15% to down 20% in terms of volume. Bill Crow : Thank you for that. And then do you expect that, that gap can be narrowed further this year, or do you think that given the overall cost of travel, the macro headlines and tech layoffs, all that other stuff that we read about. Is that something maybe is it next year or even 2025? Sourav Ghosh : It\u2019s a little difficult to tell how that ramp is going to occur just given the macroeconomic uncertainty overall. But we are seeing a positive trend and sequential month-to-month improvement. One other thing to keep in mind, as we sort of talked about in our prepared remarks is, we are getting a lot of demand from small and medium-sized of business transient versus the larger companies. And some of that comes in through retail, which is difficult to classify exactly as business transient. So, some of the gap or one could argue is being made up by selling more directly through retail as opposed to being classified business. But in general, we still expect some improvement to occur, but probably plateauing until there is more macroeconomic certainty. Bill Crow : Great. Jim, if I could just ask you a quick one. You noted that you are in the hotel ownership business, which I agree, but you are also in the shareholder returns business. I am wondering if the prospects for acquisitions can be appealing enough to use capital in lieu of share repurchases? Jim Risoleo : Yes. Bill, we are actively evaluating potential investment opportunities. I think the gating factor that really distinguish his Host is the fortress balance sheet that we have. Finishing the quarter now back down to 2.2x leverage, after all the activity that has occurred over the last several years, in particular, including the eight acquisitions that were completed over the course of \u201821 and \u201822 as well as the $1.5 billion that we put in our portfolio, all of that is leading as well as the capital allocation decisions that happened from \u201818 forward, that\u2019s what\u2019s leading to our outperformance today. So, I just \u2013 I want to set the table and the transformation of the portfolio with our RevPAR up 9% on a comparable hotel basis to 2017, TRevPAR up 15% and EBITDA per key up 31% and our un-blenching and unyielding focus on expenses and margins is a big reason why we were able to flow through our 24% to 27% RevPAR guidance in first quarter and deliver 31% and put in a substantial beat and raise for the entire year. So, we will continue to look for acquisitions that will elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the company. Right now, what we are seeing out there is a fairly wide bid-ask spread between sellers, what sellers want and what we are prepared to pay today. Now that can change, and it can change for a number of different reasons on. I am talking about non-distressed assets right now. But it can change as we see a clearer picture of the macro as we and everyone else draw some conclusions about how the economy is going to perform going forward. And when I say it can change on both sides, right, I mean we can get more bullish on our underwriting and have a different point of view with respect to our cost of capital. If the Fed does get into an interest cutting mode, which the Street seems to be banking on, they are looking for two rate cuts in back half of the year. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to happen or not. On the other hand, if things get tough, then maybe some of the sellers\u2019 expectations are going to change regarding value. So, we are keeping very close tabs on what\u2019s happening in the transaction market. We are also tracking all of the CMBS loans that are going to be maturing later this year and into \u201824 and \u201825. So, that is one place clearly that we will be prepared to deploy capital. But the great thing about our balance sheet is that it\u2019s not mutually exclusive from a Host perspective. We can buy assets. We will continue to invest in our portfolio. We will continue to do ROI projects to generate shareholder returns, the dividend at $0.12 a share. We will be talking to our Board about what the next quarter\u2019s dividend is. And we have the capital available to do share repurchases as well. So, it\u2019s kind of threading a needle, but we have the ability to do it all. Bill Crow : Very good. Thanks Jim. Look forward to seeing you next week. Jim Risoleo : Likewise. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Chris Woronka at Deutsche Bank. Chris Woronka : Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for all the details so far. So, my question will be on kind of group rate. It seems like you are really starting to benefit from some of the rate increases you got on stuff booked post-COVID. Where do you think you are if we want to use the baseball analogy of innings in terms of recapturing or maybe the answer is pushing group rate? I mean how long of a tail do you think that has? What kind of increases are people agreeing to now for business \u2013 group business out in, say, \u201824 to \u201825? Thanks. Sourav Ghosh : Yes. We continue working with our managers to make sure that rate is certainly a priority. And those conversations, frankly, in a high inflation environment are much easier to have than otherwise. And if you look at sort of where we were in terms of our group rate, just for 2023 at the end of the fourth quarter, we were around 5% higher year-over-year, and we improved 90 basis points already by the end of the first quarter. So, wherever possible, we keep on pushing those rates, and we feel pretty confident that as their availability starts becoming more challenging as we go out into the future, and we have been seeing lead times really expand. So, once those specific date start getting booked up into the future, that leads to real yield management and be able to drive rates even further. So, all-in-all, a really good trend from a rate perspective, and we are seeing continuously rate strength not only into \u201823, but \u201824 and beyond. Chris Woronka : Okay. Thanks Sourav. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Stephen Grambling at Morgan Stanley. Stephen Grambling : Hi. Thanks. This is perhaps a longer term question. But with some of your brand partners in the midst of large tech investments, how would you characterize the opportunity from a tech overhaul coming from some of your partners? And then zooming out, what are your general thoughts on artificial intelligence on how that could not only approach how you bring or what you bring to the business, but also what are your brand partners fit in? Jim Risoleo : Given that Sourav was the father of our relationship with IBM Watson, Stephen as much as I would like the answer to this question, I am going to let him answer it. Sourav Ghosh : Thanks Jim. In terms of what our brand partners are doing with technology, I mean we have had always been at the forefront of trying out new technology, whether it\u2019s proof of concept of piloting new technology to drive not only productivity improvement and just looking at overall sort of expenses, but also what is really going to drive customer satisfaction and what I like to refer to as sort of reduced transaction friction. And those are conversations that we have with our managers is when you think about sort of the front desk of the future, does there really needs to be a front desk period, if you are going to give \u2013 provide the optionality and flexibility to the guests of having access to your room, whether it\u2019s through your phone or whether it\u2019s through getting a physical key card to a kiosk and then being able to \u2013 if nothing else is there, you can approach a host or hostess to check you in. So, those are the kind of conversations we are having is how do you really leverage technology change the long-term sort of operating model that we have had and drive not only efficiencies, but improved customer satisfaction. As it relates to artificial intelligence, as Jim briefly mentioned there, we entered into this partnership with IBM Watson, back in 2018. And it really \u2013 there was \u2013 it was really IBM Research to develop a proprietary model for us that will help us identify markets that outperform or underperform and rank them, so we can make much better capital allocation decisions, whether that\u2019s acquisitions, dispositions or frankly, even investing capital in our existing assets. And I will say this is while certainly IBM Watson couldn\u2019t predict the pandemic, it was most accurate in terms of predicting what RevPAR would do relative to every other third-party predictor out there and including our internal predictive analytics. So, it\u2019s been a really good partnership and it really is a tool that we utilize to help us make capital allocation decisions. But certainly on the forefront of it, we use natural language processing as well as multiple data points that are churned through IBM\u2019s computing system to come up with those rankings. Stephen Grambling : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our final question for today is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth at Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey. Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked. Just on BI, and I apologize if you have said this, your guidance does not include any business interruption, insurance or reimbursement there. But what do you anticipate that to be this year? Sourav Ghosh : Frankly, it\u2019s difficult to tell right now because it is something that we agree upon with our insurers. So, from a timing perspective and the amount perspective, exactly how much we will get this year is difficult. And that\u2019s frankly why we have not put it in our forecast, and it\u2019s not in our guidance. But the moment we do collect BI, we will obviously let you all know and it would flow through down to EBITDA. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Sure. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Jim for closing remarks. Jim Risoleo : I would like to thank everyone for joining us today on our first quarter call. We are really excited about the way the year is setting up for us, and we appreciated the opportunity to discuss our results with you and talk about guidance for the balance of the year. As a reminder, we will be hosting an Investor Day on May 22nd and 23rd in Orlando, Florida. We hope many of you can join us, and we look forward to seeing you there. Thanks again. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jaime Marcus, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may go ahead. Jaime Marcus : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we begin, please note that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel level results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in yesterday's earnings press release and our 8-K filed with the SEC and in the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. With me on today's call are Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Risoleo : Thank you, Jamie, and thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon. During the second quarter, we delivered a comparable hotel RevPAR improvement of 2.7% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Our RevPAR performance for the quarter came in below our quarterly guidance primarily as a result of moderating transient demand in San Francisco and Seattle and at our resorts to a lesser extent.  Comparable hotel RevPAR growth was 3.8% during the quarter, underscoring the continued strength of out-of-room spend. During the quarter, we delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $446 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.53. For our second quarter comparable hotel EBITDA of $449 million was 9% below 2022, it was 9% above 2019. Second quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 32.7% exceeded 2019. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter since the onset of the pandemic that we have achieved RevPAR, RevPAR and comparable hotel EBITDA and margins ahead of 2019 levels. Comparable hotel RevPAR for July is expected to be approximately $209, which is 2.5% above July of 2022. Our performance in the first half of the year, coupled with the macroeconomic backdrop in the second half, led us to tighten our full year RevPAR growth guidance range to 7% to 9%. Bringing the midpoint of our full year expected RevPAR growth to 8%. At the midpoint of our guidance for full year 2023, comparable hotel EBITDA is forecasted to be approximately 9% above 2019. As we look at the current macroeconomic picture, it is important to consider how our outlook has shifted over the past six months. As the second quarter progressed, we started to see a moderation in volume at our hotels in San Francisco and Seattle, which were already affected by softer demand. At the same time, many high-end leisure travelers took the opportunity to travel internationally, and we did not see a corresponding level of international inbound demand, which impacted volume at our resorts. Against this backdrop, we were pleased to deliver positive RevPAR and TRevPAR growth for the quarter especially given the high watermark of the second quarter of 2022. We remain optimistic about the state of travel for several reasons. First, group business continues to improve. During the quarter, we booked over 310,000 group rooms for 2023, and total group revenue pace is now 4.2% ahead of the same time 2019 up from 2.5% as of March and 3.2% as of April. The group booking window is continuing to extend and groups continue to spend more than contracted. Second, business transient demand continued its gradual improvement during the second quarter. Rates were up 10% to both 2022 and 2019 and demand improved nearly 6% compared to the second quarter of 2022. While demand is still down 19% compared to 2019, and improved 190 basis points from the first quarter. Third, leisure rates at our resorts remain well above 2019 levels despite some expected moderation in the second quarter. For context, transient rates at our resorts were 61% above 2019 in the second quarter, an increase from 54% in the first quarter. Fourth, as evidenced by the airline and TSA data, we expect international demand to be a tailwind going forward. In June, U.S. international outbound air travel grew to 110% of pre-pandemic levels, while international inbound was only 80%. This aligns with U.S. outbound summer flight bookings, which are up 27% year-over-year, while corresponding inbound bookings were up only 3% according to rate gain. It is the first summer since 2019 that U.S. travelers had enough lead time to plan an unrestricted international vacation, and we expect these trends will revert over time. Finally, and most importantly, we are not seeing evidence of a weakened consumer at our hotels. Comparable hotel food and beverage spend was up 6% to last year, driven fairly evenly by banquets and outlets indicating the strength of both group and transient customers. This is particularly encouraging as outlet revenue grew 5% despite flat portfolio-wide occupancy. In fact, our resort outlet revenue per occupied room grew 5% in the second quarter compared to 2022, and it was also the highest in Hosts' history at $196. Other revenue also continued to grow, with all line items up over last year, except for attrition and cancellation fees, which are moderating as expected. Golf and spa revenues remain robust with growth over the record highs of 2022, which we believe is further evidence of the leisure travelers' desire and ability to spend on experiences. In fact, we still had five resorts with transient rates of $1,000 or more. Notably, the top three resorts were recent acquisitions, underscoring the strength of our opportunistic capital allocation strategy. Leading the pack was Alila Ventana Big Sur at nearly $1,800 and the Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort and Four Seasons Resort and Residences Jackson Hole, both at over $1,600. Moving to our reconstruction efforts following Hurricane Ian. In June, we completed the final phase of the restoration work at the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point, with the reopening of its water park and outdoor dining complex. And last month, we reopened the completely transformed Ritz-Carlton Naples, which combined a comprehensive renovation of the existing resort with the addition of a new 74 key tower. As part of the renovation, we expanded the guest room bathrooms to increase fixture counts elevated the design and functionality of the rooms and combine standard guestrooms to create multi-base suites. We also enhanced the arrival experience with a reimagined lobby and lobby bar. The development of the Vanderbilt Tower added a net 24 additional keys, increased the suite count to 92 from 35 and added new pools, cabanas, bungalows, a pull side F&B outlet with the bar and an expanded club lounge that eliminates the capacity constraint on upsells. In addition to the renovation and expansion, our reconstruction efforts allowed us to opportunistically enhance the resiliency of the property by elevating critical equipment, improving dry flood-proofing measures, accelerating future building envelope waterproofing and replacing major equipment with more efficient machinery. The transformation of the Ritz-Carlton Naples has been extremely well received since the reopening, and we are optimistic that the resort is set up to exceed our underwriting expectations. As an example, pace for the 2023 festive season is well above historical levels with the expanded suite inventory and new club level facilities and high demand. The new lobby champagne bar has quickly become the place to see and be seen and Naples for both guests and locals. We are extremely pleased with the transformation of this iconic resort and we are excited to see the results it delivers over the years to come. In terms of insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Ian, to date, we have received $113 million of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs. The proceeds have all been allocated to property managed thus far. Turning to group. Revenue exceeded 2022 by 4%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter, group revenue exceeded 2019. Definite group room nights on the books for 2023 increased to $3.7 million in the second quarter which represents approximately 103% of comparable full year 2022 actual group room nights, up from 94% as of the first quarter. For full year 2023, group rate on the books is up 7% to the same time last year, a 30 basis point increase since the first quarter. In addition, total group revenue pace is up approximately 19% to the same time last year and up 4.2% to the same time 2019. Looking ahead to 2024, we have 2.2 million definite group room nights on the books. Total group revenue pace is up 13.5% to the same time last year and up 1.5% to the same time 2019. We are encouraged by the ongoing strength of group as evidenced by accelerating booking activity, lengthening booking windows and tentative room nights ahead of both last year and 2019. Moving to portfolio reinvestment. We completed comprehensive renovations at the final asset in the Marriott Transformational Capital Program, the Washington Marriott and Metro Center during the second quarter. The program, which began in 2018, included extensive guestroom and public area renovations at 16 assets and finished under budget. During the pandemic, we expanded our reinvestment strategy to include 8 additional assets with required near-term CapEx, where we believe significant upside could be realized with transformational renovations. To date, we have completed 7 of those 8 assets. We believe these comprehensive renovations will enable us to continue to capture incremental market share above our targeted range of 3 to 5 points of RevPAR index share gains and that is shaping up to be the case so far. Looking at results to date. Of the 7 hotels that have stabilized post-renovation operations, the average RevPAR index share gain is 8.8 points. For the full year, our 2023 capital expenditure guidance range is $625 million to $725 million, which reflects approximately $240 million of investment for redevelopment, repositioning and ROI projects as well as $125 million to $175 million for hurricane restoration work. Remaining projects include the completion of a transformational renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani, a repositioning renovation of the Hilton Singer Island and breaking ground on finishing Canyon Sweet villas and the luxury condominium development at Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort. More broadly, we will continue to be strategic and opportunistic in our approach to driving EBITDA growth. We have an investment-grade balance sheet, independent analytic capabilities, a diversified portfolio and the size, scale and team to continue executing across economic cycles. We have created meaningful shareholder value over the past six years by improving the quality of our cash flow, and we believe Hosts is ideally positioned to outperform in the current macroeconomic environment. With that, I will turn the call over to Sourav. Sourav Ghosh : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on our second quarter operations, our updated 2023 guidance and our balance sheet and dividends. Starting with business mix. Overall transient revenue was up 80 basis points to the second quarter of 2022, driven by rate growth, which offset a slight decrease in demand. Softening transient demand drove the miss to RevPAR guidance driven primarily by underperformance in San Francisco and Seattle and at our resorts to a lesser extent. Results in the second quarter saw transient revenue down 8% over the all-time high of the second quarter of 2022. While transient rate at resorts was down year-over-year, it was still 61% above 2019 after being up 54% compared to 2019. In fact, transient revenue at our resorts increased in the second quarter compared to the first quarter despite the slight decrease in demand. Business transient revenue was 16% above the second quarter of 2022, driven by a 10% rate increase. Demand also increased by nearly 6% above last year, driven by our hotels in New York, Boston and Washington, D.C. Our downtown properties accounted for 65% of the business transient demand, which is in line with pre-pandemic trends. Small and medium-sized businesses continue to drive the recovery, representing the majority of our business transient demand today.  Turning to group. Group room revenues were 4% above the second quarter of 2022, fully driven by rate growth. The 1.1 million group room nights sold in the quarter was slightly ahead of both last year and the first quarter, which aligns with 2019 seasonal trends. Washington, D.C., Chicago and Boston drove the group room revenue growth compared to 2022. With respect to group mix, corporate group room revenue was up 9% in the second quarter, driven by nearly 6% rate growth. As anticipated, Association Group's revenue was down almost 3% in the second quarter compared to last year, as the second quarter of 2022 had elevated association group volume driven by rebookings for events that were canceled during the pandemic. Social, military, educational, villages and fraternal or Smart Group revenue was up 3% in the second quarter, driven by 2.5% rate growth. Our 2024 total group revenue pace is above both 2022 and 2019, and we are encouraged by the citywide booking pace in New Orleans, San Diego, Seattle and Washington, D.C. all of which have citywide group room nights meaningfully ahead of the same time last year. Shifting gears to margin performance. Our second quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin came in at 32.7% which is 40 basis points better than the second quarter of 2019, but below the high watermark of the second quarter of 2022 when staffing at hotels lagged demand. Total comparable expenses grew just 7.5% over 2019, while total comparable revenues were up 7.8%. As expected, attrition and cancellation revenue moderated from 2022 levels during the second quarter. We are encouraged that comparable hotel EBITDA margin remains above 2019 despite elevated inflation over the past four years and occupancy still 8 points below 2019. As Jim noted, we tightened our full year comparable hotel RevPAR growth range to 7% to 9%. The RevPAR midpoint of 8% is 100 basis points less than our prior midpoint. But at the high end of the original guidance range we provided in February. We estimate that approximately 60 basis points of the midpoint decline is attributable to second quarter results and the remaining 40 basis points is attributable to our updated outlook for the second half of the year. While we have not yet seen signs of a macroeconomic-driven slowdown, our guidance range continues to contemplate varying degrees of moderating growth in the second half of the year. As a result, we would expect year-over-year comparable hotel RevPAR percentage changes in the second half of the year to be flat to up low single digits, primarily driven by occupancy.  At the midpoint of our guidance, we would expect a comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 29.9%, which is 40 basis points ahead of 2019 and full year adjusted EBITDAre of $1.550 billion. Keep in mind that the midpoint of our revised full year 2023 adjusted EBITDAre guidance is still $100 million above the original guidance we provided in February and down only $25 million from the guidance we provided in May. We expect our operational results to roughly follow 2019 quarterly seasonal trends as provided on Page 17 of our supplemental financial information. As a reminder, the third quarter of the year is historically the weakest of the four quarters in terms of both nominal dollars and margins due to seasonal market and business mix shifts. Our 2023 full year adjusted EBITDAre guidance includes an expected $17 million contribution from Hyatt Regency Coconut Point and the Ritz-Carlton Naples, both of which are excluded from our comparable hotel results due to impacts from Hurricane Ian. As we have discussed previously, the pre-hurricane estimated contribution from these two hotels including the new tower at Ritz-Carlton Naples was expected to be an additional $71 million in 2023. It is also important to note that we have not included any expected business interruption proceeds from Hurricane Ian in our 2023 guidance. As we have discussed over the past few quarters, year-over-year, we expect comparable hotel EBITDA margins to be down 210 basis points at the low end of our guidance to down 170 basis points at the high end due to stable staffing levels at our hotels, higher utility and insurance expenses and lower attrition and cancellation fees. We expect the biggest margin differential year-over-year to be in the second quarter with a narrowing margin spread in the second half of the year. For these reasons, we do not believe 2022 will present a stabilized comparison for margins. Relative to 2019, which is more representative year for margin comparison, we expect margins this year to be up 20 basis points at the low end of our guidance to up 60 basis points at the high end despite lagging occupancy and elevated inflation pressures over the past 4 years. Our efforts to transform the portfolio and evolve the hotel operating model are enabling this margin expansion. As we have discussed in the past, it is particularly impressive when you consider that our forecasted total hotel expense CAGR from 2019 to 2023 is only 1.6% versus the forecasted core CPI CAGR of 4% over the same period. Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our weighted average maturity is 4.7 years at a weighted average interest rate of 4.5%, and we have no significant maturities until April 2024. We ended the second quarter at 2.2 times leverage, and we have $2.5 billion of total available liquidity, which includes of $213 million of FF&E reserves and full availability of our $1.5 billion credit facility. In addition, during the second quarter, we achieved a milestone in our progress towards our renewable energy goal, resulting in a 2.5 basis point reduction in the interest rate on the outstanding term loans under our sustainability-linked credit facility. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share, an increase of $0.03 or 25% over the prior quarter in July. Though we expect to maintain our quarterly dividend at a sustainable level, taking into consideration potential macroeconomic factors, all future dividends are subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors. We remain optimistic on the future of our business and travel overall. In any scenario, we believe our portfolio, our balance sheet and our team are well positioned to continue outperforming and we will continue to be strategic in the current macroeconomic environment. With that, we would be happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is live. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. I appreciate the macro stats that you shared. But do you have any way to track international inbound as a percent of your own portfolio? Where does that stand now versus pre-pandemic levels as a percentage of the mix? Jim Risoleo : Yes, it's Jim. Pre-pandemic, international inbound accounted for roughly 10% of our room night. In quarter 2 of 2022, it was 7.8%. And that is compared to 7.4% in 2022 in the second quarter. So we feel that international inbound is a tailwind to our portfolio performance going forward. In particular, if you saw in the month of June, international inbound was only 80% of where it was in June of 2019. Outbound, as we've talked about, was 110% where it was in June of 2019. So as the world starts to normalize and hopefully, as we can right sort out the Visa wait times in the U.S., which are 400 days now on average, and it's a real drag on international inbound. As an example, Canada, you can get a visa from a country that they require Visa for travel to Canada in 55 days. So -- that is -- that's a big issue that we, as an industry, are dealing with through U.S. travel and through AHLA as well. The other impediment at this point in time with respect to international inbound in our West Coast markets, in particular, is travel from China. Pre-pandemic, we had 350 direct flights a week between the U.S. and China. As it sits today, we have '24. So we're optimistic that over time, things are going to normalize and that we're going to see the return of the international travel, which will further bolster our performance. Duane Pfennigwerth : And then just for my follow-up on BI on the business interruption. As you think about growth into 2024, you'll have a natural recovery in Naples from the Ritz being back online. My guess is that would begin to contribute year-on-year in the fourth quarter. But from a growth perspective, what would be the ideal timing for BI reimbursement to hit? Jim Risoleo : Well, I'll let Sourav jump in on this, but let me just kind of set the table with respect to how our insurance program works. We collected $113 million all related to restoration and physical damage repair. We have a $130 million receivable outstanding, and we won't start recognizing business interruption proceeds until we collect the $130 million at a minimum. Sourav Ghosh : Yes, Duane, on the timing, honestly, that's why we don't have it in our forecast. It's very difficult to say. We are working with the insurance carriers right now in terms of determining how much that BI amount is. So the collection of it could be certainly some amount in Q3 led into Q4 as well as into the following year. We actually got from Hurricane Ida, if you recall, which impacted New Orleans last year, we just got a $2.7 million BI payment this quarter. So the timing is very difficult to gauge. We fully expect, as we said, that we would be paid out. And it's certainly going to be a meaningful amount. The exact timing is very difficult to predict at this point in time. Operator : Our next question is coming from Aryeh Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is live. Aryeh Klein : Thanks. Good afternoon. Within the second quarter, was it June where you saw things not really play out as you expected? And then the magnitude of the implied impact to second half RevPAR in guidance is, I guess, less of the impact in Q2. Can you add some color on the underlying assumptions? And is there something in there that may be better than you originally expected? Jim Risoleo : All right. Can you clarify that? Is this -- are you referring to the -- our assumptions with respect to the second half of the year? Aryeh Klein : Yes. The first part was just on when you started to see the weakness in the second quarter? And the second part is, I think the RevPAR impact was 60 basis points, worse than expected in the second quarter and then another 40 basis points in the second half of the year. So just curious if you can give some more color on the second half and some of the underlying assumptions there -- how you expect that to play out if there's anything better or worse than you originally expected? Jim Risoleo : Sure. So as we saw performance weekend in the month of June. That's really when it -- we saw the vast majority of the weakness occur. We went back at the property level and really look at the assumptions that were in the forecast with respect to transient pickup in the quarter for the quarter.  You may recall that we had transient pick up as high as 28% in the quarter for the quarter and another quarter with 20%. While that didn't materialize for the second quarter. So as we have talked about trends normalizing, we think that is a trend that is normalizing at this point in time. And we were very, I would say, thoughtful and deliberate about how we expected the second half of the year to play out. And we really washed out a meaningful amount of the transient pickup in the quarter for the quarter, and that led to our revised forecast. Is that helpful? Aryeh Klein : Yes, I appreciate the color. And then just a quick other question. I think you have some seller financing coming up later this year. Any update there on how you expect that to play out? Jim Risoleo : Yes. Sure. Well, we had the loan on the Sheraton Boston matured. The maturity date was August 1, a few days ago. And the borrower was in the process of refinancing us out, and they need a little more time to do it. So we entered into an agreement with that borrower to provide for a 60-day extension. And it also involved the receipt of a 10% principal pay down on our loan, which was $16.1 million, and we have received that money. And we restated the interest rate from 6.5% to 12%. So that loan is now due at the end of September, but we materially improved our position on it, and I am very confident that the borrower is going to be able to get the financing done. The nuance was a condo regime that they were pursuing on the property to effectuate their business plan. They were going to convert 1 tower. They are going to convert 1 tower to student housing and leave the other tower as a hotel, and it was just taking a bit longer to effectuate the condo documents and the like to get it done. With respect to the loan on the Marquis, we have been in contact with the borrower and they are actively in the market pursuing a refinance. So we feel good that they're going to be able to get that deal done. Aryeh Klein : Great. Thanks for all the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Your line is live. Anthony Powell : Hi, good afternoon. Just one for me. And I guess on the other side of the refinancing activity, you saw that an owner of a resort in May was able to get a hotel refinance with a cash out refi at a high rate, but good proceeds. So do you think that kind of ability limit kind of the number of deals that come to market in terms of your ability to maybe do some larger acquisitions here? Jim Risoleo : Yeah, I think it really is very sponsor specific, market-specific and hotel-specific, Anthony. And the asset that you're referring to in Maui had been on the market for sale on more than 1 occasion, frankly. It's something that we obviously looked at that given our exposure on Maui and the assets that we own, it wasn't something that we could get excited about.  And whenever they could not effectuate a sale at the price that they wanted, they were able to get the deal done. Now that's a unique asset because it had -- as you know, the resort market is extremely strong, and it had really strong underlying cash flow, strong performance. It had undergone a renovation and had the right equity capital behind it as well. So there will be circumstances like the Maui property where sellers will be able to get an attractive refinance, but there are also going to be circumstances where all those boxes are in check whether or not the asset is not performing well, whether or not it's been reinvested in, whether or not it's in a market that a lender would find attractive to deploy capital to, so deploy money too. So I still believe that over time, given the fact that there have been so many assets that have not been reinvested in over the course of the pandemic and owners/borrowers are strapped for cash and they have to put capital into their hotels that we may see opportunities as later in this year and into 2024. Anthony Powell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is live. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask you a little more about the weaker-than-expected transient business in San Francisco and Seattle. And I think in San Francisco, maybe it's not all that surprising given kind of continued delays in their recovery and a lot of sort of ugly headline issues around quality of life. But in Seattle, do you do you ascribe the weakness to just kind of more of sort of local economic issues, maybe to do with the tech industry? Or are you also starting to see a pullback in because of sort of issues that, that city might be having as well? And is that going to become a drag longer term on the portfolio? Sourav Ghosh : Hey, Smedes, it's -- with Seattle, we actually saw BT improve. So that was certainly not an issue with Seattle. It was just overall sort of anticipation of how much we could pick up not only in the quarter for the quarter, but really in the month for the month, there was sort of -- we started seeing the trend shift a little bit at the end of May into June. So for us, Seattle actually continues to be a relatively -- it was always a weaker market to begin with, at the beginning of this year, but there is signs, especially when you look into 2024, Citywide and just pace, there certainly is strength in the Seattle market moving forward. So this we attribute really to sort of short-term transient pickup. Overall, I mean, when you look at sort of Seattle, specifically BT revenue grew actually year-over-year by about 5%, and that was all rate driven by Amazon. Group room nights and total revenue production also exceeded our internal forecast. So it really was BT driven. It wasn't anything to do with group at all. So overall, we sort of -- sorry, leisure driven versus BT driven. Smedes Rose : Okay. And then can I just follow up on that. When you -- as you reintroduce the Ritz-Carlton and you talked about the $71 million, I guess, that you lost through disruption. When -- what sort of time frame would you expect to recoup that? Is that something that will happen all in 2023? Or how are you thinking about that? Jim Risoleo : Well, I think this goes to the earlier question regarding the receipt of timing of business interruption proceeds. And we haven't put the BI in our forecast because we just don't know when we're going to receive it. But I'm hopeful that certainly through the course of 2024, we should be able to close out most, if not all, of the claim associated with Hurricane Ian, and we do anticipate very strong performance from both the Ritz and the Hyatt Regency next year as well. Smedes Rose : Okay. But do you think -- I mean I was asking about the business interruption and more about recouping the EBITDA that was lost and getting back to getting that $71 million back just from operations. Do you think that's a 2024? Jim Risoleo : That is -- barring a macroeconomic meltdown, that will certainly happen throughout the course of 2024. I mean it's a seasonal property. We're very pleased with the pace that we're seeing around festive, which is really December, January, February -- December, January and then that the property really takes off in that period of time in the first quarter. So there is incredible enthusiasm for the new offerings at the hotel, at the resort in Naples. It's a really unique property, and we're very optimistic that it's going to perform very well. And we should between those two assets over the course of 2024, rebuild our $71 million that we lost this year due to. Sourav Ghosh : Smedes, just want to clarify here for you understand, we are actually picking up combined for a non-comparable hotels, which includes Coconut Point and Ritz Naples $17 million in the adjusted EBITDA number. So it's not in our hotel EBITDAre, but it is in our adjusted EBITDAre. That's for 2023. So the 2024, $71 million, which we're saying, that's incremental to that $17 million. None of that $71 million is really in the '23 number, if that makes sense. Smedes Rose : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is live. David Katz : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to the expense side because it's come up a handful of times around the cost of labor. One, as a function of just being fully staffed on a comparable basis versus last year, but two, the actual per person cost of it and whether that's going up.  And secondarily, we've talked before about the cost of insurance, and I just wanted to get an update there as well, please. Sourav Ghosh : Sure. I think we had messaged before that our wage rate growth for this year, we expect it to be around 5%. And that we are still holding to that. And thus far, when you look through our expenses, we have actually performed pretty well on our expenses, and you can see that in our margin expansion relative to 2019. For the second quarter as well as what we are expecting for the full year to the midpoint being 40 basis points.  So labor-wise, we still expect a 5% rate growth. We are seeing all the productivity improvement improvements we made as a result of redefining our operating model, still holding and certainly something that is sustainable, which is driving the margin expansion to 2019. As far as insurance goes, we had baked into the forecast approximately 50% premium increase. Our renewal was in June 1. We maintained our coverage and the limits that we had previously. So no change to that. The overall rate increase was about 38%, and the premium increase, like I said, was close to 50%. So for the full year, which is already in our forecast and was in our forecast, insurance expense is expected to go up about 40% year-over-year, which equates to approximately $61 million for 2023. David Katz : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Your line is live. Michael Bellisario : Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Just one question for me on the group booking front. Can you provide some color just on what markets you're seeing pick up momentum? And there are also any markets in the portfolio that were either softer or you see softening or maybe just leveling off as you look out to the back half of the year in '24? Thank you. Sourav Ghosh : Sure. For specifically for 2024, as Jim mentioned, our total group revenue pace is ahead to 2019 by 1.5%. And just to remind you, when we were looking sort of -- in the end of last year, we were actually down double digits in total revenue pace and that improved to down about 4.4% to '19 in the first quarter, and now it's actually positive. So we're seeing really positive activity and momentum when it comes to 2024 pace. For our specific portfolio, where we are seeing PACE very strong is Atlanta, Chicago, New Orleans, New York, Phoenix, San Diego, as mentioned earlier, Seattle and Washington, D.C. And that wraps with sort of the citywide pace improvement as well, where we're seeing positive city-wise, better than '19 and for New Orleans, San Diego, Seattle and D.C. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Your line is live. Bill Crow : Thanks, good afternoon. Jim, help me understand this leisure normalization that we're all talking about. Because implicit in your remarks, at least I took it that maybe rate is staying strong, but demand is off. We heard from a peer this morning that said, rate is down 10% in one of their markets, but demand is strong. I guess I'm trying to figure out what you're seeing out there. Is it on the demand side? Is it on the rate side? Is it both on leisure normalization? Jim Risoleo : Sure, Bill. We had always anticipated in our forecasting that rate was going to back off a bit. I mean we never believe that rate was going to be sustainable relative to where it was in 2019. And certainly, in -- second quarter 2022 was an anomaly on many, many fronts, given Omicron in Q1. So we assume rate was going to come down, and it did. I think our leisure rate came down about 7% all in all.  That said, it was still 61% higher than where it was in Q2 2019. What we didn't anticipate, and I don't think anybody anticipated if you look at the commentary of travel-related companies in general, whether they're the car rental companies or the airlines was the desire by the U.S. consumer to travel abroad. And that is where we saw the softness in our leisure business because we didn't pick up the volume that we anticipated that we would. I think our total leisure occupancy was down by one percentage point. So it was nothing meaningful by any stretch of the imagination. Rates are still at record levels. As you saw in the release, TRevPAR was up 3.8%.  So we're still seeing very healthy out-of-room spend, whether it's at outlets or golf spa and otherwise. I mean we had a record outlet spend per occupied room, I think, of $193 or $196 in the quarter. So I don't know if people are going to go to Europe every quarter or if they're going to go to Europe in the second quarter of next year. But clearly, this was a phenomena that I think everyone missed -- and we're just very -- we're very comfortable with how the resorts have performed in general. Certainly, from a rate perspective, the issue was really a slowdown in volume. Bill Crow : If I could just pursue that just a little bit more because you talked about this normalization and kind of we call it the travel -- the international travel imbalance. But it's been kind of three years of pent-up demand. So it seems like that could continue for a while longer. And I'm just curious, and you probably don't have an answer, but yours is better than mine. Are we going to be talking about continued normalization next year? Jim Risoleo : I hope we can get -- frankly, Bill, I hope we can get beyond talking about 2019 and in 2022 and say, okay, 2023 is the year we look at, and it's a new benchmark in our new base year going forward.  So normalization to occur in 2024, I frankly think that, that's a tailwind to us. And it really is a tailwind because we're international inbound performed in the second quarter. And some of the issues we talked about with respect to flights from China and visa wait times and things of that nature. I mean, we just didn't see any pickup in in our resort properties or elsewhere, frankly, from the international inbound travel. I mean we had 10% of our room nights in 2019. We were 7.8%.  So again, I think it's a positive for us going forward. And I think it's positive for the industry going forward. We're certainly not seeing anyone remain in the consumer is very healthy. We're not seeing them rein in their spending. Bill Crow : Great, thanks. Jim, appreciated. Jim Risoleo : Sure, Bill. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tyler Batory with Oppenheimer. Your line is live. Tyler Batory : Good afternoon. Thank you. I just want to stick on the leisure topic for a minute here. And just a multipart question. I mean a lot of the commentary relates to your resort properties. I'm also interested in what you're seeing urban leader, specifically on the weekends, that's following a similar trajectory in terms of a softness that you're experiencing on the resort side. And then just kind of a follow-up, thinking about revenue management. If demand slows further from here at your resort properties? Would you look to hold on to occupancy and lower rates or maybe you want to hold on to rate and you're okay sacrificing some occupancy? Just trying to think through some of the scenarios there. Jim Risoleo : Yeah. I will answer the second part of your question first, and I'll let Sourav talk to the first part regarding urban leisure. That's a tricky question to answer about really looking at the proper yield management strategies. You flow a much greater percentage of ADR to the bottom line than you do a plan occupancy. And I think one of the things that has been really encouraging over the course of the last several years is the fact that, generally, across the board, properties have held rates and rate integrity has remained intact. And there would have to be a real meaningful trade-off, i.e., significant pickup in occupancy before we would consider cutting rate. Because once you cut rate, it's difficult to go back to the other direction. And as I said, we saw a 1% reduction in occupancy in Q2 and rate was still 60% above where it was in the second quarter of 2019. And it really just flows to the bottom line and has a meaningful impact on margin performance. Sourav Ghosh : Yeah. And on the leisure front, when you're looking at the urban hotels, they actually were pretty consistent overall. We didn't see the same level of drop off if you will, in terms of the demand. And we saw a little more consistent short term in the quarter for the quarter pickup with the exception, obviously, of San Francisco and Seattle, as we mentioned.  But overall, when you look at sort of our overall other market performance, we were actually up in rate 6.3% and for a convention portfolio, about 5.1% overall for that. And while resort was actually down about 12%. So definitely had a more stable performance even when we looked at the holiday performance during the quarter. Tyler Batory : Okay. I appreciate that detail. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. Chris Woronka : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for all the detail so far. Question is on the tail that you expect to get from the capital transformation program. I think you mentioned eight of the hotels are fully stabilized and you're getting the 9 points. Just how long does that last? What about the other, I guess, eight or nine hotels? And then does that make you want to -- I think you mentioned there were two others that you renovated that weren't in the original program. That make you, Jim, want to look at even more hotels and as other owners are dealing with issues and maybe not fully keeping up on their own capital? Jim Risoleo : The short answer to the second part of your question, Chris, is we will continue to be opportunistic and where we see an opportunity to do a transformational renovation and I want to underline the word transformational because I think that is why we are seeing the outperformance that we are achieving in the recently renovated and stabilized properties. We have the balance sheet. We have the capital. We have the team internally to execute on those types of opportunities, and we will certainly look to deploy capital where we think we can achieve better than 3 to 5 points in yield index. To answer your question with respect to how long does it last? Well, I suppose I could tell you that it would last until the property looks hard, and we have to renovate it again. And that's probably you're talking a seven-year cycle generally for a rooms renovation seven to eight years, roughly. So we are really optimistic that we were able to deploy the type of capital that we did into our properties over the course of the pandemic, and we expect to see future strong outperformance going forward. Chris Woronka : Okay, very helpful. Thanks, Jim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is live. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks. I just wanted to understand a little bit better your guidance for second half margin. You have declines kind of moderating from Q2, but RevPAR not necessarily much stronger. So just kind of wondering how you are comfortable because a lot of the factors you mentioned, I would think could still have tough comps in terms of labor costs and cancellations -- fewer cancellation fees. So just any color there you can give us? Sourav Ghosh : Yeah, Robin. I mean, when you look at sort of our guidance and I'll speak to dollars perspective, we basically took it down, what, about $25 million, as you mentioned in our prepared remarks. And we would attribute about $17 million really to the second quarter and about $8 million -- sorry, $18 million for the second quarter and then $7 million, call it, for the second half. And the way you look at sort of the RevPAR growth that we're assuming, we effectively looked at the short-term pickup market by market and we expected in the quarter for the quarter pickup and really scrubbed that to get to the RevPAR growth of low single-digit growth for the second half. On the expense side, the expense drivers that we effectively flowed through was all revenue driven. So when you look at the second quarter as well, the relative drop in terms of margin to what we had guided to was more than 80% all revenue driven. So we feel very comfortable with all the expense growth that we have in there. The only thing we did moderate is also food and beverage revenue, which obviously just given Q2 ends, we moderated that. That flows through the food and beverage department line as well as impact margins. So we feel very comfortable in terms of our expense forecast for the second half. relative to the revenue growth that we have. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. Thank you. And I don't know if I heard you guys mention an expectation for corporate negotiated rate for next year? Sourav Ghosh : No, we did not. That will not start until really later in August. So we'll have more color as to what that will be shaping up like probably on our third quarter call as we typically do. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you so much. Our final question will be coming from Dori Kesten of Wells Fargo. Your line is live. Dori Kesten : You mentioned a few times washing out the short-term transient pickup in the second half of the year. What would your guidance look like if the pickup was comparable to 2019? Sourav Ghosh : What it would look like if it was in terms of the transient pickup being comparable to 2019 because we're obviously off from a BT perspective, meaningfully we are off by 20%. The group for night on also off. So It's kind of difficult to say relative to '19 in terms of room night because are up in rate, right? So I don't have exactly what that number would be, if our rate was held exactly at '19, and we had the same amount of resin. Dori Kesten : Okay. I guess I'll ask a second one. So you've talked about the healthy out of room spend. And I think year-to-date, the RevPAR to to RevPAR growth spreads about 200 basis points. And so I'm just trying grout -- like what do you see in the second half of the year that leads you to believe by year-end, room and out of them spend growth should converge? Sourav Ghosh : So when you look at where the food and beverage came in for the second quarter relative to '19. It was certainly lower, and that was really being driven by sort of the type of groups that we actually got in second quarter and a lot of the rebookings that took place during the pandemic that were in Q2.  When you look forward into Q3 and Q4, -- our -- as we mentioned earlier, third quarter is our weakest group quarter. So food and beverage and Banco will be lower as well in Q3, but Q4 is a strong group quarter for us. And that's where we feel like food and beverage should perform well in the fourth quarter just based on the catering pace that we have.  And as a reminder, I've been banking catering contribution with the metric you look at, which is up 20% in Q1 that was up over 6% in Q2 as well. So that we still have we still building on the strength of banquet and AV going forward in the second half as well as the outlook performance of our resorts, which, by the way, on a per occupied room basis was 46% above 2019. Dori Kesten : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. So I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Risoleo for any closing comments you may have. Jim Risoleo : I'd like to thank everybody for joining us on our second quarter call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our quarterly results with you -- we hope you enjoy the rest of your summer, and we look forward to seeing many of you in person this fall. Thanks again. . Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's call, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation.",

Before we begin, please note that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws as described in our filings with the SEC. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed. And we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel level results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in yesterday's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. With me on today's call are Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Risoleo : Thank you, Jaime, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. Before we turn to the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the devastating wildfires that occurred on the island of Maui this past August. All of us at Host were deeply saddened by the loss of life and heartbreaking impact on local communities. As the largest hotel real estate owner on Maui for over 20 years, Host has long shared a connection to the island and helping to support the community through this difficult time is important to our company. We are proud to have aided recovery and rebuilding efforts, donating more than $250,000 to emergency response and relief organizations, as well as providing direct financial assistance and relief to our hotels employees. We also provided food and shelter to these employees, their families and emergency response teams. The strength and resilience of the Maui community inspires us and we are committed to supporting them as the recovery continues. Now let's move to our results for the quarter. Please note that the results presented on today's call represent the comparable hotel portfolio, which includes all three Maui resorts and continues to exclude the Ritz-Carlton Naples in Hyatt Regency Coconut Point. When applicable, we will provide estimated impacts from Maui to certain results to provide a more comprehensive view of business trends in the quarter. During the third quarter, we delivered a comparable hotel RevPAR improvement of 1.8% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Our RevPAR performance for the quarter was driven by an occupancy increase of 150 basis points led by our convention hotels in downtown locations. Overall, Maui had less of an impact on our results than we initially expected as we were able to replace high rated transient business with recovery and relief group business, which impacted our demand mix this quarter. We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $361 million, which includes $54 million of business interruption proceeds from Hurricane Ian and delivered adjusted FFO per share of $0.41 beating consensus on both metrics. Third quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 26.6% exceeded 2019 by 10 basis points and this marks the sixth consecutive quarter since the onset of the pandemic that we have achieved TRevPAR, RevPAR, comparable hotel EBITDA and margins ahead of 2019 levels. Comparable hotel RevPAR for October is expected to be approximately $229, a 2.4% improvement over 2022. We estimate that the Maui wildfires impacted third quarter comparable hotel RevPAR by 60 basis points, comparable hotel TRevPAR by 120 basis points, and comparable hotel EBITDA by $4.5 million. Our risk management team is continuing to engage with our insurers about potential business interruption coverage and the timing and amounts of any potential proceeds are not yet known. Despite the wildfires on Maui, which we expect will impact our full year RevPAR guidance by 50 basis points, we maintained the midpoint of our previous full year expected comparable hotel RevPAR growth at 8% and tightened our full year RevPAR growth guidance range to 7.25% to 8.75%. At the midpoint of our guidance, full year 2023 comparable hotel EBITDA is forecasted to be 8.5% above 2019 with comparable hotel RevPAR growth 5.6% greater than 2019. As we look at the current macro picture, we continue to be optimistic about the state of travel for several reasons. First, group business continues to improve. During the quarter, we booked 245,000 group rooms through 2023 and total group revenue pace is now 6.7% ahead of the same time 2019, up from 4.2% as of the second quarter. Even without the recovery in relief groups on Maui, total group revenue would have been above both 2022 and 2019. The group booking window continues to extend and we are pleased with the base we have on the books for next year. Second, business transient demand continued its gradual improvement during the third quarter. Business transient revenue was up approximately 9% to 2022 and demand improved 5% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Overall, business transient revenue is down approximately 16% compared to 2019, with room nights down approximately 20%. Room nights have gradually improved throughout the year. In January, we were down nearly 23% to 2019. And in September, we were down just 17% to 2019. We see the continued evolution of business travel, as a tailwind in the future. Third, leisure rates at our resorts remain well above 2019 levels, despite continued moderation in the third quarter as expected. For context, transient rates at our resorts were 56% above 2019 in the third quarter, which is particularly impressive when considering that this excludes the benefits from our two newly renovated noncomparable hotels in Florida and includes the impact from our three resorts on Maui. Fourth, we expect international demand to be a positive trend going forward. International inbound air traffic increased to 88% of 2019 levels in September, up from 80% in June. At the same time, international outbound air traffic increased to 118% of 2019 levels, after hovering near 108% since January, which indicates that consumers continue to prioritize travel. As evidenced by recent booking volume trends for US airlines, the international imbalance is likely to revert to 2019 levels over time. Most importantly, we are not seeing evidence in weaken consumer at our hotels. Food and beverage outlet revenues remained both above 2022 and 2019, driven by resorts and nonresort alike, which is encouraging, given that occupancy still lags 2019 levels. Golf and small revenues also remained significantly ahead of pre-pandemic levels. Taken together, we believe this indicates that consumers continue to desire and ability to spend on experiences at our hotels. Moving to our reconstruction efforts following Hurricane Ian. The newly transformed Ritz-Carlton Naples has been very well received since its reopening in July and we are optimistic that the resort is set up to exceed our underwriting expectations. Transient rates were 75% above 2019 for the second half of this year, driven by the increased suite mix in the new Vanderbilt Tower. Looking forward to festive season, club-level room night booking pace is up more than 25% over the same time in 2019 with an ADR premium of almost $900 and suite bookings are pacing up 125% with a more than $1,300 rate increase over 2019. We are proud of the well-deserved tension that Ritz-Carlton Naples is receiving, including regaining the coveted AAA five-diamond designation and we look forward to seeing the results it delivers in the years to come. In terms of insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Ian, to-date, we have received $208 million of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs. During the third quarter, we received $54 million of business interruption proceeds, and we expect to receive an additional $26 million of business interruption proceeds in the fourth quarter. Turning to group. Revenue exceeded 2022 by 10% in the third quarter, marking the fifth consecutive quarter group revenue exceeded 2019. Definite group room nights on the books for 2023 increased to 4 million in the third quarter, which represents approximately 110% of comparable full year 2022 actual group room nights, up from 103% as of the second quarter. For full year 2023, total group revenue pace is up approximately 20% to the same time last year, and up 6.7% to the same time 2019 in part due to recovery and relief groups on Maui. Group rate on the books is up 7% at the same time last year, a 40 basis point increase since the second quarter. Looking ahead to 2024, we have 2.6 million definite group room nights on the books, a 15% increase since the second quarter. Total group revenue pace is up 13% at the same time last year, driven fairly evenly by room nights and rates. We are encouraged by the ongoing strength of group, as evidenced by increasing pace, lengthening booking windows and improving citywide calendars. Moving to portfolio reinvestment. We are excited to announce that we reached an agreement with Hyatt to complete transformational reinvestment capital projects at six properties in our portfolio. The properties include the Grand Hyatt, Atlanta; the Grand Hyatt, Washington D.C.; the Grand Hyatt, San Diego; the Hyatt Regency, Austin; the Hyatt Regency, Capitol Hill; and the Hyatt Regency, Reston. Building on the success of the Marriott transformational capital program, we believe these portfolio investments will position the targeted hotels to compete better in their respective markets, while enhancing long-term performance. Hyatt has agreed to provide us with priority returns on these investments. Additionally, Hyatt will provide $40 million in operating profit guarantees as protection for the anticipated disruption associated with the incremental investment. Our total investment is expected to be approximately $550 million to $600 million, two-thirds of which we were planning to invest as part of our capital plan over the next few years. We expect to invest between $125 million and $200 million per year over the next three to four years on this program. We are targeting stabilized annual cash-on-cash returns in the low double digits on our incremental investment through a combination of enhanced owners' priority returns and RevPAR index share gains. Turning to our capital expenditure guidance for 2023, we tightened the range to $615 million to $695 million, which includes approximately $200 million to $230 million of investment for redevelopment, repositioning and ROI projects and $150 million to $175 million for hurricane restoration work. Major capital expenditure projects included the December completion of a transformational renovation at the Fairmont Kea Lani, as well as the start of construction at the Finishing Canyon Suites Villas and the luxury condominium development at Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort. Lastly, we are well underway with the repositioning renovation of the Hilton Singer Island, which is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2024, and we are working with Hilton to top brand the hotel as a Curio Collection Resort. We are targeting a stabilized cash-on-cash return in the mid-teens on our repositioning investment. As we have said many times before, our exceptional balance sheet puts us in a position to execute on multiple fronts, which is what you saw us do during the third quarter. We continue to reinvest in our portfolio, and we believe our comprehensive renovations is while enhancing the EBITDA growth of our portfolio well into the future. We announced an exciting transformational capital program with Hyatt. We purchased approximately $100 million of stock and return capital to shareholders through a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. We continue to be optimistic about the state of travel and we believe Host is very well positioned to outperform in the current economic environment. With that, I will turn the call over to Sourav. Sourav Ghosh : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on our third quarter operations, our updated 2023 guidance, our balance sheet and our dividend. Starting with business mix, we estimate that Maui impacted overall transient revenue by 450 basis points, which skewed the comparison this quarter, resulting in transient revenue down 330 basis points to the third quarter of 2022. We were encouraged that transient rates at resorts remained 56% higher than 2019 despite the impact from Maui and the renovation at the one Hotel South Beach, which contributed to the decline over last year. As expected during the third quarter, we continued to see a normalization in transient rates at resorts compared to 2022. Business transient revenue was approximately 9% above the third quarter of 2022. Business transient rooms sold remain approximately 20% below 2019 levels, but it's worth noting that New York, San Francisco and Denver three of our largest business transient markets were within 10% of 2019 room nights in the third quarter. Looking at top business transient customers, large consulting and audit firms continue to drive the biggest share of business travel room nights but they're also the largest contributor to room night decline compared to 2019. Encouragingly, during the third quarter large technology companies showed room night growth compared to 2019. Turning to group. Group room revenues were 10% above the third quarter of 2022, driven by a rate increase of 8%. It is worth noting that these results were skewed higher by the recovery and relief groups at our Maui Resorts, which positively impacted group room revenue. In the quarter for the quarter, group room night bookings were up 49% compared to last year and 85% compared to 2019 with growth driven by New York, Phoenix and San Francisco as our convention hotels continue to focus on building a strong in-house group base. Maui also contributed to the strong in the quarter for the quarter bookings, but results would still have been up meaningfully excluding its contribution. We are encouraged by the continued recovery of international arrivals San Francisco, which stood at 87% of 2019 levels in the third quarter, up from 76% in the first quarter driven by increased airlift from Asia. With respect to group mix, corporate group room revenue was up 8% in the third quarter, driven by 7% rate growth. Association Group revenue was down 11% in the third quarter compared to last year led by a decline in room nights as the citywide recovery remains uneven. Social, Military, Educational, Religious and Fraternal or SMERF Group revenue was up 39% in the third quarter, driven by recovery and relief room nights on Maui, which are designated in the smart category. Excluding Maui, room night growth in this category would still have been up over 7% led by our hotels in New York and Washington D.C. Looking ahead, our 2024 total group revenue pace is 13% ahead of the same time last year and we continue to be encouraged by the citywide booking pace in markets such as Seattle, New Orleans and San Diego. All of which have citywide group room nights meaningfully ahead of the same time last year. Shifting gears to margin performance. Our third quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin came in at 26.6%, which is 10 basis points above the third quarter of 2019. Total comparable expenses grew 5.5% over 2019 while total comparable revenues were up 5.6%. As we have said many times before, we are encouraged that comparable hotel EBITDA margin remains above 2019 despite elevated expense inflation over the past four years and occupancy still 8-points below 2019. As Jim mentioned, despite the impact of the wildfires in Maui, we maintained the midpoint of our previous full year expected comparable hotel RevPAR growth at 8% and tightened our full year RevPAR growth guidance range to 7.25% to 8.75%. Our guidance range continues to contemplate varying degrees of moderating growth in the fourth quarter. We would expect year-over-year comparable hotel RevPAR percentage changes in the fourth quarter, to be down low single digits at the bottom end to up low single digits at the top end, with the range driven, primarily by the evolving nature of demand on Maui. We expect fourth quarter operational results to roughly follow 2019 quarterly seasonal trends, as provided on page 17 of our supplemental financial information which at the midpoint of our guidance implies slightly positive fourth quarter RevPAR growth. At the midpoint, we would expect full year adjusted EBITAre of $1.620 billion. Please note that our adjusted EBITDAre guidance includes $54 million of business interruption proceeds, which we received in the third quarter and an additional $26 million which we expect to collect in the fourth quarter, all of which is related to Hurricane Ian. Excluding the impacts of business interruption our revised full year comparable hotel EBITDA midpoint only declined $8 million versus the second quarter, despite a full year estimated impact of $25 million from Maui. It is important to remember that, although business interruption proceeds are one-time in nature we expect the Ritz-Carlton Naples and Hyatt Regency Coconut Point to contribute a full year of EBITDA in 2024. As a reminder, comparable hotel EBITDA and comparable hotel EBITDA margin are not affected by operational results or business interruption proceeds related to these two resorts as they are considered non-comparable at this time. Shifting to margins. As we have discussed over the past few quarters, year-over-year we expect comparable hotel EBITDA margins to be down 210 basis points at the low end of our guidance to down 170 basis points at the high end, due to stable staffing levels at our hotels, higher utility, and insurance expenses, and lower attrition and cancellation fees. For these reasons, we do not believe 2022 represents a stabilized comparison for margins. Relative to 2019, which we believe is a more representative year for margin comparison, we expect margins this year to be up 20 basis points at the low end of our guidance to up 60 points at the high end. This margin expansion is despite impacts from Maui, occupancy still meaningfully below 2019 levels, moderating attrition and cancellation revenues and expense inflation. Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity position. The $163 million loan to the buyer of the Sheraton Boston was repaid in full during the third quarter. Our weighted average maturity is 4.5 years, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. We have a balanced maturity schedule with our next maturity of $400 million coming due in April 2024. We ended the third quarter at 2.1 times leverage, and we have $2.6 billion of total available liquidity, which includes $218 million of FF&E reserves and full availability of our $1.5 billion credit facility. In addition, we repurchased 6.3 million shares at an average price of $15.90 per share bringing our total repurchases for the quarter to $100 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 9.5 million shares at an average price of $15.82, bringing our total repurchases for the year to $150 million. We have approximately $823 million of remaining capacity under our repurchase program, and we will continue to be opportunistic when executing share repurchases. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share, an increase of $0.03 or 20% over our second quarter dividend. Though, we expect to maintain our quarterly dividend at a sustainable level taking into consideration potential macroeconomic factors, all future dividends are subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors. We remain optimistic on the future of our business and travel overall. We believe our portfolio, our balance sheet, and our team are well positioned to continue outperforming. As we have shown Host can do it all and we will continue to be strategic in the current macroeconomic environment. With that, we would be happy to take your questions. To ensure we have time to address as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from Aryeh Klein with BMO. Your line is live. Aryeh Klein : Thanks, and good morning. Maybe just on the group bookings pace. It's up 30% for next year. Curious what you're seeing from the end of the quarter for the quarter bookings and do you think that bookings pace for next year ultimately narrows as maybe booking windows extend? And then if you could just touch on which markets looks strongest and weakest for next year from a group standpoint? Sourav Ghosh : Sure. So we saw meaningful in the quarter for the quarter bookings for the third quarter. That trend seems to be pretty consistent. We actually picked up 85% more relative to 2019 in Q3 in the quarter for the quarter. When we looked at the 245,000 group room nights that Jim spoke to that we picked up in Q3 for Q3 and Q4 about 46% of that was a pickup for Q3 and about 54% of that was about a pickup for Q4. Going into next year, as the booking window extends, we do expect that to moderate somewhat just because there wouldn't be any capacity left frankly at the hotels. So to put that into perspective in the fourth quarter booking window extended by about 10 days, which effectively was it was 80 days before and it's like 90 days now. And then all future arrivals that extended by 15 days. So we're definitely seeing that extend for -- in the year for the year as well as for future years. So you will see that moderation into next year. As it relates to markets that we expect will do well for next year we're certainly seeing strength to our portfolio as meaningful as San Diego Orlando and D.C. Overall citywide pace for 2024 is strong in Seattle, Boston, New Orleans and Miami as well. What's interesting is right now when you look at 2024 the city-wide room night pace is actually 90% of 2019 actuals which is up from 83% which we saw at the end of Q2. Aryeh Klein : Thanks. Appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Your line is live. Michael Bellisario : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just on the Hyatt Capital program for those six hotels maybe just on average, but when were they all last renovated? What's the current RevPAR penetration index and then do you expect to get the same 3- to 5-point lift that you had underwrote for the Marriott program? Thank you. Jim Risoleo : Yes, Mike. We'll be happy to gather that information specifically and share it with you. But suffice it to say that we and Hyatt both believe that these properties were in need of a transformational comprehensive renovation. We were going to undertake work at all six of these hotels. About two-thirds of the work that we agreed to with Hyatt in return for the enhanced owner priorities and the $40 million guarantee to support disruption. So we see returns in the low-teens as we saw with the Marriott transformational capital program and that will be driven by the enhanced owner priority as well as yield index gains. So I think that we have a very high degree of comfort given the performance of the assets in the Marriott program just to refresh your recollection that was 16 properties. They're not all stabilized yet due to where we are but due to certain properties and certain competitive sets like New York, in particular, having been closed for a longer time than our property. But the assets that we have seen have delivered truly outsized yield index gains. We had underwritten three to five points and we're meaningfully above that. So, we're excited to be able to partner with Hyatt as their largest owner. And really looking forward to getting on with this program which we will complete over the next three to four years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Your line is live. Bill Crow : Thanks. Good morning Jim and Sourav. Point of clarifications Sourav, is it fair to say you still have about $40 million in potential BI recoveries that could occur next year right $250 million through the third quarter plus some in the fourth? And then the GAAP to $310 million, is that the right way to think about it? Sourav Ghosh : Yes, we still plan to get to the $310 million. We're working with our insurers right now. There will be an allocation between BI and property. So far what the letter we have got from our insurers is that we will be -- they're okay with the $80 million of BI. That's why we have $26 million of BI in our forecast. We are still working with the insurers to collect on the balance Don't know what that number exactly is going to be. It won't be all of the remaining to get to the 310 but certainly more than the $80 million. So, we do expect some BI next year that amount. We are still working with our insurers as to what that is going to be. Bill Crow : All right. Thanks. And then my question really is I hear you on the comparison of the margins versus 2019 instead of 2022. In a few months we're going to be talking about 2024 versus 2023. And I'm thinking the question I've been asking is a number of the REITs is what sort of topline growth that we'll make our own decision about what that is. But how much do you need before you could get flat EBITDA margins next year? Is it a 4% number? Jim Risoleo : Bill that's the question. It's really difficult to answer given where we are with respect to the budgeting process. What I can share with you at this time is we would anticipate wage growth next year in the 4% to 5% range. Where insurance costs are going to come in they're certainly baked through next June because that the renewal is year-to-year and it renews June one of every year or July 1 of every year I guess through June 30th. So, question mark will be what happens in insurance renewal and there are a lot of variables that can impact that. And as we get granular on each hotel budget, we will look for opportunities to continue to enhance improvements in productivity and utilize technology as we have been doing. So, we will do everything possible to command and control expenses going forward. But I do think it's important that we kind of level set the stage as to what is our true base of EBITDA going into next year. And I would like to just share a couple of numbers with you because I don't want people to think that the $80 million of business interruption that we received this year as a one-time event. It's really not a onetime event from the perspective that the Ritz-Carlton Naples and the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point are going to be back online full time next year. Sourav Ghosh : Yes, just to expand on that Bill. I think the way to think about it first the level at the base. So, before we even get into the growth of EBITDA for next year. When you think about the midpoint of our guidance at 16.20 right now that already has a $30 million negative impact from Maui which was made up of $25 million from the hotels and then $5 million from the timeshare. So, let's assume for a second that we still have about a similar impact into next year as Maui recovers. And then you think about that $80 million of BI that proceeds for this year which Jim mentioned, is that effectively a majority of that we would have received as EBITDA from the Ritz-Carlton Naples, and the Hyatt Coconut Point, if it was not for Hurricane Ian. So, that is EBITDA we would be receiving for next year. So in other words, if you think about it, the base -- before any growth is starting off at $1.6 billion plus, if that makes sense. And then of course as Jim mentioned, in terms of expenses and everything else, we are working through and we have many initiatives that we are working on. So while there will be inflationary expense pressures, we fully anticipate to mitigate those pressures with productivity enhancements and various initiatives that we have going on at the hotels. And we will provide you with next year guidance as we typically do in February -- on the February call. Bill Crow : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is live. Q \u2013 Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks.. Good morning. I thought that was a good question by Bill, and response by you. So I'll just ask another Hawaii question. Maybe could you just play back the recovery, why things were a little bit better than you anticipated in the third quarter? And then maybe just since the delta on the fourth quarter guidance, is really about Hawaii. It sounds like what would get you to the high end? What would get you to the low end in terms of what needs to happen? Jim Risoleo : Sure, Duane. Let me start, by saying that the -- were it not for Maui. I think our guidance range for the full year would have been tighter than it is. But we have a wide range at this point in time because of some of the uncertainties surrounding how Hawaii is -- how Maui is going to recover. The west side of Maui -- kind of Maui just reopened to tourists on November 1 yesterday. So it's going to take some time to see the cadence of, how people are going to come back to the west side. And I do believe it will take some time as well, for people to get comfortable rebooking their stays down in the [indiscernible] where our other two resorts are. We did see a lot of cancellations in the fourth quarter, due to some pronouncements that were made by the governor and we fully support the reconstruction and relief efforts, because what happened on Maui is just a terrible horrible disaster. And we fully support the fact that you've got to take care of the people first, and that's what's happened. So the reason, that our performance in the third quarter was better than we initially anticipated, is as a result of recovery first responders taking rooms at our property as well as providing housing that was subsidized by FEMA for displaced residents. And that really caused a material pick up better than we anticipated. You did see a decline in TRevPAR in the quarter by an amount that was directly attributable to what happened on Maui. I think the out-of-room spend the TRevPAR spend was impacted by 120 basis points. So, we're optimistic for the long-term future in Maui. It's a great place and great place to be, and we will do what we can to support the recovery. Q \u2013 Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Maybe just to put a finer point on it. The delta in the fourth quarter the range is that a function of the duration of first responder in housing or the rate of just sort of organic leisure recovery? Sourav Ghosh : Yes, it's a little difficult to look at November and December. It really is the disaster recovery business and how that will taper off, as the west side of the island opens up which actually opened up as of yesterday November 1st. So, it's we're trying to gauge the properties are trying to gauge what that demand pickup looks like, and how they will replace sort of the regular business with the demand recovery business. So that was driving the delta. What I will say is, if it was not for that Maui impact we put out October numbers at 2.4%. Our fourth quarter numbers would have been slightly higher than the 2.4%, if it wasn't for the Maui impact. Jim Risoleo : Yes. And point of fact -- just to kind of wrap this up way our anticipated -- the anticipated impact on comparable hotel RevPAR and comparable hotel EBITDA from Maui is 50 basis points off the top line and $25 million for the full year at the bottom line. So in that sense had Maui not occurred, we would have been talking about a guidance raise on this call because we were able to keep the midpoint at 8%, we would have been talking about an 8.5% guide for this year. Q \u2013 Duane Pfennigwerth : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jay Kornreich with Wedbush. Your line is live. Jay Kornreich : Good morning. You made some comments on the urban and business transient demand profile accelerating in September getting back to 17% GAAP to 2019. So I'm wondering if you can just provide some more color on how much you think that GAAP can narrow in 2024? And maybe within that some of your peers have been diminishing their exposure to San Francisco. Maybe if you could provide some color on how you see your assets in that market trending over the next year or two? Jim Risoleo : Sure. I'll take the San Francisco piece of it Jay. And then Sourav, can talk a bit about business transient. San Francisco, we think for the long-term is a great place to be particularly, given the assets that we own which we believe are the best located in the market and excellent physical condition. San Francisco, Moscone Marriott has been for quite some time now building a solid base of in-house group business. It's in terrific condition. It was the first asset that we completed as part of the Marriott's transformational capital program completed in 2019. And the results are paying off relative to the competitive set it is outpacing I think everyone in the sect today. The Grand Hyatt on Union Square also in great physical condition and in a great location. So we are seeing a return of business travel in San Francisco in particular, in September. San Francisco it's one of our top business travel markets. We're down just about 10% in total room nights relative to where we were in 2019. So it's slow and steady. And I think 2024 will be a challenged year for San Francisco from a citywide perspective. But as we get beyond 2024, we're optimistic about how the market is going to evolve. Sourav Ghosh : Yes. And I'll add on the San Francisco piece, which is encouraging is our lead volume, as the San Francisco Marriott Marquis is actually up 5.5% to last year. And group room nights there was up almost 8.5% year-over-year as well. So \u2013 and in November is I believe when APAC that Asia Pacific economic conferences and that should be really good for San Fran as well. Obviously, 2024 as Jim mentioned, the city-wides are weak but that's why we are really making inserted effort to get quality in-house group at that hotel. As it relates to your question on BP [ph] it's been a very, very slow recovery from a room night perspective. Obviously, we had the strength of the special corporate rate this year almost double-digits. But the room night recoveries across the board for the portfolio is still down around 20% call it, that said, the major markets as we spoke about in our prepared remarks, San Francisco, New York, Denver is down only 10% to 19%, which is pretty impressive. In terms of 2024, we expect more of the same in terms of BP. We expect certain markets to recover \u2013 to continue to recover but just at a very slow pace. The reality is if BP will come back in a meaningful way when there is more macroeconomic certainty and there is two economic growth, we believe there's a pretty close relation with nonresidential fixed investment growth and RevPAR. And once that comes back in a meaningful way and GDP growth comes back in a meaningful way we expect that GAAP to reduce. Jay Kornreich : Very helpful. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is live. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask you \u2013 you mentioned 2.6 million group room nights on the books for next year. How does that compare to where you would sort of normally be in terms of group bookings for the full calendar year when you're in -- just late in the year? Sourav Ghosh : Yeah. When we compare that to 2019 we are about 10% down relative to 2019. Smedes Rose : Okay. So catching up. And then can you just mentioned the Sheraton Boston you mentioned the Sheraton financing that loan was repaid in full. Any update on the Sheraton Times Square loan? Jim Risoleo : Yeah. That loan was due to be paid off on October 18. We worked with the borrower and entered into a forbearance agreement and extension to November the next -- November 8, next Wednesday. As part of that agreement the interest rate was restated to 13% and there was an upfront paid that brought the effective rate all in to 15%. So they are in the final stages of completed the documentation necessary to have the loan paid off by next Wednesday. Smedes Rose : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Your line is live. Dori Kesten : Thanks. Good morning. Based on what you're seeing marketed for sale today and then the shadow pipeline of deals you hear about, would you expect to be a net buyer next year? Jim Risoleo : Dori, I sure hope so. I really do. I mean, clearly, our balance sheet is a differentiating factor for Host. As we've said, we have the ability to allocate capital across many fronts, as you saw us do in the third quarter and sitting here at 2.1x leverage and the ability to do deals all cash and get them done quickly is something that -- I don't think there's anyone else in this market can do today. What we're seeing today though is still a fairly significant bid-ask spread in the marketplace. There just isn't a lot of quality product in the pipeline. We are talking to a lot of people, a lot of hotel owners and we'll just have to wait and see how pricing trends as we get into 2024. But we clearly have the capability to not only continue to buy back stock, which we believe is very undervalued relative to our assets in the quality of our EBITDA and invest in our assets and pay a sustainable dividend, and also be acquisitive. So let's keep our fingers crossed that we have an opportunity next year to do that. Dori Kesten : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Meredith Jensen with HSBC. Your line is live. Meredith Jensen : Yeah. Thank you. I have two quick questions. First, looking at RevPAR or comparable to TRevPAR, if you could speak a little bit about what you're seeing on out-of-room spend and how we might think about that in the near and longer term? And then secondly, I recall a couple of minutes ago maybe at the Analyst Meeting, you spoke about some strategic moves you might make over time working with managers to identify some of the brand standards that might be modified, as you sort of collect some sample set to drill down on those. And given where cost pressures are I was curious if there's anything meaningful there we could think about? Thanks so much. Sourav Ghosh : Sure. On the food and beverage front, banqueting and catering contribution which is effectively banqueting catering NAV revenue on a per group room night basis, still remains pretty strong. I mean, last quarter we just had a lot of pent-up group demand from groups that are canceled during COVID. So it's very difficult to compare the Q3 results to Q3 results of this year when it comes to food and beverage. Just because the excess amount of group that we had. So even in our internal forecast, without the impact of Maui we were actually expecting food and beverage revenues to be down. That said, that really has moderated in terms of food and beverage revenue. We are still getting a meaningful amount of banqueting and contribution and outlet revenues for occupied room are significantly higher than they were back in 2019. The piece that is certainly going to moderate as we get into next year is attrition and cancellation revenue. That has -- you saw had an impact in the third quarter. Third quarter with ANC revenue being down literally about half of what it was last year. So that -- put into perspective in 2022 we received close to $100 million of attrition cancellation revenue. We think that's going to moderate somewhere around the $50 million to $55 million range. That's just one thing to keep look out on, and sorry Meredith your second question was? Meredith Jensen : Just sort of -- it was a strategic question on working with managers on brand standards. Is there any modifications that could be made over time on looking post-COVID? Sourav Ghosh : We are constantly working with our managers to evaluate brand standards that are relevant. And frankly I would say Marriott and Hyatt both made meaningful changes into the brand -- for the brand standards post pandemic really figuring out, which ones we should modify, which ones to eliminate, the ones which truly drive value to the guests. It's always a continuing conversation and we believe as technologies evolve and we can leverage technologies, which not only help from a productivity standpoint, but also enhance customer experience, we will keep on doing proof of concepts and piloting those technologies to drive incremental value to the bottom line. Meredith Jensen : That\u2019s all. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tyler Batory with Oppenheimer. Your line is live. Tyler Batory : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Few questions on the leisure and the resort commentary. Are you seeing any divergence within your portfolio between some of the higher rated resort properties and those that are a little bit lower or at the different price points? And then when you look at the holidays, talk about your book position I know it's still a little early there. But curious what you're seeing in terms of demand Thanksgiving and Christmas. And then the third part of this question you talked about transient resort rates still 56% above 2019. What guidepost or what expectations do you have for those rates in Q4 and going forward? Certainly commentary and expectation is that number should slow. But just trying to get a sense of best guess perhaps how much -- where growth could end up going in the next couple of quarters here? Jim Risoleo : Sure. Let me start with the last question that you asked with respect to leisure transient rates. We're very happy that in the third quarter, our leisure transient rates were 56% above where they were in the third quarter of 2019. For reference that's down about five percentage points from where we were in the second quarter. Second quarter we were 61% ahead. And the fact that the 56% number takes into account the three comparable resorts on Maui to the negative and it excludes our Ritz-Carlton Naples and our Hyatt Regency Coconut Point does give us a substantial level of comfort that our properties are going to continue to be able to charge a rate that customers are willing to pay just given the nature of the assets that we own. So we're not really seeing a divergence across the 16 resorts we have. They're all very high quality properties. And we're optimistic that as we get into the fourth quarter and as we get into next year, we'll continue to be able to drive strong performance at all of these assets. I think the Ritz, Naples what we're seeing with respect to booking pace across every room category at that property is very, very impressive and we're very optimistic that we're going to be able to outperform our underwriting expectations on the expansion of the Vanderbilt Tower. I think we underwrote a 12% cash-on-cash return on that investment and we're going to do much better going forward. So, we are not seeing any signs of weakness as we move into the holiday season. I would just caveat that by saying but for the unknown surrounding what's going to happen in Maui this year. Sourav Ghosh : And on the question of holidays and how things are pacing. You have to keep in mind Q4 holidays somewhat present a tough comp to last year because the last year was the first time the country was really open for broader travel during the holiday season. But that said, specifically for like a Christmas time right now and this is much more direction of what we have revenue on the books left Maui is effectively flat, which we think is very encouraging. And for Thanksgiving, it's slightly off but you have to remember it's that timing was a tough timing when you compare to last year. So, we were off less how Maui down about 6%, 7% in pace. But Christmas is effectively flat right now pacing flat in terms of revenue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Your line is live. Anthony Powell : Hi. Good morning. A question on one of your newer markets to Austin, Texas, RevPAR has been down over the past few quarters. Is that all technology business travel being down and just more broadly, I think there's a Convention Center renovation there starting next year. Would it be disruptive? And how has your experience been in that market relative to kind of the more traditional coastal business urban markets? Jim Risoleo : Anthony, I think that Austin, we have two properties in Austin. We have the hotel Van Zandt and we have the Hyatt Regency, Austin. Just to remind you the Hyatt Regency was the first asset that we purchased during the pandemic. I think it was the first hotel that was done during the pandemic. And that asset is doing actually quite well. Van Zandt is -- and it's growing quite well given the fact that we're able to take in-house group given the lease base platform there as well as its location across the lake. Van Zandt is more of a leisure-driven property. And I don't know if you've been to Austin recently but there is an incredible amount of construction around Van Zandt in that particular submarket the Rainy Street district and that has really impacted business at that property. So for the long-term, I think it's going to be great. Going forward, because it's a myriad of new development is occurring there residential as well as office. But in the short-term it's going to be challenging until we get the cranes out of there and the Street's open up to business again. So -- and tech has had a bit of an impact as well in the near term on that asset. So you're absolutely right. With respect to plans for the Convention Center, Host as well as other hotel owners who have a presence in Austin have been meeting with the appropriate officials in Austin to talk about whether or not they're going to go forward with a closure of the Convention Center or a staged renovation and expansion and also talking about ways that we can mitigate any impact that actions taken with the Convention Center can will have on business in the Austin market. So we're being proactive and doing everything that we can to mitigate any potential issues surrounding the Convention Center going forward. Anthony Powell : Okay. Thank you for that. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today will be coming from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. Chris Woronka : Hey. Good morning, guys. Jim Risoleo : Good morning, Chris. Chris Woronka : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Talking about acquisitions Jim, I know you mentioned that there's a big pipeline out there. We think there's going to be stuff that might come available next year that's related to debt refinancing. As you guys look at the potential pipeline, a lot of deals -- a lot of the acquisitions you've done last couple of years have been one-off assets, bigger EBITDA assets. What's your willingness to do either a portfolio type of deal or something where there's a lot of CapEx involved upfront? Are you willing to do different kind of deals and kind of what you've done in the last few years? Jim Risoleo : Chris, the short answer is, it really is transaction dependent. And if we see a portfolio that we believe is accretive to shareholder value. And if assets needed to be repositioned and they have CapEx needs and we can see our way clear to performance in the near term, we would do that. I mean, I think a great example of an asset that has performed extremely well for us, that needed to be repositioned is the Phoenician. And we bought that asset in 2015 and completely reimagined the property and invested, I think $120 million to reposition it including new amenities, a new spa, a new fitness center, a new lobby bar and complete renovation of all the guest rooms and the asset is doing exceptionally well. So, if I could find another Phoenician that is something that we would certainly be interested and excited about doing. With respect to portfolio deals, we look at everything that's out there and we look at it with an open mind. And if there is a transaction that we believe is accretive, we would certainly take it down. Chris Woronka : Okay. Thanks, Jim. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. So I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Risoleo for his closing remarks. Jim Risoleo : Well, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on our third quarter call today. We appreciate the opportunity as always to discuss our quarterly results with you and we look forward to seeing many of you in person at NAREIT and other conferences in the coming weeks. Have a great day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Jaime Marcus, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Jaime Marcus : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, please note that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel level results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in yesterday's earnings press release and our 8-K filed with the SEC and in the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. With me on today's call are Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Risoleo : Thank you, Jaime, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. 2023 was a terrific year for Host on several fronts. First, we delivered strong operational improvements, driven largely by occupancy increases and continued rate growth. Second, we completed the work on the three strategic objectives we established in 2021 and we will continue to realize the benefits of our ongoing efforts well into the future. Third, we returned significant capital to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, continue to successfully allocate capital through reinvestment in our portfolio and announced an agreement with Hyatt to complete transformational renovations at six properties in our portfolio. Lastly, we maintained an investment grade balance sheet and continue to position Host to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities we see in the lodging space including potential acquisition opportunities. Turning to our results. We finished 2023 above the midpoint of our full year guidance range. We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $1.629 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.92. Comparable hotel total RevPAR grew 8.3% and comparable hotel RevPAR grew 8.1% compared to 2022. Notably, comparable hotel EBITDA margin was 60 basis points ahead of 2019 due in large part to our efforts to redefine the hotel operating model with our managers. During the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $378 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.44, which includes $26 million of business interruption proceeds from Hurricane Ian. Comparable hotel RevPAR improved 1.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Our RevPAR performance for the quarter was driven by an increase in both occupancy and rate. Despite an estimated 30 basis point impact from the wildfires in Maui, our fourth quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 28.1% was flat to 2019. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter since the onset of the pandemic that we have achieved total RevPAR, RevPAR comparable hotel EBITDA and margins at or above 2019 levels. I will say that one more time. We have delivered operating metrics at or above 2019 levels for nearly two years. As a reminder, the operational results discussed today refer to our comparable hotel portfolio in 2023, which excludes Hyatt Coconut Point and Ritz-Carlton, Naples. In 2024, our comparable hotel portfolio only excludes Ritz-Carlton Naples. During the fourth quarter, our portfolio results were once again impacted by the evolving nature of demand at our three resorts on Maui. We estimate that the Maui wildfires impacted fourth quarter comparable hotel RevPAR by 130 basis points, comparable hotel total RevPAR by 150 basis points, comparable hotel EBITDA by $9 million and comparable hotel EBITDA margin by 30 basis points. For the full year, we estimate that Maui impacted our comparable hotel RevPAR by 50 basis points, comparable hotel total RevPAR by 70 basis points, comparable hotel EBITDA by $13 million and comparable hotel EBITDA margin by 10 basis points. Including our joint venture timeshare, we estimate that Maui impacted adjusted EBITDAre by $15 million in the fourth quarter and $22 million for the full year. Our risk management team is continuing to engage with our insurers about potential business interruption coverage at Maui and the timing and amounts of any potential proceeds are not yet known. Shifting to another market that remains top of mind. San Francisco results showed meaningful year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter. RevPAR was up 10%, driven by both rate and occupancy and F&B revenue was up 15%. Group business is driving the strong results with group room revenue up 36% for the fourth quarter compared to last year as our properties have shifted their focus to in-house groups until the citywide calendar improves in 2025. We have seen positive trends from 2023 continuing in the first quarter of 2024 with conventions driving weekday demand. In fact, January was the best month in the history of the San Francisco Marriott Marquis, with total revenue and EBITDA setting all time records. Briefly looking at out-of-room spend in the fourth quarter, comparable hotel, food and beverage and other revenues were down slightly due to impacts from Maui. We estimate that Maui impacted fourth quarter F&B and other revenues by 60 basis points and 540 basis points, respectively. Encouragingly, the out-of-room revenue trends we have seen post-pandemic remain elevated for the rest of our portfolio. In addition to driving strong RevPAR growth and operating improvements across the business, we continue to be recognized as a global leader in corporate responsibility over the course of 2023. We introduced new 2030 environmental and social targets, which are aligned with our vision of becoming a net positive company by 2050, incorporate the progress made toward our prior goals, and are more reflective of our current portfolio by updating our baseline to 2019. These environmental and social targets will enable our team to focus on and measure our progress over the long-term. Our 2030 environmental targets are in their third generation and put hosts on a linear path to net zero operations by 2040, leaving 10 years to get to net positive by 2050. We now have 14 properties with lead certification and projects in the pipeline at 19 properties. In addition, we are the only lodging REIT to have green building certifications linked to our sustainable financings. In this year\u2019s corporate responsibility report, we highlighted our asset level climate risk assessment across three near-term climate perils including flood, wind and wildfire, and three long-term perils including heat, cold and water stress. Based on the results, we have identified assets with elevated climate risk and their corresponding EBITDA contributions, which allows us to prioritize capital investments in resilience and better underwrite potential acquisitions. Our 2030 social targets are in their second generation and now include two responsible supply chain targets around supplier diversity and responsible sourcing and one new community impact target. As an employer of choice, we aim to lead our industry by integrating diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging best practices into all aspects of our culture. Turning to capital allocation, we repurchased 1.9 million shares at an average price of $16.50 per share in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we repurchased 11.4 million shares at an average price of $15.93 per share for a total of $181 million. We have approximately $792 million of remaining capacity under the repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, an 11% increase over the prior quarter. We also announced a special dividend of $0.25 per share bringing the total dividends declared for the year to $0.90 per share. In total, we returned over $700 million of capital to shareholders in 2023. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, the buyer of the Sheraton New York repaid the $250 million seller financing loan, we provided to effectuate the disposition. Our size, scale and balance sheet have allowed us to provide seller financing on three recent dispositions at a time when debt capital was scarce. Further demonstrating that our fortress balance sheet and unparalleled access to capital creates unique opportunities and substantial value for shareholders. Turning back to fourth quarter operations, our overall business mix results were skewed by Maui as leisure transient demand decreased and group demand increased, driven by recovery and relief groups. Outside of this temporary demand shift, business mix results were as expected. Group led to growth with nearly 1 million group room nights sold in the fourth quarter, bringing our total group nights sold for 2023 to 4.1 million, or 112% of comparable 2022 actual group room nights. Business transient continued its gradual improvement with 7% revenue growth for the quarter and leisure remaining strong with transient rates at our resorts up 58% to 2019, including our three Maui resorts. As we look at the current backdrop for our business, we are optimistic about 2024 for several reasons. First, macroeconomic sentiment is incrementally more positive with consensus expectations of a soft landing. Second, supply levels and anticipated growth in supply is at historically low levels in our markets and chain scales. Third, we expect tailwinds from increased airline capacity, continued improvement in the international inbound demand imbalance, and lastly, the transactions market is expected to pick up as improved macroeconomic sentiment allows for more visibility on operating performance and the market is expecting that we will see rate cuts later this year. As we consider these factors, we believe host is best positioned to capitalize on acquisition opportunities with $2.9 billion of total available liquidity and net leverage of 1.9 times. In addition, we have completed 24 transformational renovations and four development ROI projects, which we believe provide meaningful tailwinds for our portfolio. Looking at results to date, of the 10 hotels that have stabilized post renovation operations, the average RevPAR index share gain is 8.2 points, which is well in excess of our targeted gain of 3 to 5 points. We are also continuing to reinvest in our portfolio with additional comprehensive renovations and resiliency investments underway, and we do not expect meaningful disruption this year. And most importantly, we believe that diverse demand drivers in our portfolio leave us well positioned for top line growth. Sourav will discuss more operational detail in our 2024 outlook in a few minutes. Turning to portfolio reinvestment in 2023, we invested nearly $650 million in capital expenditures at our properties, completing renovations to approximately 3,500 guest rooms, 111,000 square feet of meeting space and approximately 110,000 square feetof public space. In addition, we substantially completed property restorations following Hurricane Ian. In 2024, our capital expenditure guidance range is $500 million to $605 million, which reflects approximately $225 million to $280 million of investment for redevelopment, repositioning and ROI projects. Within the Hyatt Transformational Capital program, we have already started renovations at the Grand Hyatt Atlanta and the Grand Hyatt Washington, which we expect to complete in the first half of 2025. We will also start transformational renovations at the Hyatt Regency Reston in the fourth quarter of this year. Other major ROI projects include the completion of renovations at the Hilton Singer Island Resort and the construction of the Finishing Canyon Suites Villa expansion. In addition to our capital expenditure investment, we expect to spend $50 million to $70 million on the luxury condominium development at Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort this year. We expect to benefit from approximately $9 million of operating profit guarantees related to the Hyatt Transformational Capital program, which will offset the expected revenue disruption at those properties for 2024. We are extremely proud of our operational and financial performance in 2023 and the iconic portfolio and balance sheet we have built and maintained. Our people, our platform and our portfolio have allowed us to create meaningful shareholder value and we are confident in the significant opportunities ahead for continued growth and value creation in 2024. With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav. Sourav Ghosh : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on our fourth quarter operations full year 2024 guidance and our balance sheet. Starting with business mix, overall transient revenue was down 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by the evolving nature of demand in Maui. We estimate that Maui had a 590 basis point impact to transient revenue, which was evenly split between demand and rate. We were encouraged that transient rate at our resorts grew 2% above last year's tough comparisons despite the demand impact from Maui and renovation disruption. Looking ahead to spring break, transient revenue pace is up for our portfolio compared to the same time last year, driven by occupancy and rate growth at our resorts. Outside of Maui, resort transient revenue pace for spring breakis up 20%. Business transient revenue was up over 7% to the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by both rate and demand growth at our downtown properties. Business transient demand continued its slow and steady recovery. Room nights at our downtown properties were down 15% in the fourth quarter compared to 2019, which is the smallest gap to the 2019post-pandemic. For the full year, business transient demand grew 12% over 2022. In 2024, we expect further demand growth driven by large corporates alongside rate growth in the mid-single-digits. Turning to group. 2023 was the year of group and convention hotel recovery. For the full year, group room revenues increased 21% over last year and room night volume recovered to 95% of 2019 levels. It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui. Excluding Maui, group room night volume recovered to 94% of 2019 levels. Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter, driven by an increase in both rate and room nights, and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui. Outside of Maui, hotels in San Francisco, Boston, DC and Seattle contributed to the group room night increase. Notably, November's APAC Conference in San Francisco drove results with an estimated 41,000 citywide group room nights. Looking ahead to 2024, we have 3.1 million definite group room nights on the books, representing a 16% increase since the third quarter, putting us ahead of where we were this time last year. Total group revenue pace is up 10% over the same time last year, driven by rate room nights and banquets. We continue to be encouraged by the ongoing strength of group business as evidenced by strong pace, lengthening booking windows and double digit citywide room night pace in key markets such as New Orleans, San Diego, Seattle and D.C. Shifting gears to margins. As expected, margin declines year-over-year were driven by increases in wages and benefits, fixed expenses as well as moderating attrition and cancellation revenues and impacts from Maui. Despite these headwinds, full year 2023 comparable hotel EBITDA margin was 30.1%, representing a 60 basis point increase over 2019. Our ability to achieve this margin expansion is a result of our efforts to redefine the operating model and is indicative of our strong execution, particularly when considering that total comparable hotel expenses have only grown 7% in the last four years and occupancy is still 8 points below 2019. Turning to our outlook for 2024. The midpoint of our guidance contemplates a stable operating environment with continued improvement in group business, a continued gradual recovery in business transient, steady leisure transient demand and a continued evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. At the low end, we have assumed slower group pickup and softer leisure transient, and at the high end, we have assumed a faster recovery at our Maui Resort and increased group pickup. For full year 2024, we anticipate comparable hotel RevPAR growth of between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. We expect comparable hotel EBITDA margins to be down 120 basis points year-over-year at the low end of our guidance to down 40 basis points at the high end. Notably, we expect margins to be down only 20 basis points at the midpoint versus 2019 despite a 50 basis point margin impact from Maui. In terms of RevPAR growth cadence for the year, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR growth to be in the low single digits in the first half of the year due to tough comparisons to 2023, which saw a surge in recovery of downtown markets driven by improving group business and elevated leisure demand. We expect mid-single digit comparable hotel RevPAR growth in the second half of the year as a result of strong group booking pace, less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and the diminishing impact of the Maui wildfires. For January, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR to be approximately $187, a 1.4% improvement over 2023. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we anticipate comparable hotel RevPAR growth of 4% compared to 2023 and a comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 29.3%, which is 80 basis points below 2023. As we think about bridging our 2023 results to 2024, we estimate that Maui is impacting comparable hotel RevPAR by 100 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margin by 50 basis points. We also expect a 15 basis point impact to margins from moderating attrition and cancellation revenues and a 45 basis point impact from property taxes and insurance. In 2024, we expect wage rates to increase approximately 5%. For context, in 2023, wages and benefits comprised approximately 50% of our total comparable hotel expenses and attrition and cancellation revenues were $75 million, which is approximately 50% higher than 2019. Our 2024 full year adjusted EBITDAre midpoint is $1,635 million, this includes an expected additional $10 million from business interruption proceeds related to Hurricane Ian and an estimated $60 million contribution from operations at the Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which is excluded from our comparable hotel set in 2024. It is important to note that we have not included any assumption for business interruption proceeds from the Maui wildfires in our 2024 guidance. Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity position, our weighted average maturity is 4.2 years at a weighted average interest rate of 4.5%. We have a balanced maturity schedule with our next maturity of $400 million coming due in April 2024. We are closely monitoring the debt capital markets and we believe our balance sheet provides us with optionality and flexibility. As Jim noted, we have $2.9 billion in total available liquidity, which includes $217 million of FF&E reserves and full availability of our $1.5 billion credit facility. We ended 2023 at 1.9x net leverage, and since our last call, Fitch upgraded the company\u2019s issuer rating from BBB- to BBB with a stable outlook, returning Host to its pre-pandemic rating level. Wrapping up. In January we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share and a special dividend of $0.25, returning to our pre-pandemic quarterly payout level. The Board of Directors authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 on our common stock to be paid on April 15, 2024 to stockholders of record on March 28, 2024. As always, future dividends are subject to approval by the company\u2019s Board of Directors. To conclude, we are proud of our achievements in 2023 and we believe our best-in-class portfolio and balance sheet leave us uniquely positioned to capitalize on opportunities for growth in the future. With that, we would be happy to take your questions. To ensure we have time to address as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Sean Kelly from Bank of America. Your line is live. Sean Kelly : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Jim or Sourav, maybe we could just start off with a little color on the M&A environment. You alluded to it in your prepared remarks a little bit and obviously we know the strength of the balance, but coming out of the ALIS conference, how are conversations going? And maybe you could just lead us a little bit on how you can really tap in using your balance sheet strength to unlock some opportunities that others may not have in front of them at this point in the market. Jim Risoleo : Sure, Sean. This is Jim. I\u2019m happy to take that question. I think our fortress balance sheet really differentiates Host in the space. Sitting here today at 1.9x leverage with $2.9 billion of liquidity is a testament to the fact that we can do it all as we have shown, and that\u2019s how we intend to approach 2024. We want to be net acquirers. We want to continue to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the portfolio in 2024 through acquisitions, but also through continued reinvestment in the portfolio as we\u2019ve done over the past few years. You may recall that we acquired $1.6 billion of assets at the beginning of the recovery in 2021, and another $315 million in 2022. And over that time frame, we\u2019ve invested \u2013 from 2020 through 2023 we\u2019ve invested over $2.1 billion in our assets. So our 16 properties under the MTCP, as we noted in our prepared remarks, are significantly outperforming our underwriting expectations of 3 to 5 points in yield index. The properties that have stabilized post operations are up to 8 points or up to 10 points, I\u2019m sorry, 8 to 10 points. And we continue to do the same with the HTCP program in 2024 as a start. Now, with respect to the acquisition market, frankly, there just aren\u2019t a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale, certainly not assets that would interest Host. But that\u2019s really not slowing us down at all. We are talking to our competitors in the industry, our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host type assets. We are leaning on our relationships, we\u2019re leaning on our reputation, on our ability to close deals all cash that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to get the balance sheet to work. So we\u2019re working very hard to find the right sorts of assets to add to the portfolio. The assets that we like are those that have diverse demand drivers with a combination of group business, transient and leisure, and we want to continue the same. But at the end of the day, it really is everything that we do is to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the portfolio. Now, I said that there aren\u2019t a lot of assets on the market today, but I believe and we believe as a team here at Host, that under the assumption that the Fed is going to start loosening interest rates in the second half of this year, that that will spark sellers to bring properties to market and it\u2019s going to also spark competition for those assets. So our point of view is we have the balance sheet, we can do it all, we want to get out there, we want to get ahead of the pack and I hope over the course of the next several months that we\u2019re going to be able to tell you that we\u2019ve been an acquirer early in 2024. Sean Kelly : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Smedes Rose from Citi. Your line is live. Smedes Rose : Hi. Thank you. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about on the group booking side. It sounds like part of your improvements you\u2019re seeing are driven by kind of large citywide conventions and the return of maybe sort of association business. But could you talk about maybe just what you\u2019re seeing, just more on the corporate side, larger meetings, smaller meetings, more frequent meetings, just any kind of detail around that would be interesting. Sourav Ghosh : Sure, Smedes. We\u2019re doing really well on the corporate group business and that remains strong. So while association is certainly coming back in quite a few markets, particularly with citywide coming back for 2024 in a meaningful way, the 2024 citywide room night pace is around 90% of 2019 actuals, and quite a few cities are pacing ahead. But corporate group continues to be strong and what\u2019s also important to note is their spend on banquet and catering continues to be strong. So the catering contribution at our hotels has not declined year-over-year and we are keeping pace both from a demand perspective as well as from a rate perspective. Right now, our group pace from an ADR standpoint is around 4% and we are pacing ahead to last year by 3.4% in terms of room nights, and on a total revenue basis, it\u2019s 10% that we are pacing ahead year-over-year. So, pretty meaningful. The markets which are driving this for our portfolio, specifically the $3.1 million group room nights that we have on the books for 2024, they include San Diego, Orlando, D.C., San Francisco and San Antonio. Those markets make up just over 50% of the $3.1 million that\u2019s already on the books. In terms of citywide pace, what\u2019s pacing well is also San Diego, D.C., but also Seattle, New Orleans and Miami. Smedes Rose : Thank you. Appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Your line is live. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks. Just circling back to your comments on potential acquisitions. I guess, I\u2019m surprised, just given the maturities, CMBS maturities, some of which were pushed back in 2023 into 2024, that maybe there\u2019s not more kind of for sale in the first half of 2024. So I guess what is your sense of kind of what\u2019s happening with those maturities? And then also just curious what your current thoughts are on the type of assets, location, if there\u2019s been any change in terms of what Host would be looking for? Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Sure, Robin. We track all the CMBS maturities, the CMBS loans outstanding and the maturities. This year there\u2019s about $26 billion of full service loans that will be maturing. And I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress. Frankly, we haven\u2019t seen it materialize, certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. We\u2019ll continue to track it. There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio. And as you know, as I mentioned earlier in my response, we have invested significant capital in our portfolio. So we\u2019re in a really great place to continue to gain yield index and continue to outperform going forward. So I think it\u2019s still TBD on distressed but we're certainly not counting on that. We're making it happen on our own by trying to capitalize on our relationships, our reputation and our balance sheet to be net acquirers this year. The types of assets and the types of markets, it's really \u2013 there is nothing that's perspective per se, that's off the list. But we are always going to be thoughtful about maintaining geographic diversification, which has served us well. I think notwithstanding the tragedy in Maui, the geographic diversification of our portfolio still allowed us to achieve 8.1% RevPAR growth in 2023, notwithstanding a 50 basis point impact from the Maui wildfires. So we'll continue to look at assets where we can add value through our strong asset management and enterprise analytics capabilities, assets where we see ROI opportunities that haven't been completed by the current owner and new markets, we'll continue to look for resorts. We'll also continue to start looking at urban markets today because we've seen some good solid performance out of the urban market. So I think recovery is on the way. We feel good about the macro picture. There is visibility from an underwriting perspective. And let's all keep our fingers crossed at the soft landing that seems to be the consensus to say does come through. Robin Farley : Great, very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Bill Crow from Raymond James. Your line is live. Bill Crow : Thanks. Good morning. Maybe for Sourav, a question about the kind of the tail of two halfs of the year and RevPAR growth in the low single-digits in the first half and then accelerating up to I guess, what, 5%, 6%, 7% in the second half of the year to hit your numbers. Can you kind of compartmentalize how much tailwind you get from Maui? How much you get from renovation disruption? Perhaps Coconut Point is providing a lift given the challenges in that market last year. What can you tell us to give us kind of confidence in that outsized growth in the second half of the year? Sourav Ghosh : Sure. So the first piece, I'll talk about the first half, the reason that is low single-digits is because of the tough comps that we have, particularly given the Q1 performance in 2023. And remember, 2022 Q1 was impacted by Omicron. So we had a meaningful amount of growth in the first quarter of 2023. And the first half, leisure did extremely well, as you might recall. So just tougher comps in the first half, that's why the low single-digits. On the second half, what's really giving us confidence are two things : One, specifically is the group booking pace for the second half, both particularly for Q3 as well as Q4, when you look at overall second half, our pace is really strong. We have confidence in that pace number and the second piece is really the tailwind from four hotels that had a meaningful impact last year from renovation in the second half, second half of 2023. Those four hotels really being the one hotel South Beach, Fairmont Kea Lani, the Biscayne Bay Marriott and the Hilton Singer Island, which is a complete redevelopment project. So that's really what's going to help drive that tailwind into the second half at group booking pace and the tailwind from those four renovation properties. There are other factors as well, but those are probably the two largest most impactful factors driving the mid single-digits in the second half. Bill Crow : Great, thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Michael Bellisario from Baird. Your line is live. Michael Bellisario : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. You want to stick to your outlook. Do you have an industry RevPAR forecast that you're thinking about? And then specific to your outlook, what are you assuming for the mix of rate and occupancy in 2024? And how does that affect your expense outlook and how you're thinking about cost per occupied room? Thanks. Sourav Ghosh : Sure. So the way we think of the industry forecast is \u2013 and if you look at SCR, it's effectively at around 4%. But remember, our midpoint number is getting impacted 100 basis points as a result of the impact from Maui. So in other words, that would be 100 basis points more if it wasn't for Maui. That also, keep in mind, the weighting of our portfolio is different when you look at sort of the different markets that we have waiting in. So it's not on two apples-to-apples comparison when you are looking at our comparable RevPAR growth versus what the third parties put out there. So that's one thing to keep in mind as well. So overall, please, particularly given the capital investments that we have made, which Jim talked about and the lift that we are getting from the MTCP projects as well as the eight other projects that we invested in and the RevPAR index gain translating into EBITDA growth as well. In terms of total expense growth for this year at the midpoint, we are effectively at 5.8% total expense growth on that midpoint of 4% for the total portfolio. And sorry, the other question you asked was just split between occ and rates on that 2% and that's pretty evenly split between the two. Michael Bellisario : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks. So on the group pace, I think you said up 13%. How are you thinking about closing group bookings in the quarter for the quarter over the balance of the year? Assume closing group would moderate as the booking curve continues to normalize. And then relatedly, are you leaning on group any differently than you did pre-pandemic given changes in underlying seasonality? So for example, given changes in business trends, is there more of an effort to lean on group to fill in off-peak periods? Sourav Ghosh : I'll start with the second part of your question. First, it's really an asset-by-asset revenue management decision in terms of what is available and where we can maximize yield. And we're looking always at the total revenue piece of it. It's not just the room night piece because obviously, the banquet and catering that groups provide makes a meaningful difference. So I wouldn't necessarily say there is a different way that we are \u2013 or the managers are approaching revenue management. Obviously, the goal is to fill the hotels with the highest not only rated business, but the highest business that's going to provide you the highest total revenue and ultimately, total EBITDA for the hotel. When you think about sort of the cadence of group for the balance of the year, we already have 3.1 million group room nights on the books. We expect for the year based on the midpoint to be above in terms of total group room nights for the year relative to 2023. And we do not just given how well we've been pacing, obviously, in the year for the year, pickup is going to be lower. And in the month for the month and in the quarter for the quarter is going to be lower than what we have seen previously just because the lead times have expanded not only for just in the year for the year but also into future years. But we feel very confident with the ongoing sort of the short-term pickup to make that gap up, particularly given sort of the need dates that have been filled for the year, both in the first half as well as the second half. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay, appreciate the thoughts. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chris Woronka from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. Chris Woronka : Hey, good morning, guys. Appreciate all the details so far. Just had a question as to how you're thinking about cadence of transient through the year, especially as we get into summer Q3. Remember last year we had a little, I guess, surprise where more international outbound and we didn't get the corresponding numbers inbound. How are you kind of internally modeling summer transient this year? Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Sure. So the way we're thinking of transient, I mean, we obviously expect it to be moderating for the summer. We just had an extremely strong summer last year. And to your point, I mean, U.S. outbound for the year was 117% above 2019 level and inbound was effectively at 90% of 2019. For what it's worth, right now, the U.S. travel is projecting that inbound number is going to be more at 98% for 2024 relative to 2019, which is a good stat. We do expect an impact on a year-over-year basis, therefore the low-single digits guidance for the first half of the year. But what I will say is our fourth quarter ended with our transient ADR for our resorts still up 58% to 2019. And what we are seeing in terms of spring break, and I think that's like most visibility we have because you won't really get into summer visibility until you get to the end of Q1. Spring break is pacing up 20% in revenues and rate is pacing above 7%, and that's specifically for our resort, excluding Maui. So we feel very good, which effectively is saying that none of these particularly the transient resort ADR is still going to be above 50% of 2019 level. So that's really encouraging. Not enough visibility into the summer yet, but spring break is very encouraging. Chris Woronka : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Stephen Grambling : Obviously, we can kind of look at the total dollar amounts, but there's been some changes in construction costs and otherwise. I'm just curious how you're thinking about the ROI on those projects. And if you can give any other color comparing and contrasting the two. Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Hey, Stephen, it's Jim. The first part of your question, we didn't hear, it cut out. So would you mind repeating it? Stephen Grambling : Just asking to compare and contrast the Hyatt Transformation versus the Marriott transformation programs. Jim Risoleo : From what perspective? Stephen Grambling : how you're thinking about the return on investment, how these which \u2013 how the hotels might compare and contrast. There's a reason why we should be assuming that these should be kind of the same uplift. Or could there be a difference when we think about looking at the two? Jim Risoleo : No, I think as you're looking at the HTCP program, it's modeled after the Marriott program. We have received enhanced owner priorities on all of our dollars that we're investing, which is meaningful because in many of the hotels we didn't have owners\u2019 priority for one reason or another, either it burned off over time or it just didn't exist. So that's a big plus. Hyatt is also providing $40 million in operating profit guarantees to cover off anticipated disruption. And as we noted in our comments, we expect to collect $9 million in operating profit guarantees this year that will cover the anticipated disruption associated with the Hyatt renovations. And I think the cadence is, the assumptions are the same. The assumptions are the same. Let's hope the results are the same, because the results out of the MTCP blew away our assumptions. But we're looking at low-teens cash on cash returns, say low-double digit to low-teens cash on cash returns, which is the same way we underwrote the MTCP program. And frankly, the other eight assets that have received transformational renovations. Stephen Grambling : And just one follow-up on that, was that primarily through RevPAR index premium or was there also a component, any way to break that down with F&B uplift or other revenue uplifts? Jim Risoleo : It's both. And I think we can talk, let\u2019s \u2013\u2013 I'm going to let Sourav talk a little bit about the F&B uplift because we have seen a meaningful uplift in F&B revenues throughout the portfolio. I think we have a little audio problem here. Hang on. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Aryeh Klein from BMO. Aryeh, your line is live. Aryeh Klein : Thanks, and good morning. So I guess within the 4% RevPAR growth outlook, what are your expectations for leisure performance? And are you seeing any kind of noticeable difference in the consumer behavior at the ultra high end resorts versus leisure at your other properties? And then maybe if you just talk to what you're seeing in Maui from a future bookings perspective. Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Sourav, are you back on audio? No, he's not. Sourav, he is having some audio issue. Sourav Ghosh : I'm back on. I'm back on. Jim Risoleo : There you go. Okay. Sourav Ghosh : I'm back on. Can you repeat the question? Jim Risoleo : I'll start, Aryeh with respect to what are we seeing from the leisure consumer, our leisure transient traveler is generally the affluent consumer in the country. We are seeing no slowdown in spend. We're really not seeing a backing off in a meaningful way in ADR and out-of-room spend in banquet in outlets is still strong. This goes back to Stephen's question. The investment that we made in a lot of our properties and the transformational properties has resulted in a significant pickup in outlet spend throughout the portfolio. So leisure is from our perspective, it's still trending very strong. And I think that goes back to the commentary around spring break where our revenue pace is up 20% year-over-year for spring break, and we're very pleased with that. Aryeh Klein : Thanks. And just on Maui, what you're seeing from a future booking standpoint that gives you kind of confidence in the recovery in the second half of the year? Jim Risoleo : Well, I'm not certain that we said that there was going to be a recovery in the second half of the year. So we hope that there's a recovery in the second half of the year. But there are a number of things that have to happen on Maui, particularly on the West side, which is where the wildfires were. And the gating issue really is finding shelter for the displaced residents. And March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind. The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents, then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. Because I think on the island of Maui, in total, there's about 30,000 short-term rentals. So it's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely. Additionally, cleanup and the plans to rebuild Lahaina town are still in process. So the west side, I think, is going to take some time to come back. In the interim, we have been working with relief agencies, in particular, now the Red Cross, and we have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May. And we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward. The story in Wailea, where we own the Andaz Wailea and the Fairmont Kea Lani is different. Those properties have been, in the case of the Fairmont Kea Lani just completed a transformational renovation. So the asset is in incredible shape, as is the Andaz Wailea, where we completed soft good's rooms redo, as well as the significant bathroom work. So both of those assets are in great shape and we're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea, which is a completely different submarket than the west side in Kaanapali, that will see the cadence of business pick up. And I would just say that, as we think about the midpoint of our guidance this year, we've assumed pretty much 100 basis point impact on Maui and that will result in about the same diminution in EBITDA as we experienced last year. But if Maui is better than our anticipation, and it's too soon to really know that, then we think there is some upside and that takes us to the higher end of the EBITDA guide. Sourav Ghosh : Yes, I just want to make sure I explain the EBITDA piece for Maui. To be clear, obviously when you look at sort of the first half, it's going to be impacted by the wildfire. That's about a $25 million to $30 million incremental impact for 2024. So when you think about the total impact for the year, it's close to $50 million that the wildfire impact is actually having as a result of Maui. So just keep that in mind, it's $25 million incremental impact year-over-year, $25 million to $30 million. Aryeh Klein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is live. David Katz : Morning everybody. Thanks for working me in. I appreciate it. Covered a lot of ground already and I really wanted to just maybe triple click on how we think about the boundaries for deals more. Are fixer uppers in or out of bounds versus things that just need a little more strategic direction. And any thoughts on sort of size would be helpful there as well. And that's it for me. Jim Risoleo : Well, David, let me take the second part of your question first, because that's an easy one. Bigger is better for us. And we don't turn any attractive opportunity away. But obviously, given our scale and our ability to deploy capital, we focus on larger transactions, we focus on complicated transactions, complicated boxes with diverse demand generators being group business transient and leisure, as well as hotels that have multiple outlets and look for opportunities to not only improve the top line, but to improve the middle part of that P&L through our asset management and enterprise analytics capabilities. We are perfectly open minded to buying an asset that needs to be repositioned from a CapEx perspective, it doesn't concern us at all. We certainly have the ability with our design and construction group in house to do that. But what we really look at is how is this asset going to perform after it is renovated and repositioned, and how is it going to perform relative to the existing portfolio, because our bottom line goal is to put money to work, whether it's within our existing assets or new acquisitions to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the company. So it's across the board. David Katz : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Dori Kesten from Wells Fargo. Your line is live. Dori Kesten : Thanks. Good morning. How has the spread between your group and transient ADR shifted from 2019 to today? And I guess, how much do your transient rates drive your in the year, for the year group booking pricing. Jim Risoleo : Sorry, Dori, can you repeat the question for me? Dori Kesten : The spread between your group rates and your transient rates. I'm wondering how that's changed from 2019 to today. And then the second piece of it was how much do your transient rates inform your in the year for the year group pricing? Jim Risoleo : Yes, so its typically so answer the second half first, I'll have to get back to you on the specific delta to 2019 on group and transient, don't have that in front of me. But in terms of the way we think about the yielding, it really is group comes first. So you're developing that group base and you're seeing where that group rate is, and then you're yielding the transient business and depending on where group is coming in, and it's not just a rate piece, you have to remember, it's also we get a meaningful amount of ancillary business with food and beverage and golf and spa and all that. That makes up a pretty meaningful amount for our portfolio. It is looking at total revenue and what that contribution is to total EBITDA. So once a group base is built, then we figure out the properties are looking at, okay, what makes most sense to layer in transient and at what rate. So you're going to yield out the lower rated business and obviously move towards the higher rated business. So it's more the group base that drives it versus just where transient is coming in. I mean, so you're looking at transient pickup, certainly in the short-term, and filling that up. But the pricing is all determined where group sits for majority of your portfolio. Operator : Certainly, there are no further questions in the queue. I'll now hand the conference back to Jim for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Jim Risoleo : Thank you. And thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our quarterly results and our guidance for 2024, and we look forward to seeing many of you at conferences in the coming months. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jaime Marcus, Senior Vice President of Investor of Investor Relations. You may begin. Jaime Marcus : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, please note that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.  In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel level results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in yesterday's earnings press release and our 8-K filed with the SEC and in the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com.  With me on today's call are Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. James Risoleo : Thank you, Jaime, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. In the first quarter, we delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $483 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.60, which includes $10 million of business interruption proceeds from Hurricane Ian. Excluding the business interruption proceeds, our adjusted EBITDAre was 7% above the first quarter of 2023, and our adjusted FFO per share was 8% above last year.  We delivered a year-over-year comparable hotel total RevPAR improvement of 50 basis points, underscoring the continued strength of out-of-room revenue while comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.2%. First quarter RevPAR faced headwinds from tough year-over-year comparisons, particularly in Maui. The year-over-year decline in Maui RevPAR had an actual drag of 170 basis points on our first quarter portfolio RevPAR. However, this understates the true impact of the wildfires as we would have expected Maui to contribute 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the first quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023. As a result,  the total estimated impact of the wildfires on first quarter RevPAR is 310 basis points. RevPAR was also impacted by unseasonable weather in Florida, Arizona and California unanticipated renovation delays at the Singer oceanfront resort. Despite these headwinds, our first quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 31.2% and was 30 basis points above 2019. As a reminder, our first quarter operational results discussed today refer to our comparable hotel portfolio, which excludes The Ritz-Carlton, Naples in 2024. In addition, while Alila Ventana Big Sur is included in our first quarter results, it is currently closed and it has been removed from our comparable hotel set for the remainder of the year after a portion of Highway 1 collapse in late March. At this time, we expect the resort to reopen towards the end of the second quarter.  During the first quarter, our portfolio results continued to be impacted by the evolving nature of demand on Maui. Our risk management team has reached an agreement with our insurance carriers and we are now including between $18 million and $22 million of business interruption proceeds related to the Maui wildfires and our full year 2024 guidance. Turning to business mix. It is worth noting that this quarter, we are referring to revenue growth for our business mix segment as revenue per available room as a result of the leap year. Group revenue per available room grew 4% in the first quarter, driven by room nights. Our properties booked over 500,000 group room nights in the year for the year bringing our definite group room nights on the books for 2024 to $3.6 million, with total group revenue pace up 7% compared to the same time last year. In the first quarter, business transient revenue per available room grew 5%, driven by both rate and room nights and leisure remained steady with transient rates at our comparable resorts up 52% compared to 2019, including our 3 Maui resorts. Briefly touching on out-of-room spend. Food and beverage revenue per available room grew 2% in the first quarter compared to last year, driven by an all-time high banquet and catering contribution.  Other revenue per available room grew 6%, driven by elevated attrition and cancellation fees. It is worth noting that nearly 40% of our total revenue in 2023 came from food and beverage and other revenue and our 2024 guidance assumes a similar proportion. Since 2017, non-room revenue has steadily grown as our portfolio has shifted towards more complex, higher-end properties, which benefit from substantial out-of-room spend from both guests and non guests. In fact, there may be instances that the property teams at our hotels strategically forgo [indiscernible] room rate as they focus on the total revenue picture. The Ritz-Carlton, Naples is a clear example of the positive impact out-of-room spending. In the first quarter, the resort achieved RevPAR of $900, which is only half of its $1,700 total RevPAR. As a result of our meaningful expansion and transformational renovation, transient rates in the quarter were up 40% compared to 2019 driven by club level rooms and food and beverage revenue grew 38%, driven by outlets. In March, the resort posted its best revenue month ever, aided by Easter week's RevPAR, which was 45% above the competitive set. In addition, the resort was recently named to Travel and Leisure's It List, and we are proud to say that it truly is firing on all cylinders.  Turning to capital allocation. Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of the fee simple interest in a 2-hotel complex comprising the 215 room, 1 Hotel Nashville, in the 506 room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown were approximately $530 million in cash. The acquisition price represents a 12.6x EBITDA multiple or a cap rate of approximately 7.4% on 2024 estimated results. The properties are each expected to rank among our top 25 assets based on estimated full year 2024 results, with an expected combined RevPAR of $275, RevPAR of $435 and EBITDA per key of $58,550, further improving the quality of our portfolio.  The newly built LEED silver complex opened in 2022, and stands directly across from the 2.1 million square foot music city convention center adjacent to the Bridgestone Arena, which is home of the NHL Nashville Predators, and within a 10-minute drive of Nissan Stadium, the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum, Vanderbilt University, Tennessee State University and Centennial Park. It sits on 1.2 fee simple acres in Nashville, Spain Lower Broadway Entertainment District. The 2 hotel complex has a combined 721 oversized rooms that average approximately 500 square feet with a 75% suite mix. The properties offer 7 separate food and beverage outlets, including [indiscernible] rooftop at the 1 Hotel, which provides guests with exclusive views of Music City skyline in an elevated night life setting. Other amenities include a spa, 2 fitness centers, a yoga studio and 33,000 square feet of shared meeting space. From 2000 to 2023, the Nashville hotel market had a RevPAR CAGR of 7.7%, even while absorbing new supply. It is the #2 ranked convention destination in the United States and the convention center has continued to set record attendance numbers by attracting larger events with promising definite bookings in future years. The new Nissan Stadium, home of the NFL Tennessee Titans, is also expected to generate increased demand as the stadium zone attracts more entertainment and sporting events with year-round activation.  In addition, Nashville has the fastest-growing airport in the United States with current passenger traffic 33% above 2019. The recent $1.5 billion airport expansion added 6 international gates and 8 satellite gates. And another $1.5 billion expansion is already underway, with expected completion in 2028. While supply growth is expected to continue in Nashville, most projects are in the planning stages and in the select service chain scale. We believe the 1 Hotel Nashville and the Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown are highly differentiated from the future supply due to their central location and diversified product offerings, which provide distinct value propositions to customers and guests.  With multiple demand generators and no expected near-term capital expenditure requirements, we believe the combined properties will stabilize at approximately 10 to 12x EBITDA in the 2026 to 2028 time frame, driving additional value creation for our portfolio. Due to the timing of the acquisition, the 1 Hotel Nashville and the Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown are not yet included in our comparable hotel guidance metrics, but will be included starting in the second quarter. The acquisition is expected to generate $29 million of adjusted EBITDA for our ownership period, which is included in our adjusted EBITDAre and FFO guidance for 2024.  Looking back on our transaction activity. We have acquired $4 billion of assets since 2018 at a 13.5x EBITDA multiple and disposed off $5 billion of assets at a 17x EBITDA multiple including $976 million of estimated foregone capital expenditures. This accretive capital recycling has allowed us to grow our adjusted EBITDAre and dividend in excess of full year 2019 levels as we continue on the path towards $2 billion of adjusted EBITDAre. As we have demonstrated, we believe Host is well positioned to continue capitalizing on value-enhancing acquisition opportunities. After adjusting for post-quarter transactions, we have $1.7 billion of total available liquidity and net leverage of 2.3x, and we will continue using our size, scale and relationships to uncover more acquisition opportunities.  Turning to portfolio reinvestment. Our 2024 capital expenditure guidance range remains $500 million to $605 million, which reflects approximately $225 million to $280 million of investment for redevelopment, repositioning and ROI projects. During the first quarter, we started the Hyatt Transformational Capital program renovations at the Grand Hyatt, Atlanta and the Grand Hyatt, Washington, which we expect to complete in the first half of 2025. We received $2 million of operating guarantees in the first quarter to offset business disruptions related to the Hyatt Transformational Capital program and we expect to benefit from an additional $7 million in 2024. More broadly, we have completed 24 transformational renovations since 2018, which we believe provide meaningful tailwinds for our portfolio. Of the 12 hotels that have stabilized post renovation operations to date, the average RevPAR index share gain is 8.5 points, which is well in excess of our targeted gain of 3 to 5 points. Wrapping up, we believe Host is well positioned to continue to outperform. Our successful capital allocation strategy has allowed us to deliver 2023 adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per share above 2019 levels, outperforming the other full-service lodging REITs. We are encouraged by the supply picture for our markets and chain scales, which remains below historical levels. The improving international demand imbalance, the continued improvement in business transient demand and increased activity in the transactions market.  We believe our EBITDA growth profile, our investment-grade balance sheet, our diversified portfolio and our continued portfolio reinvestment are key differentiators. As we have demonstrated, Host can and will continue to do it all. With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav to discuss additional operational detail and our revised 2024 outlook. Sourav Ghosh : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on our first quarter operations, updated 2024 guidance and our balance sheet. Starting with business mix. Overall transient revenue per available room was down 6% compared to the first quarter of 2023, driven by tough comparisons, including the evolving nature of demand in Maui, unseasonable weather in many markets and unanticipated renovation delays at the Singer Oceanfront Resort. Combined, we estimate that the renovation delay and Maui had a 440 basis point impact to transient RevPAR in the quarter. However, leisure rate is still strong. Transient rates at our resorts remained resilient at 52% above the first quarter of 2019 and resort food and beverage outlet revenue per occupied room grew over last year. Gulf revenue continued to grow the record levels set in the first quarter of the last 2 years despite the impact from our Maui golf courses. Looking ahead to holidays in the second quarter, for Memorial Day weekend, transient room revenue pace for the overall portfolio is up over last year and up high single digits, excluding Maui.  We are still outside the primary booking window for July 4, but thus far, we are encouraged by strong bookings in San Diego, Houston and New York. Business transient revenue per available room was 5% above the first quarter of 2023 driven by an increase in rate and room nights as business transient demand continued its slow and steady recovery. Seattle, Boston, and San Francisco led room night growth, and both New York and Boston are within 2% of pre-pandemic demand. Turning to group. Revenue per available room was up 4% in the first quarter, driven by room night growth in San Diego, San Francisco, Orlando and Maui. Notably, group room night volume reached 96% of the first quarter of 2019 levels, led by corporate and SMERF groups. For full year 2024, we have 3.6 million definite group room nights on the books, representing a 17% increase since the fourth quarter and putting us ahead of same time last year.  Group rate on the books is up 4%, and total group revenue pace is up 7% over the same time last year. As Jim mentioned, our banquet and catering contribution per group room night in the first quarter was at an all-time high, coming in approximately 1% above the prior record set in the first quarter of 2023.  We continue to be encouraged by the ongoing strength of group business as evidenced by strong pace, [ lingering ] booking windows and double-digit citywide room night pace in key markets such as Nashville, New Orleans, San Antonio, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Shifting gears to margins. As expected, margin declines year-over-year were driven by increases in wages, benefits and fixed expenses as well as impacts from Maui. Despite these headwinds, our comparable hotel EBITDA margin was 31.2% in the first quarter, representing a 30 basis point increase over 2019 as a result of our continued efforts to redefine the operating model. We expect year-over-year margin comparisons to improve as the year progresses. Turning to our revised outlook for 2024. The midpoint of our guidance continues to contemplate steady demand in travel and low supply growth. Our expectations for the year are driven by improvements in group business, a gradual recovery in business transient, softer short-term leisure transient demand and a continued evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires.  At the low end, we have assumed slow group pickup and softer leisure transient demand. And at the high end, we have assumed a faster recovery at our Maui resorts and increased group pickup. For full year 2024, we anticipate comparable hotel RevPAR growth of between 2% and 4% over 2023. We expect comparable hotel EBITDA margins to be down 80 basis points year-over-year at the low end of our guidance to down 30 basis points at the high end. Notably, we expect comparable hotel EBITDA margins to be up 10 basis points at the midpoint versus 2019 despite an estimated 20 basis point margin impact from Maui. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we anticipate comparable hotel total RevPAR growth of 3.7% and comparable hotel RevPAR growth of 3% compared to 2023. This 100 basis point reduction in our RevPAR growth midpoint is driven by lower-than-expected first quarter results, underperformance in Maui and softer-than-expected short-term leisure transient demand. That said, the strength of out-of-room revenues allowed for total RevPAR to decline only 60 basis points relative to our prior midpoint. We expect a comparable hotel EBITDA margin midpoint of 29.6%, which has improved 30 basis points from our initial guidance and is now only 50 basis points below 2023. We estimate the Maui wildfires will impact full year comparable hotel TRevPAR by 90 basis points, RevPAR by 130 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margin by 20 basis points.  We also expect a 50 basis point impact from property taxes and insurance. In terms of RevPAR growth cadence for the year, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR growth to be flat to low single digits in the first half of the year based on the drivers I just mentioned. We continue to expect mid-single-digit comparable hotel RevPAR growth in the second half of the year as a result of strong group booking pace, less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023, and the diminishing year-over-year impacts of the Maui wildfires, which occurred in August of 2023. Our revised 2024 full year adjusted EBITDAre midpoint is $1.670 billion, a $35 million or 2% increase over the prior quarter. This includes an expected additional $8 million from business interruption proceeds related to Hurricane Ian, $20 million of business interruption proceeds related to the Maui wildfires, an estimated $62 million contribution from operations at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which is up from $60 million in our prior guidance and $6 million from operations at Alila Ventana Big Sur, a decline of $10 million compared to our prior guidance.  As a reminder, Ritz-Carlton Naples and Alila Ventana Big Sur are excluded from our comparable hotel set for the full year 2024 forecast. Our adjusted EBITDA and FFO guidance also includes an estimated $29 million contribution from the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville downtown.  Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our weighted average maturity is 4.3 years at a weighted average interest rate of 4.7% after repaying the $400 million Series G senior notes in April. As Jim noted, we currently have $1.7 billion in total available liquidity, which includes $231 million of FF&E reserves. Our quarter end leverage ratio adjusted for post-quarter transactions was 2.3x, and we have $1.3 billion of availability on our credit facility.  Also, since our last call, Moody's upgraded the company's issuer outlook from stable to positive. Further, in April, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share demonstrating our commitment to returning capital stockholders. As always, future dividends are subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors. We will continue to be strategic and opportunistic in managing our balance sheet and liquidity position as we move through the remainder of 2024. To conclude, we believe our best-in-class portfolio and balance sheet uniquely position Host to capitalize on opportunities for growth in the future.  With that, we would be happy to take your questions. To ensure we have time to address as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Michael Bellisario : Jim, one long question for you on Nashville. Could you walk us through the time line for this deal, maybe how your cost of capital and view of value evolved, especially given how much the capital markets have moved in the last 3 to 6 months? And then just lastly, how you're thinking about the continued ramp-up of these properties, given that they're both less than 2 years old? James Risoleo : Sure, Mike. Nashville is a market that we have had our eye on for a number of years. It is a market where I would say we're underrepresented given the dynamic that is occurring in Nashville. Years ago, we did a 50-50 joint venture with White Lodging on a Hyatt Place. We were one of the early ones in Nashville. And that property has continued to outperform all of our expectations. I think we refinanced it 2 or 3 times along the way. So have been scouring the market and actually had reached out to our friends at Starwood Capital and Crescent before the 1 Hotel and Embassy Suites even opened when it was in the construction phase. We're not much of -- not terribly keen on being a developer, but that was one deal that I really wanted to see if we could participate in when it was coming out of the ground. And that was a nonstarter for the development team. So we've been following it for a long time. It came out very strong in 2022. It was open for a partial year, and it had RevPAR of $185 and EBITDA of $8.7 million. And to proceed in a cautious way and really not having a clear view at that point in time with respect to how the macro picture is going to play out, whether we were going to really have a hard landing and end up at a serious recession or the Fed was going to engineer a soft landing, we elected to just watch the property over '23 and keep the dialogue going. So obviously, our cost of capital is a fluid metric. We look at it over time, and adjusts from time to time. And as we engaged in this transaction, earlier in this year, the equity markets were in a different place. And so that's tick one to your question. Secondly, we wanted make certain that the property was going to perform as anticipated. And in 2023, the asset had a RevPAR of $257. And the out-of-room spend was very, very strong to result in EBITDA for '23 of $37.7 million. So our underwriting this year has us at $275 RevPAR and $42.2 million of EBITDA. And we think Nashville is really just getting started as a market, honestly. There are so many good things happening in Nashville that it is a market of the future. It's the #2 convention market in the United States behind Orlando. They've just completed a $1.5 billion expansion of the airport and immediately starting on another $1.5 billion expansion.  Oracle just announced that they're moving to Nashville to be closer to the center of health care tech. Amazon is developing a significant presence in the city as well. I think they're going to have about 5,000 jobs in Nashville. The demographics of the city are very positive. You have a lot of demographic inflows into Nashville. The tax environment is very favorable. It's a favorable business environment.  The asset itself, it's unmatched. I mean it is a main and main location. It's literally right across the street from the Music City Convention Center, a $2.1 million facility. And that facility for 2023 and '24 on the books exceed 2029 nights, all over 1 million citywide room nights. The pace in 24 is 19% over 23%, the pace in '25 is 10% over same time last year. So there are just a lot of really positive things that are happening in this market. And I know there's been some talk about new supply and -- we spent a lot of time in the market. I spent a lot of time myself in the market. And really to wrap our hands -- our head around what could possibly happen. I will tell you that a lot of the projects that were planned are still in the planning stage because developers are finding out that it is costing more to build than they anticipated. And when you layer higher construction costs on with a higher cost of debt and lower proceeds from a construction loan perspective, the deals just aren't getting done. As a matter of fact, there was a Ritz-Carlton planned for quite some time, and that transaction got completely pulled by Ritz because the site was tied up and nothing was happening on it. So there will be some select serve come online in the marketplace. We've taken that into consideration in our underwriting, but in terms of full service, upper upscale luxury hotels, if and when it happens, it's probably 3 or 4 years out best case scenario. So that's how we're thinking about Nashville. It's a market we don't have an exposure in. It's a market we want to get into, and we follow this asset for a long time. Operator : Our next question is coming from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Jim, Sourav, and I apologize going a little bit late. So if there's some piece of prepared remarks, it's a repeat here than my apologies. But hoping you can just dig in on what you're seeing on the leisure transient softness came up a couple of times. -- that I heard. Just some examples you could give when you started to see that behavior shift, is it continuing into April? Just any kind of sense by market or behavior that you can see right now? That would be great. Sourav Ghosh : Sure, Shaun. Where we started really seeing it as the short-term leisure transient demand. And I want to specify demand because in our prepared remarks, we talked about how rate for leisure has still surprised us to the upside. We are -- effectively for our portfolio Q1, 52% above 2019. And if you recall, that's kind of where we were in prior quarter as well. So the rate is not letting down. It's just the short-term transient demand. Reality is we started seeing that really March is probably when we did. And part of it is -- we suspect is really being driven also by the poor weather that we had in Q1.  And going into April, obviously, you have the Easter shift, we have a significant portion of our portfolio is resorts and Q1 does extremely well for our resorts. So the Easter shift is a little, I would say, not as much impactful for our portfolio. However, what does happen with the timing of Easter, it does shorten the time that the resorts can really drive rates and demand. So therefore, April sort of in the short-term pickup is certainly slower. However, rates are still holding strong. What I can tell you with what data we have available as of right now, we don't have the full month data yet, but April is trending effectively flat for the portfolio. But remember, that includes Maui. If you exclude Maui, we were actually closer to slightly above 1% for April.  So overall, things are still looking very strong. And when we look at the sort of the second half of the year, what I will say is the group piece is looking extremely strong for the second half. And that's what really gives us confidence for the full year is we picked up 421,000 room nights for the remainder of the year and 60% of that was for the second half. So clearly, have tremendous confidence for the second half and overall total revenue pace is actually close to 9% for the second half of the year. Operator : Our next question is coming from Aryeh Klein with BMO. Aryeh Klein : Maybe just going back to Nashville, now that, that acquisition has been done, how are you thinking about future M&A? And perhaps which markets are of interest? Are there Nashville types markets that you're not in that you'd still like to get into? And then maybe just on the overall M&A landscape, with rates seemingly higher for longer. Has there been any shift in the market? Have you seen assets pulled or anything like that? James Risoleo : Yes. A couple of questions there, Aryeh. Let's talk about the M&A landscape first. So I think there was a fair amount of anticipation among the brokerage community that we would see a pickup in transaction activity as the Fed moved to lower interest rates. We haven't seen that happen yet because of where the Fed is sitting. However, I believe that there are some owners out there who will be sellers now because they just can't afford to wait any longer and for a lot of reasons. I mean, they haven't invested in their assets over the course of the pandemic. They may have loans coming due, and they're going to have refi them into a higher interest rate environment.  So we're hearing a little bit of chatter that we might see a more active M&A market in the second half of the year. That said, we don't sit around at Host and wait for marketed opportunities. We really prefer to continue to work with our long-standing partners relationships that we have and that's how we got the Nashville deal done. You may recall that we also bought the 1 Hotel South Beach from Starwood Capital. So we're very happy that Starwood Capital and Crescent have the confidence faith in Host as an owner to give us this deal on an off-market basis. And we're talking to a lot of other folks out there and I'm hopeful, certainly not assured, but hopeful that over the course of the year that we'll be able to get additional transactions completed. We're in a unique position. And we're going to take advantage of the position that we're in. We don't have to go to the debt capital markets to get a deal done. Even post Nashville, we're sitting here at 2.3x leverage. We have $1.7 billion of available liquidity. The investment grade balance sheet is very important to us. We certainly intend to maintain our investment-grade rating. That said, with a leverage ratio of circa 3x roughly, we have the ability to acquire another $1.1 billion of assets this year. So that is our focus. We continue to want to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the portfolio. We told many of you who were at our Investor Day last May, that we're on track to get to $2 billion of EBITDA and I just encourage everyone to watch us and see what we do. Operator : Our next question is coming from Smedes Rose with Citi. Bennett Rose : Sourav, I just wanted to circle back. I know you talked about this a little bit in your opening remarks that the -- on a comparable basis, your EBITDA outlook declined by over $20 million. And so you -- that included some business insurance. It turned out, it's going to be a lot more, which is great. But I guess I just wanted to understand, of that about $22 million decline, how much did you think was isolated or sort of realized as it were in the first quarter? And how much is coming through the balance of the year and maybe related to your  1 point reduction in sort of RevPAR forecast? Sourav Ghosh : Sure thing. I just want to clarify and maybe I'll just quickly walk through the bridge from our prior guidance to this guidance. Because on the comparable hotel operations, it's actually a $13 million decline, which is a result of the change of 1 point to our midpoint of going down from the 4% to the 3%. The $13 million, it's not $22 million, so let's start off with $1.635 billion, which was our previous guidance. You take out $13 million of comparable operations and which is pretty impressive if you think about it because typically a 1 point decline in RevPAR would equate to $30 million of EBITDA decline. So we're deducting only $13 million from there. you have $20 million of comparable BI from the Maui wildfires, which you will be adding to that. Then you take out $10 million for Ventana, maybe that's where you're getting the $223 million because the $10 million is moving to non-comp from comps. So that's Alila Ventana, taking out $10 million of EBITDA. You're adding $2 million incremental for Naples because our forecast went from $60 million for the year to $62 million. And then you're adding $29 million for Nashville, the 1 Hotel and the Embassy Suite and then another $8 million of BI for the Ritz, Naples. So that, if you really add that up, you will get to the $1.670 billion. So hopefully, that helps bridge it from our prior guidance. In terms of where that 1 point decline I would say it's 2/3 in Q1 and about 1/3 in Q2. And as I mentioned earlier, our second half is looking very strong. So we have a ton of confidence in terms of group for the second half, and that confidence has improved. Our total revenue pace for the second half is now over -- slightly over 9%. And a lot of that is Q3 that's driving it. So -- that's sort of how it lays out. Hopefully, that makes it clear. Operator : Our next question is coming from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Grambling : Just a follow-up on that. So there's a lot of moving parts in terms of bridging that guidance. And some of that includes BI. Some of it is the core, of the BI is covering some of the disruption. What do you think is the kind of right recurring EBITDA in the year to build off of as we think about longer term? Sourav Ghosh : Sure. So if you think about the $1.670 billion that we have guided to for the year, the way to think about long-term run rate, you take out $38 million of BI, right? So it's effectively the $10 million that we already had in the previous guidance, plus the $28 million that we have put into the guidance. You'll take out the $38 million, and then you will add $10 million for Alila Ventana, you would add $13 million for Nashville. So that, as Jim mentioned, we're expecting about $42.2 million this year. We already have $29 million in there. So that's where the $13 million is coming for Nashville.  And then you would add another about $46 million, call it, for Maui. But for this year, our estimated Maui EBITDA is about $114 million. And if you add the $46 million, that sort of gets you back to where we were pre-fire. So when add that all up, I would say it comes to a pretty even $1.7 billion in terms of sort of ongoing run rate. Operator : Our next question is coming from Bill Crow with Raymond James. William Crow : Perfect. Jim, it seems like the Four Seasons, Orlando is an interesting resort to look at it. It seems -- correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like that asset, in particular, benefited from pent-up inbound international demand and maybe what might be called aspiration or surge spending over the past couple of years. I'm just curious how 2024 is shaping up relative to '23? And maybe more generally, is surge spending kind of coming down or cooling a bit? James Risoleo : Bill, it's -- yes, I would say that I don't know if I want to say that it's coming down or cooling a bit. The ADR is likely to be lower this year in Orlando than it was in '23, but it's still meaningfully above where it was in 2019. So we're not seeing a reset really backwards by any means. And one of the other things that will impact us a bit in Orlando this year is some disruption associated with our condo development. So we are steering guests away from a certain side of the building during times of construction. And -- so that is going to be an impact on Orlando as well. But all in all, we've had -- we still continue to have I think 5 resorts in the quarter that drove over $1,000 ADRs. And we're not seeing a real slowdown in the affluent customer. There has been a rotation that we talked about last year with respect to an international inbound versus -- international outbound versus inbound imbalance. That is still occurring. I think over time that will right itself and correct itself. I think going back to Orlando for a moment, the Four Seasons in the quarter, we've had an ADR of over $2,000. So people are still -- they still want to go to Orlando, they still want to stay at the Four Seasons. And what we have working against us a bit is a strong dollar. It's not weakening. It will likely weaken once rates start to come down, and that's keeping the international traveler away from the United States right now. I mean there was a fairly significant uptick in the first quarter.  As we all try to wrap our head around the soft leisure demand -- we talked a lot about weather in 3 states : Arizona, Florida and California, and it was meaningful. I mean we lost group business at the [ Fenician ] over the course of the waste management open because of the rains. Now we dug into this a little more. And we tried to answer the question, where do these people go? I mean the demand didn't just disappear. People just stay home. We found out that as an example, the international outbound to the Caribbean in the first quarter was 135% of where it was in 2019 levels and RevPAR in the Caribbean was up 17%. So it's just a longer way of saying that our belief is that the consumer -- the affluent consumer is still healthy. They're still spending money. They're still prioritizing experiences over goods. And we're just not seeing the reset back. William Crow : That's helpful. Jim, you were one of the louder voice among your peers. I think everybody talked about it, but kind of projecting that this inbound outbound balance would correct itself this summer. Has the change in currency values -- and maybe some of the outbound activity you saw in first quarter, has that kind of reduce your conviction on that call? James Risoleo : I would say it's going to take longer than we anticipated. Yes. We just -- just very difficult to wrap your arms around that. One of the other things that we as an industry are dealing with through U.S. travel and AHLA is working with the state department to see what can be done to shorten Visa wait times. I mean Visa wait times in the U.S. are still running at 400 days. And that is a discouraging factor to many people as they are looking to come to the U.S. A corollary to that is in Canada, you can get it a Visa 40 days out. So there is a program in place to try to break that log jam and to hire more people to do the processing necessary. Operator : Our next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Most of my questions have been asked. But just on the Naples Ritz, can you remind us what seasonality is for that asset historically? I know your guide implies about 50% of the full year contribution in the March quarter. But does that align with historical seasonality? What did 1Q typically represent historically, if there's such a thing as a \"normal year.\" Sourav Ghosh : Sure, Duane. So yes, your estimate is right. We did about $32 million of EBITDA from operations of the Ritz Naples -- what you will -- when you see the $42 million in the income statement, that really includes the $10 million of BI that was in our previous guidance. So for purely from operations, $32 million, that's about 50%. I would say Q2 is about 25%. Q3 is relatively close to 0, and then Q4 is the remaining 25%. That's sort of how it breaks up for the year. And yes, it is pretty consistent to prior levels in terms of seasonality. Operator : Our next question is coming from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Most of my questions have already been addressed. But one, I was just looking at your commentary about the increase in revenue in the quarter, the different parts of revenue per room. And it sounded like the biggest increase was coming from, I think, you said the other revenue, up 6% from cancellation and attrition fees. So I'm just wondering if that was -- that increase was an unusually high level? Is that something you'll be comping next year that we should be thinking about or -- maybe thinking about as onetime in nature? Sourav Ghosh : Yes, Robin, clearly, attrition and cancellation revenue is coming in higher, and I wouldn't say that's necessarily a systemic thing. We were expecting -- the attrition cancellation revenues to go back more to norm. We had in our previous forecast for the year, approximately $57 million or so for the year. And now we have closer to $71 million forecasted for the year. It's not across the portfolio. And part of it is our managers are frankly doing a much better job of collecting those revenues and contracts are tighter. So it's just been sort of a trend that we are seeing, and we may actually stabilize at those higher levels, but it's not a systemic issue about the portfolio or anything that was some of these jumps out on a onetime basis in Q1. Robin Farley : So that bridge that you built earlier to kind of what's recurring and not recurring, would you say that -- I guess, that kind of roughly like $14 million increase in your original expectations, you're saying we should assume that cancellations stay at that level? Or would you say that something that would [indiscernible] we're thinking about? Sourav Ghosh : Yes, it's difficult to exactly predict what it will be for the following year, but it seems like thus far, attrition cancellation is going to be at that elevated level, at least based on what we're seeing today. Operator : Our next question is coming from David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : Can you just talk about the deal market a little bit? Are there assets out there that would be sold but not for the cost of capital? Is there still some sort of sellers posturing with respect to price that needs to adjust itself. What are the gating factors for a more active deal trading market to start to occur, please? James Risoleo : Yes, David, I think the limiting factor is really the cost of debt. It's not so much the availability of debt right now because the CMBS market for those buyers who need to tap CMBS financing is wide open. And there's been a lot of volume occur this year across multiple asset classes in real estate. But the cost of debt is still such that it is precluding private equity firms to underwrite to their hurdle returns and concurrently with their underwriting give the seller the price that they're looking for in the asset. So I think that is the biggest gating issue. And that puts Host in a really competitive advantage. I mean I talked about it before. We do not have to go to the debt window to get a deal done. And I think there will be opportunities over the course of the year where you have certain private equity firms who might be coming up on end of fund issues with respect to certain assets that they have to trade. They waited for the Fed to cut rates, but they're out of time. A couple of deals that we did in 2018 and started with the 1 Hotel South Beach. That was an end of fund issue with the Starwood Capital. They had to trade that asset. Same with the Four Seasons Orlando, another instance where that deal was at the end of fund life as well. So I can tell you that neither owner of those assets really want to part with them because it is terrific properties. And I hope we're going to be able to find some additional opportunities in that vein as we work our way through 2024. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Chris Woronka : Wanted to kind of ask about Hawaii, Maui. I mean you guys -- I think used the term evolution of demand. Just can you give us a little more color on kind of what's happening? Are you guys seeing reservations come in and cancel? Or are you seeing just the booking windows get closer in? Just trying to get a sense for how much visibility you think you had? Is it getting better, it's getting worse? And what are some of the factors around that? James Risoleo : Yes. I'll start, Chris, and I'll let Sourav jump in and add what additional color he might have on it. But we are obviously very close to the -- to what's happening on Maui and I can't describe it in any more specific terms other than to say that demand continues to evolve on the island. I think that when the wildfires occurred, devastating wildfires occurred, those folks who might have been new to Maui and maybe they were staying down in Wailea in one of our 2 terrific properties [indiscernible] the Andaz or the Fairmont Kea Lani. They just said they listened to the governor and the governor said, \"Stay away from Maui.\" So travelers took the governor at his word. Now that language has been tempered since. The cleanup continues on the west side. The good news is that the displaced residents are really moving into more permanent homes and apartments. We like that. We like to see people get out of hotels and move into their -- move into a home and start their way back because so many people lost so much. They lost everything as a result of these wildfires. So the hotel association is -- and all the hotel owners on the island are working together to put a marketing plan in place. One of the other factors that still is out there with respect to the island is the fact that air capacity, the number of seats is down around 19% over the first quarter of 2019. And that's consistent with where the capacity went post the wildfires in August of last year. So -- it's a bit of a chicken and egg situation right now. We've got to get people back to the island. We have to sell the beauty of Maui and the experiences that they can get, even if it's not on the west side, if it's in Wailea. And we're confident that once that starts happening, that the airlines will increase capacity and the recovery will commence. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our allotted time for questions and answers. So I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Risoleo for any closing comments he may have. James Risoleo : Well, thank you again for joining us. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our quarterly results with you, and we look forward to seeing many of you on the road and certainly at NAREIT in New York. Have a good day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jamie Marcus, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Jaime Marcus : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, please note that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel level results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in yesterday's earnings press release and our 8-K filed with the SEC and in the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. With me on today's call are Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Risoleo : Thank you, Jamie, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. In the second quarter, we delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $476 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.57, which includes business interruption proceeds of $21 million for the Maui RevPAR and $9 million for Hurricane Ian. Adjusted EBITDAre grew 6.7% over the second quarter of last year and was up slightly, excluding business interruption proceeds. We delivered a year-over-year comparable hotel total RevPAR improvement of 50 basis points, underscoring the continued strength of out-of-room revenue while comparable hotel RevPAR was up 10 basis points. As a reminder, our second quarter operational results discussed today refer to our comparable hotel portfolio which excludes The Ritz-Carlton Naples and Alila Ventana Big Sur. Turning to quarterly results. Second quarter comparable hotel RevPAR faced headwinds from a slower-than-anticipated recovery in Maui and a continued shift in leisure demand to international destinations without a corresponding increase in international inbound demand. The year-over-year decline in Maui RevPAR had an actual drag of 250 basis points on our second quarter portfolio RevPAR. As discussed last quarter, this understates the true impact of the wildfires as we would have expected Maui to contribute 90 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the second quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023 and the expected lift for 2024. As a result, the total estimated impact of the wildfires on second quarter RevPAR is 340 basis points. The lodging recovery in Maui has been slower than anticipated due to several factors. First, recovery and relief room demand has diminished without a commensurate level of leisure demand to offset the decline. Second, as a result of softer demand, airline capacity is still impacted. In July, total airline seats to the island were down 16% year-over-year. However, this has improved from down 19% in June and down 26% last September. And lastly, there remains a perception from would be visitors that Maui is not ready to welcome guests back to the island. Our properties are collaborating with local tourism authorities and government officials to create a clear, well-supported marketing campaign that will launch this fall after the anniversary of the tragic fires. These state and local efforts are in addition to sales and marketing efforts by our managers. We are hopeful that this will be a turning point in the recovery trajectory, and consumers will once again feel comfortable returning to Maui. Turning to business mix. Group room revenue was up approximately 8% in the second quarter, driven by rate growth alongside demand growth. Our properties booked 315,000 group room nights in the year for the year, bringing our definite group room nights on the books for 2024 to 4 million rooms with total group revenue pace up 6% compared to the same time last year. Business transient revenue grew 4%, driven fairly evenly by demand and rate growth. Domestic leisure demand moderated as consumers opted for international destinations in Europe, Asia and the Caribbean. Despite the volume decline, transient rates at our comparable resorts were up 51% compared to 2019, including our 3 Maui Resorts, underscoring the financial health of the affluent consumer. We believe the international travel imbalance remains a key driver of lower leisure demand at our properties. In fact, U.S. international outbound travel has grown from 110% of pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter of last year to 119% in the second quarter of this year. At the same time, U.S. international inbound travel remains below pre-pandemic levels at 88% as a strong dollar, weaker global economic growth and Visa delays continued to present headwinds to the inbound recovery. Encouragingly, guests at our properties continue to spend during their stay. Food and beverage revenue drove total RevPAR growth in the second quarter, led by Banquet and Catering as well as improvement in outlet revenue on a per occupied room basis. Other revenue was down slightly due to the expected moderation of attrition and cancellation fees, but spa and golf revenues continued growing outside of Maui. As we highlighted last quarter, nearly 40% of our total revenue in 2023 came from food and beverage and other revenue and our 2024 guidance assumes a similar proportion. We continue to believe that total RevPAR presents a more holistic picture of our underlying business as our portfolio has shifted towards more complex, higher-end properties which benefit from substantial out-of-room spend. Turning to capital allocation. Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of fee simple interest in the 234 room 1 Hotel Central Park for approximately $265 million in cash. The acquisition price represents an 11.1x EBITDA multiple or a cap rate of approximately 8.1% on 2024 estimated results. The property is expected to rank among our top 10 assets based on estimated full year 2024 results with an expected RevPAR of $545, TRevPAR of $735 and EBITDA per key of over $100,000, further improving the quality of our portfolio. The LEED certified luxury property opened in 2015. It has 25 suites and a recently added 5 key penthouse that offers large terraces and unparalleled views of Central Park as well as the presidential suite. The lobby level features Jams, a 3-meal restaurant and bar affiliated with James Beard Award winner, Jonathan Waxman. The second floor offers 2,000 square feet of contiguous and flexible meeting space as well as a naturally lit fitness center and a business center. The 1 Hotel Central Park will further diversify our presence in New York City, which is one of the top RevPAR markets in the country. It will also provide host with the exposure to the luxury guest in Upper Manhattan, the top RevPAR submarket in the city. We also completed the previously announced acquisition of the 450-room Ritz Carlton O'ahu Turtle Bay yesterday. The resort is located on the North Shore of O'ahu, Hawaii and includes a 49-acre land parcel entitled for development. The $630 million resort acquisition price is net of key money, and represents a 16.3x EBITDA multiple or a cap rate of approximately 5.3% on 2024 estimated results. Based on preliminary 2025 underwriting and the conversion to Ritz-Carlton, the acquisition price represents an approximately 13.5x EBITDA multiple or a cap rate of approximately 6.7%. We expect this resort to stabilize between approximately 10x to 12x EBITDA in the 2027 to 2029 time frame. Due to the timing of the acquisitions, the 1 Hotel Central Park and The Ritz-Carlton, O'ahu, Turtle Bay are not yet included in our comparable hotel guidance metrics. They will be included starting in the third quarter. These 2 acquisitions are expected to generate $22 million of adjusted EBITDA for our ownership period, which is included in our adjusted EBITDAre and FFO guidance for 2024. Looking back on our transaction activity in 2024, we have acquired $1.5 billion of iconic and irreplaceable real estate at a blended 13.6x EBITDA multiple based on estimated 2024 results, which represents over $100 million of estimated full year EBITDA that we expect to grow as the assets stabilize. In May of 2023, we laid out a path to $2 billion of EBITDA at our Investor Day. With these acquisitions, we are halfway toward our target of $3 billion of acquisitions at a lower blended EBITDA multiple than we assumed at that time. Since 2018, we have acquired $4.9 billion of assets at a 13.6x EBITDA multiple and disposed of $5 billion of assets at a 17x EBITDA multiple, including $976 million of estimated foregone capital expenditures. This accretive capital recycling allows us to grow our 2023 adjusted EBITDAre by 6% above 2019 levels. Adjusted EBITDAre per key by 18% and NAREIT FFO per share by 13% and is what we believe will allow our portfolio to outperform over the long term. After adjusting for post-quarter transactions, we have $1.4 billion of total available liquidity and net leverage of 2.7x. During the quarter, we also repurchased 2.8 million shares of stock at an average price of $17.81 per share through our common share repurchase program, bringing our total repurchases for the quarter to $50 million. Since 2022, we have repurchased $258 million of stock at an average repurchase price of $16.26 per share. Turning to portfolio reinvestment. Our 2024 capital expenditure guidance range is $500 million to $600 million, which reflects approximately $220 million to $260 million of investment for redevelopment, repositioning and ROI projects. Included in the ROI projects is the Hyatt transformational capital program, which is on track and slightly under budget thus far. We received $2 million of operating guarantees in the second quarter to offset business disruptions related to the Hyatt transformational capital program, and we expect to benefit from an additional $5 million this year, bringing the total operating guarantees to $9 million in 2024. In addition to the capital expenditure range, this year, we expect to spend $50 million to $60 million on the 40-unit residential condo development at our Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort. The development is well underway and marketing efforts began in July. We anticipate the formal sales launch to begin in the fourth quarter. More broadly, we have completed 24 transformational renovations since 2018, which we believe provide meaningful tailwinds for our portfolio. Of the 14 hotels that have stabilized post renovation operations to date, the average RevPAR index share gain is 7 points, which is well in excess of our targeted gain of 3 to 5 points. Earlier this week, we released our 2024 corporate responsibility report, which details our CR program and strategy, our ESG initiatives and our industry-leading accomplishments. Additionally, the report provides an update on our performance and progress towards our 2030 environmental and social targets, which are mapped to our aspirational vision of becoming net positive by 2050. The CR report can be found on the Corporate Responsibility section of our website at hosthotels.com. Wrapping up, we believe Host is well positioned to continue to outperform. We remain optimistic about the state of travel today despite the softer than expected recovery in Maui and moderating domestic leisure transient demand. While we would certainly prefer to see more leisure demand in the U.S. versus abroad, it is encouraging to see consumers continue to prioritize spending on travel and experiences. The pendulum will eventually swing back to domestic destinations. And when it does, we believe Host is well positioned to benefit due to our geographically diversified, iconic and irreplaceable portfolio as well as the recent reinvestments we have made and continue to make in our properties. Host is uniquely positioned. And as we have demonstrated, we are able to access many capital allocation levers to create shareholder value. With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav to discuss additional operational detail and our revised 2024 outlook. Sourav Ghosh : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on our second quarter operations, updated 2024 guidance and our balance sheet. Starting with business mix. Overall transient revenue was down 5% compared to the second quarter of 2023, driven by softer-than-anticipated demand in Maui. We estimate that Maui had a 410 basis point impact to transient revenue in the quarter. Transient rates at our resorts remained resilient at 51% above the second quarter of 2019. Additionally, food and beverage outlet revenue per occupied room grew at both resorts and non-resorts. Outside of Maui, golf and spa revenues continued to grow due in part to our recent ROI investments in our spa and fitness facilities. We believe the rate strength at our resorts and continued growth of out-of-room spending indicates consumers' ongoing willingness to spend on travel and experiences. Looking at recent holidays, excluding Maui, Memorial Day weekend and July 4 outperformed our expectations due to strong last-minute transient bookings in the weeks leading up to the holiday weekends. Looking forward and excluding Maui, Labor Day transient revenue pace is up 9% compared to the third quarter of last year driven by occupancy. Business transient revenue was 4% above the second quarter of 2023, driven fairly evenly by increases in room nights and rate as business transient demand continued its slow and steady recovery. Demand growth was market-specific with certain hotels in Chicago and San Francisco, showing double-digit year-over-year growth in business transient demand. Encouragingly, Boston and New York both exceeded 2019 levels of business transient demand in the second quarter. Turning to Group. Revenue grew 8% in the second quarter, driven by 5% rate growth. Approximately half of the growth came from San Diego, Phoenix and Nashville with the balance coming from our other top markets. For full year 2024, we have approximately 4 million definite group room nights on the books, representing a 9% increase since the first quarter, keeping us ahead of same time last year. Group rate on the book is up 4% and total group revenue pace is up 6% over the same time last year, driven by a particularly strong third quarter and the continued focus on growing banquet and catering contribution. We remain encouraged by the ongoing strength of group business as evidenced by strong revenue pace, banquet and catering growth and double-digit citywide room night pace in key markets such as Nashville, New Orleans, San Antonio, San Diego, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Shifting gears to margins. Second quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 32.6% was 10 basis points below last year, driven by increases in wages, benefits and fixed expenses as well as impacts from Maui. We received $21 million of business interruption proceeds from the Maui wildfires, which provided a 135 basis point benefit to the comparable portfolio. Excluding the business interruption proceeds, operations in Maui had a 60 basis point impact to EBITDA margin. Despite these headwinds, our controllable expenses, which include laundry, linens and guest supplies were flat versus the second quarter of 2023 due to net operational improvements across our portfolio. Turning to our revised outlook for 2024. The midpoint of our guidance contemplates a slower-than-anticipated recovery from the wildfires in Maui and moderating domestic leisure transient demand, primarily driven by the international demand imbalance. At the low end, we have assumed slower group pickup and softer leisure transient demand. And at the high end, we have assumed a faster recovery at our Maui resorts and increased transient pickup. For full year 2024, we anticipate comparable hotel RevPAR growth of between negative 1% and positive 1% over 2023. We expect comparable hotel EBITDA margins to be down 110 basis points year-over-year at the low end of our guidance to down 60 basis points at the high end. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we anticipate comparable hotel total RevPAR growth of 1.2% and flat comparable hotel RevPAR compared to 2023. Looking at the drivers of the RevPAR midpoint decline, approximately 90% of the reduction is related to transient business as group remains strong in the second half of the year, particularly in the third quarter. We estimate the Maui wildfires will impact full year comparable hotel total RevPAR by 120 basis points and RevPAR by 180 basis points. Excluding business interruption proceeds, we expect adjusted EBITDAre to be impacted by $75 million to $80 million relative to our prefire estimate. In terms of RevPAR growth cadence, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR growth to be slightly positive in the second half of the year, driven by low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. We expect a comparable hotel EBITDA margin midpoint of 29.3%, which is 90 basis points below 2023. We estimate a 30 basis point impact to full year EBITDA margin from Maui relative to our prefire estimate, a 40 basis point impact from insurance and property taxes and a 110 basis point impact from wage and benefit rate increases, which is partially offset by a 90 basis point benefit from operational improvements. Our revised 2024 full year adjusted EBITDAre midpoint is $1.645 billion, a $25 million or a 1.5% decrease over the prior midpoint. This includes an estimated $62 million contribution from operations at the Ritz-Carlton Naples and $11 million from operations at Alila Ventana Big Sur, an increase of $5 million compared to our prior guidance. As a reminder, The Ritz-Carlton Naples and Alila Ventana Big Sur are excluded from our comparable hotel set for the full year 2024 forecast. Our adjusted EBITDA and FFO guidance also includes an estimated $22 million contribution from the 1 Hotel Central Park and The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu Turtle Bay for our ownership period. Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our weighted average maturity is 4.7 years at a weighted average interest rate of 4.9% after adjusting for investing and financing activities completed subsequent to quarter end. As Jim noted, we currently have $1.4 billion in total available liquidity, which includes $242 million of FF&E reserves. Our quarter end leverage ratio adjusted for post-quarter transactions was 2.7x, and we have $970 million of availability on our credit facility. In July, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, demonstrating our commitment to returning capital to stockholders. As always, future dividends are subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors. We will continue to be strategic and opportunistic in managing our balance sheet and liquidity position as we move through the remainder of 2024. To conclude, we remain optimistic about the future of travel as the headwinds facing our portfolio are not indicative of a weakening consumer. As Maui recovers and the international leisure demand imbalance finds equilibrium, our renovated portfolio of geographically diverse properties is well positioned to benefit. With that, we would be happy to take your questions. To ensure we have time to address as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to 1 question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. And the first question today is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. David Katz : I appreciate it. Jim, congrats on all of the acquisitions to everybody. Can you just talk about the possibility, the prospects, probability, boundaries around any further acquisitions that we might see this year or even early next from what you can tell today? Jim Risoleo : Yes, David, I think that -- let me start by saying that we are very, very happy with the 3 acquisitions that we made this year. Real estate is not a short-term business. And we look to acquire assets that are going to grow EBITDA over time. These are one-of-a-kind properties in each instance. And we're fortunate enough to have the balance sheet and the relationships to be able to transact when an asset like Turtle Bay comes to market. We referenced in a recent press release that we just sent out, I think it was yesterday, that Ritz Turtle Bay, O'ahu is now part of The Ritz-Carlton system. It went live yesterday when we closed on the hotel. It's a unique property for a lot of reasons. But one of the things that I think is worthy of pointing out is that there was a $0.5 million per key invested in that asset. And Ritz-Carlton took the hotel without a tip. So we believe there's going to be a lot of upside over and above the metrics that we quoted, which were based on 2025 pro forma, a 13.5x EBITDA multiple and a 6.7% cap rate. We think that, that property has a lot of run room. We haven't taken into consideration in our underwriting, any incremental EBITDA generated from the residences that are currently being developed by another developer on the site as well as our 49-acre parcel of land. So it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire that hotel and we're in a unique position to do it. The same with Central Park that we just announced yesterday as well. A little bit of background on Central Park and a little bit of background on why luxury. Why is Host focused on luxury assets? This is something that we started exploring back in 2017, quite frankly. And if you look at luxury, RevPAR CAGR. These are assets that had a RevPAR of greater than $500. They have meaningfully outperformed upper upscale in other segments in the lodging space, over extended periods of time. From the period of time 2019 to '23, luxury CAGR was 4.7% versus upper upscale 1.3%. So we expect that we're going to continue to be able to drive this type of performance from the acquisitions we made, which will lead to elevated EBITDA growth and elevated free cash flow, which will allow us to continue to take those proceeds and invest in our portfolio or pivot to other capital allocation decisions and opportunities that might be out there. Now to get back to your question, I don't think that we are contemplating doing additional acquisitions this year or even early next year. You never know of that 1 opportunity that might come over the door, where there is a great asset with a great opportunity to buy it because of some distressed situation. But, we certainly are more focused today on integrating these 3 great properties that we acquired into the Host system, into our asset management and enterprise analytics platform. And we will continue to invest in our portfolio generally because we are very happy with the results that we've achieved from the 24 total transformational innovations that we've completed to date, where the 14 properties that have stabilized operations have picked up 7 points in yield index well above our underwriting and we think that positions us great going forward. And we'll also consider buying back additional stock. We still have $742 million on our stock repurchase program. In the second quarter, we bought $50 million worth of stock at $17.81 per share. Looking back to 2020, throughout the pandemic to today, we purchased $400 million at $16.35 per share. So we're certainly not shy about getting into the market and acquiring our own stock, particularly given where we're seeing the share price trading today. David Katz : Understood. Thanks for the answer. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question is coming from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Okay. We will move on to Chris Darling from Green Street. Chris Darling : Jim, maybe following up on that last question actually. I mean, you mentioned acquisitions are unlikely in the near term and pivoting instead to deploying capital through whether ROI projects or as share repurchases. With that in mind, I wonder what role incremental dispositions might play in pursuit of that strategy and whether you're thinking about testing the market in any regard. Jim Risoleo : Chris, thanks for the question. Yes, we have explored disposition pricing recently and made a decision that really, given that we are under no pressure whatsoever to dispose off assets, and we will only do so if we believe that the pricing is fair relative to our hold value, the market dynamic just isn\u2019t there today. The cost of debt is still prohibitive from a valuation perspective. We\u2019ve been in a unique position to be able to transact, given our balance sheet and there really aren\u2019t any other players out there that are in that position. So we\u2019ll keep an eye on the market as we always do. And if we think there are opportunities to continue to enhance the overall growth profile of the portfolio, by disposing of assets, that\u2019s certainly something we will consider going forward. Operator : The next question is from Chris Woronka from Deutsche Bank. Chris Woronka : So Jim, you now have 3 of the 1 Hotels in the portfolio. I know there's a few more out there. So the question is kind of what's your longer-term vision for those hotels? Obviously, you've done very well in Miami in a pretty short period of time. I know they're managed, I know the entity that manages them. But is there a longer-term play there in terms of some other co-branding or something else you might do to kind of enhance the longer-term value of those? Jim Risoleo : Well, we are really happy being an owner of 1 Hotels, Barry Sternlicht, Starwood Capital, we\u2019ve always got Barry as an innovator. I mean, he started with the W brand. And I think 1 is really an extension of W. Our performance in Miami has been really quite incredible. We bought that at, I think, roughly a 13x multiple in 2018. And in 2023, we were around 10x, 10x, 10.5x, something like that. In 2022, we actually got down to sub 8x. So we like the performance of the brand. We like \u2013 we like where he\u2019s heading with it, where SH Hotels is heading around the globe and elsewhere for distribution. But it\u2019s not anything that we\u2019ve had conversations about co-branding or anything of that nature. So we just said \u2013 we think they do a great job, and we have a great relationship with them, and we hope that we can continue to expand that relationship going forward. Operator : The next question is coming from Dori Kesten from Wells Fargo. Dori Kesten : As you are putting together guidance this quarter, what were the aspects of the guide that you were more uniformly agreeing upon internally versus which required a more vigorous discussion. We're just trying to get a sense of how derisked the second half of the year is at this point. Sourav Ghosh : Yes, I think what gave us sort of the confidence in our guide, as we went about it is really the group booking pace remains strong for the second half. We actually picked up 241,000 rooms in Q2 for the second half, and about 143,000 or so was for Q3. So that's 68%. So Q3 pace is actually high single digits. So we're very confident about group in the third quarter. We did derisk the fourth quarter from a group perspective, just around election weeks. So typically, in any given election year, the week of elections is always a softer group pace, and you can see that. But this year, we are seeing softness following the election week as well in terms of pace. So we adjusted for that. The bigger 2 pieces that we spoke in our prepared remarks is really the softer recovery that we are seeing in Maui. So that's in our second half as well as what we did was we saw these short term -- a lot of lack of short-term leisure pickup in Q2, and that effectively we have extrapolated into the second half as well. So that's -- those are the items that we took into consideration when looking at guidance. Dori Kesten : Just a quick clarification, Sourav. So Q3 group pace is up high single digits. So what transient, like on the books now for Q3, what is transient and down? Sourav Ghosh : Yes. Transient, we look at a room night perspective and transient pace it really is in terms of pickup happens around a 30-day window. So we have derisked effectively the decline that we saw in Q2 proportionately in Q3. Dori Kesten : Okay. Operator : The next question will be from Michael Bellisario from Baird. Michael Bellisario : To focus on Maui a little bit. Can you maybe help us understand the guests that are coming to your properties? Are they different customers than a year ago, pre-pandemic? Are they coming through different channels? Also what are the brands doing to help stimulate demand? And then just lastly, can you give us some examples of the planned marketing initiatives that you mentioned? Jim Risoleo : Yes. Mike, there are new channels that we pursued. Different wholesalers, Costco -- Costco Travel as an example to bring customers back to Maui. I mean what happened is the wildfires were just an incredible tragic event. And as we saw the residents finding permanent or semi-permanent housing, we are very encouraged that, that's happening. But what that meant for our hotel on the west side was that we went from well over 200 rooms that were being rented by the Red Cross and FEMA in the first quarter to 13 rooms that were being rented in Q2. And we didn't see a corresponding pickup in visitation. And I think there are several reasons why that occurred and why that is the current situation on the island today. We\u2019re coming up on the first anniversary of the wildfires, which is a very important date for a lot of reasons in Hawaiian culture and otherwise. But going forward, mid to the latter part of September, the Governor of Hawaii and the Mayor Maui are planning on a marketing campaign in the Los Angeles area, basically rolling out the fact that Maui is now open for business. 80% of the Maui economy is dependent on tourism. So we are supportive and appreciative of what has to be done first before you can bring customers back to the island. And we think good progress is being made along those lines. Additionally, we are working with other hotel owners on Maui and Hotel Association to put in place a coordinated marketing campaign to sell the island, and we\u2019re taking steps individually at our 3 assets, the Hyatt Regency, the Andaz as well as the Fairmont Kea Lani to start marketing those assets, again, mid-September on going forward. One of the other challenges that we\u2019re going to have to overcome is airlift into Maui. I believe that in the quarter, we were down about 16% over the same time frame in 2019, and that\u2019s down another 6% over where we were last year. So, it\u2019s a bit of a chicken and an egg situation. We certainly want the airlines, and we\u2019re going to be encouraging the airlines to put more capacity into their Maui routes, but we\u2019ve got to bring the customers back as well. The really good news for our assets. Generally, we had completed a transformational renovation of the Hyatt Regency during COVID, we accelerated that renovation and the property is fresh and ready to go. And more recently, we completed a transformational renovation at the Fairmont Kea Lani, which is on Maui\u2019s Wailea as well as did a substantial renovation at the Andaz. So, Andaz Wailea as well. So our properties are ready, open for business, and we\u2019re working with the local authorities and the other hotel owners to sell Maui beginning in mid to late September. Operator : The next question will be from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Jim, I want to go back to an earlier question or maybe for Sourav, actually, I want to go back to an earlier question on just the underwriting for leisure transient in the back half. Sourav, if I caught it correctly, I think you said basically, the trends you saw in leisure transient for Q2, you're extrapolating that trend as sort of your baseline for 3Q, did I catch that correctly? And then, secondarily, just can you remind us of the weights of Q3 and Q4 as it relates to some of the seasonality here, particularly how dependent is Host in the portfolio now on decent leisure in Q4? So did you derisk that, did you underwrite that the same? And should there be anything we need to worry about as we get pretty late in the year, particularly around the holidays? Sourav Ghosh : Yes, you did hear that correctly. We effectively took the trends that we saw for leisure transient in the second quarter and applied that for the rest of the year. Obviously, the mix of leisure in Q3 is a little bit different than Q4. But when you actually look at sort of the 300 basis point decline in the midpoint of guidance, what I would say is about 15% is as a result of Q2, the remainder is second half, and that\u2019s effectively evenly split between Q3 and Q4. Operator : The next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Just on cost programs. I assume your expense budgets at the asset level were based in part on your revenue outlook? And I just have a basic question. Are there cost takeouts that can happen? And do those cost reductions typically have a lag as revenue softens? Sourav Ghosh : It\u2019s always obviously an asset by asset in terms of how expenses are managed. And obviously, you have certain fixed costs. The variable costs really move with volume. For the most part, there isn\u2019t a meaningful lag with that variable cost, it happens and it will show up and sort of the lag is maybe a week or 2, but by month end, the true-up occurs. So by the time you\u2019re seeing the numbers whatever costs are being taken out or being managed relative to volume shows up pretty real time. Operator : The next question is coming from Smedes Rhodes from Citi. Smedes Rose : I just wanted to go back to your guidance and just taking out the acquired EBITDA for a moment. It looks like it's about close to $50 million downward revision. And then you said from Maui, you're expecting a 180 basis point negative impact to your portfolio for the year. And I think that's a little steeper than the 130 basis points that you called out in the first quarter. So just given those 2 things and just something -- is the bulk of that decline of $47 million or so all related to Maui on a relatively small decline in your RevPAR? Or maybe you can just kind of walk through the pieces. Because it seems like a large downward revision to given your expectations just in the quarter ago. Sourav Ghosh : Sure, Smedes. I think what will be easy is if I just walk through where our midpoint of previous guidance was at $1.670 billion and bridge that to our current guidance of $1.645 billion. So you take the $1.670 billion, you take out $64 million of comp EBITDA, excluding Nashville. Of that $64 million, about 50% of that $64 million is attributable to Maui and San Francisco. The remainder is primarily made up of 4 markets, I would say, it's D.C., Orlando, Phoenix and L.A. And then you add $5 million for improvement of our forecast for Nashville. You would add another $5 million for Alila Ventana, which opened up sooner than we had expected. And then you add $22 million for the 1 Hotel Central Park in Turtle Bay and then another $7 million for higher interest income, because we obviously did the $600 million bond deal, had more cash reserves and higher interest rates that allowed for that. Once you total that up, you get to the $1.645 billion. But what I would say is important to remember that certainly for 2024, the $1.645 billion guidance, but it's important to remember what the run rate really is once you really adjust for all the puts and takes. So if you take, again, the $1.645 billion midpoint guidance that we have and you remove all the business interruption that we got this year, which is equal to $40 million, you would add an additional $49 million for Turtle Bay and 1 Hotel Central Park because obviously, we don't have the full year baked in, in 2024, you would add another $13 million for Nashville. And as we said in our prepared remarks, another $75 million to $80 million for Maui and another $5 million for Ventana. So the true run rate on a stabilized basis, if you will, is $1.750 billion. So hopefully, that answers your question and then some. Smedes Rose : Yes, that helps. And then just, Jim, you said at the beginning in your opening remarks that group revenues were up 8%, business transient was up 4% and that leisure moderated. Can you share what the percentage increase or decrease was in leisure? Sourav Ghosh : Sorry, are you asking for the leisure demand increase in Q2? Smedes Rose : Well, whatever you -- at the beginning of the call, you said group revenue was up 8% in the quarter, business transient was up 4%, and I'm wondering what leisure was? It was characterized as moderating, but can you just share the percentage? I think you were speaking of revenues, right? Sourav Ghosh : Yes. Our overall \u2013 and remember, we used our resorts as a proxy. Our rate still held firm, overall resort revenue or our lease revenue was slightly down as volumes, obviously, as what Jim was referring to, have moderated. But our rates held up, which are still 51% above 2019. I believe in Q1, that number was 52%. Operator : The next question will come from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin Farley : I wanted to go back to your comments about how total RevPAR grew more than room RevPAR. And Marriott had called out some ancillary spend being reduced and MGM called out kind of lower restaurant covers and pressure on entertainment ticket prices. And so I'm just wondering, is the increase that you're seeing in ancillary revs, is that -- do you think it's because of your group mix is increasing, and so it's more banquet revenues? But the transient piece is softening on the ancillary side? Or just wondering why your trend looks a little bit different than what some others have talked about. Jim Risoleo : Sure, Robin. I think our trend looks a little bit different because of the nature of our assets and the nature of our customer. Our customer is -- falls into the affluent category given the nature of our properties, and they're still spending money. Unfortunately, we saw a big pickup in outbound travel in the quarter. But in terms of the spend at our resorts, both resorts and non-resorts, we saw food and beverage outlet revenue per occupied room up about 2% over last year and same quarter last year and up about 1% over the first quarter as well. And encouragingly, as Sourav mentioned in his prepared remarks, we saw spa revenues and golf revenues up ex Maui, spas up about 11% in the quarter over same quarter last year and golfs up 5%. So we are seeing continued spending with a leisure transient rate that's 50% higher than where it was in the second quarter of 2019. And additionally, we're not seeing any holding back on the group side as well. Banquet revenues are up over where they were at the same time last year. So I think it's a different mix. It's a different property type and a different customer. Robin Farley : Great. That's helpful. Maybe just one follow-up clarification is can you remind us where your group mix, where you think that will end up this year and where it was in 2019? Jim Risoleo : It\u2019s going to be pretty similar to where it was in 2019, about 65 \u2013 about 35% group, roughly 61% transient and the balance contract. Operator : The next question will be from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Stephen Grambling : As a follow-up on the -- I think it was Smedes questions around resort RevPAR. I think you said for the quarter, ADRs were flat and occupancy down. Did that change over the course of the quarter? Because it seems like part of the evolution we're hearing from folks is really around June and July, and I realize it's a little bit more myopic, but I'm just trying to think about the dynamic of what's happening to price within leisure or resorts, however you want to define that as we look into the back half? Sourav Ghosh : Not necessarily because both for Memorial Day and July 4, we came in actually better than expectations. So it really sort of -- sort of scattered across the quarter on certain weekends, but there wasn't any discerning trend necessarily while we went through the quarter as it relates to sort of pricing or for that matter of fact, even demand, because the holidays actually did better than what we thought they would do. Stephen Grambling : Okay. That's helpful. And one other follow-up on that, I guess, would be that in that comment that you said that you're assuming the trend line kind of holds in the back half, just to be clear, that would be that dynamic of effectively flat ADR, slightly down occupancy in the back half for your resorts overall? Sourav Ghosh : That\u2019s correct. And effectively, the trend of \u2013 particularly from the leisure standpoint, the international outbound that Jim mentioned, we had obviously assumed earlier that we would \u2013 it would be actually lower in Q2 of this year versus Q2 of last year. The opposite helps you and we\u2019re assuming for the rest of the year that, that will continue. Operator : The next question will be from Bill Crow from Raymond James. Bill Crow : Jim, in a weakening economic backdrop. And when we see rising job cuts and rising unemployment, what's the first -- what's the first indicator in the lodging space. Is it weaker leisure demand? Is it weaker? Or is it group attrition, lower F&B, what should we be looking out for if the economy starts to slow at a fastening pace? Jim Risoleo : I would say, weekend leisure at the lower end of the chain scale, Bill. I do think there is a bifurcation today between the high-end consumer who is still strong, moderating somewhat candidly, and the low-end consumer. And I think you're seeing that in the earnings reports that are being printed this quarter, there's a differentiation. From our perspective, we talked a bit about where our leisure transient rate is, and where our out of room spend is, how our out of room spend is trending, and we're very comfortable with how our consumer is behaving. We think that what's happened in this quarter is that the high-end leisure traveler went abroad, they went to Europe and the Caribbean and Japan, and that it's a moment in time, much like when the leisure consumer led the recovery coming out of COVID. It was revenge travel and I think we saw a bit of revenge travel in Europe last year when that was the first year that Europe was opened up without any restrictions, and we're seeing that this year. And it's frankly, it surprised us a bit because I know we've talked about this before. I mean if we look at -- and we spent some time digging into this, if you look at all U.S. outbound at roughly 120% of 2019 levels, that equates to 6 million additional outbound trips. And that is -- that's a big number, but people they're spending money, and we're not seeing the corresponding increase of international inbound. So TSA checkpoints give us confidence that travel is still occurring. We hit a record in July of, I think, 3 million throughputs in 1 week in particular. So we believe that this is a moment in time and the pendulum will swing back, and we will be well positioned to perform going forward. Bill Crow : Great. If I could ask Sourav, a follow-up or a second question. Sourav, we've got a lot of flavor negotiations coming up towards the end of this year, and I'm not going to ask you about those. But how do you think about wage and benefit increases as you look into 2025 across the portfolio? Sourav Ghosh : Yes. As we look into next year, it\u2019s a little bit early to tell, obviously. I mean the managers are working through the budgets right now. And we obviously don\u2019t have those submitted until much later this \u2013 later part of the year. However, just given that inflation has come under control, to some extent, we would expect it to be lower for next year. How much lower? We will probably have a better idea once we get further down the year, I would say, probably October, November in terms of what that\u2019s looking like. But would think it\u2019s more in the 3% to 4% range or even better than that, depending on what inflation trends look like? Operator : That's all the time we have for questions. Today, I would now like to hand the call back to Jim Risoleo for closing remarks. Jim Risoleo : Thank you again for joining us today. We always appreciate the opportunity to discuss our quarterly results with you, and we look forward to seeing many of you at conferences in the coming months. Enjoy the rest of your summer. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jamie Marcus, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Jamie Marcus : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, please note that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel level results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in yesterday's earnings press release and our 8-K filed with the SEC and in the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com. With me on today's call are Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Risoleo : Thank you, Jamie, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. Before we turn to the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the devastating effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which made landfall in late September and early October. We were deeply saddened to see the loss of life and damage the hurricanes brought. And while many of our hotels were impacted, we are very fortunate that the employees at our properties remained safe throughout the storms. In response to the urgent needs of those impacted, we partnered with the American Red Cross, World Central Kitchen, Team Rubicon, Community Foundation Tampa Bay and Feeding Tampa Bay to deliver vital disaster relief support. Due to evacuation mandates and the loss of commercial power from Hurricanes Helene in Milton, 4 of our properties were temporarily closed, 3 of which reopened within 10 days. The most significant damage occurred at The Don CeSar, which remains closed to guests. We are still evaluating the remediation and disruption impacts of the storms, and we currently expect a phased reopening of The Don CeSar beginning towards the end of the first quarter of 2025. Please note that The Don CeSar is still included in our comparable hotel results in the third quarter, but it has been removed from our comparable hotel set in our full year guidance. It is worth noting that our resilience investments at the Ritz-Carlton, Naples paid off during both hurricanes. As a reminder, during the remediation following Hurricane Ian, we opportunistically enhanced the resiliency of the property by elevating critical equipment, improving dry flood-proofing measures and accelerating future building envelope waterproofing replacements. As a result of these investments, we saw minimal water intrusion inside the resort despite a storm surge comparable to that of Hurricane Ian, and we reopened the resort 7 days after commercial power was restored. Following the success of these enhanced resiliency measures, we will continue to prioritize these types of investments across our portfolio over the near term. For additional details on our resiliency investments, please see our 2024 Corporate Responsibility Report, which details our CR program and strategy, our ESG initiatives and our industry-leading accomplishments. It can be found on the Corporate Responsibility section of our website at hosthotels.com. Turning to our results in the third quarter. We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $324 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.36. As a reminder, in the third quarter of last year, our adjusted EBITDAre benefited from $54 million of business interruption insurance proceeds, which led to a 10% decrease in our adjusted EBITDAre this quarter. Excluding the business interruption proceeds, our adjusted EBITDAre would have been up over 5% and adjusted FFO per share would have been up 9%. We delivered a year-over-year comparable hotel total RevPAR improvement of 3.1%, underscoring the continued strength of out-of-room revenue, while comparable hotel RevPAR was up 80 basis points. As a reminder, the operational results discussed today refer to our comparable hotel portfolio for the third quarter, which excludes the Ritz-Carlton, Naples and Alila Ventana Big Sur. Our third quarter comparable hotel RevPAR came in slightly better than we expected despite weather impacts from the hurricanes in Florida during the last week of the quarter. While Maui is recovering, the year-over-year decline in RevPAR for Maui had an actual drag of 170 basis points in the third quarter. As we have discussed over the past few quarters, this understates the true impact of the wildfires as we would have expected Maui to contribute 20 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the third quarter given the transformational renovation at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023 and the expected lift for 2024. As a result, the total estimated impact of the wildfires on third quarter RevPAR is approximately 190 basis points. Following the anniversary of the tragic wildfires, we supported our managers, local tourism authorities and government officials in promoting the return of visitors to Maui. Our three hotels launched the Ho'okipa marketing campaign. Ho'okipa means the spirit of hospitality in Hawaiian. The marketing efforts included social media and TV ads, digital displays and e-mail campaign and videos from each of our resorts that aired in Southern California during the month of September. Additionally, the Governor of Hawaii, the Mayor of Maui and the Head of the Hawaii Lodging and Tourist Association met with longtime supporters of Hawaii, the Los Angeles Rams and key travel partners across the greater Los Angeles market to communicate the importance of tourism for Maui's economic recovery. The Rams have supported Hawaii over the years, and part of the governor's trip was aimed at formalizing the relationship between the two going forward. Thus far, the sales and marketing efforts are paying off. Thanksgiving and festive revenue pace for our 3 Maui resorts is up over 35% and over 65%, respectively, compared to the same time last year. We are encouraged that Maui is beginning to show improvements on its road to recovery. Moving on to business mix. Group room night revenue was up 1% in the third quarter driven by rate as group room nights were flat due to the recovery in group rooms in Maui that were booked in the third quarter of 2023. Our property booked 212,000 group room nights in the year for the year, bringing our definite group room nights on the books for 2024 to 4.2 million rooms with total group revenue pace of approximately 5% compared to the same time last year. Business transient revenue grew 5% in the third quarter as strong rate growth was driven by market and customer mix shifts. Turning to leisure. The unfavorable international demand in balance held steady in the third quarter. Transient room nights sold at our comparable resorts were up 4% in the third quarter, driven by Maui. In addition, leisure rates remained resilient during the third quarter. Transient rates at our comparable resorts were up approximately 50% compared to 2019, which is in line with recent quarters, continuing to underscore the financial health of the affluent consumer. Out of room spending trends this quarter also continued to demonstrate the strength of group and affluent consumers. Comparable hotel total RevPAR grew over 3% in the third quarter, which represents the largest spread to RevPAR growth in 6 quarters. As a reminder, in 2023, nearly 40% of our total revenue came from food and beverage and other revenue, and our 2024 guidance assumes a similar proportion. We continue to believe that total RevPAR represents a more holistic picture of our underlying business as our portfolio continues to benefit from substantial out-of-room spend. Turning to capital allocation. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of stock at an average price of $16.33 per share through our common share repurchase program, bringing our total repurchases for the quarter to $57 million. Since 2022, we have repurchased $315 million of stock at an average repurchase price of $16.27 per share, and we have $685 million of remaining capacity under our share repurchase program. Looking back on our transaction activity this year, we acquired $1.5 billion of iconic and irreplaceable real estate and a blended 13.6 times EBITDA multiple, based on estimated 2024 results. Thus far, the 1 Hotel Nashville and the Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown, the 1 Hotel Central Park and The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu, Turtle Bay are performing in line with our underwriting expectations. The brand and management transition at The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu, Turtle Bay is going well. And we expect continued growth as awareness of the rebranded resort spreads. Turning to portfolio reinvestment, our updated 2024 capital expenditure guidance range is $485 billion to $580 billion, which includes approximately $225 million to $255 million of investment for redevelopment, repositioning and ROI projects, $225 million to $275 million for renewal and replacement projects and $35 million to $15 million for property damage reconstruction. Included in the ROI projects is the Hyatt Transformational Capital Program, which is on track and slightly under budget so far. We received $2 million of operating guarantees in the third quarter, to offset business disruptions related to the Hyatt Transformational Capital Program, and we expect to receive an additional $3 million this year, bringing the total operating guarantees to $9 million in 2024. In addition to the capital expenditure range, this year, we expect to spend $50 million to $60 million on the 40-unit residential condo development at our Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort. The development is well underway and marketing efforts began in July. We anticipate the formal sales launch to begin later this month, with closings to begin in the fourth quarter of 2025. More broadly, we have completed 24 transformational renovations since 2018, which we believe provide meaningful tailwinds for our portfolio. Of the 15 hotels that have stabilized post renovation operations to-date, the average RevPAR index share gain is over seven points, which is well in excess of our targeted gain of three to five points. Wrapping up, we continue to believe that Host is well positioned, due to our investment-grade balance sheet, our geographically diversified portfolio and our continued reinvestment in our assets. As we have shown, we were able to access many capital allocation levers to create shareholder value, and we will remain opportunistic going forward. With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav, to discuss additional operational detail and our revised 2024 outlook. Sourav Ghosh : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on our third quarter operations, updated 2024 guidance and our balance sheet. Starting with total revenue trends, total RevPAR growth continues to meaningfully outpace RevPAR growth as both group and transient guests maintain elevated levels of out-of-room spending. Comparable hotel food and beverage revenue grew 6% in the third quarter, driven by banquet and catering. In fact, banquet and catering revenue achieved the strongest third quarter in Host's history, with contribution per group room night up 13% year-over-year. Transient guests showed continued willingness to spend as well with spa revenues up 5% and resort outage revenue per occupied room of 3%. Overall, transient room revenue was up slightly compared to the third quarter of 2023, driven by the recovery in Maui as well as strong rate and occupancy growth in San Diego, New Orleans and Houston. From a Visa perspective, we are encouraged that Maui is beginning to show improvement. While RevPAR in Maui was down 19% in the third quarter, total RevPAR was down only 10% as out-of-room spending trends returned with the traditional group and leisure guests coming back to the island. Looking at holiday progression, Maui is expected to shift from lagging to leading our portfolio. In the third quarter, Maui represented a drag to portfolio results for both the July 4th and Labor Day weekends. Looking forward, and as Jim alluded to earlier, Maui is driving holiday performance in the fourth quarter. Transient revenue pace for the total portfolio is up 2% for Thanksgiving week compared to the same time last year, and festive period is up 20%. Business transient revenue was 5% above the third quarter of 2023 driven by rate trend. Overall, business transient demand was down 2% driven by fewer government room nights. Encouragingly, demand from consulting firms increased this quarter, narrowing its gap to pre-pandemic levels. Turning to group. Revenue grew 1% in the third quarter driven by rate growth and strong pickup in New Orleans, New York and Boston. As a reminder, group business faced tough comparisons this quarter due to the recovery in the leased rooms booked in Maui last year. We estimate that Maui negatively impacted third quarter group revenue growth by 570 basis points. For full year 2024, we have approximately 4.2 million definite group room nights on the books, keeping us ahead of same time last year. Group rate on the books is up 3% and total group revenue pace is up 5% over the same time last year, bolstered by banquet and catering spend. Looking ahead, our 2025 total group revenue pace is nearly 5% ahead of the same time last year, driven by both rate and room night. We continue to be encouraged by the citywide booking pace in San Francisco, San Antonio, Seattle, Nashville and New Orleans, all of which have citywide group room night pace up meaningfully compared to the same time last year. It is also worth noting that San Francisco citywide room nights are pacing up 40%. Shifting gears to margins. Third quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 25.3% was 130 basis points below last year. The decline was driven by increases in wages and benefits. Additionally, we estimate a 110 basis point impact from Maui and the Hurricane Ian business interruption proceeds we received for [ph] comparable hotels last year. Turning to our revised outlook for 2024. Despite the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, we maintained our previous full year comparable hotel guidance growth midpoint. As a result, we anticipate comparable hotel total RevPAR growth of approximately 1% and comparable hotel RevPAR to be approximately flat compared to 2023. Our guidance assumes the continued recovery in Maui and steady demand trends in the fourth quarter. We estimate the Maui wildfires will impact full year comparable hotel total RevPAR by 180 basis points and RevPAR by 220 basis points. Excluding business interruption proceeds received earlier this year, we expect full year adjusted EBITDAre to be impacted by approximately $75 million relative to our prefire estimate. We expect a comparable hotel EBITDA margin of approximately 29%, which is 90 basis points below 2023. We estimate a 30 basis point impact to full year comparable hotel EBITDA margin from Maui relative to our pre-fire estimate, a 40 basis point impact from insurance and property taxes and a 110 basis point impact from wages and benefit rate increases, which is partially offset by a 90 basis point benefit from operational improvements. Our revised 2024 full year adjusted EBITDAre guidance is expected to be $1.630 billion, a $15 million or approximately 1% decrease over the prior midpoint as a result of the hurricanes in Florida. Of the $15 million, we estimate that $2 million occurred in the third quarter and $13 million will occur in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted EBITDAre estimate includes approximately $57 million from operations at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, a decline of $5 million compared to our prior guidance and $24 million from operations at The Don CeSar, a decline of $9 million compared to our prior guidance. In addition, it includes $11 million from operations at Alila Ventana Big Sur. As a reminder, The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, Alila Ventana Big Sur and The Don CeSar are excluded from our comparable hotel guidance for full year 2024. Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity position in the third quarter. We completed the issuance of $700 million of Series L senior notes at 5.5%. The proceeds were used in part to repay the outstanding revolver portion of our credit facility. Our weighted average maturity -- is 5.5 years at a weighted average interest rate of 4.8%. Our quarter end leverage ratio was 2.7 times, and we currently have $2.3 billion in total available liquidity, which includes $240 million of FF&E reserves and $1.5 billion of availability on our credit facility. In October, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, demonstrating our commitment to returning capital to stockholders. As always, future dividends are subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors. To conclude, we are pleased with the performance of our portfolio, and we are encouraged by steady business mix trends heading into 2025. We will continue to opportunistically allocate capital as we seek to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio and increase shareholder value. With that, we would be happy to take your questions. To ensure we have time to address as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] One moment please for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Stephen Grambling : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I guess I'd like to touch base on the transaction market. You obviously were active this year with acquisitions. I'm curious how you're thinking about how the market might be evolving now and whether you'd be more likely to be a buyer or a seller at this point, if you're seeing any change in terms of who's actually an active participant either from people putting up assets for sale or people coming to you looking for assets for sale? Thanks. Jim Risoleo : Sure, Stephen. You know, I would say that until the last 90 days or so, really both buyers and sellers have been on the sidelines. The bid-ask spread has just been too great and everyone was in a wait-and-see mode, wait-and-see mode for a couple of different reasons. I think the fact that we're past the election now will clear one hurdle for a lot of people. They'll be able to wrap their arms around, what the economic policies of the new administration are likely to look like over the near-term and the debt capital markets have become much more conducive to transacting. Rates have come down, spreads have come in. SASB financing is available. And I think that as we get into next year, you're likely to see private equity get back into the game and come off the bench. There have been some additional transactions out there that we have evaluated. Nothing has risen -- has beat the bar for us. And we're absolutely delighted that we were able to complete the three deals, four hotels and three transactions that we did earlier this year. Our balance sheet is a differentiator and it will continue to be a differentiator for us. I think that we would have more competition today, if those assets were brought to the market. Clearly, there would be because they're all attractive properties, they're all unique and they're all in great locations and one-of-a-kind assets. So that said, relationships and reputation matter and will always, I think, continue to differentiate Host as we go forward. So our ability to move quickly with no need for financing is always a differentiator for us. I expect that over the course of the -- not the balance of this year so much but next year probably, I know you hold me to this if it doesn't come true, but I'm willing to go out on a limb and say that at Atlas, we're likely to hear about additional transactions coming to market because I do think that people have waited a long time. And the good news is that the pressure to sell wasn't there, and that's because fundamentally, the business is very sound and resilient. Yes, we have our little bumps in the road along the way, but it's not like folks are rushing to exit at any price. So I think we'll see an active transaction market next year. And from Host's perspective, we're likely to test the market ourselves with some of our non-core assets to really understand pricing, assets that likely will need heavy CapEx investments that we just don't see -- good hotels but not a long-term fit for the portfolio, given the direction that we have moved in over the last seven or eight years in terms of the types of assets we own and really with our focus being on free cash flow generation as a differentiator going forward. So we're likely to test the market. We'll see what pricing comes back at. If pricing is attractive, we'll sell. If it's not, we'll pull back and invest in the assets ourselves. We'll be hopeful to be able to be a continued net acquirer going forward. I mean, we sit here at 2.7 times leverage today. We have a lot of dry powder. And it will either be -- well, it will always be continuing to invest in our portfolio. Sourav, I think, mentioned in his comments that we've seen a 7-point yield index gain on average from the investments we've made. We bought back $57 million of stock last quarter and we bought $1.5 billion of assets this year. So we'll look forward to continuing to grow the portfolio. And we prefer to do it on a one-off basis and not be in a competitive situation. But if we have to be in a competitive situation, we will. And we'll just see what happens. Stephen Grambling : Great. And maybe one unrelated follow-up for Sourav. I know we've talked about this on prior calls, and maybe I missed this in your remarks. But I guess, are we still thinking about the underlying EBITDA? There's a lot of moving parts with the different acquisitions. There's The Don CeSar issues and insurance proceeds. Is the underlying EBITDA to build off of still kind of that $1.75 billion? And I guess within that, does that have to include what level of recovery in Maui? And how would you generally think about Maui kind of building back? Thanks. Sourav Ghosh : Sure. Yes, Stephen. It's still $1.750 billion, and I'll build it from the $1.630 billion so you have all the different moving pieces. So starting off with the midpoint of our current guidance of $1.630 billion, you would take out $40 million of BI for this year. So $19 million of it, Ian. That was $10 million in Q1, $9 million and Q2 and then $21 million BI that we received for the Maui wildfires. So that's the $40 million that you would deduct. Then you would add about $49 million or so for Turtle Bay and 1 Hotel Central Park, add another $13 million for Nashville. And then the $75 million to $80 million, Maui, which I\u2019ll get into a little bit more in terms of how we are thinking about recovery. Then you would add $5 million for Alila Ventana. And then the $15 million we talked about in terms of hurricane impact, you would add to that to get to a grand total of $1.750 billion. That's what we really consider to be the true run rate when you think about adjusted EBITDAre. As it relates to Maui, as Jim and I sort of got into our prepared remarks, we're certainly encouraged by the transient trends and the pickup we are seeing specifically for Thanksgiving as well as for effectively around the week of Christmas and New Years. The piece that is going to be a little bit challenging and will take a little bit longer to recover is going to be the group piece. Because if you recall, beginning of this year, there certainly wasn't a clear method on Maui in terms of being open for business. Once we lapped over the one-year anniversary of the fire, there's certainly much more clear direction in terms of the island being open for tourism and welcoming guests back. The meeting planners didn't really have much of a chance in the beginning of the year to really book forward. So we didn't see much group booking activity into 2025 and into the future. We expect to see that really pick up beginning next year. So the group piece of the business, and group for Maui across our hotels on a room night basis works out to be about 30% or so. And from a revenue perspective, it's around 20% of revenues as a group, but it does build a meaningful base for the hotels, particularly with the Hyatt. That's going to take a little bit while to come back. So that $75 million to $80 million, I mean, we don't have any budgets yet so I can't really give you a number. But what I would say is that the trends are encouraging from a transient pickup perspective and group is going to come back certainly. It will just take a little more time, probably towards the end of next year into 2026. Stephen Grambling : Helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Next question is from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Michael Bellisario : Thanks. Good morning. Just sort of along the same lines on the moving pieces and all your numbers in the models. Can you maybe just take a step back? What's the clean run rate for the portfolio, both top and bottom line, that you think everything is performing at today ex all the one-timers? And then how might that be different or the same as you start thinking about looking out to 2025? Thanks. Sourav Ghosh : Just so, I'm sure I understand the question. The clean run rate, once you do all the puts and takes, including the acquisition, taking out the BI is the $1.750 billion I just walked through. A big component of the $1.750 billion is obviously the $75 million to $80 million of Maui EBITDA that we are missing. The question really is, for 2025, how much of that EBITDA comes back? For 2025, without getting into more details because we don't obviously don't have budgets right now. I don't really have a good sense in terms of where top line and expenses will come in. But what we do know is the group booking pace is looking strong for 2025. We already have 2.8 million group room nights on the books. We picked up about $400,000. Total group revenue is up effectively 5% and rate -- group rate is up about 3.5%. But we're feeling pretty good about 2025 from a group perspective in terms of what visibility we have. Specific to Maui, like I said, I think group is going to take a little bit of time to get back. And unclear at this point in time how much of that $75 million to $80 million we'll really be able to see in Maui. Q \u2013 Michael Bellisario : Got it. Sorry, I should have been clear. I was sort of referring to the current top line and bottom line growth rates, right? Like are you seeing -- do you think the underlying performance of the portfolio is 3% on the top line, 4% expenses, all the -- ex all the onetime items? Not really thinking about the absolute numbers, more about the growth rates ex all the onetime items. Sourav Ghosh : For -- you're saying for 2024 or into 2025? Q \u2013 Michael Bellisario : Just today. Just I think as everyone thinks about is this a 2% RevPAR growth environment? Is 3%, 4% expenses? What's kind of your view on where the portfolio is performing today and looking out of the 2025 ex all these onetime items, just thinking about it in terms of growth rates. Sourav Ghosh : Yes. If you think in terms of growth rates, I mean, this year would have, just on a RevPAR perspective, given how much drag we're seeing from Maui, we would have been closer to a 3% RevPAR growth rates. And in that case, we would have actually seen margin expansion because our total expenses was up 2.8%. So net-net, for this year, we would have meaningfully outperformed relative to the industry just given the benefit we saw from all the capital investments we put in into our hotels on the Transformation Capital Program. And as Jim spoke here, the index share gains that we saw, so it's sort of unfortunate that we've had a drag in terms of the Maui wildfire. Otherwise, certainly a 3% growth rate in RevPAR just for this year, and we would have actually seen about a 10, 15 basis points margin expansion. Q \u2013 Michael Bellisario : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is open. Smedes Rose : Hi. Thank you. I just -- sorry, I wanted to just clarify something on Maui. Could you just talk about what you're expecting there this year in terms of EBITDA, I guess, excluding the business interruption proceeds? So, I just get a sense of like what the gap is, the $75 million to $80 million you're talking about potentially for next year? Sourav Ghosh : Sure. It's $97 million excluding -- $97 million, excluding the BI proceeds. Smedes Rose : Okay. Thanks. And then I guess one thing you mentioned next year for the group outlook, the group calendars look good across -- the convention calendars look good. Any thoughts around sort of grouping up, I guess, into 2025 to help sort of lock in demands now and revenues? Or would you expect to keep more in line with where you've been historically in terms of the percent of overall group segmentation? Sourav Ghosh : Yes, I mean, honestly, it is really an asset-by-asset exercise that we go through. And we know for which years what the optimal group room night is and so that we can maximize yielding of the transient rate. So, it really depends. But overall, I would say the mix is not going to shift meaningfully for the portfolio. We certainly focus on grouping up on -- across the board wherever it does make sense. And wherever we do have holes, we also like fill in with contract business. So you'll see a shift in contract business over the years. So the yield management is really asset-by-asset. The encouraging thing is there's few city-wides that are certainly pacing very well for next year. And specifically for the Host market, I would say, San Francisco being up 40% from this standpoint. New York, San Antonio, Orlando, DC, it really makes up more than 40% right now of the group room night that we already have on the books for 2025. So, overall, I feel really good. And as we see the need for each of these assets and where the holes are, we're going to fill accordingly. I certainly hope that the strength in corporate group continues and the banquet and catering contribution that comes along with it to really drive total EBITDA. Smedes Rose : Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is open. David Katz : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I'd love some initial commentary around the labor market. I think there's a lot of potential puts and takes and opportunities that may or may not occur given the election outcomes. I know it's early and you've gone out on a limb elsewhere so I'm not asking that. But any perspectives or thoughts you can share with respect to that and whether it's plus would be great. Jim Risoleo : Sure, David. Generally speaking, we are very pleased with the labor picture at our assets. We're not the manager. We're not the employer. But we have two of the very best in the business in Marriott and Hyatt in particular that manage the bulk of our portfolio. And they're an employer of choice. They are the opportunity that people search out if they want to make hospitality a career. So, we're very encouraged going forward. We -- coming out of the pandemic, we got back to optimal staffing levels fairly quickly after we redefined and reinvented the operating model. So, going -- looking forward, we're nothing, but optimistic on the labor front. I don't see any issues that are going to present a problem for us as we get into 2025 and beyond. David Katz : Thank you. And if I may, I just wanted to follow-up on kind of leisure transient and maybe get one layer further down. Are -- is some of the softness that we're discussing more a decision to go or no go? Or would you classify it more as a pushback on the level of rates and rate growth that were out there? How would we unpack that? Jim Risoleo : Well, I think there are a couple of different components to the leisure picture. Go, no go, I'm not sure that, that is -- that's really the bottom line, David. And I say that because if you look at international outbound air capacity versus inbound, we have seen that 120% number has held steady now for the last several quarters. So people are still traveling. They're spending money. They're just not spending it at our properties, generally speaking. We're not seeing any pushback on ADR, in our leisure transient ADR in our portfolio. We finished the third quarter with leisure transient ADRs up 50% over the third quarter of 2019. And that has held for 10 quarters in a row now. So people are still spending money. When they get to our properties, they're spending money out of the room as well. We continue to see records on a quarterly basis in terms of -- for occupied room spend at our outlets, we've seen spa revenues continue to increase, golf revenues continued to increase. So clearly, the affluent consumer is still spending money. We believe that over time, that the pendulum will swing back and we'll see a more normalized balance of international inbound versus international outbound. I think international inbound has held somewhere around 90% of 2019 levels, maybe even a little less than that. A lot of that could have to do with the strong dollar. We keep our eye on a lot of different things as we're assessing the health of the leisure consumer. David Katz : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Darling of Green Street. Your line is open. Chris Darling : Thanks. Good morning. Going back to the Orlando condo development, can you walk through underwritten sales proceeds relative to your development budget there? And then, are there any similar densification opportunities that you might pursue in the near term in other places within the portfolio? Jim Risoleo : Sure. Are you talking about in terms of what assumptions we've made with respect to top line sales? Chris Darling : Yes. That would be helpful, all relative to your overall kind of construction budget there. Jim Risoleo : Yes. So I think the construction budget was what, $150 million to $170 million. And that really hasn't changed. We started in mid-July the construction of the project, and we anticipate starting sales in -- later in this quarter, mid-November -- mid to the end of November. We're targeting completion of the mid-rise, that's 31 out of the 40 condos, I think in the fourth quarter 2025. And then there are nine villas that will be completed in the first half of 2026. So it's 40 units in total. And our anticipated returns are going to be in the mid to high-teens cash on cash. So we will not provide our assumptions with respect to sales per square foot, but we underwrote it to a mid to high-teens cash-on-cash return, and the construction budget is proceeding on time and within budget. So we're fairly confident that we're going to hit those numbers. Chris Darling : Okay. That's fair enough. And I guess to the second half of my question, any similar opportunities that you might pursue in the near term elsewhere in the portfolio? Jim Risoleo : Well, one of the really attractive attributes of The Ritz-Carlton, O'ahu, Turtle Bay, was a 49-acre parcel of entitled land for residential development that's immediately adjacent to the resort, a significant portion of which is oceanfront property. And you just don't find that type of opportunity in Hawaii, and it's one of the things that really drove us to complete the acquisition of Turtle Bay. We are still in the planning stages and we have not taken into consideration any EBITDA upside for the resort. But we believe there is going to be, over time, meaningful EBITDA upside at The Ritz itself, as well as a development profit. And that is whether or not we sell the land or we joint venture the development of those 49 units -- of those 49 acres, which probably going to be somewhere plus or minus 250 units. And it's likely going to be risk residential units, at least 50% of which will participate in the rental pool because that's just how things -- as a matter of law, that's how things happen in Hawaii. So it's an exciting project. It's a fairly large project. That's why we're considering joint venturing it or selling the property outright. But suffice it to say that we would expect to make a profit on the sale or development of the land and see meaningful upside to the resort, both from units being in the rental pool and a share of revenues with the owner, as well as ancillary spend at the restaurants, golf and spa. That's the most exciting project we have. We are looking at potential development, which I can't get into any details at this point in time with you, potential residential development at another one of our resort properties. But that's in the very early stages. And as it manifests itself, we'll certainly share more details with you down the road. Chris Darling : Okay. Appreciate the time. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ari Klein : Thanks and good morning. Maybe just going back to Maui. It looks like you slightly narrowed the expected RevPAR headwind for the year in that market. I'm just curious if that was based on what you're seeing in Q4. And then, Sourav, you mentioned group taking longer to recover in Maui. Can you just provide us where group and transient currently stands from a delta perspective relative to pre-wildfire? Sourav Ghosh : Yes, sure. So yes, if you recall, last quarter we had said that the total Maui impact was about 250 basis points drag to the overall RevPAR. We have revised that to 220 basis points. So in other words, it's actually improved by 30 bps. And yes, you are correct. It really is based on what we are seeing in terms of transient pace for Thanksgiving and for the festive period. So we feel encouraged in terms of where things are heading from a changing perspective. I will say like where we are off if overall is about, call it, 20% or so in terms of sort of room nights, the piece that is going to take longer to come back, like I mentioned earlier, is going to be more the group side versus the transient. And for Maui, if I remember correctly for our key hotels prefire, we did about 100,000 group room nights. And while we're pacing okay for 2025, we are still pretty behind double digits in terms of group pace. And that's the piece which we are you keeping a close eye on. And hopefully at the beginning of next year, we will start seeing group activities pick up. The transient pace is actually pretty similar to where we were prefire at least for the fourth quarter, which is very encouraging relative to sort of where we go back in -- before the fires occurred. So group is a piece we're keeping an eye on. And hopefully, we see the group activity pick up as we get into next year. Ari Klein : Got it. Thanks for that. And then, Jim, I'm wondering if maybe you can provide us with a little bit more color on The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu performance and how that's trended post conversion. Jim Risoleo : It's trending in line with our pro forma expectations, Ari. The transition is going well at the present time. It's at the top of the list when anyone is searching for Ritz Carlton. It's a very important asset to Ritz-Carlton brand. It's getting all the attention that is certainly warranted going forward. So we're excited about it. I mean we're working with Art developers who bought an adjacent parcel from Blackstone on a realignment of the golf courses. There are two golf courses there. They're going to lease and manage the other one on our behalf. So everything is going according to plan. The asset was in terrific shape when we bought it. So no near-term CapEx needs. And we're seeing good pace over festive season and beyond into next year. Ari Klein : Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Chris Woronka : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Jim, I wanted to kind of ask, year-to-date, I think you're running about 72% comparable occupancy. And if I look back to 2019, I think it was over 79%. And I'm curious, and I know there's nuances in the portfolio is a little different, but do you guys see any impact from whether you want to call it shadow supply, Airbnb or conversely, maybe some of these soft brands or even kind of these new affiliation brands that technically aren't part of your major brands. Just any thought as to whether -- because it seems like group and corporate occupancy is and certainly leisure is pretty much as far back as it's going to get. So is there any thought on kind of where those lost occupancy points are coming from? Jim Risoleo : Yeah. Chris, the short answer is it's not as a result of shadow supply. And it's not as a result of new supply because the new supply picture has never looked better relative to what's being developed today as to other times in the cycle. I think what has happened, and we have about -- I think we think it's 8 to 9 points of occupancy that we can still pick up. And we actually view that as a tailwind to the portfolio, not as a negative bias. Return to office is still slow to evolve in several markets, but it's coming back. And I think that is probably one of the biggest dynamic things that changed coming out of the pandemic. The good news is that Salesforce in San Francisco, they're going back to work. Amazon is going back to work. So a number of other big corporates are putting -- or mandating that their employees get back to the office. And we believe that over time, as business transient travel continues to evolve and it has been evolving on a quarter-over-quarter basis, that we should pick up some of that occupancy gap relative to where we were in 2019. Chris Woronka : Okay. Appreciate your thoughts. Thanks, Jim. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open. Robin Farley : Great. Thank you. Can you give a little more clarity around leisure rates in the quarter on a year-over-year basis? And then kind of your expectation for 2025 in terms of what the leisure traveler kind of outside of Maui, but just sort of broadly, leisure rate may look like next year and also what it was in Q3 year-over-year? Sourav Ghosh : On a year-over-year basis, Robin, it's relatively flat in a lot of the market to slightly down because you may recall that there were certain quarters last year where it was meaningfully above the 50% to 2019. It seems to have pretty much normalized around the approximate 50% over 2019. So for the most part, pretty flat. From a demand perspective, that's been the case as well. Again, pretty much flat throughout the year, every single quarter that we look at. Actually, I believe it was down 3% year-over-year from a demand perspective in Q1. But then actually, that demand improved as we went through. So again, close to flat, but not very far from flat in both respects of a year-over-year standpoint. Going into 2025, just given the consumer strength we have seen and given that there is hopefully more clarity around sort of macro -- the overall macroeconomic outlook, we believe that there is -- that the leisure, that have formed a new baseline. So effectively, that's where we have settled down. And given the growth expectations for next year from a GDP standpoint, from a business investment standpoint and just overall macro outlook, and as Jim mentioned earlier, we expect that imbalance that currently does exist with international inbound-outbound to at some point sort of revert to mean, that should definitely help leisure overall stabilize. And we don't expect any degradation in terms of rate or demand. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just a quick clarification. When you were talking about the $1.75 billion run rate, were you including -- and I know that was like excluding business interruption from Maui. Were you including the theoretical like if you recovered $75 million to $80 million in Maui in that $1.75 billion? I'm sorry, I just didn't catch. You were sort of giving a lot of puts and takes. And what -- in that $1.75 billion, that includes what kind of recovery in Maui? Sourav Ghosh : Yes, that did assume the $75 million to $80 million. That was effectively the long-term run rate. So it wasn't necessarily for 2025. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. That's why I wanted to clarify. In other words, based on your other comments, it would seem like you're saying that's not where you'd be in 2025. So just -- that's what I want to clarify. Thank you. Thanks. Sourav Ghosh : That's correct, yes. Operator : Thanks. The next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, good morning. Just on San Francisco, if I heard you correctly, any times of year or specific citywide events that stick out? I think you said room night pacing is up 40%. And I wonder if there's any more underlying detail you have on that? Sourav Ghosh : Sure. That's effectively for overall citywide pacing year over year, specifically in terms of group room nights for us. We already, for San Francisco, have approximately 220,000 group room nights on the books, which is about close to 30%, up year-over-year from a pace perspective. It's still obviously far from where we were back in 2019, but nonetheless good progress. And we're really encouraged by the way it's pacing for 2025. And if you recall, 2026 is World Cup and Super Bowl in San Francisco. So again, good things to come for San Fran. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Great. And then just -- you touched on this in prior questions, but on capital allocation. If we think about ROI projects, additional acquisitions or buyback, I guess, given your experience this year, are you leaning in any more of a direction in any of those three buckets going forward just given your experience this year? Jim Risoleo : Duane, I think that it goes without saying that the easiest opportunities to underwrite with the greatest degree of certainty are those that are in our existing portfolio. So we are well into the Hyatt Transformational Capital Program, and we look forward to continuing to invest in those assets and complete that program in the near term next year. ROI projects, we're always looking for places to continue to put money in our existing portfolio as well. Stock buybacks, 3.5 million shares, $57 million this last quarter. We will continue to be opportunistic on buying back stock. And acquisitions, of course, if they make sense for us. And we're sitting here at 2.7 times leverage today. We can take our leverage up to somewhere to three times, 3.25 times comfortably. So we have a lot of -- significant amount of dry powder to allocate capital across all those various opportunities. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will turn the call to Jim for closing remarks. Jim Risoleo : Well, thank you again for joining us today. We always appreciate the opportunity to discuss our quarterly results with you, and we look forward to seeing many of you in Las Vegas in the coming weeks and at other conferences over the course of the year. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",
